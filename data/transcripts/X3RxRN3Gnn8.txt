[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940]   What's so striking is how long mainstream media and leadership in the Democratic Party
[00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.880]   have tried to tell an alternative story that was so obviously revealed to be not true last
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.760]   night. And that is the thing that I think makes me say America is losing because there
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.100]   are a few people that are in charge of controlling the narrative. There are a few people in charge
[00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.400]   who decide who gets to be the candidate. And those few people are keeping democracy from
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.900]   working effectively because the raw data, the direct data, the media content that has
[00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.600]   come out of Biden over quite some period of time made it so obvious that he was not in

[00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.600]   or an interview comes out, it has been excused away as Oh, well, he tripped or Oh, it wasn't
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.720]   well edited. And then when it's fully exposed, the fact that they all flipped so quickly
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.180]   is what's so shocking, because this was there. And if you're on Twitter, you can see these
[00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.800]   clips being talked about by millions of people, but then media and democratic leadership won't
