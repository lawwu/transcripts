[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800]   I'm Cal Newport. This is my third weekly update video where I give you a closer
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.600]   look at my own personal struggles as a professional writer, professor, and
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.800]   podcaster to work deeply in an increasingly distracted world.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:32.480]   As you can probably see, today I am not in my Deep Work HQ. I'm instead in a
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:39.160]   hotel room in Augusta, Georgia of all places. I'm here at a computer science
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:46.600]   conference. In about two hours from now I'll be presenting this paper. Now I saw
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.840]   the house cleaning cart maybe two doors down from now, so my time here is
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.240]   probably limited before I have to go. So I'll make this quick, but what I wanted
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:02.000]   to talk about today, appropriately enough given where I am, Deep Work while
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.520]   traveling. I have two major pieces of advice to give that I have learned
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.840]   through hard and long experience. The first piece of advice is don't wing it. I
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.440]   used to have all this optimism when a trip was coming up because I would
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.360]   imagine those days as empty. Why did I imagine those days as empty? Because my
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.440]   calendar would be empty. You don't schedule meetings and appointments on
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.560]   days when you're traveling. My brain would see empty calendar days and think
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.960]   we are going to get everything done on the trip. It's all uninterrupted. We'll
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.280]   write thousands of words, solve major theorems. It's going to be great. The
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.720]   reality, of course, when you're traveling is your day is not empty. The things that
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.040]   are pulling at your attention just don't happen to be on your normal calendar.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.160]   It's more like conference sessions, conversations with collaborators you
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.480]   haven't seen, administrative details like preparing a talk that you have to give.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.560]   So what I've learned through hard experience is that you have to do a
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.320]   lightweight form of time blocking even when you're on the road. What I mean
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.000]   by this is pick out the two or three Deep Work targets you want to make
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.800]   progress on that day. Plan the time. Plan the time smartly. What I do is I
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.760]   actually look at my program for the day. Look at the different sessions, the
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.760]   different events and pick opportune times to step away and work on something
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.800]   specific. This morning, for example, during a keynote talk, I actually attended it
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.560]   but was working on a computer science proof during that talk that was
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.440]   pre-planned. Right now, when I took a break to record this video, I've
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.440]   been working on writing. This is a good time to get some writing done. I
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.000]   dedicated the flight here to doing a proposal review I owed someone. I printed
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.160]   it out. I knew that's what I was gonna do on the flight, that one thing. So by
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.600]   pre-planning each day when you're gonna do the Deep Work, you're much more likely
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.480]   to get it done and your plans can be a lot more realistic. A little sub piece of
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.640]   advice here too is I take administrative stuff. I got to check my email and
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.200]   keep up with what's going on in the world and I put that into one session. If you
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.120]   fall into the habit when you're at a conference, for example, of let me just
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.920]   continually be responding to emails, etc. You get a lot of context shift and you
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.400]   lose a lot of advantage of being out of your normal environment. So block those
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.360]   administrative things as well. Second piece of advice I want to give, when I
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.400]   travel, I always look for at least one unusual novel or scenic location where I
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.960]   can go to do some deep thinking. So I want to leverage the unique physical
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.840]   settings of the places that I travel. So here in Augusta I have found the River
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.240]   Walk on the Savannah River serves that purpose for me. It's a nice walk, you can
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.080]   see the water, you can see the nature, it's quiet, it's different than anything
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.520]   I have back in Washington DC. I've done one deep thinking session on that river
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.400]   so far. I have another one I'm about to do once I get kicked out of here. My
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.800]   house cleaning. So I'm coming up to a place in my writing right now where I'm
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.400]   stuck on what's the right way to structure a section. I'm gonna go figure
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.560]   that out on the river. So that's my second piece of advice. Take advantage of
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.160]   the location. I was fortunate enough as a graduate student at MIT and as a young
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.600]   professor to be able to travel all over Europe, all over the world to do these
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.920]   type of conferences. And so I have written and thought and worked on books
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.760]   in very interesting places. I remember for example working on how to become a
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:43.240]   high school superstar at a rooftop restaurant in Bologna, Italy. I have
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.680]   memories of being in Toronto with a cool hotel room overlooking the cityscape and
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.640]   I think I was working on So Good They Can't Ignore You there. So I have a lot
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.180]   of memories of having a lot of good thoughts by seeking out interesting
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.040]   locations where I travel. Alright so those are my two pieces of advice.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.800]   Lightweight time blocking of the deep work you're going to do. Don't just wing
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.120]   it. Consolidate administrative work like email checking to schedule times. Don't
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.000]   make that the default and seek out interesting places to go as long as
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.480]   you're traveling. Get all of that concentration boosting environments
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.560]   that you can take advantage of that. Alright that's my update from the road.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.200]   I'm gonna go walk on the river and I got to prepare to give this talk but I'll be
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:28.120]   back next week in my deep work HQ. See you then.
