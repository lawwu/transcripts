[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:20.800]   the Gospel according to St. John, in the third chapter, and verses 14 and 15.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:31.800]   As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:40.920]   that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.280]   We are continuing our consideration of this great and most important incident in the life
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.320]   and ministry of our blessed Lord and Saviour, namely the account which is given in this
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.280]   third chapter of the Gospel according to St. John, of his interview with and his dealings
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   with this man Nicodemus, who was a teacher, one of the masters of Israel, speaking from
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.400]   the natural standpoint a great man and a very notable man.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:22.680]   And we are looking at it because it is one of these priceless pictures which we have
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:33.600]   here and there in the Gospels of our Lord himself taking the part of an evangelist and
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:42.280]   dealing with a soul, showing to a man the way of salvation.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.280]   Now I say it is of very exceptional value for that reason, for the whole purpose of
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:58.260]   this meeting is to deal with this very question of salvation.
[00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.520]   This is not an entertainment, God forbid that it should be.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.480]   The world does its entertainments, and an entertainment is not meant to do anything
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.960]   more than to give us a comfortable, happy feeling and enjoyment for the time being.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:21.400]   We are here, and this word is preached, because it is concerned with this great question of
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.200]   our eternal destiny.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.680]   We are here in time, but we are occupied when we meet in the house of God not only with
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.680]   time but with eternity.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.000]   The Bible makes it so plain and clear that we are in one of two positions, that we are
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.360]   either in the kingdom of God or else we are not in the kingdom of God, and that nothing
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:50.080]   is so important as to know that we are in the kingdom of God.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.840]   The responsibility is therefore tremendous, not only in the one who is given the privilege
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.900]   of speaking but also in all who listen.
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:08.520]   It was our Lord himself who said on one occasion, "Take heed how ye hear."
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.840]   There is such a thing as a lazy listening as well as a lazy preaching.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.540]   So if we realize that we are here concerned with such momentous matters, well then I say
[00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.600]   we shall all listen for our lives, and especially as we see our Lord himself dealing with this
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.320]   very situation and showing this man the truth.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.200]   Now you remember that our Lord himself has divided up the matter into two main sections.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.160]   He says there are certain things which can be described as earthly things; there are
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.520]   others which are heavenly.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.800]   Now what he means by the earthly is that every man has got to realize that coming into this
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:56.080]   realm we come into a realm that is absolutely different from everything that the world can
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.980]   ever provide for us.
[00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:05.400]   We are here in a realm where all our natural faculties and propensities are not sufficient.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.600]   Here we are entering the spiritual realm, and we have to realize that at the very beginning,
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.720]   because if we come here to these things with our natural minds, with our ordinary reason
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.200]   and understanding and ability, well, we'll make nothing of it at all.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.760]   That is the greatest hindrance.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.960]   We have to start by realizing that it's altogether different, which our Lord, you remember, has
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:37.840]   put in these words, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.880]   cannot see the kingdom of God, leave alone enter it.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.920]   Must be entirely renewed by the Spirit of God."
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.760]   And he's gone on to elaborate that.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.200]   But this man, Nicodemus, great, able, teacher as he was, couldn't understand it.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.400]   Keeps on saying, "How, how, how can these things be?
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.640]   How is it possible?
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.640]   Can a man enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born?
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.640]   How can these things be?"
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.760]   And then you remember our Lord went on to say, as we showed you last Sunday evening,
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:16.800]   "Nicodemus," he said, "if you don't understand what I've already been saying, how can you
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.360]   possibly understand the things that I've now got to say to you?
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.520]   That's only the beginning, that's the preliminary, that's the introduction, that's the thing
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.380]   that is, as it were, almost within your own reach and grasp.
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.120]   If you can't follow that, how can you follow what I'm now going to say?
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.760]   But I'm telling it to you, I must expound it to you.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.280]   You've misunderstood me so completely."
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.760]   His object, you see, the whole time is to get Nicodemus to see that he's got to let
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.640]   go of his own abilities and he must cease to rely upon them.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.240]   He's got to become a listener.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.560]   Very difficult thing for a teacher, but he's got to become, as a little child, like everybody
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.560]   else.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.240]   Here is a realm in which he's no better than the greatest ignoramus in the land.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.720]   He's got to come right down.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.080]   He's got to just sit and listen.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.560]   He's got to stop asking his questions.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.520]   He's got to believe.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:15.200]   It's not irrational for this reason that we're in a realm above reason.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.280]   It's supernatural.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:23.760]   And reason alone should dictate to us that in such a realm our natural reason is obviously
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.760]   inadequate.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.220]   So our Lord goes on to press this point upon him.
[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.260]   And you remember, he puts it like this.
[00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.240]   He begins to talk about himself and his own person.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:40.000]   He says, "Nicodemus, you know, you and I are talking about things that belong to the
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.520]   realm of heaven.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.040]   We are talking about God.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.780]   We are talking about his being and his nature.
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.880]   We are talking about men and how men can have communion and contact with God.
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.000]   What do you know about things like that?
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.680]   Have you ascended up into the heavens?
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.200]   Do you know the mind of God, the mind of the Lord?
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.040]   Are you, as it were, in the secret of the eternal?
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.520]   What do you know about these things?"
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.480]   He asks his question to show that Nicodemus obviously knows nothing because he says, "No
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:19.800]   man hath ascended up into heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of Man
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.080]   which is in heaven."
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.840]   In other words, he is telling Nicodemus that he is no ordinary man.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.080]   Nicodemus thought he was.
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:33.360]   He is announcing to him that he is the Son of Man, that he is the Son of God, that he
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.960]   is one who has come from heaven, from eternity, into this world of time.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.840]   Now then, that is the beginning of the gospel.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:53.080]   The person of the Lord Jesus Christ, absolutely pivotal, central, primary.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:08:00.120]   He says, "We speak that which we do know and testify that which we have seen."
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.880]   That is his position.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.240]   He is an eyewitness.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.240]   He knows God.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.720]   He has come from God.
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.120]   He is not repeating things at second hand.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.880]   He knows.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.080]   He has seen.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.080]   He is witnessing.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.080]   Very well.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:26.760]   Then I say we must begin the whole glory and marvel and mystery of the doctrine of the
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:38.280]   person of the Son of God, Jesus of Nazareth, Jesus the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.280]   These are the things.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.560]   Where are we, my friends?
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.200]   Are we clear about this?
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.480]   These are the things about which he spoke to Nicodemus.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.640]   These are the things that are vital to us.
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:56.240]   Christianity is not just a morality tinged with emotion.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.000]   Christianity is not just a code of ethics.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.680]   It is not just a political or a social point of view.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.960]   No, no.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.600]   The first thing about it is this.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:10.080]   It is concerned with him, the Son of God, who has been in this world.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.120]   Very well.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.120]   But it does not stop there.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.600]   That is simply the beginning.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.560]   And our Lord has put that very perfectly in the account which is given here in verses
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.760]   9 to 13.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.720]   But now you see there arises this question.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:34.840]   If he is the Son of God, why did he come into this world?
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.000]   What is he doing in this world?
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.120]   He calls himself the Son of Man.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.400]   He says he has seen that he has heard.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.960]   But here he is on earth.
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.920]   Here he is as a carpenter.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.720]   What is he doing here?
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.560]   Why has he come here?
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:56.440]   These are the questions that inevitably arise in our minds and our Lord goes on to answer
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.440]   them.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:02.360]   That is precisely what he does in these two verses that we are looking at together this
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.960]   evening.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:13.280]   Now I would remind you once more that we must keep in our minds what was our Lord's
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:19.680]   primary and fundamental object in thus speaking to Nicodemus.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:27.480]   He is bringing this man to see his own helplessness, his own hopelessness.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.400]   He has got to cease to be the master of Israel.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.480]   He has got to come right down and become, as I say, a little child.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:39.480]   And our Lord is revealing truth to him that is to stagger him and is to bring him to an
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:45.160]   end of himself, to make him see that here he is confronted by something that he will
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.840]   never understand if he lives to be as old as Methuselah.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:53.800]   He has got to believe it and accept it because of the one who is saying it to him.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.840]   Now then we must hold that in our minds.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.000]   I am going to give you doctrine this evening.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.160]   I am going to put something before you that the human mind never could have thought of,
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.160]   never did think of.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:09.760]   Indeed, it is something at which the human mind has always boggled and stumbled, and
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.880]   it still does so tonight.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:12.880]   What is it?
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.200]   Well, look at it as our Lord himself divides it.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.600]   What does he say to Nicodemus?
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:31.960]   Well he tells Nicodemus about himself as the saviour, as the one who has come into the
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:36.160]   world to save the world.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:42.220]   Now that of course was a staggering thing for this man Nicodemus.
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:46.000]   You remember what Nicodemus had said about him?
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.720]   He addresses him as rabbi, teacher, master.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:58.640]   And he goes further and says, "We know that thou art a teacher come from God."
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:03.320]   He did not mean by that that he believed in the incarnation, but he did recognize that
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:07.480]   here was a teacher to whom God had given very exceptional power.
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.000]   That is what he believed about him.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:16.600]   "For no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him."
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.560]   Nicodemus, you see, is interested in him.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.440]   That is why he goes to have the interview.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:27.320]   But he thinks of him as a man, as a teacher, and as a miracle worker only.
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.360]   And therefore he wants to ask him questions.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.040]   He wants to know a little bit more about this.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:38.840]   Our Lord at once interrupts, because what he is really going to say to him is this.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:44.120]   He says, "While it is perfectly true that I am a teacher, and while it is true that
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:52.240]   I work miracles, you have seen them, I have not come into the world merely to work miracles.
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.080]   I am not in this world even to teach.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.400]   I have come to save.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:07.680]   I have come about this whole question of salvation, the Savior."
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:15.560]   Now you see at a glance that this is of the very essence of this New Testament message.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:20.320]   Go back right away to the beginning and to his birth.
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.880]   You remember the scene, don't you?
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:26.880]   You can see the shepherds watching their flocks by night in the fields.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:32.840]   And there they are, just a night like every other night, when suddenly they are awakened
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.240]   and their attention is drawn to some heavenly music.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.840]   And there they are visited by the angels.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:38.840]   And what is the message?
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.960]   Well, the message is this.
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:46.160]   We are bearers, they say, of glad tidings.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.600]   What are these glad tidings?
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.640]   The glad tidings are these.
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:14:00.800]   Unto you this day is born in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:01.920]   That is the message.
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:07.160]   And you see it is the first announcement that is made to these men after his birth.
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:12.240]   The babe that has been born in Bethlehem is the Savior.
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:16.160]   Now this is the whole message of the gospel.
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:21.400]   Oh you read these four gospels and keep your eye on this and you will find that they suddenly
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.180]   become illuminated before you.
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.960]   It was over this people always stumbled.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:29.000]   They didn't really listen to what our Lord was saying.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:35.040]   He keeps on saying in some shape or form, "The Son of Man has come to seek and to save
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.040]   that which is lost."
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.760]   They were not interested.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.040]   They were interested in miracles.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.360]   They were interested in the restoration of the kingdom to Israel.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.860]   They wanted him to divide the inheritance between two brothers.
[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.840]   They wanted him to do a thousand and one things.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:54.120]   Of course, they had acknowledged that he was a great man, a most remarkable teacher, and
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.120]   these miracles were extraordinary.
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.680]   But you see, they wanted him to stop on that level, but he hadn't come to do things like
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.800]   that.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.320]   He has come to be the Savior.
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:11.280]   He has come about this question of salvation.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.200]   Well what is it?
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.360]   What is this, says someone?
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:21.240]   Now before I answer your question, may I ask you a question?
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:30.760]   As you think about Christianity, do you think of it primarily in terms of salvation?
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.320]   As you think of the Lord Jesus Christ, what is your first thought of him?
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:39.120]   Is it that he is the Savior?
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:44.920]   Do you think of him in terms of the message of the angel to the shepherds?
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.760]   Is this your conception of the good news?
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.600]   Is the gospel good news to you primarily?
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.840]   Or is it just an ethical or a social or a political way?
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.440]   Is it good news?
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.400]   Is it something that thrills you?
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:03.120]   The test of that is, you see, does it come as salvation, the message of salvation?
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.640]   What is this, says someone?
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:09.280]   Well, now that's the thing that our Lord deals with very particularly in these two
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.720]   verses that he addresses to this man Nicodemus.
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.200]   Listen to him.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:23.040]   As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:30.960]   that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.760]   Let me put it in the form of a principle.
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:43.040]   The Lord Jesus Christ first and foremost tells Nicodemus about the need of salvation.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:46.200]   Nicodemus had never seen that.
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.800]   As a Jew, he'd never seen it.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.960]   As a Pharisee, he'd seen it still less.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.240]   The need of salvation.
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:57.720]   But that's exactly what our Lord is putting to him by using this strange language.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.160]   Look at it in terms of the story.
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:06.080]   Our Lord now is comparing himself and his object in coming into this world with that
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:12.160]   extraordinary thing that happened way back there in the history, the story of the children
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:18.680]   of Israel as they were in their pilgrimage between Egypt and the land of Canaan.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:24.080]   I read to you those verses out of the twenty-first chapter of the book of Numbers just now in
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:27.360]   order that we might have the background clearly in our minds.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:31.240]   It's our Lord speaking, remember, and this is how he compares himself.
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:35.160]   Now go back across that story and this is what you find.
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:39.120]   "There are those children of Israel.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.960]   God has delivered them in a marvelous, in a miraculous manner from the bondage and the
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:47.920]   captivity of Egypt, and he is leading them in the direction of their promised land.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:54.100]   But they were having a somewhat difficult and hard time.
[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.200]   They were traveling in a wilderness.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.880]   I needn't go into the reason for that, even that was their own fault.
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:04.400]   But there they are, they're in a wilderness, and it was a difficult place, not enough food,
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.880]   nothing to drink.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:11.920]   God was feeding them miraculously by means of the manna.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:17.200]   But the children of Israel began to murmur and to complain and to grumble.
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.880]   They began to grumble not only against Moses but against God also.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:26.000]   They rebelled against God and they said, 'Has he brought us out of Egypt in order to kill
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.200]   us of starvation here in this desert?
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.640]   Would to God we'd stayed in Egypt.'
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:35.560]   And they began talking about the flesh parts of Egypt and the leeks and the garlic and
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:41.560]   the onions, and they grumbled and complained and rebelled against God.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:45.720]   And you remember what happened.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:51.160]   God punished them by sending amongst them fiery serpents.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:56.560]   And these serpents bit the people and injected their venom and their poison into them.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.800]   And there they became desperately ill and large numbers died, and it looked as if they
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.160]   were all going to die.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.560]   The people were awakened.
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:11.400]   They realized that all this was happening because of their sin.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:15.600]   So they went to Moses and they said, 'We have sinned against God and against thee.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.480]   Go and pray to God on our behalf that he may forgive us.'
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:24.480]   And Moses went and prayed to God, you remember, and God told him, he said, 'Take a brazen
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:30.280]   serpent and put it on a pole and hold it up before all these people and tell them that
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:36.160]   anyone who's bitten with a serpent and who's on the point of death, if he looks at that
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.760]   brazen serpent, that moment he'll be healed.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.760]   It's the way I'm appointing to heal them.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.760]   Tell them to do it.
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:43.760]   If they do it, they'll be healed.
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.200]   If they don't, they'll die.'
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:52.160]   And so it happened that everyone, however desperately ill he might have been, the moment
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:58.720]   he looked at that brazen serpent, that serpent of brass, held up on a pole, he was immediately
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:02.560]   healed.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:11.680]   Now what the Lord Jesus Christ tells Nicodemus is this, he says, 'As Moses lifted up the
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:19.520]   serpent in the wilderness, even so, as even so.'
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.520]   Is it plain?
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.520]   Is it clear?
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.920]   It's an exact comparison.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:29.220]   He says, 'I am in this world in a sense to do what that brazen serpent did of old that
[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:31.160]   Moses made and put up on the pole.
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.120]   I've come to do something like that.'
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.000]   That's the business of salvation.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.400]   Well what does it tell us then?
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.800]   Ah, you see, here is very profound doctrine for us.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:50.400]   Here's the first thing, that we are obviously in the same position and the same condition
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.600]   as the children of Israel.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.480]   Now that's inevitable.
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.200]   You can't argue against this.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:03.040]   It's our Lord's comparison, 'as even so.'
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:08.640]   There's the condition of the children of Israel, there therefore must be our condition.
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.640]   What is it?
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:14.600]   Well, isn't it this?
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:21.120]   We are under the wrath of God because of sin.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.280]   That's the message.
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:32.400]   The fiery serpents were sent by God to punish the sin of the Israelites.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.760]   We therefore must be in the same position.
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:43.760]   We are under the wrath of God because of sin.
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:44.760]   They sinned.
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:45.760]   How?
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.480]   They rebelled against God.
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.960]   They put their own desires before His.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.280]   They put His ways before His.
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:53.280]   That's rebellion.
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:58.560]   Isn't that precisely what the Bible tells us is the whole condition of the world this
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:21:59.560]   evening?
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.520]   Isn't that the cause of the whole tragedy of mankind?
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:08.880]   Ever since that first sin in the Garden of Eden, man sinned against God.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.880]   He rebelled.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.680]   He set his will up against God.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:12.680]   And what is the result?
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.880]   God has punished him.
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:19.920]   He's under the wrath of God.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:24.400]   Now let's look at this.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:29.520]   This is a part of what our Lord calls the heavenly things.
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:36.880]   If I have spoken unto you earthly things and ye believed not, how shall ye believe if I
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.840]   tell you of heavenly things?
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:44.440]   And here it is.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:51.160]   The whole world is under the wrath of God.
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.880]   Oh, but men can't receive that.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.960]   How shall ye receive if I tell you of heavenly things?
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:58.960]   And the world doesn't.
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.920]   The world hates this above everything else.
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.920]   And yet it's our Lord's own teaching.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:09.280]   The world, I say, has a greater objection to this doctrine, this biblical doctrine of
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:14.960]   the wrath of God, than perhaps of any other single aspect of truth.
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:20.120]   And yet it is here at the very beginning in the mouth of the Son of God himself.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.000]   The world, I say, doesn't receive it.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.040]   It puts it like this.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.600]   It says, "This is unthinkable."
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:30.000]   It says, "If there is a God at all, well, then he must be a God of love.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.440]   And if he's a God of love, you mustn't speak about his wrath.
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.440]   You can't reconcile wrath and love.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.600]   The two things are mutually contradictory."
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:42.800]   "No, no," they say, "that idea of wrath, it doesn't belong to God at all, and it should
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:43.920]   never be preached.
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.680]   It isn't true.
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.280]   That belongs to paganism.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:52.440]   We know that all pagans, they believe in their various gods, and they're afraid of them.
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:55.720]   They're afraid that if they don't worship the sun, it'll fall on top of them, and likewise
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.760]   the moon and the stars.
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.760]   They're afraid of the spirits in the trees and in stones.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.400]   It's a whole religion of fear.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:07.360]   But," they say, "mankind has outgrown that sort of thing.
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.760]   So we don't believe in the wrath of God.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:10.760]   Don't mention it to us.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.760]   It isn't true."
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:17.800]   Others say this, "Oh," they say, "that idea of the wrath of God, it may be in the Old Testament.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:21.280]   It's the tribal idea of God that the Jews had of old.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.840]   It's got nothing to do with the New Testament.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.840]   That's not Jesus's picture of the loving Father."
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:31.840]   Now, I'm giving you the arguments that are so frequently adduced, the things that are
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.440]   so often said about this.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.080]   They say, "It isn't true.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.080]   We reject it.
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.080]   We can't receive that.
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:44.200]   God is our loving Father."
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:52.680]   You see, where we find ourselves, if we speak like that, we are still in the position of
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.520]   Nicodemus who says, "How can these things be?
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:56.600]   No, no.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.480]   This doesn't fit in with my idea.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:02.720]   I believe that God is like this, and he can't be like that, therefore."
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:08.840]   You see, the claim is that our minds are so big and so capacious that we can include God
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:15.440]   quite simply, that we understand everything about God in his love and justice and righteousness.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:20.440]   We know all about him, and we can pit our minds against the teaching of this book.
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:24.800]   That's what it comes to.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:32.400]   Because you see, the teaching of this book is very plain and very clear.
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:40.520]   It is as our Lord talks to Nicodemus about himself as the Saviour in the context of John
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:48.080]   3, 16, that he says that mankind is exactly like the children of Israel in the wilderness,
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.280]   bitten by the fiery serpents.
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.840]   It is the only explanation of this.
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.120]   There is no other.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:26:04.040]   The conditions are exactly parallel, but of course it's not only found here.
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:09.040]   This teaching is to be found right through the Bible.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:14.880]   Go back to the very beginning, didn't God tell men, "The day that thou eatest thereof,
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.640]   thou shalt die"?
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.280]   And it happened.
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:26.320]   Right away through, God tells the people of whom we read in that Old Testament that if
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:30.680]   they break his laws, he will punish them.
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:36.640]   My dear friends, I'm not standing here to tell you that I understand all this.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:42.520]   I'm here to tell you that I know nothing apart from what is revealed in this book.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:43.920]   God is infinite.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:44.920]   He is absolute.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.240]   He is eternal.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.560]   How can I understand God?
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.240]   What do I know about God?
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:55.520]   What does anybody know about God except what God has been pleased to reveal about himself?
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.560]   And he has revealed himself.
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:03.480]   He revealed himself to Moses when he gave him the Ten Commandments and the moral law.
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:12.120]   And there he tells us that he is a God that visits the sins of the fathers upon the children
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:17.040]   to the third and the fourth generation of them that hate him.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:22.560]   He is a God who says that if man transgresses his law, he will be punished.
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.240]   Now I'm not saying that.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.700]   It's God who says it.
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.760]   It's the revelation that says it.
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.920]   It's running through your Old Testament.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.880]   You get it in the book of Psalms.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.680]   You get it in the message of the prophets.
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:39.080]   What is the message of these prophets, the great prophets and the minor prophets?
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:48.000]   Isn't it this, that the nation of Israel by its rebellion and its sin is courting disaster?
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.080]   That it's flying in the face of God and his holy laws and that if it doesn't repent and
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:56.960]   return to God, it will end in nemesis and destruction.
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:00.280]   It's a plea with the people to repent and to come back.
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.280]   Why?
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:05.760]   Well, because the wrath of God is set against sin and evil.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:12.320]   There is no sense in the Old Testament if you reject this doctrine.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:18.000]   But as I say, it's not only in the Old Testament.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.320]   You turn over the pages and you come to the New Testament and you look at that first preacher,
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.720]   John the Baptist.
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.200]   What was his message?
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.560]   This was his message.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:32.280]   He preached a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:37.440]   And when he saw certain Pharisees coming amongst the crowd, he looked at them and said, "Who
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:43.920]   hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:49.200]   He says, "I indeed baptize you with water, but one mightier than I cometh, the lecher
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.880]   to whose shoes I am unworthy to unloose.
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:57.640]   He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire, whose fan is in his hand, and he
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:03.800]   will throughly purge his floor and gather the wheat into the gardener, but the chaff
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:07.880]   he will burn with fire unquenchable."
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:16.440]   I'm not asking you to believe what I think.
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:23.160]   I am just reporting to you the message and the preaching of John the Baptist, the forerunner
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:27.760]   of the Son of God, the Savior, the herald of salvation, the one who had been sent to
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.920]   prepare and to make smooth the way of the Lord.
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:31.920]   That's his message.
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:32.920]   Repent.
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:33.920]   Why?
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:42.640]   Well, the day of wrath is coming, God's judgment upon sin.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:50.280]   Believe me, my dear friends, when I tell you that I don't like preaching on this doctrine.
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.200]   I'm a man like yourselves.
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:58.640]   It's not an easy thing to do, but my commission is not to stand here and say what I think.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:02.600]   It's to hold this word before you and to expound it, and there it is.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.600]   That's the preaching of John.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.520]   Go on to the preaching of our Lord.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.120]   It's exactly the same.
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:10.440]   He sends out his disciples, and this is what he tells them to preach.
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:18.520]   He tells men to flee from the wrath to come.
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:28.120]   It is he who talks about coming on the clouds of heaven to judgment with his holy angels.
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:34.960]   It is he who talks about a place where the fire is not quenched and where their worm
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.120]   dieth not.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:42.160]   It is he who spoke about Dives and Lazarus.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:48.200]   It is he who pronounced wars upon the heads of those Pharisees in their sin.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:51.560]   It's everywhere in his teaching.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.600]   And as you go on, you'll find it everywhere.
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:58.800]   Peter, on the day of Pentecost, this was his preaching, that great sermon on the day of
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:03.800]   Pentecost when three thousand people were converted and became Christians.
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:09.880]   This is what Peter said to them, "Save yourselves from this untoward generation."
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:14.680]   And the word was with such effect and power that the people cried out, saying, "Men and
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.560]   brethren, what shall we do?"
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:17.760]   That was his message.
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:22.400]   It was equally the message of the apostle Paul.
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:31.720]   You'll find it in chapters 13, 14, 17, and 20 of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:38.160]   He tells the people that God has appointed a day in which he will judge the whole world
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:45.680]   in righteousness by that man whom he hath appointed whereof he hath given proof in that
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:48.640]   he hath raised him from the dead.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:53.160]   The resurrection of Jesus Christ is an announcement of a day of judgment.
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.720]   Christ is to be the judge.
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:59.840]   He says himself in the fifth chapter of this gospel according to Saint John that the Father
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.680]   hath committed all judgment unto him.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.520]   He is the judge.
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.080]   It's everywhere.
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.480]   You go on to the epistles.
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:13.800]   Do you know that the apostle Paul talks about the wrath of God ten times in the epistle
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:16.360]   to the Romans alone?
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:21.600]   Do you remember him writing about that great day in the first epistle to the Corinthians?
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:25.880]   Do you remember what he says in the second letter to the Corinthians, chapter 5?
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:30.040]   This is how he puts it.
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:38.680]   "Knowing the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:45.800]   We must all stand, he says, before the judgment seat of Christ and give an account of the
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:50.360]   things done in the body, whether good or bad.
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:54.720]   Therefore, therefore, I persuade men."
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:57.760]   He says, "I know something about the terror of the Lord."
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:58.760]   The same argument.
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.680]   Oh, my dear friends, it's everywhere.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:06.120]   You will read in the epistle to the Ephesians that we are all by nature the children of
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:08.800]   wrath, even as others.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:14.000]   That's why the gospel is preached.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:20.120]   The apostle reminds the Thessalonians that they had turned from idols to serve the living
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:26.560]   God and to believe on his Son, Jesus, whom he had sent from heaven to save us from the
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:27.560]   wrath to come.
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:30.960]   It's in the epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:33.240]   Who shall save us?
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:34.800]   What shall happen to us?
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:40.520]   If we neglect so great a salvation, never let these things slip, says this man.
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:45.680]   We are hopeless if we do the wrath of God.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:49.800]   And what is the message of the book of Revelation if it isn't this?
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.960]   Well, I mustn't keep you.
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:58.240]   I've gone through the evidence because I'm anxious that we should all see that this is
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:03.920]   the peculiar message of Christianity.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.280]   Christ is the Saviour.
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:11.280]   Well, obviously we need to be saved from something, and what we need to be saved from is the wrath
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.280]   of God.
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.440]   God is the judge of all the earth.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:17.120]   He is the everlasting righteous one.
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:24.600]   And the business of preaching is to announce first and foremost that the whole world lieth
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:30.400]   guilty before God.
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:38.240]   Mankind is in the same situation as the children of Israel in the wilderness.
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:41.120]   God is punishing sin.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.400]   His wrath is upon sin.
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.600]   And here is the message.
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:47.720]   There is no meaning in good news apart from that.
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:49.560]   Why do you call this the gospel?
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:50.560]   What is the gospel?
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:51.560]   It's good news.
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:52.560]   What is the good news?
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:55.520]   Well, the good news is that there is a way of escape.
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:06.080]   The wrath of God is upon us, and there is a way of deliverance.
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:12.000]   That's the first thing that our Lord is telling Nicodemus by comparing himself in that way
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:18.360]   to that brazen serpent that was lifted up upon a pole in the wilderness.
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:24.640]   You and I are under the wrath of God, and because of that we are face to face with eternal
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:29.520]   spiritual death.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:34.840]   Everyone bitten by that serpent died unless he was healed in this way.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:35.840]   That was physical.
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:36.840]   That's the comparison.
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:40.960]   But that is a comparison to illustrate a spiritual truth.
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.880]   And the spiritual truth is this.
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:49.880]   As they died physically as the result of their sin, the whole world is dying spiritually
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:53.560]   because of sin and rebellion against God.
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:36:01.920]   One of the wages of sin is death.
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:10.680]   I admit very freely that I would have no reason for preaching like this in this pulpit were
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:25.240]   it not that I believe that we are all by birth spiritually dead because of sin, and that
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:35.600]   unless we are saved we will go on to eternity in that state of spiritual death.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:43.440]   The Apostle Paul talks about everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord.
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:49.480]   The Lord Jesus Christ puts it here like this, that whosoever believeth in him should not
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:52.760]   perish.
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:58.400]   Had you realized, my friend, that by nature you are perishing?
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:02.880]   That as you are by nature you are spiritually dead, and that you'll go on like that to all
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:06.920]   eternity in a state of misery and unhappiness and wretchedness.
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:07.920]   That's perishing.
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:12.400]   Death and everlasting destruction.
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.040]   It's horrible, I know.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:16.160]   It's unthinkable, but it's true.
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.280]   That's the whole purpose of the Good News.
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:21.680]   That's why Christ came, to save us out of this.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:26.920]   As those people were saved from that physical death, he's come to save men from this spiritual
[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:30.440]   death.
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:35.520]   Had you realized that that was your position, that you were spiritually dead, and that as
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:42.040]   you die physically and go on to eternity, you go on to that everlasting, endless spiritual
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:49.200]   death outside the life of God, a life of mental anguish and spiritual torment without end
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.840]   and without relief?
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:54.280]   That's the message.
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:38:00.440]   And there is only one other thing that he taught about it, it's this.
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:06.240]   Those Israelites being bitten by the fiery serpents were absolutely helpless.
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.920]   They could do nothing about it.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:09.920]   They had no medicines.
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.840]   They had no charms that could deal with this.
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:14.400]   They were absolutely helpless.
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.080]   They're staggering on their feet.
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.080]   They're dying.
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:24.360]   And in their desperation, they go to Moses and say, "Is there nothing?"
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:31.560]   And it is a part of the preaching of the gospel to tell men and women this, that we are all
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:36.720]   equally helpless spiritually.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:41.300]   You cannot give yourself spiritual life.
[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:45.140]   You cannot create within yourself a love of God.
[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:48.200]   You cannot get rid of your sins that you've committed.
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.360]   They're there.
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.480]   And you can't erase them off the book.
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.080]   They're set against you.
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:59.680]   You can do nothing about appeasing the wrath of a righteous and a holy God.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:01.040]   Nothing.
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.640]   We are as helpless as those Israelites.
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:04.920]   You can live a good life.
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.560]   You can do a lot of good.
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:10.000]   You can fast and sweat and pray, but don't waste your time.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.120]   Luther tried it.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.280]   Wesley tried it.
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.800]   The great saints of the centuries have tried it.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:21.080]   And they've ended by saying, "Not the labors of my hands can fulfill thy laws demands.
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.080]   Could my zeal?
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.080]   No.
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.080]   Respite?
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.080]   No.
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:26.080]   Could my tears forever flow?
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:33.120]   Oh, for sin could not atone."
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:36.120]   That's what our Lord said to Nicodemus.
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.880]   Nicodemus, he says, "Don't listen.
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.400]   Don't think any more about miracles.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.180]   We're not talking about that.
[00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:44.220]   Don't come and ask your learned questions.
[00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:46.960]   Don't you see that you're in the position of that Israelite?
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.960]   You've been bitten by the serpent.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.320]   Sin, evil, you're dying.
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:52.800]   You're dead spiritually.
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:55.680]   Don't you see your helpless plight?"
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:56.680]   That's his message.
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:02.760]   But thank God he doesn't stop there.
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:12.400]   Having delineated the condition, having diagnosed the ill, having exposed the desperate need
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:17.240]   of men, he says, "I say that he is the Savior."
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:21.280]   And he goes on to show the one and only way of salvation.
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:22.280]   What is it?
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:30.280]   As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up that
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:35.360]   whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:38.000]   What is this nonsense, says someone?
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.280]   What is this, says the modern, sophisticated, educated man?
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.280]   What are you talking about?
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:43.280]   What's he saying?
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:49.360]   I've no doubt those were the thoughts of Nicodemus.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:54.440]   I imagine that what Nicodemus was saying to himself was something like this.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:41:02.000]   "Ah," he said, "when he heard the Lord speaking of himself as the Son of Man who'd come down
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   from heaven."
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   Now this is interesting.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.480]   I could tell that he was unusual.
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:08.960]   Is he the Son of God as he's claiming?
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:11.900]   He was on the point of saying, "Yes, I like that."
[00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:18.760]   But then our Lord says this, "Son of God, Messiah?"
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:24.480]   And lifted up as the serpent was lifted up by Moses in the wilderness?
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:27.040]   He knew what that meant.
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:30.240]   Our Lord is here referring to crucifixion.
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:35.520]   A man being nailed to a pole to a tree and then the pole raised up.
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:36.520]   Crucifixion.
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:39.800]   That's what he's talking about.
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:42.800]   When he talks about being lifted up, he means his death.
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:47.480]   You get exactly the same thing in the eighth chapter in the twenty-eighth verse.
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:52.120]   You get it still more clearly in the twelfth chapter of this gospel in the thirty-second
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:57.960]   verse where he says, "And I, if I be lifted up, will draw men unto me."
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:04.940]   This speak he referring to his death.
[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:09.040]   But this is impossible.
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:14.840]   Moses' idea of the Messiah was that he would come as a great military personage who would
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:21.560]   found a great army and then lead it against the Roman Empire that had conquered Palestine
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:27.280]   and drive out the Roman legions and set himself up as king and then perhaps begin to invade
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:32.360]   other countries and conquer the whole world and be the greatest military personage that
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:34.040]   humanity had ever known.
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:39.200]   That was their idea of Messiah.
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:44.760]   But this man who claims to be the Messiah is talking about being nailed on a pole and
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:45.760]   raised up.
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:51.760]   Oh, the monstrosity of it all.
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:58.960]   Christ crucified was, as Paul says, "a stumbling block to the Jews and folly to the
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:42:59.960]   Greeks."
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:05.280]   Ah, they were very interested in the idea of incarnation perhaps, very interested in
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:11.640]   a great teacher, a miracle worker, and all these things, but crucified, dying on a pole
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:12.640]   in utter helplessness.
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:13.640]   It's monstrous.
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:14.640]   It's impossible.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:23.000]   It is still the same, isn't it?
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.120]   Did you notice how even Simon Peter stumbled at it?
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:30.600]   That's why I read to you that section from the 16th chapter of Matthew's Gospel at
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:31.600]   the beginning.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:36.920]   Peter at Caesarea Philippi, our Lord says, "Whom do men say that I am?"
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:37.920]   And they give the answers.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.440]   Then he says, "But now, who do you say that I am?"
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:47.760]   And Peter ever first stood forward and said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:48.760]   God.
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:51.760]   You are the Son of God, the Messiah."
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:44:00.800]   "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood hath not revealed unto this,
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:03.400]   but my Father which is in heaven."
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.160]   It was given to him to see that.
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:13.220]   He now sees, they all see with him, that Jesus is the Son of God.
[00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:17.080]   What our Lord had already been telling Nicodemus.
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:22.560]   But then you remember how our Lord began to tell these men who had just confessed him
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:30.440]   as the Son of God that he would be tried and condemned by the chief priests and the Sadducees
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:37.080]   and scribes and that he would be put to death and rise again.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:41.520]   And Peter of every body, the man who has just made the great confession about his deity
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:47.000]   as the Son of God, Peter steps forward and says, "Far be it from thee, Lord.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.880]   It shall not be unto thee."
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:56.960]   He rejects this idea of death.
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:02.240]   And our Lord has to say a very severe thing to him, "Get thee behind me, Satan."
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:09.040]   "For thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men."
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:14.680]   Peter could not receive this notion of the Son of God dying in order to save and men
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:15.680]   still cannot.
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:18.480]   They will believe in the deity of Christ.
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:20.720]   They will believe his ethical teaching.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:26.200]   But they say that blood, that cross, that death, your statement that he died for our
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:28.120]   sins, it seems immoral.
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:29.120]   They cannot believe it.
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:36.040]   They cannot accept it.
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:40.440]   And there you see still the whole trouble.
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:52.600]   "If I have spoken unto you earthly things and ye believe not, how shall ye believe?
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:57.900]   If I tell you heavenly things, it is impossible."
[00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:03.760]   If you think that you or I are going to understand this doctrine of the atonement, in a final
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:07.520]   sense we are making a grand mistake.
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:09.200]   Thank God we are not asking.
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.800]   Here is the comparison.
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:18.400]   It is by dying he saves us, by dying for us.
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:27.560]   As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so, all they had to do was to look at
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:29.040]   that brazen serpent.
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.600]   They did not understand how it worked.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:31.600]   Who could tell?
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:34.560]   The fact is God says it, God planned it, and it does work.
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.280]   Everyone who looked was healed.
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:40.080]   It is like that, you know, if you want this salvation.
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:51.640]   Don't pit your puny mind against the doctrine of the two natures in the one person, still
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:47:00.880]   less pit it against this amazing doctrine of Christ being made sin for us, that we might
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:03.680]   be made the righteousness of God in him.
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:07.920]   "Thank God there is no need," I say, "here is the way."
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:17.520]   All these people had to do was to look, and the moment they looked they were healed.
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:23.720]   Thank God all you and I have to do tonight is to look.
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:29.920]   By nature we are under the wrath of God and we can do nothing about it.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:37.200]   But the Son of God here told Nicodemus, and he is telling you at this moment, that he
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:48.120]   came into this world to be crucified, to save you from your sins, from your sin and all
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:51.320]   the dread consequences.
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:52.600]   He died.
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:48:05.240]   He was lifted up on that cross, that pole, in order that you and I need not go to hell.
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:16.560]   That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:25.680]   If you believe this, if you believe that the Son of God came from heaven to earth to taste
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:33.440]   death for you, to die the death that you deserved, to bear the punishment of your sin in his
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:41.280]   own body on that cross on Calvary's hill, I tell you in the name of God you shall not
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.280]   perish.
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:47.840]   You are saved, your sins are forgiven, not because you have done anything, but because
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:51.520]   he has done it all for you.
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:58.400]   And you simply in your helplessness look to him and cast yourself upon him and what he
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:48:59.400]   says.
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:02.480]   You believe it because he is saying it.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:08.800]   You accept it, you rely upon it, you rest upon it.
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:19.960]   And we have his own word for saying that as you do so, you are that moment healed from
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:22.960]   all the consequences of sin.
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:34.080]   You are pardoned, you are reconciled to God, you become a child of God and an heir of everlasting
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:35.080]   bliss.
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:41.320]   That is his own message to Nicodemus.
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:48.200]   Not miracles, not teaching, but this salvation question.
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:54.760]   A man's soul, his eternal destiny, he has come about that, and his way of dealing with
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:50:06.120]   it and of solving the problem was to suffer the disgrace, the ignominy, the agony and
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:14.200]   the suffering and the shame of a death upon a cross.
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:16.600]   But he has done it.
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:24.720]   And whosoever believeth in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:27.520]   That is the good news.
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:29.720]   What wonderful news!
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:36.600]   Escape from hell and eternal perdition, no perishing.
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:59.840]   But the enjoyment of everlasting life.
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:16.080]   381.
