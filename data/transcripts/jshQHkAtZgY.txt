[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   - How promising in the near term, in your view,
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.720]   is brain-machine interfaces?
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.860]   So starting to allow computers to talk directly
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.800]   to the brains, Elon Musk is working on that with Neuralink,
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.960]   and there's other companies working on this idea.
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.440]   Do you see promise there?
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.880]   Do you see hope for near-term impact?
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.340]   - Well, every technology has pluses and minuses.
[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.560]   Already, we can record memories.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.880]   I have a book, "The Future of the Mind,"
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.800]   where I detail some of these breakthroughs.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.320]   We can now record simple memories of mice
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.320]   and send these memories on the internet.
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.060]   Eventually, we're gonna do this with primates
[00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.100]   at Wake Forest University and also in Los Angeles.
[00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.960]   And then after that, we'll have a memory chip
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.860]   for Alzheimer's patients.
[00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.840]   We'll test it out in Alzheimer's patients
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.800]   because, of course, when Alzheimer's patients
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.760]   lose their memory, they wander.
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.640]   They create all sorts of havoc, wandering around,
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.640]   oblivious to their surroundings, and they'll have a chip.
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.220]   They'll push the button, and memories,
[00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.080]   memories will come flooding into their hippocampus
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.080]   and the chip, telling them where they live and who they are.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.520]   And so a memory chip is definitely in the cards,
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.180]   and I think this will eventually affect human civilization.
[00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.080]   What is the future of the internet?
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.680]   The future of the internet is brain net.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.640]   Brain net is when we send emotions, feelings, sensations
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.600]   on the internet, and we will telepathically communicate
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.560]   with other humans this way.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.120]   This is gonna affect everything.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.440]   Look at entertainment.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.040]   Remember the silent movies?
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.200]   Charlie Chaplin was very famous
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.000]   during the era of silent movies,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.940]   but when the talkies came in,
[00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.980]   nobody wanted to see Charlie Chaplin anymore
[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.600]   because he never talked in the movies.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.840]   And so a whole generation of actors lost their job,
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.340]   and a new series of actors came in.
[00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.340]   Next, we're gonna have the movies replaced by brain net,
[00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.440]   because in the future, people will say,
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.080]   "Who wants to see a screen with images?"
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.920]   That's it.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.240]   Sound and image, that's called the movies.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.920]   In our entertainment industry,
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.200]   this multi-billion dollar industry is based on screens
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.620]   with moving images and sound.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.880]   But what happens when emotions, feelings, sensations,
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.160]   memories can be conveyed on the internet?
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.720]   It's gonna change everything.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.200]   Human relations will change,
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.660]   'cause you'll be able to empathize
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.200]   and feel the suffering of other people.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.200]   We'll be able to communicate telepathically,
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.120]   and this is coming.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.600]   - You described brain net in "Future of the Mind."
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.900]   This is an interesting concept.
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.840]   Do you think, so you mentioned entertainment,
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.120]   but what kind of effect would it have
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.560]   on our personal relationships?
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.320]   - Hopefully, it will deepen it.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.320]   You realize that for most of human history,
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.720]   for over 90% of human history,
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.720]   we only knew maybe 20, 100 people.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.460]   That's it, folks.
[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.960]   That was your tribe.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.360]   That was everybody you knew in the universe
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.660]   was only maybe 50 or 100.
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.160]   With the coming of towns,
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.560]   of course, it expanded to a few thousand.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.400]   With the coming of the telephone,
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.480]   all of a sudden, you could reach thousands of people
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.600]   with a telephone, and now with the internet,
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.600]   you can reach the entire population of the planet Earth.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.320]   And so I think this is a normal progression.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.240]   - And you think that kind of sort of connection
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.840]   to the rest of the world,
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.280]   and then adding sensations,
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.800]   like being able to share telepathically emotions and so on,
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.100]   that would just further deepen our connection
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.840]   to our fellow humans?
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.680]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.600]   In fact, I disagree with many scientists on this question.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.120]   Most scientists would say that technology is neutral.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.520]   A double-edged sword,
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.880]   one side of the sword can cut against people,
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.300]   the other side of the sword
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.760]   can cut against ignorance and disease.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.360]   I disagree.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.840]   I think technology does have a moral direction.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.300]   Look at the internet.
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.720]   The internet spreads knowledge, awareness,
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.960]   and that creates empowerment.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.340]   People act on knowledge.
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.680]   When they begin to realize
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.460]   that they don't have to live that way,
[00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.000]   they don't have to suffer under a dictatorship,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.500]   that there are other ways of living under freedom,
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.640]   then they begin to take things, take power,
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.520]   and that spreads democracy,
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.160]   and democracies do not war with other democracies.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.200]   I'm a scientist.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.080]   I believe in data.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.000]   So let's take a sheet of paper
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.720]   and write down every single war you had to learn
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.840]   since you were in elementary school.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.760]   Every single war, hundreds of them,
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.000]   kings, queens, emperors, dictators,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.560]   all these wars were between kings, queens,
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.180]   emperors, and dictators,
[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.800]   never between two major democracies.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.500]   And so I think with the spread of this technology,
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.080]   and which would accelerate with the coming of brain net,
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.420]   it means that, well, we will still have wars.
[00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.480]   Wars, of course, is politics by other means,
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.400]   but they'll be less intense and less frequent.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.560]   (silence)
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.720]   (silence)
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.880]   (silence)

[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.200]   (silence)
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.360]   (silence)
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.520]   (silence)
