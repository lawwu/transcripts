[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   [silence]
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.340]   How do we actually measure dehydration?
[00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.220]   Now, you hear different things.
[00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.220]   Like if you pinch the skin on the top of your hand
[00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.400]   and it takes more than three seconds
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.260]   to lay down again flat, then you're dehydrated.
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.100]   You hear that.
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.660]   You hear, okay, if you are to press on your fingernail
[00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.980]   and see a change in the color of the tissue
[00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.140]   just below your fingernail, which indeed does happen,
[00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.060]   and it does not go back to its original color
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.580]   within one to three seconds, then you're dehydrated.
[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.420]   You hear things like this.
[00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.580]   If your ankles are swollen when you're wearing socks,
[00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.700]   you take off the socks and you can see the imprint
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.540]   of the socks on your lower limbs,
[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.380]   that means you're dehydrated.
[00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.740]   You hear this kind of stuff,
[00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.820]   and you should probably be wondering, is any of that true?
[00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.020]   To some extent, it is true,
[00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.660]   although it can vary quite a bit by how old you are,
[00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.180]   whether or not the skin on the top of your hand
[00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.700]   tends to be looser or not,
[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.020]   depending on whether or not you're leaner or not.
[00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.300]   So in other words, those are not
[00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.820]   absolutely objective measures of dehydration.
[00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.180]   Now, it is true that if normally you can pinch the skin
[00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.020]   on the top of your hand
[00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.980]   and it returns to its normal flattened position
[00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.660]   within about one to two or three seconds,
[00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.620]   and it does not do that within five or more seconds,
[00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.500]   there's a decent probability
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.580]   that you're a little bit dehydrated,
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.220]   that you need to ingest some fluid,
[00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.420]   or that if you press down on your nail
[00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.860]   and you see the depression causes a transition
[00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.860]   from kind of a pink color to a white color,
[00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.020]   and then you release,
[00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.220]   and it doesn't go back to its original pinkish color
[00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.220]   within a few seconds,
[00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.180]   well, then there's a chance that you're dehydrated.
[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.980]   But again, these are not perfect measures of dehydration.
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.180]   You may be surprised to learn,
[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.320]   and I was surprised to learn,
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.320]   that most of the basis for these statements,
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.100]   like even a 2% dehydration state
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.780]   can lead to significant reductions
[00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.700]   in cognitive or physical performance,
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.220]   are based on not direct measures of hydration,
[00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.600]   but rather on measures of reductions in water intake,
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.380]   which is a different thing, right?
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.080]   It's saying that ordinarily,
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.580]   a person of a given body weight
[00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.460]   needs X amount of fluid per day,
[00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.460]   and when they get even just 2% less
[00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.820]   than that amount of fluid,
[00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.020]   then their cognitive and/or physical performance is impaired
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.300]   rather than focusing on dehydration of tissues, right?
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.820]   Now, that might seem like a subtle distinction,
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.460]   but it's actually a meaningful distinction
[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.380]   when you think about it.
[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.640]   However, it's a meaningful distinction
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.380]   that we can leverage toward understanding
[00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.800]   how much water or fluid we need to drink each day.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.640]   Now, there we can really point to some solid numbers
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.880]   that, believe it or not,
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.820]   are fairly independent of body weight.
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.500]   Now, I say independent of body weight,
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.660]   I'm referring to the amount of fluid
[00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.300]   that most healthy adults need at rest.
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.260]   What do I mean by at rest?
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.000]   I mean when not exercising
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.700]   and when not in extremely hot environment.
[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.260]   So I'm leaving aside you desert ultramarathoners
[00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.700]   or people that are doing any kind of movement
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.100]   or living in environments that are very, very hot.
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.340]   Here, I'm mainly referring to people
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.260]   that live most of their daily life in indoor environments.
[00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.820]   Could be air-conditioned or not air-conditioned,
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.020]   heated or not heated.
[00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.220]   What we're trying to arrive at here
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.660]   are some numbers that can work across the board
[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.620]   because, of course, there are an infinite number
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.500]   of different conditions
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.580]   that each and all of you are existing in.
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.500]   So I'm not going to attempt to give you a body weight
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.420]   by activity, by environment,
[00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.900]   by humidity formula calculation.
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.300]   In fact, no such calculation exists.
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.260]   However, there are formulas
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.700]   that can put you into very stable frameworks.
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.540]   That is levels of water intake for periods of rest
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.860]   when you're not exercising
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.660]   and for when you are exercising
[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.940]   that will ensure that you are hydrating
[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.100]   with the one exception being if you are exercising
[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.460]   or if you are living in very, very hot conditions
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.740]   and you're not heat adapted to those conditions.
[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:54.860]   So what are those numbers?
[00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.220]   In other words, what is the answer to the question
[00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.140]   of how much fluid do we need each day?
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.540]   And here, I'm referring to fluid.
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.780]   I'm not distinguishing between water,
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.140]   caffeinated beverages, soda, tea, and so on.
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.640]   I'll discuss that in a moment.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.980]   We can reasonably say that for every hour
[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.960]   that you are awake in the first 10 hours of your day,
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.880]   this is important, in the first 10 hours of your day,
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.880]   you should consume on average eight ounces of fluid.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.540]   Now, for those of you that are using the metric system,
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.060]   not ounces, eight ounces of fluid
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.540]   is approximately 236 milliliters of water.
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.820]   And for those of you that exist in the metric system
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.940]   and aren't used to thinking about ounces and vice versa,
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.180]   just think about a typical can of soda
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.980]   in the United States is 12 ounces.
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.460]   In Europe, sometimes the cans of soda
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.700]   are a little bit smaller.
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.580]   That's a whole discussion unto itself,
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.580]   but eight ounces of fluid, that is 236,
[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.740]   let's just say 240 milliliters,
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.420]   'cause we don't need to be too precise here,
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.420]   of fluid on average every hour
[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.380]   for the first 10 hours of your day,
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.300]   which translates to an average of 80 ounces of fluid
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.340]   for the first 10 hours of your day.
[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.940]   Or 2,360 milliliters of water,
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.900]   in other words, approximately two liters of water
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.020]   plus a little bit more for the first 10 hours of your day.
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.900]   Now, I want to be very clear that this does not mean
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.400]   that you need to ingest eight ounces
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.100]   or 236 milliliters of fluid on the hour,
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.900]   every hour for the first 10 hours of your day.
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.300]   I'm certainly not saying that.
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.700]   And in fact, most people are going to find
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.600]   that they're going to ingest water in boluses,
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.580]   that is, they're going to have perhaps 16 ounces of water,
[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.300]   500 milliliters of water at one portion of the day,
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.140]   and then maybe a couple hours of later,
[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.140]   they'll drink some more water or some more coffee or soda
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.780]   or some other beverage in another portion of the day.
[00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.060]   I do think, however, it's important for most of us
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.460]   to take a step back and ask ourselves
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.620]   whether or not independent of any other activity
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.020]   or environmental conditions,
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.420]   whether or not we are in fact ingesting 80 ounces
[00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:11.160]   or basically 2.4 liters of water
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.740]   for that 10 hours of the day
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.320]   that spans from the time we wake up until 10 hours later.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.160]   Now, why am I setting this 10-hour framework?
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.160]   The reason I'm setting this 10-hour framework
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.720]   is that it turns out that your fluid requirements,
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.600]   even just at rest, are vastly different
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.200]   in the time from when you wake up
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.140]   until about 10 hours later
[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.780]   as compared to the later evening and nighttime.
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:36.840]   And here I'm referring to people
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.360]   that are not doing night shifts.
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.400]   But if you are requesting a number
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.800]   of how much fluid to drink,
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.120]   independent of our needs for fluid for exercise,
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.000]   that's going to be eight ounces of fluid
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   or 240 milliliters of fluid on average for every hour
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.240]   from the time we wake up until 10 hours later.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.060]   That's the simple formulation
[00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.920]   that should basically ensure
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.960]   that you're getting sufficient baseline hydration
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.880]   for the cells and tissues of your body.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.740]   Now, if you are engaging in exercise,
[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.180]   whether or not it's endurance exercise
[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.540]   or whether or not it's resistance training exercise,
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.420]   you are going to need additional fluids
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:16.180]   in order to maximize the effects of that exercise
[00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.260]   and to avoid dehydration.
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.520]   And there too, we have some excellent numbers
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.360]   that we can look to,
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.980]   excellent because they arrive from research.
[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.260]   And this is largely peeled from the episode
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.540]   that I did with Dr. Andy Galpin,
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.500]   professor of kinesiology at Cal State Fullerton.
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.780]   We did a six-episode series all about exercise,
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.400]   everything from strength training, hypertrophy, endurance,
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.800]   nutrition, supplementation, recovery,
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.400]   everything related to exercise.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.160]   You can find all of that at hubermanlab.com.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.000]   And one of the components of those episodes
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.260]   that was discussed but that some of you may have not heard
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.680]   is that there is a simple formula
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.880]   for how much fluid to ingest on average.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.920]   Keep in mind, this is on average when you're exercising.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.140]   And I refer to this as the so-called Galpin equation.
[00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.000]   The Galpin equation states
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.100]   that you should take your body weight in pounds,
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.200]   divide that by 30,
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.800]   and that will give you the number of ounces of fluid
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.700]   to ingest every 15 to 20 minutes on average
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.600]   while exercising, okay?
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.540]   Your body weight in pounds divided by 30
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.320]   equals the number of ounces of fluid to consume
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.260]   on average every 15 to 20 minutes.
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.140]   When I say on average, what I mean is
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.580]   it is not the case that you need to stop
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:28.820]   every 15 or 20 minutes
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.560]   and consume that volume of fluid.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.780]   You could sip it from moment to moment.
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.340]   You could wait half an hour or an hour
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.820]   and then consume a larger bolus of fluid, a larger amount.
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.180]   Although it is recommended for performance sake
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:47.060]   that you sip or consume beverages
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.520]   fairly consistently throughout your training.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.620]   One's ability to do that
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.020]   is going to depend on a number of things
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.120]   like gastric emptying time,
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.080]   whether or not the particular exercise you're doing,
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.980]   whether or not it's running or jumping
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.060]   is compatible with ingesting fluid on a regular basis
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.220]   or whether or not you need to do it at different intervals
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.500]   than every 15, 20 minutes.
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.500]   Maybe it's every five minutes.
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.020]   Maybe it's every half hour.
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.120]   You have to adjust for you.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.700]   But if you were to take the hour of exercise
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.740]   or the half hour of exercise
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.700]   or the three hours of exercise
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.140]   and ask how much fluid to ingest,
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.660]   it's going to be that Galpin equation
[00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.020]   of body weight in pounds divided by 30
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.660]   equals the number of ounces for every 15 or 20 minutes.
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.180]   And of course I can already hear screaming from the back,
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:29.260]   what about for those of us who follow the metric system?
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.280]   And there there's a simple translation
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.440]   of the Galpin equation,
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:37.040]   which is that you need approximately two milliliters of water
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.260]   per kilogram of body weight every 15 to 20 minutes.
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.720]   Again, the Galpin equation converted into the metric system
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.680]   is going to be two milliliters of water
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.960]   per kilogram of body weight
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.720]   every 15 to 20 minutes on average.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.000]   I'm sure a number of you are asking
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.600]   whether or not hydration prior to exercise
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.440]   is also important.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.260]   It absolutely is.
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.320]   And if you follow the numbers that I talked about before,
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.200]   approximately eight ounces or 240 milliliters
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:07.120]   of fluid intake per hour in the first 10 hours of waking,
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.320]   that should establish a good baseline
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.500]   of hydration heading into exercise,
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.880]   which then prompts the next question I often get,
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.280]   which is, is the amount of water that needs to be consumed
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.660]   according to the Galpin equation during exercise
[00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.600]   on top of or separate from,
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.240]   that is, does it replace the amount of fluid
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.640]   that one needs at a basic level,
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.560]   that eight ounces or 240 milliliters?
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.340]   And there, the answer sort of goes both ways.
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.360]   I think if you're going to exercise,
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:38.640]   then obviously follow the Galpin equation in some way.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.080]   Again, you don't need to be ultra specific about this.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.900]   These are ballpark figures that will ensure hydration.
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.360]   So we've set them a little bit higher perhaps than needed
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.880]   to ensure more hydration rather than less.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.160]   But basically the short answer is
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.800]   if you're exercising for about an hour,
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.760]   most people are exercising for an hour or two,
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:56.680]   probably not more than that.
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.280]   Most of my workouts are,
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.820]   certainly the resistance training workouts
[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.200]   last about an hour.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.600]   Well, then you can replace the eight ounces
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.540]   or the 240 milliliters of water
[00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.800]   that's required at baseline with what you consume
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.400]   according to the Galpin equation
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.980]   during that bout of exercise.
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:20.020]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
