[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920]   Previously on Grace To You... Personal control in the life of every individual.
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.520]   What is that? It's the law of God written in the heart. Romans 2, every human being
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.920]   has the knowledge of right and wrong written in the heart. What is the killer
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.400]   of all relationships? Pride. Pride kills all relationships. It kills the supreme
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.360]   virtue of all virtues, humility. Only humble people love. What in the world
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.080]   makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:38.600]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:01:02.920]   The population driven by sexual deviation, perversion, and lust, TV, music, films, every
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.420]   day exacerbates the problem.
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.340]   So these are the things that mark our society: love of pleasure, love of satisfaction, love
[00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.720]   of self, love of things, and sexual perversion.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.080]   Number five, the deadly danger of anger.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.140]   Anger was once recognized as a sin.
[00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.400]   Everybody recognized it as a sin.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.380]   Just a normal, healthy culture recognized that anger had no place, that anger ate up
[00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.940]   the person who was angry and damaged the relationships of everybody around that person.
[00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.460]   Self-control used to be something socially valuable.
[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.080]   It used to be valuable if you thought something and kept your mouth shut and didn't say it.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.380]   It didn't all of a sudden become a virtue for you to vent every angry thought you have
[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.980]   as if that's some kind of psychologically freeing experience.
[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:48.980]   It isn't.
[00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.420]   It's self-damaging.
[00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.680]   Psychologists say anger is healthy.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.600]   I've heard it all the time.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.600]   People have a right to be angry.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.600]   They have a right to be angry.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.700]   They have a right to do what they want.
[00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.360]   They have a right to react the way they react.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.460]   They have every right to do that, really.
[00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.820]   Ephesians 4:31, "Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and evil speaking be
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.840]   put away from you with all evil, along with all the rest of the evil."
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.560]   James 1:20, "The wrath of man works not the righteousness of God."
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.040]   Ecclesiastes 7:9, "Anger lives in the heart of a fool."
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.420]   Read Proverbs, all through Proverbs there are Proverbs that warn us against the deadly
[00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.540]   danger of anger.
[00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.000]   Anger is the venting of the flesh.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.400]   The works of the flesh are anger, Galatians 5:19 to 21.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.560]   Anger destroys.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.620]   You say, "Well, what about somebody who treats you unjustly?"
[00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.680]   Well, Jesus is the model.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.240]   First Peter 2, "When He was reviled, He reviled not again.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.240]   Father forgive them, they know not what they do."
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.180]   Falling on the heels of that is the deadliness of vengeance, vengeance.
[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.000]   You have a culture that loves to feed on vengeance.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.920]   Video games are filled with this, dominating the lives of junior high kids, creating a
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.300]   culture of people.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.660]   People are into vengeance.
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.580]   This is another dominant sin in our day.
[00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.160]   It's hailed as a virtue, retaliation, getting back.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.300]   Chain reactions of evil.
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.560]   You get them back, they get you back.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.160]   You get them back, they get you back.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.420]   And that's how life is lived.
[00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.000]   It's like life in a biker gang, more like in an inner city gang.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.640]   You do to them, they do to you, so you do to them and they do to you, and you have an
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.040]   amoral, antisocial destruction.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.320]   Destructive, murderous culture, all because of vengeance.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.800]   Vengeance is in the human heart.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.220]   It's in the human heart.
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.340]   We want to get it.
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.200]   We want to get our pound of flesh.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.880]   We want vengeance when somebody does something wrong.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.180]   Vengeance is such a natural thing that in the Old Testament, Deuteronomy 19, Joshua
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.520]   20, God in Israel created cities called cities of refuge, so that if somebody accidentally
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.780]   took a life, it could happen when you're out working, doing something, like using an
[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.860]   ax, as it talks about, and somehow the ax slips or goes in the wrong direction and someone
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.900]   dies.
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.600]   There needed to be cities of refuge because immediately what was natural to the human
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.120]   heart was vengeance on somebody who really did something without premeditation and just
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.120]   by accident.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.240]   So God ordained cities where people could go and they would be safe there until the
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.780]   thing could be handled correctly.
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.340]   Cities of refuge.
[00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.520]   And that was simply so there would be a place for people to hide.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.780]   People to hide from avengers.
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:46.320]   You know, if you read 1 Samuel 24, David, a beautiful picture of David who is unwilling
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.160]   to take vengeance on Saul.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.640]   He has him where he could kill him and he doesn't do it.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.240]   And then in the next chapter, 1 Samuel 25, he restrains his vengeance against Nabal.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.460]   You remember that story.
[00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.400]   There's an intervention and he backs off.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.260]   It's in the human heart to take vengeance.
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.120]   Remember this, 1 Thessalonians 4:6, "The Lord is the avenger.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.120]   The Lord is the avenger."
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.900]   It's what it says.
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:21.520]   Vengeance is destructive of the avenger, destructive of the avenger, destructive of the culture,
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.900]   glorified in movies, glorified in video games.
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:33.700]   We have furious, angry, vengeful, retaliating people filling up this culture.
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.000]   Shootings every day.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.240]   The Bible absolutely forbids this, absolutely forbids it.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:52.380]   In Leviticus 19, I'll just read this to you, verse 16, "You shall not go about as a slanderer
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.380]   among your people, and you're not to act against the life of your neighbor.
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.460]   I am the Lord.
[00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:03.280]   You shall not hate your fellow countrymen in your heart; you may surely reprove your
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.280]   neighbor.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.520]   You shall not incur sin because of him.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.300]   You shall not take vengeance.
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.700]   You shall not bear any grudge against the sons of your people.
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:23.500]   But you shall love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.720]   That's the context for love your neighbor as yourself, not taking vengeance.
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.080]   How would that change our culture?
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.020]   Massive problem.
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:40.780]   And that leads me to another Romans 12, "Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, saith the Lord."
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:41.780]   Right?
[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:48.980]   Vengeance is Mine, I will...listen, God keeps all those accounts, you don't have to do that.
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.300]   And number seven in my list, the absence of forgiveness.
[00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.080]   There's an utter absence of forgiveness.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.980]   That kind of goes along with it.
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.160]   Whatever happened to I forgive you?
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.160]   My brother-in-law.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.160]   Sister-in-law.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:03.860]   Patricia.
[00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:04.860]   Patricia's sister.
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.840]   Had a wonderful son in our church, and he was working up at a market near here a number
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:16.420]   of years ago, and a guy came in to rob the market, and Tim tried to intervene, shot him
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.420]   dead.
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:22.140]   I remember when his dad, Dwayne, went to the hospital to tell the killer he forgave him
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.720]   and give him the gospel.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.380]   Number eight, the divisiveness of prejudice.
[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.100]   The divisiveness of prejudice.
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.240]   I could say more about that.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.240]   I won't.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.700]   The divisiveness of prejudice.
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.320]   Jonah was prejudiced.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.260]   Obviously the whole story of Jonah is he didn't want Gentiles horning in on the blessings
[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.520]   from his God.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.740]   Proverbs 24:23, "To show partiality in judgment is not good."
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:52.060]   John 7:24, "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:59.080]   First Timothy 5:2, "Do nothing with partiality."
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.540]   God is not a respecter of persons.
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.540]   Acts 10.
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:08.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:10.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:15.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:17.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:18.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:19.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:23.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:29.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:33.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:36.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:37.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:38.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:40.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:44.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:47.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:50.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:51.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:52.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:58.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:00.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:03.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:10.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:15.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:18.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:21.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:25.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:31.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:33.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:35.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:36.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:37.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:38.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:43.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:45.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:47.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:48.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:54.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:02.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:03.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:06.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:08.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:09.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:12.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.380]   "Do not judge according to appearance."
[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.040]   Number ten, the disaster of civil rebellion.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:24.660]   Civil rebellion is just collective anger against authority, collective anger against authority.
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:29.700]   We're seeing that more often now than I can ever remember.
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.700]   And just two more.
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:38.680]   Number eleven, the decline in swift and severe punishment, the decline in swift and severe
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.560]   punishment.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.880]   There's a very interesting verse in Ecclesiastes 8:11.
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.380]   Listen to this.
[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:53.080]   "Because the sentence against an evil deed is not executed quickly, because the sentence
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:59.240]   against an evil deed is not executed quickly, therefore the hearts of the sons of men among
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.600]   them are given fully to do evil."
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.600]   You want to turn criminals loose?
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.020]   Just delay their sentence.
[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.400]   Just delay the process.
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.740]   Just delay the consequences.
[00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.380]   And if you push the consequences out.
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:22.060]   If you push the consequences out far enough, you literally encourage them to crime.
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.620]   We're pretty good at that in this society.
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:30.380]   Finally, we have said the trouble with society is civil rebellion, lack of respect, prejudice,
[00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:34.620]   unforgiveness, vengeance, anger, hate, sexual perversion, love of things, love of self,
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:35.680]   love of pleasure.
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:41.380]   And finally, a desire for weak, impotent, and immoral leaders.
[00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:42.580]   A desire for weak, impotent, and immoral leaders.
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:43.580]   A desire for weak, impotent, and immoral leaders.
[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:43.880]   A desire for weak, impotent, and immoral leaders.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.760]   A desire for weak, impotent, and immoral leaders.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:51.460]   I don't think this country cares about the character of its leaders.
[00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:51.880]   Some do.
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:56.920]   We do.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:02.980]   Proverbs 16:12, "It's an abomination for rulers to commit wicked acts, for a throne is established
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:06.480]   on righteousness," or justice.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:12.020]   Proverbs 29:2, "When the wicked rule, people groan."
[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.020]   Proverbs 29:12.
[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:13.380]   Proverbs 29:12, "If a ruler is a wicked ruler, he will not be a good ruler."
[00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:18.660]   Proverbs 29:12, "If a ruler pays attention to lies, all his ministers become wicked."
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:22.420]   If a ruler pays attention to lies, all his ministers become wicked.
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.000]   What is the principle there?
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.100]   You allow lies and you'll attract liars.
[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:33.640]   You're corrupt and you'll be surrounded by more corrupt people.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:42.420]   Now on the other hand, 2 Samuel 23, God gives His picture of a leader.
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.040]   These are the last words of David.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:49.420]   David, the son of Jesse, declares, but these are the words of God in verse 3.
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:56.640]   "The God of Israel said, 'The Rock of Israel spoke, 'He who rules over men righteously,
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:04.160]   who rules in the fear of God, is as the light of the morning when the sun rises, a morning
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:10.540]   without clouds, when the tender grass springs out of the earth through sunshine after rain.'"
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.540]   .
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:17.940]   A ruler who rules righteously in the fear of the Lord is like a beautiful dawn and a
[00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:21.780]   fresh rain.
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:28.540]   Those who rule in utter submission to God and righteousness make life beautiful.
[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.800]   All right, symptoms.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.920]   So where are we now?
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.420]   You have to give me another few minutes.
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.620]   Our times are dominated by these kinds of things.
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.040]   These are the motives, incentives.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.320]   Attitudes of our culture.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.260]   And it isn't the whole list.
[00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.220]   Just read Romans 1.
[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.700]   The false church won't help.
[00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:57.280]   Nothing superficial will help.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.740]   The sickness is incurable.
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:01.920]   So where are we?
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.920]   What are we facing?
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.120]   What do we do?
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.720]   Turn to Exodus 20.
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.280]   Just be patient for a few minutes because I want to bring this to its necessary conclusion.
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.540]   I'm going to read it to you.
[00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:12.320]   It's a necessary conclusion.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.280]   Exodus 20.
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.860]   This is the Ten Commandments.
[00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:21.780]   The most important commandment of all has to do with God.
[00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.660]   "I am the Lord your God," verse 2, Exodus 20.
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.600]   By the way, this is repeated in Deuteronomy 5, the same thing.
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.280]   God repeated this when they got back into the land later.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.700]   This is when they left Egypt.
[00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.540]   He repeats it when they're ready to go back into Canaan.
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:37.540]   All right.
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:38.620]   "I am the Lord your God.
[00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:39.620]   You shall have no enemy.
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:40.420]   You shall have no enemy.
[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.300]   No other gods before Me.
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:47.180]   You shall not make for yourself an idol or any likeness of what is in heaven above or
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.980]   on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth.
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.100]   No other gods, no idols.
[00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:57.800]   You shall not worship them or serve them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God."
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:58.800]   Okay?
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:03.260]   You worship Me and Me alone, Me and Me alone.
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:09.100]   Or "I will be visiting the iniquity of the fathers."
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.300]   Plural.
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:14.060]   "The leaders, those in responsible positions."
[00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.060]   The fathers represent those who lead the society.
[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:23.920]   "I will be visiting the iniquity of those leaders on the children," plural, "on the third
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:29.180]   and fourth generations," plural, "of those who," notice this, what?
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.060]   "Hate Me."
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:36.920]   Listen, any other god but the God of Scripture, any god that anybody devises, the God of Islam,
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.180]   the God of Mormonism, the God of Judaism, any other god but the God of Scripture, any
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:43.600]   other god but the God who is the Trinity, the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:47.180]   the God of Scripture, Old Testament and New, the God of the gospel, any other god is an
[00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.940]   idol.
[00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.640]   Any other god is an idol.
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:54.200]   Whether you're an atheist or you worship a false god, that's idolatry.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.780]   If you're an atheist, you worship yourself.
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:00.900]   But any other god means you hate the true God.
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:01.900]   That's what it says.
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:04.120]   "Those are those who hate Me."
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.100]   And that's what we're seeing in this country, folks.
[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.380]   You have to see they hate God.
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.060]   They hate the true God.
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:16.340]   And Jesus said in John 15, "They hate My Father and they hate Me, and they will hate you."
[00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:17.720]   We just have to set the record straight.
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.900]   This is how it is, okay?
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.680]   This society is not your friend.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.680]   They hate God.
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:23.680]   They hate Christ.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.560]   They hate you.
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:30.200]   This is going to create generational impact to the third and fourth generation.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.200]   What does that mean?
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.820]   Please, it doesn't mean when a father sins, his kids pay.
[00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:37.920]   No, it's not a father, it's fathers.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.940]   It's not a child, it's children.
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.300]   It's not a generation, it's generations.
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:48.580]   What this says is when you have a corrupt generation, it will take three or four generations
[00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:51.940]   with the best conditions to change that.
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.420]   So here it is.
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.580]   You're not going to fix it.
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:56.640]   Don't try.
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.540]   Neither will your children, neither will your grandchildren, and probably neither will your
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.240]   great-grandchildren.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:07.400]   This is your world and their world and the next world and the next world.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.820]   And it may be the last one.
[00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:10.780]   It may come.
[00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.660]   But you're not going to change it.
[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.020]   So stop trying.
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.200]   You can't change it politically.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.580]   You can't change it financially.
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.900]   It's how it is.
[00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:26.520]   Ezekiel 18:20 says, "The sins of an individual are never punished in his children."
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.660]   You only are punished for your own sin.
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:30.180]   That's a different issue.
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.120]   This is generational impact.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:37.660]   A corrupt generation gets so embedded that it takes generations, if ever, to root it
[00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.660]   out.
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:39.700]   That's where we are.
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:46.460]   Lust for pleasure, selfishness, materialism, sexual perversion, anger, hate, vengeance,
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:51.540]   unforgiveness, prejudice, lack of submission to authority, civil rebellion, corrupt leadership.
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:56.080]   That's going to be around for your children, your grandchildren, your great-grandchildren.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.800]   Not going to change.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:03.100]   So what do we do?
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:09.580]   Well, first of all, remember this: this culture is not going to help you in anything
[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:12.840]   that is God-honoring.
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.300]   Don't look to the culture for any help in your personal holiness.
[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:20.080]   In order for you to be personally holy, you need to separate.
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.300]   This culture offers you nothing.
[00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:25.240]   The less exposure, the better.
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:29.700]   There was a time when I was a boy growing up, there was cultural morality, cultural
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:33.020]   dignity, cultural honor, cultural honesty.
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:37.180]   There was a kind of Christian mentality.
[00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:38.180]   No more.
[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.460]   They're your enemy.
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.020]   They hate everything that you love.
[00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.180]   They're your enemy.
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:47.220]   They're God's enemy, Christ's enemy, your enemy.
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.460]   They're not going to help you in your personal life.
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:50.460]   Separate.
[00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.660]   Parents, they're not going to help you in your parenting.
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:54.700]   They're not going to help you.
[00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:55.900]   You've got to know that.
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:56.900]   They're not going to help you.
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.400]   They're not going to help you in any way.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.840]   They're not going to help you through the toys they make for your kids.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.340]   They're not going to help you through the entertainment they provide for your kids.
[00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.700]   They're not going to help you through the schools.
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.340]   They're not going to help you.
[00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.340]   They're against you.
[00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:12.080]   They're against you.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:19.100]   This raises the stakes in personal holiness and raises the stakes in parenting.
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.780]   They're not going to help the church.
[00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.440]   They're going to come against us really strong.
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:28.960]   They're going to come against us maybe with taxation and who knows what, against Christian
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:33.020]   colleges and those who hold to the things of the Word of God.
[00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:34.020]   They're not going to help.
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:36.240]   The culture is destructive.
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.220]   It is the enemy of God.
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.460]   Now, here's my message.
[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:44.460]   Okay, that was the introduction.
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.640]   Okay, this is it.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:55.620]   Now listen, wake up.
[00:19:55.620 --> 00:20:02.460]   Turn to Matthew 5:43.
[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:09.000]   Okay, let's be like the Jews in Jesus' day.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.360]   Matthew 5:43, "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor,'" your
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.520]   fellow Christian, "and" - what?
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.860]   "Hate your enemies."
[00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:17.860]   Is that what we do?
[00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.860]   Is that what we do?
[00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:21.860]   No.
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:24.240]   What did Jesus say?
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:28.560]   "You don't hate your enemy.
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:32.000]   I say to you, love your enemies.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.880]   Pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven."
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:39.880]   Listen to me.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:44.780]   You're never more like God than when you love your enemies, because you were one of
[00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:48.000]   the enemies God loved.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:57.640]   Romans 5:10, "While we were enemies, we were reconciled to God."
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.120]   Right?
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:05.240]   Listen, here's the message.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:08.760]   Your enemy is your mission field.
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:15.180]   Your enemy is your mission field.
[00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:18.100]   The world of enemies was God's mission field.
[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:23.380]   God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son.
[00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.540]   Don't hate the enemy.
[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:33.820]   Love the enemy as God loves the enemy and sent His Son for their salvation.
[00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:38.640]   And remember this: to convert a sinner from his own sin, to convert a sinner from his
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:45.320]   eternal doom, is an event of far greater significance than the deliverance of an entire
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:48.140]   nation from temporal evil.
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:49.620]   Did you get that?
[00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:55.180]   To convert one sinner from his eternal doom is an event of far greater significance than
[00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:59.220]   the deliverance of an entire nation from temporal evil.
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.920]   We're not here to deliver a nation from temporal evil.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:06.200]   We're here to say with the apostle Paul, "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.520]   it is the power of God unto salvation."
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.280]   Anyone who believes, Jew or Gentile.
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.120]   So what's our job?
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:18.980]   Go into the mission field, love them the way God loves them, and preach the glorious gospel
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:22.400]   of Jesus Christ, and let the kingdom advance one soul at a time.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.400]   Amen?
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.400]   Okay, it's time for amen.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.400]   Amen.
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.400]   Let's pray.
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:33.760]   Father, we're so grateful that we've been able to be together this morning and worship
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:37.100]   and consider these precious truths.
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.400]   Give us clarity and understanding.
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.320]   Give us understanding in the time in which we live.
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:47.780]   Help us, Lord, to be a force for the gospel in this very, very doomed world.
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:53.800]   Lord, open up doors for us to preach Christ to perishing souls.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:59.260]   Use us, Lord, to call Your own to Yourself.
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:03.060]   Help us to be faithful in proclaiming the truth and living it out.
[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:08.280]   We'll thank You in Christ's name.
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:17.300]   John we just watched a sermon that was hope for a doomed world and you reinforced for
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:21.260]   us the problem with the world today.
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:24.020]   Sin, sin, sin.
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:32.720]   How is a believer supposed to have hope in light of how sinful this culture has become?
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:38.100]   Well I think the knowledge that it's the reality in every generation.
[00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:39.560]   It's the default reality.
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:44.040]   It's the symptom of every culture and every place and every time.
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.040]   So nothing new.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:48.720]   I think every generation sort of feels like they're the worst and it couldn't have been
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.600]   in the past as bad as it is now.
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.280]   We talk like that even today.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.280]   Nothing has changed.
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:57.120]   The world is just dominated by sin.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:01.700]   I go back to one statement of our Lord at the end of the 16th chapter of John when He
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:05.060]   said in the world you'll have trouble, trouble.
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.420]   Be of good cheer.
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:07.920]   He didn't just say hold on.
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.760]   He said be happy.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.140]   I have overcome the world.
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:13.140]   We win.
[00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:19.900]   I think about Paul's words where he says we always triumph in Christ no matter what's
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.540]   going on around us.
[00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:23.700]   We're like the eye of the hurricane.
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:27.340]   There's perfect peace and perfect calm in the storm.
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:28.540]   But we don't just ride it out.
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:33.360]   We don't just sit in the calm and sort of wait for heaven.
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.200]   We occupy, right?
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.740]   Like Paul said and I love this statement.
[00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:37.740]   He said.
[00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:41.340]   We have a wide open door and there are many adversaries.
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:42.340]   So we go to battle.
[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.560]   And what do we go to battle to do?
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.560]   To proclaim the gospel to a sinful world.
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:50.160]   Now we know two things are going to happen, right?
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:53.220]   Rejection and belief.
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.640]   But that's all preordained.
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:59.440]   Those that are going to come to Christ, the names are already written in the Lamb's Book
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.440]   of Life.
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:06.480]   So we're just picking up the harvest that the Lord has already determined.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.560]   Christ wins.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.320]   He triumphed in Christ.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:13.700]   The world is just going to always be like this until he returns to establish his kingdom.
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:22.240]   So if we adjust our expectations to know that the world is sinful and that we have a guaranteed
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.840]   outcome, that's where the believer finds his hope.
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:25.840]   Absolutely.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:30.700]   And I think sometimes in some cultures that reality of the wretchedness of the world gets
[00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.220]   masked.
[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.820]   It was in America for a long time masked.
[00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:37.380]   I mean, I think even in the UK and Scotland.
[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:41.680]   In England in the 1700s and 1800s it was masked.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:45.720]   It looked like a moral culture, you know, Victorian morality.
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:49.560]   And in early America there was Judeo-Christian ethics.
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.560]   External morality.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.500]   Yeah, it's a kind of cover.
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.360]   It's a kind of veneer.
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.740]   But underneath the same sin is there.
[00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:03.920]   But I think we get fooled by that and all of a sudden we are alive in a generation when
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.200]   the cover is ripped off.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.200]   And the reality of the world is that we are living in a world where we are living in a
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.200]   world where the reality of the wretchedness is visible everywhere.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:16.080]   And so it seems to be worse when it's just what it's always been and it's not hidden.
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.340]   So ask yourself this question.
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:21.720]   Who was worse in the life of Jesus?
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:27.240]   The tax collectors and the prostitutes and the criminals or the Pharisees?
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:35.580]   He saved his most severe malediction for the people who were covered with a religious veneer.
[00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:37.020]   And he said, "I came to call the sinners to repentance."
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:43.360]   So one good thing about living in an openly sinful culture is that you can identify the
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.460]   sin because it's not hidden.
[00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:48.540]   And we know where the gospel needs to be proclaimed.
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.180]   So that's the believer's source of hope.
[00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:56.260]   What is an unbeliever who just heard their ultimate problem is that the wrath of God
[00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:57.320]   is on them?
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.920]   What is an unbeliever's hope?
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:05.920]   The unbeliever is caught in a situation where to be religious in this society right now
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.840]   is kind of a bad thing.
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:14.080]   To be buttoned up and tied down and legalistic and keeping the rules is kind of counterculture.
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:17.340]   So what happens then is sin is okay.
[00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:22.840]   So people sin more and the product of sinning more and sinning more openly is greater guilt.
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:26.840]   And greater guilt is something that the Spirit of God can use to convict the sinner.
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:33.840]   It's harder to convict a self-righteous person than an openly sinful person.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.660]   So the good news for sinners?
[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:38.480]   Is that God saves them.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:42.340]   The good news for sinners is you know you're wretched.
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:44.380]   You're living that in an open way.
[00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:45.700]   You know that's true.
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:52.360]   And the good news is you're just exactly the open reality of what every man and woman is.
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:58.800]   And God sent His Son to provide salvation for sinners.
