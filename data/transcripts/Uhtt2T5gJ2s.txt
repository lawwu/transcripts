[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.340]   All right.
[00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.120]   We have a question here from Geriatric Millennial.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.200]   How does that work out?
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.840]   Feel bad about that.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.680]   I'm one of the oldest millennials.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.480]   There is some variation in how you
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.920]   define the age range that actually captures
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.520]   the millennial generation.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.840]   And typically, the beginning of it
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.320]   is usually put around somewhere between 1980 and 1984,
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.240]   with 1982 being about the average
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.880]   that demographers will use when saying,
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.920]   here's the beginning of the millennial generation.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.800]   I'm born in 1982, so I'm one of the oldest millennials.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.840]   By the way, another aside, millennial
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.440]   does not mean young person.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.240]   This frustrates me sometimes when I hear it.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.400]   Millennial is a very specific demographic population boom
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.720]   that is captured by certain years.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.440]   Starting around my birth date, and then ending.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.120]   And then there's another generational demographical
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.840]   labels that capture the group after it.
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.080]   So I think we got used to-- the baby boomers got
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.000]   used to referring to millennials as young people.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.560]   And now we use it just generically
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.520]   to talk about 14-year-olds today who
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.960]   are very much not millennials.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.920]   The youngest millennials are well out of college
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.640]   and in their 20s.
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.760]   So that's a little PSA.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.520]   Millennial doesn't mean young person.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.280]   It's a very specific demographic range.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.760]   Anyways, if this millennial is geriatric,
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.600]   that means I'm geriatric, which I kind of am.
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.760]   Guys, two weeks ago--
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.520]   last week, last week, I threw out my back shoveling snow.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.040]   It's the most dad thing you can do.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.400]   I mean, I was out, couldn't walk around for a couple of days.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.760]   Took me a week to really recover.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.320]   I mean, I had to do pretty aggressive--
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.240]   I'm very aggressive in recovery on things.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.720]   So as soon as I could move, I was moving.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.320]   As soon as I could walk, I was walking.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.640]   As soon as I could stretch, I was
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.680]   doing huge amounts of stretches.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.080]   And then I started working in exercises
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.240]   that didn't strain the back.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.600]   And then I finally have worked myself up to-- yesterday,
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.360]   I was able to do my full exercise routine.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.200]   I mean, I got after it because I hate being immobile.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.680]   But I mean, is there anything more--
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.440]   speaking of geriatric millennials-- anything more
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.240]   dad than throwing out your back shoveling snow?
