[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.720]   - Good morning, or good afternoon over there, Joshua.
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.320]   I appreciate you taking my call.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.480]   Just finished listening to your show
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.720]   on Donald Trump's taxes.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.480]   And I never thought I would say this,
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.120]   but I think I'm actually inspired by Donald Trump.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.800]   (Joshua laughs)
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.120]   But it's something that I've actually been thinking
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.400]   a lot about lately anyway,
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.840]   which is decreasing my taxable income.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.040]   And so I've got a couple of questions
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.920]   that are tied with that.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.720]   So first of all, this year we sold a property.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.760]   I'm in the business of real estate investment.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.000]   And I sold the property with the intent
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.840]   of doing a 1031 exchange.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.760]   Some things happened at the last minute
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.760]   that made that not possible.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.760]   And so we're gonna end up with about $200,000
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.920]   of capital gains, which I wasn't initially planning on.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.240]   And so I'm trying to think about ways
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.680]   where I can decrease my taxable income for the year.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.240]   And so that's part one.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.440]   And then part two, which is kind of tied in with that,
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.720]   is my family and I, we really like to travel.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.880]   I also do write sometimes.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.200]   I blog.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.240]   And listening to your episode the other day,
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.320]   it made me realize, well, maybe instead of,
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.280]   I've never tried to monetize my blogging,
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.600]   but maybe if I, is it something that I could do
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.600]   to actually run the blog as a business?
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.760]   And then maybe if I start another blog focusing on travel,
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.240]   actually run it as a business,
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.440]   with the intent of making money, of course,
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.240]   a travel blog, would I then be able to deduct
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.960]   some of my expenses, or most of my expenses
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.960]   involved with travel, such as maybe an RV, et cetera?
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.760]   - Good questions.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.720]   All right, let's start with the real estate
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.440]   and the $200,000 of capital gains.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.880]   When was the property sold?
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.440]   - This April.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.640]   - This April.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.920]   And at this point in time, with the timing
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.880]   and your property selection, there's no chance
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.840]   to still consummate a 1031 exchange, is that right?
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.160]   - Yeah, correct.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.120]   - Okay.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.600]   So you have a tough row to hoe,
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.360]   because anything, any expenses that you're going to use
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.540]   to offset that $200,000 of capital gains
[00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.640]   need to be incurred here during 2020.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.440]   So across your real estate business,
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.880]   do you have any big expenses that are sitting there
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.240]   waiting for you that you need to pay for?
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.040]   - You know, I really don't.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.880]   The biggest expenses are buying the properties
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.520]   and rehabbing the properties.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.840]   And I don't, and those just kind of come along
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.160]   as they come along.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.760]   I don't have any major tools that I need to buy.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.320]   The one possibility, I thought, is maybe,
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.160]   and this also ties in with travel,
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.000]   especially where this year's travel is probably gonna be,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.840]   we try to travel in the winter,
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.840]   and this year's travel will probably be based
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.840]   in the US and based out of some sort of camper or RV.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.360]   So I did think, well, maybe we could buy a truck
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.080]   for the business, and maybe the business
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.400]   would be generous enough to let us use it
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.000]   this winter for traveling.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.160]   That's my only thought with as far as big business expenses.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.680]   - Right.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.560]   Well, then you're gonna be limited,
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.480]   because at the end of the day, you have what you have.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.360]   So what can you do?
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.480]   Well, first, have you done any cost segregation studies
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.920]   for the properties that you own
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.800]   to see if you can increase the depreciation rates
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.600]   based upon a cost segregation study?
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.680]   - You know, I haven't, and for the most part at this point,
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.160]   most of, I don't have a whole lot
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.000]   as far as long-term properties, buy and holds at this point.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.520]   It's mostly just flipping.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.520]   - Right, okay.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.160]   So you know as well as I know
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.120]   that there's nothing magic about real estate.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.320]   And I probably overstated a little bit,
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.720]   I hope I didn't overstate, but in terms of,
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.720]   when you read about President Trump's low tax return,
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.480]   the reality is that he has a low tax return
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.080]   because of losses.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.280]   Now, what we can't know,
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.760]   what I tried to emphasize in the show,
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.120]   what we can't know is the degree to which those losses
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.680]   are paper losses that are simply reducing
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.320]   his taxable burden, but he's having
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.040]   additional gains elsewhere, or are those real losses,
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.240]   meaning he's actually getting poorer
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.840]   because his properties are consuming more money
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.000]   than what they create.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   We can't know that.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.600]   Depreciation is not a magic pill.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.160]   There's a depreciation schedule.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.760]   And so if you're running a hotel,
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.760]   you have the ability to do a cost segregation study
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.480]   and potentially take higher rates of depreciation
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.800]   on your equipment, and a lot of those expenses
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.180]   will come in the front end.
[00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.520]   But at the end of the day, depreciation
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.640]   always runs out as well.
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.120]   And so you cannot escape taxes forever,
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.640]   and you cannot escape taxes on current income.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.560]   The only way for you to offset your $200,000
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.960]   of capital gains is going to be to generate expenses.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.760]   But it's one thing to generate expenses
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.580]   if you have an underlying profitability component
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.840]   where, hey, I'm generating expenses,
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.280]   but I'm still gonna be profitable overall
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.280]   when I look at the overall structure of my business.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.700]   It's another thing to just simply spend money
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.000]   that you don't need to spend.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.440]   And so I'm always nervous about people spending money
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.520]   just for a tax deduction.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.680]   If you need something or if you have a business
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.880]   where you can profitably invest money,
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.880]   sure, take the tax deduction.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.080]   Take the loss if you can do it in a way
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.520]   that genuinely leads to a profit
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.880]   and it helps your tax situation, do it.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.480]   But I wouldn't even necessarily go out
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.380]   and buy a new truck just simply to offset the taxes.
[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.600]   Now, if you need a new truck or if you want a new truck
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.860]   or if a new truck makes financial sense for you,
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.680]   then by all means, make this the year
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.600]   that you buy a new truck and think about
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.020]   what kind of truck that you need.
[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.940]   But at the end of the day, there is no 100% tax rate.
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:50.780]   And so you don't wanna spend money just to reduce taxes.
[00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.580]   You want to invest money, and if you can see a way
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.340]   to profitably invest money so that it pays off
[00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.420]   in the long term, that's what you do.
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.620]   And I think that, as I thought more about it
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:05.900]   after I did that show, I think that if President Trump
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.100]   is doing something intelligent, right,
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.880]   if he's doing something intelligent,
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.980]   then it's probably due to the structure
[00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:17.540]   of the golf businesses where you have so much land
[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.760]   that you're baking a long-term play
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.420]   for the appreciation and the value of the land,
[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.220]   the appreciation and the value of the buildings, et cetera,
[00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.400]   that that's where your long-term profit play is.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.620]   You're trying to capitalize by owning grade A real estate
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.940]   in highly desirable locations, and yet you have the benefit
[00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.700]   of the fact that that property is not currently taxed
[00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.140]   because it's just simply an increase in capital gains.
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.060]   So I don't see a solution for you other than
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.740]   is there a place that you can profitably invest money?
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.080]   If there is a place that you can profitably invest money,
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.420]   do it, if not, pay the tax.
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:54.300]   - Yeah, that makes sense, and I agree.
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.720]   I actually don't like the idea of buying things
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.720]   just to buy things.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.920]   To save 30% or whatever.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.640]   - Now, if you expect there to be other income in the future
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.640]   that you need to shelter, for example,
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.680]   if you have two businesses, you have a real estate business
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.120]   that you're involved in full-time,
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.640]   but you also have another business
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.200]   that's a cash flow business,
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.280]   then think about your strategy of real estate
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.600]   and ask yourself, is there a type of real estate
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.040]   I can invest in that's gonna give me more depreciation,
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.200]   more current losses to offset this income?
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.760]   So, you know, a big multifamily apartment building
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.400]   might be a good fit.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.400]   You can buy one that's gonna require significant capital
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.280]   up front to do repairs to the property, et cetera.
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.840]   Something like that is an ideal solution
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.680]   for your overall tax planning.
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.640]   But at the end of the day, I always come back to the fact
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.600]   that there's no 100% tax rate,
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.000]   and even as things stand currently,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.440]   the capital gains tax rates,
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.400]   the long-term capital gains tax rates,
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.760]   are among the more fair of the US tax rates.
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.960]   I don't wanna call them fully fair,
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:05.700]   but they are more fair than our income tax rates, certainly.
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.400]   - Yeah. - All right.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.120]   - Yep, that's my--
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.320]   - Let's talk about your second question.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.520]   Can you start a travel business
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:19.120]   and use that travel business to fund your family travels
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.560]   in a way that is going to allow you
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.560]   to use your business expenses as part of that business?
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.160]   The answer is certainly yes, you can.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.920]   But you will need to be very thoughtful
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.100]   about how you do this.
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.120]   So from the IRS perspective,
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.520]   there is nothing unique about a travel business
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.240]   versus any other kind of business.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.520]   A travel business is a travel business.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.640]   So imagine that you are a photographer
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.280]   and you get a job for National Geographic Magazine.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.000]   I think they're still around.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.080]   And so you're a photographer.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.800]   And National Geographic calls you up.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.200]   You live in Denver, Colorado.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.280]   And National Geographic calls you up and they say,
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.240]   we're doing this special series
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.040]   on the waves off the coast of Portugal.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.920]   And we want you to go and we want you to photograph
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.360]   the winter waves there that are 85 feet high
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.960]   off the coast of Portugal.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.840]   So you say, fine, right?
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.660]   And so you take out
[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.740]   your National Geographic business credit card.
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:17.760]   You're an employee of the company.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.160]   You take out your National Geographic business credit card.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.060]   You call up the airline.
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.000]   You buy an airplane ticket to Portugal.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.620]   You reserve a hotel for yourself there in Portugal.
[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.200]   You go to the beach with your camera.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.780]   You take those pictures.
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.400]   Then you come back from that business trip.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.240]   You're there for a couple of weeks
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.800]   to cover the surfing competition.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.000]   And you gotta be there every day
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.040]   because the waves are,
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.200]   the waves are,
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.200]   you don't know when to expect them.
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.640]   And the surfing competition goes over the course
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.720]   of a couple of weeks.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.960]   Then you come back to your home in Denver, Colorado.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.680]   When you arrive back at your home in Denver, Colorado,
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.160]   you submit an expense report to your company
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.900]   telling them about all of the expenses that you've had.
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:00.940]   You tell them about the hotel cost, the plane cost.
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.040]   You tell them about the food that you ate on the trip.
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.920]   And all of that is deductible business expenses
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.840]   for the National Geographic Organization.
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.800]   It doesn't matter whether they paid you
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.800]   as an independent contractor
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.800]   or you submitted as an expense report.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.780]   It doesn't matter whether you did it as an employee.
[00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:18.000]   All of those are deductible expenses.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.280]   The IRS does not say that because National Geographic
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.280]   is a big business and a big known brand
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.960]   that they can deduct the travel expenses
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.300]   for their photographers.
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.120]   But you can't because you're not yet a big business
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.440]   or you're not yet a big brand.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.040]   So let's say that you have an idea
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.000]   to start your own travel magazine.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.880]   And you sit down and you figure out
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.440]   is this something that could be profitable?
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.040]   You write a business plan that shows,
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.860]   listen, if I start this offbeat travel magazine,
[00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.720]   I'll have the ability to create
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.640]   really just stunning photojournalism
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.760]   that everybody's gonna be really interested in.
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.560]   And you decide that you're gonna start a surfing magazine.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.920]   Your first feature is going to be a feature
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:01.120]   on the Giant Wave Surf Competition in Portugal.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.880]   So you do all exactly the same thing
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.640]   for your own business to start your own magazine.
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.500]   There's no difference from a tax perspective
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:12.200]   about your ability to do that starting your own magazine
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.760]   versus National Geographic.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.800]   So that's the first thing is you gotta get very clear
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.000]   on what's allowed and what's not allowed.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.320]   There's no, National Geographic and you
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.200]   have exactly the same tax code.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.160]   And the tax code doesn't say,
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.240]   well, you have to, you're having fun on the job,
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.120]   so therefore you're not allowed to,
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.720]   you can't deduct it, right?
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.160]   'Cause you can't deduct fun.
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.360]   The tax code doesn't say whether you can deduct your fun.
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.340]   The tax code says that you can deduct business expenses
[00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:40.600]   that are ordinary and necessary business expenses.
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.660]   Now, you can imagine that if you had a desire
[00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:46.600]   to start this travel magazine,
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.400]   this surfing travel magazine,
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.040]   and you spent nine months a year traveling
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.200]   to far-flung surf spots and putting yourself
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:59.200]   in a situation where you, each and every week,
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.400]   you're filming these things
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.360]   and those never make it public, right?
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.860]   Those never make it to a magazine,
[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:06.980]   those never make it to the internet.
[00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.940]   You can imagine that in an audit,
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.140]   when you submit, I have $130,000 of travel expenses
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.080]   that I'm trying to deduct,
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.160]   you can imagine that being audited.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.820]   But there's no rule that says that a paper magazine
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:22.960]   is more appropriate than an online magazine.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.440]   There's no rule that says your magazine
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.060]   can't be a PDF magazine.
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.320]   There's no rule that says the travel photographer
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.620]   who takes pictures for National Geographic
[00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:35.700]   is not equally, that somehow that's allowed,
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.900]   but the travel photographer who takes pictures
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.940]   for Instagram is not allowed.
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.220]   There's not a rule on that.
[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.540]   So you can build a business like this
[00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:48.500]   that allows you to live a nice lifestyle
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.300]   and to put these kinds of expenses
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.700]   into a business expense deduction.
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.980]   Now, let's talk about your children and your wife,
[00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:57.380]   and we'll cover the RV, and then I'll tell you
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.100]   how to do this and how to do it properly
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.060]   so that you are steering clear of the edge.
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:03.260]   Because the biggest thing you wanna do
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.460]   is wanna know how to do it properly if you do it
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.180]   so that you don't have a problem.
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.020]   Now, if you're going to Portugal
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.420]   as a National Geographic photographer,
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:16.100]   and you ask them, "Listen, I've got a nine-year-old son
[00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.940]   "who I'd like to take with me,"
[00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:19.980]   and you ask them, "Do you mind?"
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.740]   They'll say, "Sure, you can take your nine-year-old son
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:22.980]   "with you after all, you're just gonna be standing
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:26.000]   "on the beach with a camera and a tripod taking pictures.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.580]   "Your nine-year-old son can stand there next to you
[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:29.000]   "and watch the surfing."
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.780]   But National Geographic would not pay
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:34.460]   for your nine-year-old son's travel expenses.
[00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:35.860]   You know, my dad did a lot of business travel
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:38.260]   over the years, and many times he would take my mom with him
[00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.300]   but he would always cover my mom's expenses.
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:41.340]   It was no big deal.
[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.440]   She would hang out, and if they were in Stockholm, Sweden,
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.980]   then she would just spend the day
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.540]   cruising around Sweden by herself.
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.220]   She would spend time with my dad at night.
[00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:53.660]   But, and the company paid for my dad's hotel room,
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.220]   the company paid for my dad's food,
[00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.100]   the company paid for my dad's transportation,
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.500]   but my dad paid for my mom's plane ticket and for her food.
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:04.260]   So any additional costs, he covered personally.
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:05.860]   And that's the way the tax code works.
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.220]   So let's say that you wanna start
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.460]   your independent travel photography business,
[00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.740]   you're starting your own independent magazine,
[00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:13.980]   and you wanna take your nine-year-old son with you.
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.420]   Well, if your nine-year-old son
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.220]   is not an employee of the business,
[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:20.360]   then you can't deduct your nine-year-old son's expenses.
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.300]   So you can't fly to Portugal and deduct two airplane tickets.
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.160]   You can deduct yours, but you'll pay for his
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.140]   out of your pocket if he's not an employee of the company.
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.240]   You can have a hotel room, and it's no big deal
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.260]   if your son uses the second hotel room.
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.460]   But what you wanna make sure of
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.940]   is that there's no additional cost for that second,
[00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.980]   for that two-bed hotel room versus the one-bed hotel room.
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:44.260]   And so a very scrupulous accountant
[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.720]   who wants to be totally audit-proof
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.180]   would get a quote for a single occupancy room,
[00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.540]   and then they get a quote for a double occupancy room.
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.700]   And if there's an additional cost
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.660]   to the double occupancy room,
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.500]   then they would not deduct that additional cost.
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.380]   If the single occupancy room is $100 a night
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.880]   and the double occupancy room is $110 a night,
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.360]   you can deduct the $100 a night for you,
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.440]   but you can't deduct the marginal $10 a night for your son.
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.660]   If you're going out to dinner, you would get separate checks.
[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.580]   You would pay for your son separately
[00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:16.380]   and not bill that to the business.
[00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.540]   You would pay for you as an individual.
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:19.960]   Now, it's rather obvious
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.680]   that there's some wiggle room in there.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.440]   I would guess, although I don't know this,
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.840]   I would guess that when my dad did his expense reports,
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.420]   his bosses were fairly lenient with him.
[00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.620]   They probably didn't check to say,
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.260]   "Was your $40 that you bought,
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.420]   that you charged for this particular meal
[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.780]   in Stockholm, Sweden,
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.980]   was that for an appetizer and a full entree
[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:42.940]   that you ate yourself?
[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.420]   And then did you separately bill
[00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.220]   an additional entree for your wife?
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.520]   Or was that an appetizer and an entree
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.640]   that you and your wife split?
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.780]   And because you don't eat very much, you're split."
[00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.180]   You get the point, that there's obviously
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:55.220]   some margin in all these things,
[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:59.340]   where it's never that specific.
[00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.580]   The laws are clear, but there's a lot of,
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:02.780]   there's a good bit of wiggle room
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:04.820]   in some of this stuff for practicalities.
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:10.780]   So, you can travel with your children,
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.100]   you can travel with your wife,
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.060]   but you can't deduct their expenses
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.740]   unless they're part of the business.
[00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.500]   Now, let's take it to a different level.
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.980]   Let's say that your son
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:24.100]   has his own surf travel magazine,
[00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:27.500]   and he recognizes that there's an unfulfilled niche
[00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.580]   for an online magazine,
[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:33.020]   specifically dealing with young surfers.
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.820]   And he wants to go and he wants to interview
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.340]   for his online magazine and for his YouTube channel,
[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.800]   he wants to interview the young surfers
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.020]   that are in the surf competition.
[00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.500]   And so, you and he together
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.940]   are going to travel to all these places.
[00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:48.500]   And he's not just a bystander,
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.140]   he's actively running the camera.
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.260]   In fact, he's doing a lot of the interviews.
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:55.300]   So, he's very much part of the business.
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.380]   Well, in that situation now,
[00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:57.940]   he's clearly an employee of the business.
[00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.180]   He's not just a tag along,
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.020]   he's clearly an employee of the business.
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.880]   And so, his expenses are every bit as deductible
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.060]   as your expenses are.
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.500]   And so, you can imagine how you could expand this.
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.480]   If you have a business where the nine year old
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.740]   is very much a part of the business,
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:16.120]   then you can incorporate the whole family.
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.700]   Your wife can run a camera,
[00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.040]   you can run a camera,
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.600]   your daughter can run sound,
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.000]   your son can be the on-air talent,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.880]   and then your other child is taking pictures,
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.660]   running the third camera and taking pictures
[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:28.960]   and updating the social media
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.720]   while you guys are doing the interviews.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.400]   Well, now you have a family business
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.380]   where it's genuinely part of the family
[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.240]   where everyone is involved in it.
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.200]   And there is nothing in the tax code
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.980]   that says that you cannot hire your nine year old son
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:44.100]   to run a camera,
[00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.480]   assuming that your nine year old son
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.120]   is capable of running a camera.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.800]   Now, you're not gonna win the argument
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.480]   that your one year old son is running a camera.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.400]   But if your nine year old is running a camera
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.480]   or your nine year old is on-air talent,
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.000]   there's nothing that says it can't do it.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.520]   And there's also nothing in the tax code
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.280]   that says that you can't shoot the entire thing
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.040]   with an iPhone, right?
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:06.440]   An iPhone today, a new modern iPhone
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.600]   has every bit as high of a recording quality
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.360]   as a professional TV camera did eight years ago.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.720]   So, there's no reason why you can't do this
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.000]   with your iPhones.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.480]   So, I hope you see what I'm saying
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.720]   is that the tax code is very, very clear,
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.880]   but it doesn't specify these details.
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.320]   So, if you design a business
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.920]   that incorporates your family,
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.580]   if you design a business that incorporates a lifestyle
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:29.880]   that you want to live,
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:34.880]   if you do that, you're not doing anything questionable.
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.640]   So, what do you have to do to prove that this works?
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.000]   Well, first of all, you need to be very careful
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.240]   that from the very beginning,
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.960]   this is a business and not a hobby.
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:47.600]   Because you cannot deduct hobby expenses,
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.920]   but you can deduct business expenses.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.960]   That is your most important thing to be careful of.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.140]   You cannot deduct hobby expenses,
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.380]   you can deduct business expenses.
[00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:00.680]   So, you wanna make sure that this is not a hobby.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:04.480]   So, from the very beginning, you need to run a business.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.300]   What does that mean?
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.140]   Well, you start with a business plan.
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.720]   One of the most valuable documents that you can create
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.880]   is a business plan.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.000]   And so that if you're sitting with an auditor
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.120]   and the auditor says,
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.280]   "This Youth Surf Magazine thing that you guys do,
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.760]   this sounds a lot like a family hobby.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.600]   I think you guys just like to travel
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.240]   and you're doing this for fun
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.380]   and there's not actually a business plan."
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.100]   But if you can pull out your business plan
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.740]   that was designed one year before you started the business
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:32.920]   or six months before it,
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.680]   and here's a 30-page business plan showing,
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.440]   "Look, here are three competitors who are doing this.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.320]   Here's our plan to make money on ads, on YouTube revenue,
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.480]   on building a YouTube channel.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:44.400]   Here's our brand sponsorship plan
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.020]   where we think that if we can grow our Instagram channel
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:51.240]   to 300,000 followers, we can monetize that
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.760]   for a promoted Instagram post
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.260]   for $5,000 per promoted Instagram post.
[00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.760]   And look, here's all the research that I've done
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:58.920]   on how I can do that."
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.120]   So, that's one of the most important things.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.660]   You wanna have that business plan
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:04.040]   that clearly shows what's going to happen.
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.240]   You wanna, in that business plan,
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.340]   clearly show how this business can be profitable
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.680]   and outline what the business idea is
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.720]   and outline who's gonna be involved
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.160]   and how it's gonna work.
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.200]   There's no reason why you and your three children
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.280]   can't be all of the employees of the business,
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.840]   but you would wanna make sure that you understand
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.680]   why those three children are necessary
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.120]   and what they're actually doing in the business.
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:27.680]   The next thing is, if possible, you want to show a profit.
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.080]   Now, there are what are called
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:33.000]   the hobby loss rules of business losses.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.340]   There is no requirement from the IRS perspective
[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:39.320]   that you actually make a profit
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.680]   in order to prove that you have a business.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.160]   One of the most common misconceptions that people have
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.120]   is they believe that I have to make a profit
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:52.120]   in order to prove that I have a business.
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.800]   That is not true.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:59.800]   There are many businesses that lose money every single year
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.520]   for a very long period of time.
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.400]   And in that situation,
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.880]   they can still deduct those losses.
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:10.680]   Now, the deductibility of losses will be determined
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.720]   based upon the function of the business.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.340]   If you're running this business as a sole proprietorship,
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:18.440]   losses from an active sole proprietorship business
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.480]   can be deducted against your other forms of earned income,
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.380]   which is very important for you to know.
[00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:25.560]   If the business does not have
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.080]   a significant liability exposure,
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.320]   and if you expect that in the future,
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.640]   this business will,
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:35.200]   if you expect it to create some losses for a while,
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.940]   you wanna think very, very seriously
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:38.880]   about running it as a sole proprietorship,
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.440]   because that's the most advantageous scenario.
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.560]   If your wife has $50,000 from her earned income,
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:47.600]   and your business produces a $20,000 loss,
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.880]   well, now that $20,000 business loss
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.240]   can be used to reduce her earned income
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.280]   from a taxable income of $50,000
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.120]   to a taxable income of $30,000.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.380]   Thus, that's valuable.
[00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.040]   Now, the other forms of business ownership,
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.280]   be it an S corporation, C corporation, et cetera,
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.520]   have more limited deductibility of losses,
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.760]   but they do still exist.
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.660]   So back to the hobby loss rules.
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.660]   One of the things that is important
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:13.420]   is that you understand what the hobby loss rules are.
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.940]   What the hobby loss rules are is they are a safe harbor.
[00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:20.620]   And basically, the IRS says that if you can prove
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:24.020]   that your business is profitable, and you're making money,
[00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.420]   then we know that you're running a business,
[00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:26.900]   and you're not running a hobby.
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.140]   And so we understand that many businesses
[00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:32.340]   have some losses in the beginning,
[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:34.740]   but at the end of the third year,
[00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.080]   if we sit down and we look and see that you're profitable,
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:40.200]   and then you have a safe harbor because you're making money.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.760]   So the safest thing to do is to make sure
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.780]   that your business is making money.
[00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:46.200]   Now, we all know that some businesses
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.400]   make more money than others.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.040]   We all know that you might have a business
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.440]   that you designed to make money,
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.240]   and you might run it to make money,
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.120]   but it may not work out.
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.960]   That's the case, that's true.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.120]   But you still wanna make sure that you make money
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:01.520]   if you wanna be absolutely safe and have that safe harbor
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.760]   from the perspective of the hobby loss rules.
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.460]   So make sure that you make money.
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:06.340]   And along the way,
[00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.300]   if it looks like you're not making money,
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.760]   you wanna make sure that you're doing the things
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.500]   that a business would do to make sure
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.820]   that you're making money.
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.420]   So for example, if you started a magazine,
[00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:20.460]   a surf magazine for children,
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.820]   a digital surf magazine for children,
[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:25.060]   and that digital surf magazine for children
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:26.180]   took you all around the world.
[00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:28.980]   In the first year, you lost $100,000.
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.220]   And then in the second year, you lost $100,000,
[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.680]   and you still had a revenue of zero.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.620]   You wouldn't keep traveling around the world
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:37.820]   spending $100,000 a year with a revenue of zero
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:38.860]   unless you thought that something
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:40.460]   would actually was gonna change.
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:41.440]   What would you do?
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.940]   Well, you would go to a conference
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:44.500]   on how to make money online,
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:47.540]   and how do people make a business as Instagram influencers
[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:50.180]   and with digital magazines and with events, et cetera.
[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:52.580]   You would hire a consultant to help you.
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:54.820]   You would focus on making money.
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.260]   That's the most important thing I can tell you
[00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:58.300]   is that any business that you run
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.320]   must be focused on making money.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.140]   So if you can make money, then you get a safe harbor.
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.300]   And so if you can generate a profit
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.780]   in at least three of the last five years,
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.580]   now you have a much stronger position
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.740]   to not have these expenses disallowed,
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:16.780]   even if these expenses are not,
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.420]   even if they're significant.
[00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:23.060]   So with that in mind, what I would recommend that you do
[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:26.320]   is you imagine the kind of business
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.880]   that is most likely to lead you to profit
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:31.140]   and to be the kind of business
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.180]   that your entire family can be involved in.
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.060]   And there are many of these kinds of businesses
[00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.100]   that you can do.
[00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.100]   Business does not have to be joyless.
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.220]   Businesses can be fun.
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:40.540]   Businesses can be interesting.
[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:42.580]   And the expenses associated with them
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:44.280]   don't have to be without joy.
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:48.620]   The expenses do have to be ordinary and necessary expenses
[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:50.020]   for the goal of making a profit.
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.820]   And within those guidelines,
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:55.780]   you can build the business that fits your dreams.
[00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.260]   And there are many things that you can do,
[00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:58.920]   including today with, like you said,
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.380]   with things like photography, et cetera.
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.660]   There are many people who make a living online
[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:05.860]   simply taking photos and selling them as stock photography.
[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:08.220]   And so I could do that.
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:09.740]   And if you have an eye and you have the equipment,
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.660]   you don't need fancy cameras,
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:14.140]   but if you have the eye for it and you recognize that,
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:16.100]   and you say, "My business is I'm gonna sell,
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.900]   "I'm gonna set up a stock photography business
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:19.960]   "where I take photos all around the world,
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.340]   "or I take little video snippets
[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:23.400]   "and I sell these photos and license these photos
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.300]   "to the sites that sell them
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.460]   "and license this as B-roll video,"
[00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:28.300]   you can do that.
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.180]   And your expenses associated with that endeavor
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:33.540]   are every bit as legitimate as the expenses
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:36.820]   that National Geographic has with their stories.
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:39.820]   Your stories that you write for a travel blog
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:42.940]   are every bit as legitimate as National Geographic stories
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:45.140]   if you have a business plan
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:47.280]   that leads to profit with your business.
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.980]   Now, the last thing I would touch on is the RV.
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:54.500]   RVs are tricky because that's an area of significant abuse.
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:57.260]   And so what I would say is you can research that further,
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:02.060]   but in general, RV expenses are not deductible expenses
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.960]   because the IRS, even for those who say,
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:08.620]   "Well, I'm gonna use the RV to go and I make my living,"
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:10.020]   you know, there are people who make their living like this,
[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:12.080]   "I make my living traveling around the country
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.200]   "and going to weekend expos
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.480]   "and putting my products out for sale
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.940]   "at these weekend expos."
[00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:20.140]   In general, the IRS will not allow you
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.580]   to deduct expenses associated with the RV.
[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.420]   So what you wanna do is you wanna think about that
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:25.540]   and then figure out,
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:30.540]   "Is this a big deal for me
[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:34.140]   "that I really need to do this differently or not?"
[00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:37.780]   Now, I have never been able to find any IRS cases,
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:40.540]   you know, private letter rulings or revenue rulings
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:42.480]   that have answered all the details.
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.940]   But what I would say is that there's probably some degree
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:49.260]   of variability here.
[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:51.860]   So for example, let's say that I really wanted
[00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:53.680]   to be able to deduct an RV myself.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.860]   What would I do?
[00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:56.480]   Well, I would make sure first of all,
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:59.860]   that the RV is the thing that is necessary.
[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:03.500]   So maybe my business is, I hesitate to say horse racing,
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.260]   but it is a legitimate business.
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:06.940]   But maybe my business is horse racing.
[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:08.220]   I'd rather use car racing,
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:10.060]   but horse racing gives me a set of facts
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:11.300]   that's a little bit clearer.
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.260]   So if my business is horse racing
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.220]   and I have these prized horses,
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:18.220]   maybe my business very well might be rodeo, right?
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:23.260]   Maybe your business is you're trying to do something
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:24.180]   related to the rodeo.
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:28.620]   You're an independent, you're a showgirl,
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:31.020]   you know, the girls that do the awesome tricks on horseback
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:34.720]   or you're a cowboy and you use the horse and whatnot.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:39.400]   Well, that situation, you might buy yourself a nice RV,
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.480]   but it's one of the RVs that has quarters
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:42.720]   for your horse inside of it
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.200]   and also living quarters for you.
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.160]   And you need to be with your horse 24/7
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.200]   because your horse needs to be cared for,
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.840]   it needs to be fed, it needs to be exercised,
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.280]   watered, et cetera.
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.400]   Well, in that situation, I would feel very comfortable
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:00.200]   deducting my RV expenses as part of my business
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:03.560]   of being a rodeo cowboy or a rodeo cowgirl.
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.740]   That makes a lot of sense
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.480]   because the RV is a fundamental tool in that business.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.260]   The RV is what allows me to travel all around the country,
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:13.640]   caring for this horse, and it's a horse trailer as well,
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.780]   which is clearly connected to the business.
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.640]   I think that those RV purchase expenses
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.840]   would clearly be business deductions.
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.600]   And also all of the expenses associated
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:26.180]   with driving from one place to another
[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:28.680]   with my horse to compete in these rodeos,
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.460]   these are clearly business expenses.
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:32.620]   Those are clearly business miles.
[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:35.360]   It's much less certain, however,
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.400]   if the facts start to be not so clear.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.080]   It's much less certain if you say,
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:45.080]   I'm gonna buy this RV and you don't use it all the time.
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:48.200]   In fact, most of your travel in it is personal travel,
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.480]   but you take it out once or twice a weekend
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.580]   for your child's motocross race.
[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:55.180]   Well, now you've got a big, big problem.
[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:56.280]   The other thing you wanna look at
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:59.280]   is that you wanna be very careful about business use of it.
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.840]   So if you had an RV and you were trying to deduct it,
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:02.960]   then I would keep a logbook.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.520]   You better have a logbook of how many nights
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.040]   is this thing used and the amount of time
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.160]   that's being used for business versus other things as well.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.920]   So on the RV thing, what I would say
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.840]   is it's probably not deductible.
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:15.240]   And so I wouldn't push that one
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.560]   because there have been some guidance
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:22.160]   that's come down on RVs that basically RV expenses
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.700]   have generally been disallowed.
[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.920]   But if your family business is something
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:29.640]   that could be created where the RV is clearly necessary,
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:32.720]   clearly important, maybe, maybe.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.760]   That'll give you some thoughts to go on, Jose.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.200]   - Yeah, that's great.
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.120]   I really appreciate this.
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.760]   I'm definitely gonna come back and re-listen to this.
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:44.080]   - Cool, my pleasure.
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:44.920]   Well, thank you for calling in
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:47.800]   and best of luck to you in your tax savings efforts.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.200]   All right, I guess my answer
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.360]   was probably a little bit too long.
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.560]   I had four callers drop off,
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.620]   but I still got four more to go.
[00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:54.600]   So we go to California next.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.440]   Welcome to the show.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.480]   How can I serve you today?
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:00.120]   - Hi, Joshua, is this me up?
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:00.960]   - That's you up.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.440]   - All right, thank you so much.
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.880]   So I'll try and be quick right now.
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.880]   Let me explain my situation.
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:09.480]   So I'm 25 years old.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:11.120]   I currently hold three jobs.
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:17.520]   One is I'm an auditor for a public accounting firm.
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:21.280]   The other, I work as a dog hygienist on Saturdays
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:22.640]   and I work under a veterinarian.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.300]   And then I also have a minor bookkeeping business.
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:29.040]   And so, and that's very, very minor.
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:32.080]   Basically what I'm trying to do is to end all three of these
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.000]   and I want to go into a sales career.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.640]   I believe I have the personality to do it.
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:41.900]   I believe I have the determination, organization, et cetera.
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.400]   My goals are basically that I want to invest
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:49.040]   in real estate along the way, have passive income,
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.160]   be able to have other businesses to have passive income
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.480]   as well so I can live the life
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:54.960]   that I really do want to live.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:58.320]   And I feel like accounting is great, but it's very static.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.680]   It's good income, but that's going to increase slowly
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.560]   and steadily, not necessarily very quickly
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.280]   like how sales could be.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.560]   So I just wanted to get your thoughts about that.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.060]   - Do you currently have a CPA license?
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:12.080]   - No.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:15.560]   - Do you have an ambition to get one?
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:16.560]   - No.
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:17.760]   - You don't have any ambition to get one,
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.320]   you're not interested enough to study and get it,
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:22.440]   you really want to make the career change faster.
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.280]   - Exactly.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.440]   - Okay, totally fair.
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:27.240]   So what kind of sales have you thought about going into?
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:30.440]   - So I'm thinking about medical sales.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:33.840]   I can, doing the hygienist as a dog,
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:37.400]   a cat and dog hygienist, I can leverage that
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.200]   to say that I had some sales experience in there
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.920]   when I'm recruiting for a medical sales job
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.920]   because I did talk to veterinarians
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:48.220]   and kind of sell the practice to other veterinarians.
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:51.340]   - Do you have a wife or children?
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:55.440]   - No sir, I'm single, or I have a girlfriend,
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.920]   but we're not married.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:01.040]   I have about $20,000 saved up
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.840]   and we're looking to move to a lower cost area
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:04.880]   sometime next year.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.880]   So this would all be like next year.
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.080]   - Yeah.
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:08.920]   Well, I love it.
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:10.920]   I think that sales is certainly
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.760]   one of the best money-making things
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:15.080]   that you can possibly be engaged in.
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:18.480]   Then sales skills, to acquire sales skills
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.240]   at an early age in your life,
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:23.200]   I think is an incredibly valuable proposition,
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:26.560]   whether you pursue it long-term or not.
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:30.880]   I started in insurance sales when I was 23 years old.
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:32.120]   And one of the reasons I did it
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:34.760]   was because I wanted to learn sales skills.
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:38.280]   And I figured even if I sell insurance for a couple of years
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:42.080]   and then quit, then I will still have gained a lot
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:46.160]   from that process and I can take that experience
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:47.260]   to many other things.
[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:48.560]   And I'm glad I did.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:51.880]   I did it for what, six years and then I quit
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:53.820]   to start Radical Personal Finance, something like that.
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.960]   And when I left, I left with
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:01.420]   a very strong sense of self-confidence
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:04.040]   in my ability to control the future.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:07.700]   And being in sales taught me that if I wanted money,
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.040]   I picked up the phone and made phone calls.
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.440]   And that's a really valuable sense of confidence
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.440]   because you know, hey, if I want money in the future,
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.260]   I pick up the phone and make phone calls
[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:20.480]   and the money starts to come in in the fullness of time.
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:23.520]   You start to understand how to deal with people better.
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:25.360]   There's a lot of skills that are associated with it.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.560]   And I think that those skills,
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:29.160]   developing those skills at an early age
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:31.540]   are very, very valuable.
[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:34.160]   So when you think about the different kinds of sales,
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:37.340]   what types of criteria will you use
[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:39.880]   to decide what kind of sales job to go after?
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:44.140]   - That's a great question.
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:46.620]   I'm probably thinking more along the lines of
[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:49.100]   like what do they expect of me?
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:52.580]   Are they expecting me to be there in the office
[00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:54.540]   or can I kind of run my own schedule?
[00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:56.500]   'Cause I'm very determined by myself,
[00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:59.340]   but I don't, one of the things that isn't great
[00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:01.620]   about being an accountant is you're stuck to the job
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:03.060]   no matter if there's work or not.
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:05.040]   You gotta be there for the time.
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.520]   So that'd be one of my criteria.
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:13.200]   I had a buddy walk through the different pay scales
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:16.200]   for how they reward,
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:19.240]   what's it called?
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.780]   I'm blanking right now.
[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:23.440]   - How they reward commissions.
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:24.280]   - Yeah, commissions.
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.240]   Yeah, he walked through the different commission scales
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.800]   and so I'd look for a company
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.700]   and ask them how that is determined.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.940]   Basically just flexibility
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:37.740]   and their wide range of clients
[00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:40.740]   is the only criteria that I have right now.
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:43.020]   - So let me give you a few criteria to think about
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:44.460]   because what I want you to do
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:47.740]   is I want you to do a broad survey of the sales marketplace
[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:49.700]   to try to start your sales career
[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:52.740]   in the place where there's the most long-term potential.
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:55.340]   And let me begin with how would I do the survey.
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:56.660]   What I would start by doing
[00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:59.260]   is I would start by making a list
[00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:01.600]   of anybody that I know
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:05.320]   who is involved in sales in some degree or another.
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:07.000]   And then I would call them
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.560]   and I would take them out to lunch
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.780]   and I would get their input
[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:10.680]   and I would ask them and say,
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:11.960]   I'm thinking about going into sales.
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:14.080]   Could you tell me a little bit about what you're involved in
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:17.080]   and most importantly, ask them
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:19.680]   what other areas have you heard of
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:21.320]   that you think are very lucrative
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.760]   or that you think I might like to be involved in?
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:27.080]   What other types of things should I consider?
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:29.360]   If you were gonna start in sales over again,
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.400]   what kinds of companies would you look at
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.080]   or what kinds of sales?
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:36.240]   Because the term sales is very broad
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.780]   and if you think about it,
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:41.000]   you can use it to create the kind of lifestyle
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.400]   that you would like in a number of different ways.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.520]   So let me give you a few things to think about.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:46.640]   The first thing to think about is
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:49.100]   what's the maximum amount of money
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:51.800]   that I can make in this sales job?
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:54.840]   You could go to your local cell phone store, right?
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.300]   You know, Verizon or T-Mobile
[00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:58.480]   or whatever your local cell phone stores are.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.340]   You could go and you could get a sales job
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.760]   working as a clerk in that cell phone store
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.640]   and they will pay you a commission
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:07.700]   based upon the amount of new business that you generate.
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:08.540]   What's the problem?
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:13.440]   The problem is that to the extent that you are a sales,
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.120]   just a simple sales clerk,
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:17.560]   there's gonna be a cap on your income.
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.160]   I don't know this for certain,
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:21.800]   but I can't imagine how somebody in that situation
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.020]   could make $100,000 a year.
[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:25.520]   They could probably make 50,
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.360]   which would be a great step up
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.640]   for somebody that goes from, you know,
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:33.680]   dipping, serving food at the food court,
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:35.520]   being paid $13 an hour
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.980]   to somebody who goes to selling cell phones,
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:42.000]   to go from $13 an hour to effectively $35 an hour
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.080]   with the ability to make commissions on your sales activity
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.600]   is a great step up.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.640]   But you're gonna be capped in that kind of business.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:49.760]   Why are you capped?
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:52.180]   Well, number one, you don't have recurring revenue.
[00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:54.440]   You just simply have transactions.
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:58.480]   I can't imagine how even the very best salesman,
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.760]   I can't imagine how that really good Verizon salesman
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.160]   can build a portfolio of clients
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:05.680]   who are gonna come back every year
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:07.880]   and upgrade their phone with him.
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.100]   Maybe he can get a few,
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:10.880]   but that's just not how that business works.
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.280]   And so you don't get a lot of recurring revenue.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.600]   Everything is a new sale.
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.160]   It's just whoever walks in the doors.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.360]   That's the second thing,
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:20.000]   is you're limited in your ability to sell
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.640]   based upon the foot traffic.
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:24.440]   And so you don't really get to control that.
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.240]   You can't, when coronavirus hits
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.880]   and all the malls are shut down,
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:30.540]   you can't really pick up the phone and make it rain
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:33.080]   because you're stuck due to the amount of foot traffic
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.620]   that's coming in.
[00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.680]   In addition, what else do you face?
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:39.040]   Well, your commission rate is just relatively low.
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.880]   I have no idea what it is,
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.840]   but you know that even if somebody's doing a big transaction
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:48.240]   they're buying a $600 phone or a $1,000 phone.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:51.020]   And if somebody is signing up for $70 a month,
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:54.220]   maybe you can make $100.
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.660]   Maybe you can make a couple of hundred dollars
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:56.500]   and that kind of thing.
[00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:57.960]   I don't know what their commission rates are,
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.260]   but you're stuck, right?
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:00.820]   You've got a couple of hundred dollars
[00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:02.440]   of maximum commission.
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:06.340]   I can't imagine they could pay more than 150 or $200
[00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:08.600]   even on a big deal, right?
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.160]   When you sell a thousand dollar phone
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:13.380]   and $80 a month of service.
[00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:16.040]   So your commission rates are relatively low.
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:17.300]   Other things you would want to consider
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.220]   are things like scheduling.
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:22.100]   Downside of selling cell phones in a cell phone store
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:25.020]   is that you've got to be there to attend the store.
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:27.120]   And you have to be there to attend the store
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.900]   when it's busy and when it's not busy.
[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:30.620]   And so you don't have any flexibility
[00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:32.820]   and control over your life.
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:34.940]   And in the end of the day also,
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:36.460]   there's not really any ownership.
[00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:38.760]   Like I talked about with recurring revenue.
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:40.380]   It's not like you get to a point where,
[00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:42.940]   okay, now I can just sit and I own this.
[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.320]   I own my business.
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:45.160]   You don't.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:48.400]   You're an hourly employee who gets sales commissions,
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.800]   but that's sales.
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:54.260]   Now let's compare that to something like insurance sales.
[00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:56.940]   Maybe you say, I'm good at money.
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:58.460]   I'm good at these numbers.
[00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:00.120]   What I'd like to do is I'd like to become
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.620]   an insurance salesman.
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:04.980]   And maybe you want to join and start a property
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:06.380]   and casualty insurance agency.
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:08.340]   So you call up State Farm and Allstate
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:10.220]   and you look at independence and you go around
[00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:12.540]   and you figure out what can I do here?
[00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:16.600]   Well, now you have a very different sales job.
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:18.900]   You have a very different structure
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:21.820]   to how your business is going to work.
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:23.100]   From the money perspective,
[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:26.660]   your maximum upside is much, much bigger.
[00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:29.020]   If you can grow your book of business significantly,
[00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:31.480]   you might start off at a relatively low income, right?
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:34.240]   You might make 60 or $70,000 your first year,
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:37.540]   but you could put a plan in place in seven, eight, 10 years.
[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:40.260]   You could very clearly be at half a million dollars a year.
[00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:43.900]   And if you can build the agency very, very large,
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:45.220]   you could certainly make a million
[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:46.620]   or a couple million bucks a year
[00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:47.860]   doing that kind of business.
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:49.300]   I've worked with many property
[00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:50.980]   and casualty insurance agents
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:54.500]   who are making seven figures a year from their business.
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:57.660]   Seven figures is very different than 70,000, right?
[00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:00.020]   A million is very different than 70,000,
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:01.980]   but you still are going to be capped, right?
[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:04.980]   You're not going to create a $100 million organization
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.780]   doing, you know, working as a State Farm agent
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:08.620]   or something like that.
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:09.940]   You're just not going to do it.
[00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:12.620]   But you have a much higher profitability
[00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:17.060]   than you do with the sales job.
[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:17.900]   What are the other benefits?
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:19.080]   Well, one benefit you get
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:20.580]   with going with something like insurance sales
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:22.100]   is you get recurring revenue.
[00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:24.400]   So once you build the book of business,
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.200]   you're going to have some cancellations,
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.060]   but you're going to receive recurring revenue.
[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:30.620]   And with a property and casualty agency,
[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:32.540]   your ongoing commissions are substantial.
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:34.540]   There's not a big difference between your first year
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:35.680]   and your ongoing commissions.
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:37.900]   And so you can provide good service
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:42.460]   and you can build this company to be very large,
[00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:43.700]   and you can do very well,
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:45.600]   and you have ongoing recurring revenue.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:46.500]   So if you had last year,
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:50.180]   you had the expected profit of $350,000,
[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:53.620]   whether you work 60 hours a week or 20 hours of work a week,
[00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:57.460]   probably 300 of that is pretty well guaranteed.
[00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:59.780]   You also have the benefits of being able to build
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:01.300]   more of an actual business.
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:05.500]   So in something like a property and casualty business,
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:08.820]   you hire staff, the staff is servicing the client,
[00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:10.980]   they handle most of your customer service needs.
[00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:13.060]   And so once you've done the initial work
[00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:14.460]   to get the business going,
[00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:16.600]   your time requirements are far less.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.700]   You'll work a lot in the beginning,
[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:19.660]   but once you're 10 years in,
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:22.100]   your time requirements are much more modest.
[00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:24.140]   And so you have a lot more free time.
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.540]   You never get to the point of total free time,
[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:28.220]   but you have a lot more free time
[00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:30.580]   because your staff and the agents that are under you
[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:32.800]   can handle most of those things.
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.380]   That gives you a lot of benefits.
[00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:36.780]   'Cause if you can say, I'm making $400,000 a year
[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:38.280]   and I'm working 30 hours a week,
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:42.220]   that's a very different type of business proposition
[00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:47.220]   than if you are going into cell phone sales.
[00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:50.340]   Now, what are some downsides?
[00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:51.780]   Well, things you would wanna think about.
[00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:54.020]   If you built a property and casualty agency,
[00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:55.100]   something like that,
[00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:58.940]   you're not at all flexible in terms of your location.
[00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:00.700]   You're gonna be in the community.
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:01.940]   You need to be in the community.
[00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:03.940]   You need to become part of the community.
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:06.340]   And so if you say, well, I wanna move every two years,
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:07.340]   that's not gonna work
[00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:09.420]   because you've got to be part of that community.
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:11.300]   You've gotta build the relationships
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:12.900]   and establish the presence
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:15.380]   that's gonna see you as a long-term part of that community
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:17.680]   'cause it just gets easier and easier and easier.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:20.080]   So you're not gonna be traveling a lot.
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:22.020]   From the perspective, you can take personal trips,
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:23.540]   but you're not gonna be traveling all the time
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:25.080]   and moving every couple of years
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:26.980]   because you're tied to that place.
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:29.060]   In addition, you'll be tied to that place
[00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:31.480]   for the productivity of your overall business.
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.180]   So you're not gonna,
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:35.220]   you're gonna build one kind of business in a small town,
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:36.940]   you're gonna build another kind of business in a big city.
[00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:38.940]   And so you wanna think about that.
[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:41.300]   Also, you're gonna have substantial responsibilities.
[00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:42.300]   You're gonna have an office,
[00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:44.620]   you're gonna have employees, and you need that.
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:46.780]   So that brings a significant amount
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:48.180]   of additional pressure on you
[00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:49.520]   when now you realize,
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:52.260]   not only is it my family that's eating from this business,
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:54.860]   but rather I'm supporting six other families.
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:56.980]   That's a big responsibility.
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:57.900]   It can be great.
[00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:00.260]   It can give you a tremendous feeling of pride.
[00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:02.700]   It can also be a downside where you're saying,
[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:04.000]   I don't like this so much.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.900]   Medical sales, right?
[00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:07.420]   You can do the same kind of rubric
[00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:08.860]   applied to medical sales.
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:10.220]   What's the benefit of medical sales?
[00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:11.260]   Well, the benefit of medical sales
[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:12.340]   is you're gonna be given a route,
[00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:13.500]   you're gonna be given equipment.
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.820]   You don't have to deal with
[00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:17.700]   the difficulty of personal sales, right?
[00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:19.260]   Some people hate insurance sales
[00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:21.740]   because you know that whenever you meet someone,
[00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:23.980]   you're hoping that they'll place their insurance with you.
[00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:25.540]   You know, I used to sell life insurance,
[00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:27.220]   and there's always this thing in the back of your mind
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:28.340]   is I should probably sell this person
[00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:29.260]   a life insurance policy.
[00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:30.740]   And some people don't like that, right?
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:32.740]   Some people do not like doing business with their friends.
[00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:35.120]   They don't like working with it.
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:37.860]   So in a medical sales job,
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:39.460]   you don't have any of those constraints.
[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:41.500]   You can have your personal life and your business life.
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:42.820]   And when you're doing sales,
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:43.980]   everyone knows what you're doing.
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:45.500]   You're just doing sales,
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:50.080]   but there's no crossover to your personal life.
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:53.040]   So medical sales can be a very high compensating business.
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:54.920]   You can do very well.
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:56.940]   I don't think you're gonna make as much as you could
[00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:59.780]   with something like a state farm office
[00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:03.100]   or running a big financial sales business,
[00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:05.420]   running a big investment company,
[00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:07.240]   but you could do very, very well in medical sales,
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:08.980]   certainly multiple six figures
[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:11.480]   if you're with the right company and the right opportunity.
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:13.140]   But you are going to be,
[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:16.460]   you're gonna lose freedom over your time, right?
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:18.860]   You've got a route, you've got to service these clients,
[00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:20.660]   you've got to see them a certain amount of time,
[00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:24.380]   and you've got to do it regularly.
[00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:28.500]   You can have some flexibility over your daily activities.
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:30.540]   You know, I've worked with medical sales people
[00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:33.500]   who had a significant degree of personal freedom.
[00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:35.260]   They had a lot of personal freedom.
[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:36.920]   Many of them were doing real estate on the side,
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:37.940]   and they had plenty of freedom
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:39.080]   because they just have their route,
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.080]   and they're in their car.
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:41.620]   The company provides you with a car,
[00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:43.940]   and as long as your clients are happy, everyone's happy.
[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:45.380]   But you don't have quite,
[00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:47.020]   you do still have a boss to report to.
[00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:51.500]   You do still have people that you're in charge of.
[00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:53.360]   Compare that to something like real estate sales, right?
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:54.620]   You could become a real estate agent.
[00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:56.780]   Now, if you're a real estate agent,
[00:46:56.780 --> 00:47:00.740]   that might put you closer at hand to your investment goals.
[00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:03.780]   Now, that might give you much more autonomy
[00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:04.740]   because as a real estate agent,
[00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:07.500]   you basically have total control over your time.
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:10.900]   And because you have total control over your time,
[00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:12.620]   you can choose when you work.
[00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:14.940]   But, you know, the downside of being a real estate agent
[00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:16.300]   is that much of that work,
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.580]   at least if you're on the buyer's side,
[00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:20.020]   not on the listing side,
[00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:21.540]   much of that work is in the evening.
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:22.880]   That's one of the biggest complaints
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.220]   for somebody who's a father with children,
[00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:28.780]   is I have to do this in the evening when I'm with my family
[00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:29.840]   'cause that's when I show houses.
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:31.880]   But if you're single, it can be a great life.
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:34.220]   So I don't know which of these is right.
[00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:35.620]   But what I wanna point out is,
[00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:38.380]   if you'll survey the marketplace
[00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:40.600]   and get some ideas from people who know,
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:42.340]   get some ideas of what works in your area,
[00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:43.700]   of what works in your target area,
[00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:45.300]   what opportunities there are,
[00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:46.860]   then I think that'll help you
[00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:49.460]   to make a more informed decision.
[00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:51.480]   And as I look at it, if you're gonna go into sales,
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:53.940]   why go into sales where you're capped, right?
[00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:58.500]   Why go after the $70,000 a year cell phone job
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:03.340]   when you could go after the $700,000 selling 747s job?
[00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:04.180]   Why not?
[00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:05.920]   If you're gonna develop the sales skills,
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:08.260]   then why not target the job where those sales skills
[00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:10.860]   can actually pay off significantly profitably?
[00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:14.380]   And so I think that what I would recommend that you do
[00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:18.540]   is as you are talking to people,
[00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:20.820]   filter things based upon where the money is.
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:22.740]   And if you can find someone
[00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:24.460]   who's making half a million a year,
[00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:26.540]   then I would put that a lot higher on my list
[00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:28.940]   than somebody where, yeah, they're making 120.
[00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:29.940]   120 is great, right?
[00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:31.180]   It's probably more than what you're doing right now,
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:32.540]   even with your three jobs.
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:34.540]   But don't put yourself in that,
[00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:35.780]   unless you're doing it as a training
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:37.180]   or it's what you can find,
[00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:40.180]   don't put yourself into one of those low-budget sales jobs.
[00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:41.740]   Target, you have the ability,
[00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:44.500]   target something where there's a big long-term potential.
[00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:46.300]   I think that makes a lot more sense.
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:51.380]   - Joshua, I appreciate your time.
[00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:52.420]   - My pleasure. - Very much.
[00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:55.020]   - Yeah, keep in touch and let me know how it goes.
[00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:56.460]   All right, we go to the great state of Montana.
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:57.300]   Welcome to the show.
[00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:58.300]   How can I serve you today?
[00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:00.740]   - Hi, this is Jeremiah.
[00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:03.100]   I was just calling to see if you could give me
[00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:07.020]   some thoughts on app protection, mainly at my primary home.
[00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:11.420]   So we live, again, we live in Montana.
[00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:15.540]   The homestead protection here in Montana is $250,000
[00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:17.340]   from my understanding.
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:20.460]   The value of our home is about 500,000.
[00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:23.820]   We both work in fields that have,
[00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:29.540]   we have liability protection for a handyman service
[00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:31.300]   and for the medical field.
[00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:34.260]   So we're a little bit worried about protecting our home,
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:36.220]   but we also like the idea of paying off our mortgage,
[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:37.700]   having no mortgage.
[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:40.260]   We have a rental and we thought about selling the rental
[00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:44.620]   to pay for the mortgage and we wouldn't have that cost.
[00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:48.380]   So I was just calling to see what your thoughts are on that.
[00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:49.740]   - Well, it's hard.
[00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:51.740]   There's certainly a balance there.
[00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:55.340]   So I've pulled up my little cheat chart here
[00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:57.060]   and let's just talk through what my chart tells me.
[00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:59.100]   First of all, Montana does not allow tenancy
[00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:00.420]   by the entirety.
[00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:02.780]   So that's a downside because tenancy by the entirety
[00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:05.420]   can be a useful way of protecting the house.
[00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:08.380]   Montana has a $250,000 homestead exemption.
[00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:11.620]   So they'll protect $250,000 worth of value.
[00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:16.620]   Evidently Montana will protect IRAs, but not Roth IRAs.
[00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:18.660]   Looks like Montana will only protect
[00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:21.580]   about $4,000 of life insurance cash values.
[00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:23.580]   My chart doesn't say annuities,
[00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:26.020]   it just gives me some code that I would look up
[00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:31.020]   and I would know if I were a Montana attorney.
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:33.700]   Life insurance proceeds protects beneficiaries'
[00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:38.140]   interest in proceeds and availability, 100% protected,
[00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:41.300]   and they'll protect $350 a month of annuity and cash values
[00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:43.140]   and they won't protect 529 plans.
[00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:45.180]   So what do you do?
[00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:47.460]   Well, the first thing that you wanna do
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:49.020]   is you wanna calculate your risk
[00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:50.900]   to the extent that you're able to.
[00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:55.900]   Because you can't, a lot of times with asset protection,
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:59.140]   you're trying to cover something
[00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:00.940]   that's just not really worth it.
[00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:03.220]   Many people have paid off houses
[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:05.300]   and many people live in states
[00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:09.060]   where there's very modest homestead exemptions.
[00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:13.100]   And in that situation, they still are covered
[00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:18.260]   because they still, they don't have,
[00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:21.740]   getting tongue tied, they're fine because nothing happens.
[00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:23.380]   So if nothing happens, you're fine.
[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:25.140]   You don't have to always have
[00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:27.180]   the world's greatest asset protection.
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:30.180]   Now, if you are in a higher profile scenario
[00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:35.180]   or you're potentially more exposed
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:38.300]   than a lot of other people, then yes, that's a big deal.
[00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:39.580]   And so you wanna make sure
[00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:43.020]   that you cover things a little bit better.
[00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:44.540]   So the first thing is the homestead exemption.
[00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:45.360]   That's always the first step.
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:47.340]   So you have $250,000 of protection.
[00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:50.900]   So I would make sure that I covered $250,000
[00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:52.180]   worth of exception.
[00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:55.360]   Now, beyond that, I wouldn't hurry to pay off the mortgage,
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:57.420]   especially if hurrying to pay off the mortgage
[00:51:57.420 --> 00:51:59.100]   is costing me something else.
[00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:00.380]   I don't know if you have a 401k,
[00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:02.740]   but a 401k would be an obvious place to put money.
[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:05.140]   So if I had a $250,000 mortgage,
[00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:07.380]   I would first max out a 401k for me,
[00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:09.700]   max out a 401k for my wife if she has one,
[00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:11.420]   and get as much money in the 401k
[00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:13.540]   because the 401k is protected from creditors.
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:16.500]   And with a low cost of a mortgage, a personal mortgage,
[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:18.460]   then that's your first step.
[00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:21.820]   So keep $250,000 worth of exemption,
[00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:24.060]   sorry, of equity in the property,
[00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:25.620]   but wait a moment before paying it off
[00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:29.140]   to see if there's anything else that's eligible for you.
[00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:29.980]   It looks like-
[00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:31.060]   - Can I have a follow-up question?
[00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:32.740]   - Go ahead, sure.
[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:36.140]   - Yeah, so with that, in, let's say, five or 10 years,
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:37.820]   if you paid down some of the mortgage,
[00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:40.540]   would you look at refinancing at that point
[00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:42.740]   to keep that equity covered,
[00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:44.700]   the $250,000 worth of equity?
[00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:48.180]   - It depends on the value of the asset,
[00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:51.100]   where else you would put the money if you did,
[00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:51.940]   if you stripped it.
[00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:52.760]   That was gonna be my third thing,
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:53.600]   is strip the equity, right?
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:54.720]   That's the strategy.
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:56.900]   But it would depend on where else you could put the money,
[00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:59.140]   and then also how much your exposure is.
[00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:01.980]   So if you really are gonna benefit
[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:04.900]   from having the paid-off house, it's gonna be wonderful.
[00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:07.820]   Well, if you have a $350,000 house,
[00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:10.060]   and you have it paid off,
[00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:11.420]   by the way, I blanked when you told me,
[00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:13.700]   how much is this house worth?
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:15.300]   - Maybe $500,000, we'll say.
[00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:16.900]   - So if you look at it and say,
[00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:20.100]   all right, if I've got $250,000 of equity exposed here,
[00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:21.300]   it's not that big of a deal.
[00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:23.620]   Now, 500 is significant, 'cause it's a lot.
[00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:25.100]   If it were a $300,000 house,
[00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:27.260]   I'd just say pay off the mortgage, because it's fine.
[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:28.700]   It's 50 grand.
[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:30.900]   In the grand scheme of things, you're gonna be okay.
[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:32.500]   But if it's a million-dollar house,
[00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:36.020]   you can see how now it's a different scenario.
[00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:37.780]   So that's the Homestead exemption.
[00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:39.340]   Number two was tenancy by the entirety.
[00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:42.380]   You can't do it in Montana.
[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:44.380]   So now we talk about equity stripping.
[00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:46.540]   And so equity stripping requires you
[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:48.300]   to have a better place to do it.
[00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:50.460]   So if you have a good place to put the money
[00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:51.660]   that's gonna be more protected,
[00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:53.180]   or you have a good use for it,
[00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:57.260]   yes, I would definitely go ahead and strip the equity off.
[00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:01.420]   And so if I had a $750,000 house,
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:04.020]   and I had other places to put the money,
[00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:05.380]   and I felt like those places,
[00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:08.020]   and I was concerned about my exposure,
[00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:12.620]   then in that situation, I would definitely refinance.
[00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:15.860]   So if I get my mortgage balance below 500,
[00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:17.540]   and again, it's gonna be significant.
[00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:18.380]   It doesn't have to be every year,
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:19.860]   but if it gets down to 420, right,
[00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:22.100]   I'm gonna refinance if rates are low,
[00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:23.980]   and get it back up, and go ahead and bring it up
[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:27.020]   to a $600,000 mortgage to protect that equity again.
[00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:27.900]   That's equity stripping.
[00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:30.460]   And you can do that so easily on a house
[00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:32.780]   that there's little reason not to do it.
[00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:34.580]   Okay, now the next thing you can look at
[00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:38.020]   is you would look into a domestic asset protection trust.
[00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:40.020]   Do you know if Montana has any legislation
[00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:42.060]   around a domestic asset protection trust?
[00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:46.060]   Okay, give me just a moment,
[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:47.700]   and let's see if I can answer it
[00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:52.700]   with a one-minute solution here to see.
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:57.540]   Not coming up.
[00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:00.020]   Okay, so let me explain to you briefly
[00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:02.380]   what a domestic asset protection trust is.
[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:04.860]   If your state allows it,
[00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:05.980]   and I'll try to get you an answer here,
[00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:06.820]   but you wanna research,
[00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:09.900]   can I do a domestic asset protection trust in Montana?
[00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:14.900]   This is a relatively new form of asset protection,
[00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:18.980]   but it is not as proven as some other things,
[00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:20.920]   but it is doable, and it works really well
[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:23.380]   for an individual home.
[00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:27.460]   And many states are passing legislation on it,
[00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:29.700]   and let me see if Montana's on the list.
[00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:32.060]   Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Michigan, Mississippi,
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:33.620]   Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio,
[00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:35.180]   Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Dakota,
[00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:37.540]   Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.
[00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:38.920]   So we're out, evidently.
[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:41.260]   So a domestic asset protection trust
[00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:43.380]   is probably off the list for you.
[00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:48.060]   But basically, it does work really well, probably.
[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:49.220]   It's not perfectly proven,
[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:50.760]   but it does work really well
[00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:52.260]   for protecting a personal residence.
[00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:54.900]   And so it's a self-settled trust
[00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:59.700]   that gives you a significant amount of asset protection.
[00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:02.020]   So I'm gonna skip it there, 'cause it doesn't apply to you.
[00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:03.460]   That was the next thing.
[00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:05.460]   Next thing is, how is the home titled?
[00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:07.940]   So do you and your wife have equal liability exposure
[00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:09.260]   in your assessment, or does one of you
[00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:11.520]   have lower liability exposure than the other?
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:15.400]   - I guess that's not something I've really
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:16.820]   been able to figure out.
[00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:18.220]   I'm a handyman.
[00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:21.140]   She works as a consultant in the medical field,
[00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:22.740]   but also as a W-2 employee.
[00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:24.780]   - Yeah, that's not-- - So mostly for her.
[00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:26.580]   - I'm sorry, I interrupted you,
[00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:27.860]   but that's not particularly clear.
[00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:31.260]   Like, both of you have some exposure.
[00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:34.260]   But if there's a spouse that has a low risk
[00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:36.940]   to liability exposure, then title the home
[00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:40.660]   into her name or into your name as appropriate.
[00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:43.140]   And then the final thing is just simply umbrella insurance.
[00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:46.040]   What you can do, no question, is you can put in place
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:49.620]   a nice umbrella insurance policy on the house.
[00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:53.180]   And so assuming that you want to keep homeowners insurance,
[00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:56.180]   which obviously in most situations is wise,
[00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:59.580]   but I say assuming because sometimes one of the goals
[00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:02.540]   of paying off a house is actually be able to drop insurance.
[00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:04.260]   You have to assess the value of it.
[00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:06.820]   But for example, when I was living in South Florida
[00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:09.220]   in hurricane country, the cost of,
[00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:10.680]   you could drop windstorm insurance,
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:12.580]   but the cost of maintaining the insurance
[00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:15.300]   was just crazy compared to the actual risk
[00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:17.740]   of the windstorm happening.
[00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:20.060]   And so one of the reasons why in Florida
[00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:21.940]   I would have paid off my house was so that I could have
[00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:24.780]   the ability to drop homeowners insurance on it.
[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:27.860]   Or if I weren't gonna do that, just have a basic
[00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:28.940]   fire policy.
[00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:32.940]   And if you do that though, that runs into trouble
[00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:34.960]   with your umbrella insurance policy.
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:38.100]   But certainly umbrella insurance
[00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:40.540]   will probably protect you sufficiently.
[00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:44.220]   So I would guess that with that, you're probably okay.
[00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:45.720]   Both of you are probably okay.
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:49.760]   It's unknowable whether these strategies are valuable,
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:51.640]   but you're much more limited in your strategies
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:52.740]   than other people are.
[00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:54.500]   - Great.
[00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:55.320]   Well, that helps a lot.
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:56.740]   I wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something
[00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:57.580]   and thinking about it.
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:58:00.660]   And then umbrella policy, you said it on the house.
[00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:01.740]   Is that separate?
[00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:04.140]   'Cause we have an umbrella policy for ourselves.
[00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:06.500]   Is there different umbrella policies
[00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:08.740]   for a home versus a business?
[00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:11.220]   I'm just a sole proprietor at this point.
[00:58:11.220 --> 00:58:13.540]   So I don't think I would have any on the business side,
[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:16.820]   but if I was to advance and maybe become an S-corp
[00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:19.700]   at some point, would then you need an umbrella policy
[00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:22.160]   for the business separate from our personal
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:23.000]   to protect the home?
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.320]   It's just a sentimental thing.
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:25.560]   That's why we really wanna make sure
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:26.840]   that we're protecting this house.
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:27.880]   - Read the contract, right?
[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:29.000]   Pull out your umbrella.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:30.720]   If you have an umbrella policy
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:32.160]   with your homeowner's insurance company,
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:33.320]   pull it out and read the contract
[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:35.320]   and see what it covers you from.
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:37.320]   And then protect it.
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:41.120]   And what I would say is that this is the problem
[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:46.120]   with any kind of asset protection.
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:52.240]   You could get bulletproof asset protection, right?
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:53.740]   It's possible.
[00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:56.900]   You could establish an offshore trust
[00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:59.020]   and move all your money into the offshore trust.
[00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:02.060]   And your plan is that if something goes bad
[00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:04.060]   and anything emerges, I'm gonna leave.
[00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:05.060]   And if you're out of the country
[00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:06.660]   and your money's out of the country,
[00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:07.660]   it's pretty bulletproof,
[00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:09.660]   as long as you're willing to stay out of the country.
[00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:11.660]   That's always the weak point in offshore planning
[00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:13.460]   is that if you're there, the judge throws you in jail
[00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:14.660]   and says, "Get the money out of the trust
[00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:15.820]   "and pay your bills."
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.760]   But if you're gone, the judge can't touch you.
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.640]   And so you can do that.
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:22.120]   But that's probably not appropriate where you are
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:24.080]   in terms of your wealth, et cetera.
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:27.840]   So I would keep $250,000 of equity.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:31.280]   I wouldn't hurry to pay off the mortgage beyond that.
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:32.760]   I wouldn't hurry to do it.
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:35.120]   I would put a good umbrella liability insurance policy.
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:37.160]   I would max out my 401ks
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:39.400]   and make sure that those are totally funded
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:41.320]   and IRAs, if eligible.
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:44.960]   And probably that's good enough in your situation.
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:48.380]   And then just control your liability with proper insurance.
[00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:49.400]   So with your rental properties,
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:51.220]   make sure that those are properly insured,
[00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:56.220]   that those are properly insulated with well-done LLCs.
[00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:59.420]   Make sure that your business is insured
[00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:01.540]   with your business liability policy.
[01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:03.180]   And that probably protects you well enough.
[01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:05.280]   You don't have to have a bulletproof plan.
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:07.980]   - Great, I like taking it to the extreme
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:09.940]   to think about it in that way.
[01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:13.100]   It helps settle it down a little bit.
[01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:13.940]   So thank you so much, Joshua.
[01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:14.780]   I appreciate it. - Yeah.
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:15.620]   My pleasure.
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:17.160]   The extreme is interesting to know,
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.500]   but a lot of times it's just simply unlivable.
[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:23.080]   So you gotta just always be aware of that.
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:23.920]   All right, thank you for calling.
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:28.720]   We move on to, looks like the great state of Washington.
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:29.680]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:30.980]   How can I serve you today?
[01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:33.740]   - Thanks for taking my call.
[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:39.680]   Got a fairly rudimentary growing family housing scenario,
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:43.200]   but would appreciate your thoughts on it.
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:46.780]   My wife and I recently grown our family
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:50.620]   and we are in the Tacoma metro area,
[01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:53.960]   which is getting a lot of fallout from the growth
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.180]   in the Seattle metro area.
[01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:57.360]   So we looked and we're like, "Hey, great.
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.120]   "Our house has gone up tremendously in value,
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:03.500]   "but so has everything else as we are looking to move along."
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:07.020]   And so we're just trying to balance
[01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:11.320]   buying in an inflated market
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:15.020]   and the realities of what that means financially.
[01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:16.920]   We've been super conservative,
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:20.080]   bought an inexpensive house, got a starter home.
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:21.520]   But as we look on moving up,
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:24.640]   we've always been committed to doing a 15 year
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:26.020]   and not a 30 year mortgage
[01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:28.520]   and having it be a fairly small part of our lives.
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:32.960]   But the house no longer suits our lifestyle
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:36.320]   and we're trying to balance the market
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:40.120]   and where is appropriate and where is lifestyle creep.
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.600]   And it's all highly subjective,
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.920]   but just looking for some of your input there.
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:47.480]   - What's your household income?
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:51.720]   - Last year, right around 200.
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:54.120]   Down a little this year due to taking a bunch
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:57.080]   of voluntary time off to spend with our baby.
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:59.280]   But next year should be right back up around 200.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.080]   - And how many children do you have?
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:04.040]   - Currently one.
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.680]   We'll have another, maybe another, maybe another.
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.800]   But probably two to four.
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:10.120]   - Okay.
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:15.120]   Do you have any ambition to move outside of the Tacoma area
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:18.920]   or do you feel pretty well planted there in that area?
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:22.720]   - We're pretty well planted in this area.
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:24.560]   We're probably not willing to relocate,
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:29.560]   which is part of the reality is we don't get a pass on now.
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:32.160]   We're just trying to not be unwise.
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:34.120]   - How much did you buy your current house for?
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:34.960]   What is it worth?
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.060]   And what is the mortgage balance currently?
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:41.880]   - We bought it 265, currently worth 380,
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:46.120]   balance is 200, and looking to purchase somewhere
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:50.120]   in the five to $700,000 range.
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:50.960]   - Okay.
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:54.240]   Well, let's talk about it,
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.560]   which obviously is why you're calling.
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:57.300]   So some big picture discussions.
[01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:59.320]   The first thing that's gonna make a big, big difference
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:02.860]   in the value of your house is simply where you are located.
[01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:04.240]   There's all the difference in the world
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:06.120]   of being located in Tacoma, Washington
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.960]   versus Columbus, Ohio.
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:09.200]   There's all the difference in the world
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:12.680]   of being located in Long Island, New York
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:14.720]   versus Shreveport, Louisiana.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:19.200]   And so you've got to think about where you are
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:21.680]   with regard to what that gets you.
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:24.280]   And think about the lifestyle associated with that.
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.240]   Now, why do people live where they live?
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:30.640]   Usually it's due to that's where my family is,
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:31.960]   that's where I grew up,
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:35.600]   or it's due to this is where I have a job,
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:37.580]   or this is where I have a career, right?
[01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:38.440]   I'm in the tech space,
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:39.760]   and so I need to live in this place
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:40.880]   because it's in the tech space,
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:43.040]   or my family is here.
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:46.400]   And those things are very, very valuable.
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:49.600]   With children, having mom just down the road
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:51.840]   makes all the difference in the world
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:54.040]   for your ability, it's so valuable
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:55.520]   to have grandparents that you can trust,
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:57.320]   who can come and take care of your children.
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:59.460]   And those things are really valuable,
[01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:00.840]   but they often come with a cost.
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:04.840]   If you're in Tacoma, or you're in Southern California,
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:06.760]   or you're in South Florida,
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.200]   it just comes with a cost.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.800]   And so you've gotta recognize what the cost is.
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.200]   Now, you're well-employed,
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:16.320]   and so if you really want to be able
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.700]   to make this move to a fancier house,
[01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:19.820]   and to do it comfortably,
[01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:22.080]   the answer is make more money.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:23.600]   Because if you make more money,
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:25.680]   you can always accomplish both things.
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:26.920]   If you make more money,
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:29.400]   you have the ability to increase your lifestyle,
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:30.760]   move into a fancier house,
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:32.240]   and increase your savings.
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:34.200]   And so where your focus should be
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:36.360]   is not necessarily on finding the cheapest house
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:37.840]   that you can find,
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.300]   but figuring out how can I go
[01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:41.440]   from a $200,000 family income
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:43.880]   to a $350,000 family income,
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.820]   and enjoy a better work-life balance,
[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:49.000]   and a better work lifestyle along the way.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.780]   Is that that's usually the solution.
[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:53.920]   When people are stressed about their housing decisions,
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:56.160]   it just usually means they're not making enough money.
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:57.760]   But if you're gonna live in a place
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:01.400]   where there's an expensive house market,
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:02.780]   it probably means there's plenty of money
[01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:04.240]   that could be made there.
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:05.680]   And so I would encourage you,
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:07.560]   spend time meditating on your career,
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:10.680]   and make a plan to go from $200,000 to $500,000
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:11.960]   over the next 10 years,
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:16.280]   and the housing problems become much simpler.
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:19.240]   More money solves the housing problem elegantly.
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:20.720]   Second thing I would talk about
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:23.240]   is that when you live in a place
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:25.860]   where there is an expensive market for housing,
[01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:28.320]   it's not necessarily a bad thing
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:30.600]   to buy a more expensive house.
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:32.820]   Because generally,
[01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:37.820]   if the trends that made that house go expensive continue,
[01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:40.560]   that real estate market
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:43.580]   is probably gonna continue fairly strong.
[01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:47.020]   So it stinks for you when you're buying the house,
[01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:49.460]   but probably it'll continue to be fairly strong.
[01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:50.700]   That's not always the case.
[01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:53.140]   And of course, here's where we're guessing,
[01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:55.740]   is California real estate gonna stay California real estate?
[01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:57.700]   Is New York real estate gonna stay New York real estate?
[01:05:57.700 --> 01:05:58.780]   We don't know.
[01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:01.020]   But generally, these areas
[01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:03.860]   have a pretty good insulation around them.
[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:05.020]   People like to live there
[01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:07.020]   because of the lifestyle associated with it,
[01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:09.160]   and they're not anxious to move.
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:11.420]   And I think that's the case in many places.
[01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:14.340]   I think that if you went to the average New Yorker,
[01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:17.940]   and you said, "Would you like to move from New York City
[01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:20.980]   "to Biloxi, Mississippi?
[01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:24.760]   "And would you like to trade your postage stamp house
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:29.760]   "that costs you $900,000 for an enormous mansion,
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:33.420]   "an enormous mansion on the lake that costs you $450,000?"
[01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:35.380]   Most of them would probably say no,
[01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:37.420]   because they like the lifestyle associated
[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:39.740]   with New York City more than they like the lifestyle
[01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:41.300]   in Biloxi, Mississippi.
[01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:44.020]   And I think the same thing applies across the country.
[01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:46.100]   Most people, they like where they live.
[01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:47.700]   If not, they would probably leave.
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:49.180]   And so if you like where you live,
[01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:50.640]   then you're gonna be stuck
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.340]   with whatever that market returns to you.
[01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:54.060]   But from a financial perspective,
[01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:57.500]   if you buy a house for $500,000 to $700,000,
[01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:59.700]   and the housing market stays strong,
[01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:02.200]   then it'll often increase even more.
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.920]   And I think that another thing I'd point out
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.840]   is that when you have a high housing market,
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:07.680]   it's probably because there's a lot of money.
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:08.680]   And when there's a lot of money,
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:10.440]   it means that when you're higher in the market,
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:13.040]   in some cases, I think you have more protection.
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:14.800]   Because when there's a recession,
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:16.200]   rich people don't generally,
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:19.280]   rich, high-income earning people don't generally suffer
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:21.440]   in a recession as much as poor people do.
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:24.360]   And so I wouldn't be scared to upgrade the house
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:27.600]   if it, just from a value perspective.
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:28.760]   I wouldn't be scared from,
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:29.980]   oh, am I making a bad decision
[01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:34.140]   to move from a $400,000 house to a $600,000 house,
[01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:37.540]   because probably the $600,000 house is doing fine.
[01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:39.300]   Now, what you wanna really home in on
[01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:40.340]   is your opportunity cost.
[01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:41.660]   What are you giving up?
[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:44.060]   So the first thing that people usually will give up
[01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:45.660]   is they'll give up lifestyle.
[01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:48.380]   And so by lifestyle, I mean number of square feet.
[01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:49.860]   Let's say that you move to New York City,
[01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:51.740]   and you've got four children.
[01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:54.660]   You don't expect to move to New York City with four children
[01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:57.180]   and be able to afford a comfortable four-bedroom,
[01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:59.600]   three-bath house with a half acre of land.
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:00.980]   That's just not the New York lifestyle.
[01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:02.520]   You don't live that way.
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:04.360]   You're gonna get cramped into a little apartment,
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:09.360]   and you go to the park for your entertainment.
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.840]   You don't have the lifestyle.
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:13.360]   That same family with four children
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:15.560]   can move to the suburbs of Texas
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:17.560]   and have a really great lifestyle there,
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:21.000]   but they're not gonna expect that in New York.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.080]   And so what people give up when prices go up
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:26.320]   is they give up lifestyle with regard to space.
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:30.640]   They give up lifestyle with regard to space.
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:31.780]   I don't have another answer to the space.
[01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:33.500]   You give up, you go to a smaller place,
[01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.200]   smaller yard, et cetera.
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:37.520]   And so ask yourself if you're willing to do that.
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:40.880]   If you're not, yeah, you might need to go to another place,
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:42.300]   but if you're not gonna go to another place,
[01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:43.140]   it is what it is.
[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:44.740]   The market is the market.
[01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:45.660]   The other thing you wanna think about
[01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:48.300]   is what am I giving up in terms of lifestyle
[01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:51.700]   if I took this, sorry, what's the opportunity cost
[01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:53.140]   if I move up in-house?
[01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:56.220]   So if I move up to a $500,000 to $700,000 house,
[01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:59.620]   and my mortgage goes up commensurately,
[01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:02.420]   then am I not doing something else?
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:03.980]   Am I not buying a rental property?
[01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:06.580]   Am I not investing in something that I wanna invest in?
[01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:09.060]   Is there a cost associated for me there?
[01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:11.100]   If you're well-employed, you're happy with your job,
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:12.840]   and you say, "I just wanna go ahead and move up,"
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:14.620]   you can do that, but I wouldn't move up
[01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:16.500]   if it's costing you the ability to do something else
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:17.700]   that's important to you.
[01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:19.620]   I think the most obvious solution for you
[01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:22.880]   is to simply go from taking a 15-year mortgage
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:24.340]   to a 30-year mortgage.
[01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:25.820]   And if you don't wanna do that,
[01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:28.460]   then stay put in the smaller place.
[01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:32.260]   If you have one child who's less than one-year-old-ish,
[01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:34.140]   you don't need any space, right?
[01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:35.940]   Your child is not even walking yet.
[01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:37.220]   You don't really need any space,
[01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:39.820]   and you don't need any space right now.
[01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:41.600]   There's a change that happens, I would say,
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:45.220]   somewhere around maybe four, four to five years old,
[01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:48.260]   where your children, and there's a change that happens
[01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:49.820]   probably around three children,
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:51.140]   where now all of a sudden,
[01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:53.140]   more space becomes really valuable.
[01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:55.380]   Your two-year-old, you can have the biggest yard
[01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:57.260]   on the block, your two-year-old won't play in it, right?
[01:09:57.260 --> 01:09:58.960]   They wanna be right inside, right next to mommy.
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:00.940]   They wanna be inside, they wanna be with you.
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:02.220]   And so the yard doesn't matter.
[01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:04.100]   And if you're gonna go out and play with them in the yard,
[01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:07.300]   then you might as well just go to the local park
[01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:09.380]   and walk down the street 'cause you've gotta be there.
[01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:11.300]   That's very different if you have a five-year-old
[01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:14.020]   and a six-year-old, because now your five-year-old
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:15.940]   and a six-year-old can go play in the yard by themselves.
[01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:18.360]   And so the yard is more helpful at those points
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:20.580]   than it is necessarily right now.
[01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:23.220]   So if you wanna wait, I think you're fine with waiting
[01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:24.460]   and saving more money.
[01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:27.360]   I don't see any reason not to take out a 30-year mortgage.
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:30.340]   If you, and it gives you more safety
[01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:31.820]   and may allow you to provide,
[01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:33.500]   it may provide you with a better lifestyle.
[01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.780]   So if your family's upgrading in lifestyle
[01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:40.780]   and you are gonna really find this house to be valuable,
[01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:42.820]   the house is gonna be valuable
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:46.900]   when your children are from four to, I guess, 18, right?
[01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:48.660]   17, 16, that's the point in the time
[01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:50.340]   where it's gonna be really valuable.
[01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:52.180]   So if you have a 15-year mortgage
[01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:53.740]   and you buy this bigger house,
[01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:57.140]   so from when your children are four to 17 or 18,
[01:10:57.140 --> 01:10:58.780]   what's the point of having it paid off
[01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:01.980]   when your children are 19 years old?
[01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:03.860]   At that point in time, your need for the house
[01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:05.080]   is probably gonna be less.
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:07.860]   And so go ahead and if you need to,
[01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:09.740]   use the 30-year mortgage to allow you
[01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:11.500]   to move into the bigger house comfortably,
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:12.900]   where it's not a strain,
[01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:14.940]   live in the house during that period of time,
[01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:17.460]   and then pay off the mortgage by selling the house
[01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:19.540]   when your children are out of the house
[01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:21.940]   and buying a smaller house again,
[01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:23.420]   now that it's just you and your wife.
[01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:25.420]   I don't see any downside to getting the 30-year mortgage
[01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:26.660]   instead of the 15-year mortgage.
[01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:27.900]   And in fact, I think the opposite.
[01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:31.300]   I think that the opportunity cost of the 15-year mortgage
[01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:33.940]   can sometimes be really expensive.
[01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:34.780]   In the United States,
[01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:36.940]   the whole real estate market runs on debt.
[01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:39.920]   And the debt is easy to get, it's low interest rate,
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.740]   it's safe debt, it's fixed,
[01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:44.260]   and so you're safer in almost every situation
[01:11:44.260 --> 01:11:45.980]   by getting the 30-year mortgage.
[01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:48.340]   And if you wanna pay it like a 15, pay it like a 15,
[01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:49.900]   but I'd rather you get the 30-year
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:51.500]   and then buy another rental property.
[01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:53.700]   Or get the 30-year, live in it for 15 years,
[01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:54.900]   and then sell it and then downgrade,
[01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:55.820]   or do something like that.
[01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:59.420]   I don't see the really strong arguments
[01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:01.120]   for the 15-year mortgage myself.
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:05.480]   Did that clear anything up or help at all?
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:07.780]   - It does, it does.
[01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:11.340]   We never intended to be moving this quickly.
[01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:14.380]   It's just been a lifestyle change this year.
[01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:16.780]   I mean, of course, the kid's not gonna benefit now.
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:20.780]   A lot of it comes from my wife has an immune condition,
[01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:23.020]   so she's basically been housebound
[01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:24.700]   and is now working from home,
[01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:28.300]   and we never intended to have a setup for that.
[01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:33.740]   - Could you put a shed in the backyard
[01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:36.060]   or fix the work problem in some other way?
[01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:42.500]   - No, no, that's the other big stressor has been,
[01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:46.380]   and this is completely our lifestyle decision,
[01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:48.220]   we've got two big dogs and have a tiny yard.
[01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:50.100]   We didn't intend to do that when we bought the house.
[01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:53.620]   So we've made some choices that have accelerated
[01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:56.180]   us growing out of this house.
[01:12:56.180 --> 01:12:57.380]   We're not completely there yet.
[01:12:57.380 --> 01:12:58.980]   We're looking kind of casually at this point
[01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:01.940]   and trying to be prudent and plan this out
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:04.700]   and consider the different angles.
[01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:09.700]   And I guess struggling with the reality of the market
[01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:14.460]   is just our big hiccup right now,
[01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:16.140]   'cause we can make arguments.
[01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:17.580]   - Self waste.
[01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:19.580]   - And trying to come down to,
[01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:24.300]   are we being foolish to decide to do this lifestyle thing?
[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:26.660]   The only reason we had been so hesitant
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:31.180]   to move forward on the mortgage,
[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:35.860]   the financing changes,
[01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:37.620]   not because we'll be looking at it
[01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:39.500]   outside of financing at that point, right?
[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:42.540]   It's to be able to have the security of the lower payment.
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:46.140]   And at this point we save 100% of my wife's income
[01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:49.060]   and I love being able to preserve the opportunity
[01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:51.460]   for her to choose if she's working or not.
[01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:54.660]   We don't wanna be in a position where that's not an option.
[01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:55.860]   As we have more children,
[01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:58.620]   I want her to be able to decide if she wants to work or not.
[01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:00.820]   The fact that we went through a pandemic,
[01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:02.220]   being able to say, yeah,
[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:04.340]   if she chooses to quit her job
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:06.500]   because they're forcing her to come in in person,
[01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:08.540]   like, yeah, whatever, no big deal.
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:09.820]   She'll find a job later.
[01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:15.500]   That flexibility has been so worth it,
[01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:18.060]   this year especially.
[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:23.020]   And so that financing change would be
[01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:26.180]   to keep that level of flexibility in our lives
[01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:28.780]   moving forward with increasing lifestyle.
[01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:29.620]   - Right.
[01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:32.860]   Are you working from the house too during the pandemic?
[01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:35.500]   - No, no, I'm not.
[01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:37.460]   - How close is your house to your work?
[01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:40.780]   - I travel for work.
[01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:43.980]   So I am all over the state of Washington,
[01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:45.820]   but always home at night.
[01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:47.580]   So I'm paid to commute.
[01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:49.780]   It's kind of an interesting situation.
[01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:51.460]   - Is your wife or your family
[01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:53.460]   very close to where you live right now?
[01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:55.580]   - Not at all.
[01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:59.580]   - Then what if you just went more east, right?
[01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:01.060]   What if you went inland a little bit?
[01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:02.980]   Because if she's working from home,
[01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:06.020]   and I expect that in most cases,
[01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:09.700]   that can continue to be negotiated in the future.
[01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:11.140]   But if she's working from home,
[01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:12.340]   what if you head east a little bit
[01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:14.140]   where prices are not so significant?
[01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:16.780]   - She won't be, she'll be back.
[01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:19.820]   She teaches public school, so she's online right now,
[01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:23.380]   but next year is anticipating being back with her team.
[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:24.500]   - Yeah, I wouldn't give up.
[01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:28.220]   I mean, you know my opinions if you've listened to the show.
[01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:29.900]   I would not give up.
[01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:32.420]   First of all, if we're saving 100% of my wife's income,
[01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:34.700]   I would keep saving 100% of my wife's income.
[01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:39.240]   I would not dedicate her income to lifestyle costs.
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:40.580]   If we can do it from my income,
[01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:43.340]   if I can increase my income and do it from that, fine,
[01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:45.140]   but I wouldn't dedicate her income to that
[01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:47.860]   because that makes it so easy.
[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:51.580]   If she decides that, hey, I do wanna be a full-time mom,
[01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:53.900]   that makes it so easy because you know,
[01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:55.860]   yeah, we don't need your income to pay our bills.
[01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:57.460]   We're gonna be totally fine.
[01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:01.340]   And with one new baby, with her working from home,
[01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:05.120]   she's experiencing one set of conditions.
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:06.820]   If you have two or three children,
[01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:08.140]   things change dramatically.
[01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:11.300]   One child, you can afford the daycare, right?
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:13.740]   You can afford those kinds of,
[01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:16.300]   the expenses associated with that with one child.
[01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:19.220]   If you move to three and if she's a public school teacher,
[01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:21.260]   the financial argument for her to work,
[01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:23.260]   if you have three children versus one,
[01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:25.540]   that financial argument totally falls apart.
[01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:27.500]   And you're far better off as a family
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.060]   from a lifestyle perspective
[01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:32.980]   with the ability for her to be a full-time mom
[01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:35.060]   than you are with her working and earning,
[01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:37.820]   you know, 40 to $60,000 as a school teacher.
[01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:39.380]   And then trying to figure out
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:40.580]   how to take care of the three children.
[01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:44.940]   And so with those details, I would encourage you to punt,
[01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:47.900]   figure out if there's a temporary solution, right?
[01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:49.940]   She's not gonna be working from home forever.
[01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:52.480]   You have one child who's less than one year old.
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:54.260]   Your child is not gonna use the yard.
[01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:55.840]   The dogs will and you're gonna be out there
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:58.100]   with your poop bags, you know, keeping the yard up.
[01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:00.980]   But whatever, maybe it gets you out walking at night.
[01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:03.860]   But so that's annoying, but you made that choice.
[01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:07.200]   I would punt and I would punt a couple of years
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:10.740]   with the idea being that once she learns
[01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:12.340]   what it's like to be a mom,
[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:14.780]   and if you have another baby,
[01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:17.900]   if you travel for work, then it should be fair,
[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:19.820]   and your mom is not five minutes away
[01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:22.540]   or her dad is not around the corner.
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:24.740]   We can just come over and take care of the baby anytime.
[01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:28.100]   Then I think that would be an obvious solution for you
[01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:30.100]   instead of trying to stay in the inflated area
[01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:32.120]   where people have to be in that area for work.
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:35.940]   The obvious solution would be move further out
[01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:39.780]   in the suburbs, go ahead and get a place that's large,
[01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:42.840]   and even if you go up a little bit in price, that's fine,
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:44.200]   but go ahead and move out to the suburbs
[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:45.860]   where you can get a large place.
[01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:47.980]   Then you'll really have a lifestyle improvement
[01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:50.260]   because to go from a postage stamp yard
[01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:52.180]   to a slightly bigger than a postage stamp yard
[01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:53.520]   is not that big of a deal.
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:56.420]   But to go from a postage stamp yard to a couple of acres
[01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:58.720]   is a huge deal when you have a seven year old,
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:00.180]   a five year old, and a three year old.
[01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:03.220]   And then if she's a full time mom and you travel for work,
[01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:05.640]   then in that situation, there's no reason
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:08.060]   why you can't build a much better lifestyle
[01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:12.180]   being 45 minutes east, which would just change everything
[01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:14.820]   for you in terms of these costs
[01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:19.380]   versus trying to be 10 minutes outside of where you are now.
[01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:20.200]   So that's what I would do.
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:21.700]   I would punt and I would wait a little bit
[01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:22.980]   to let things develop.
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:27.380]   - Yeah, yeah, that's the direction,
[01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:28.900]   the type of house we're moving.
[01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:31.660]   I guess when I say a little towards the area
[01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:35.580]   where there's a couple rural pockets in the area.
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:38.660]   Still, and so a little further outside of the city,
[01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:41.100]   but not crazy far is the type of thing
[01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:44.220]   we're looking at now, 'cause that's where we are wanting
[01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:47.480]   to be in the future.
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:52.180]   So thanks for the input.
[01:18:52.180 --> 01:18:56.020]   Are there any indicator signs you can think of
[01:18:56.020 --> 01:19:01.020]   to pay attention to as far as the general market goes?
[01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:04.380]   I guess in the back of our minds is we have been
[01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:08.900]   on such a, I don't know, full market applies to housing too,
[01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:12.660]   but housing's just exploded here in the past couple years.
[01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:15.700]   And we do have the concern in the backs of our minds
[01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:17.860]   is there anything we can look towards
[01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:21.200]   for early warning signs, especially as we progress
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:25.620]   through a lot of these government mandated rental
[01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:29.780]   and eviction and foreclosure scenario
[01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:31.260]   that we're in right now.
[01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:33.260]   - I don't understand what's happening
[01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:35.340]   in the real estate market in the United States right now.
[01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:36.620]   I do not understand it.
[01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:40.820]   And I've followed it, but I get reports
[01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:43.500]   from people all across.
[01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:46.580]   For example, my understanding is that rural properties
[01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:48.620]   are selling like crazy.
[01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:53.020]   Even if you move to rural Washington or rural Oregon,
[01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:55.500]   rural properties are selling like crazy.
[01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:58.180]   I'm hearing that even vacation properties,
[01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:00.340]   lake properties are selling like crazy.
[01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:03.020]   I got a client of mine who's trying to buy a house
[01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:05.940]   on a lake in the central Michigan.
[01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:08.860]   And he can't get a house accepted.
[01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:13.860]   In many markets in South Florida, everything is nuts.
[01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:17.540]   There's no decrease in prices and houses are selling
[01:20:17.540 --> 01:20:19.940]   with full offers on exactly the same day.
[01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:21.980]   And I don't know where the demand is coming from.
[01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:24.820]   I'm totally confused right now by what's happening
[01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.540]   in the real estate market in the United States.
[01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:29.340]   And so what I would say is, my only advice is,
[01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:31.060]   don't try to worry about the whole country.
[01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:34.500]   Worry about your neighborhood, your town,
[01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:37.100]   and figure out what's happening in my town.
[01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:39.700]   If there's a big tech company
[01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:41.340]   that is your biggest employment option,
[01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:44.060]   that tech company is not losing right now.
[01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:46.580]   Whereas if you're competing with people
[01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:50.860]   who are blue collar workers whose businesses got shut down,
[01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:54.300]   then you can expect that things to pull through.
[01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:56.360]   But it feels to me like right now,
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:58.460]   the whole country is just kind of sitting
[01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:01.060]   and waiting to see what happens with the election.
[01:21:01.060 --> 01:21:02.420]   And I don't know what's gonna change
[01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:03.540]   with the election one way or the other,
[01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:06.220]   but I don't understand it, I guess is the best thing.
[01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:07.660]   You have to look at your local market.
[01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:08.780]   I don't understand what's happening
[01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:10.220]   across the whole country at the moment.
[01:21:10.220 --> 01:21:11.320]   Enough to speak on it.
[01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:14.340]   - Yeah, us either.
[01:21:14.340 --> 01:21:19.340]   It's a little odd and not what we're used
[01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:21.220]   to seeing historically.
[01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:23.180]   So it's got us a little uncomfortable too.
[01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:24.420]   - Yeah, cool.
[01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:27.040]   Well, I think that, like I said, in your situation,
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:30.540]   I think everybody, all the signs in my opinion are punt.
[01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:32.940]   And I think that with a new baby, just punt.
[01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:33.900]   Punt for a little while.
[01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:37.260]   Your wife is gonna learn a lot over the next couple of,
[01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:38.780]   over the months in the year.
[01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:41.580]   And one baby, two babies, three babies,
[01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:44.260]   those are big changes in her lifestyle
[01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:46.420]   and big changes with the employment situation.
[01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:48.300]   And so I would not commit myself to something
[01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:51.820]   that requires her income for us to flourish
[01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:53.820]   in that kind of situation.
[01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:54.900]   We move on to Andy in Indiana.
[01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:55.720]   Welcome, sir.
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:57.260]   What's the interview today?
[01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:58.100]   - Hey, Joshua.
[01:21:58.100 --> 01:21:59.260]   Thanks for taking my call.
[01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:01.300]   I actually didn't have a question in particular.
[01:22:01.300 --> 01:22:05.860]   I was just calling to make a comment about home mortgages.
[01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:09.060]   Your audience is pretty savvy,
[01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:11.660]   so probably everybody else is ahead of me on this,
[01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.660]   but I'm in the process of refinancing
[01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:17.800]   all of the real estate debt that I have
[01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:19.940]   and rates are, I think, crazy low.
[01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:22.020]   And I was able to just tell them
[01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:24.660]   that my house I bought a year ago has gone up 15%.
[01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:26.780]   And they said, "That sounds about right,"
[01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:31.660]   and gave me a, I'm blanking on the word,
[01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:34.380]   but a waiver where I don't have to get it appraised.
[01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:35.500]   - Great. - Appraisal waiver.
[01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:39.000]   And saved 500 bucks on closing costs that way.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.460]   So it just seems like a really great time
[01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:42.580]   to be refinancing or at least considering that
[01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:45.340]   for any real estate debt.
[01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:46.420]   - That's a great tip.
[01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:48.780]   And definitely, I think that right now,
[01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:53.180]   the idea of refinancing is certainly worth doing.
[01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:56.180]   I don't predict any kind of exploding interest rates,
[01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:57.700]   but when you have the opportunity
[01:22:57.700 --> 01:22:59.660]   to borrow money at the current rates,
[01:22:59.660 --> 01:23:03.700]   if you can borrow money, and again, markets are high,
[01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:06.460]   if you can borrow that money on a home mortgage,
[01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:07.820]   even if you put the money in the bank
[01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:09.560]   and wait and see what happens,
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:11.780]   I think that's a very reasonable situation.
[01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:13.180]   If you've got a goal of paying off the house,
[01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:15.340]   obviously, follow your plan.
[01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:18.480]   But I have certainly encouraged a number of people,
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:20.140]   refinance the house, take the money,
[01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:20.980]   and just sit and wait,
[01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:24.300]   and wait for some investment opportunities to appear.
[01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:27.460]   Because the opportunity cost on doing that is so low.
[01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:28.940]   If you take the money out and you say,
[01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:30.420]   "I'm gonna buy a rental house,"
[01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:33.060]   or whatever you're doing with the money that's profitable,
[01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:34.620]   right, don't spend it necessarily.
[01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:35.460]   But if whatever you're doing,
[01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:38.400]   and you leave it in the bank for two years,
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:39.760]   you calculate the interest cost
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:41.380]   that you'll spend from doing that,
[01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:42.780]   and you say, "No deals emerged,
[01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:44.060]   "we'll just pay down the mortgage again."
[01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:47.500]   But the cost of doing that right now is very, very low.
[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:49.560]   And I think it's well worth doing for the average person.
[01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:51.700]   - Thanks for the tip, Andy, appreciate it.
[01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:53.420]   - And the other comment I was gonna make,
[01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:54.860]   I don't know if you saw this,
[01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:57.660]   but I saw with the CARES Act,
[01:23:57.660 --> 01:24:02.660]   the first national moratorium on eviction for late rent
[01:24:02.660 --> 01:24:09.780]   was based on if that house had a federally subsidized,
[01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:12.980]   anything involved with it,
[01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:15.660]   which included a mortgage owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.
[01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:17.860]   So where I'm refinancing to,
[01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:21.440]   I'll be going from being owned by Freddie Mae, Freddie Mac,
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:25.720]   to a local bank owning and servicing those mortgages,
[01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:29.100]   which, not that I had a problem with that,
[01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:31.080]   but that kind of makes me happy to get that as well.
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:32.640]   I just noticed that as I've been reading
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:33.520]   about real estate lately,
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:35.900]   and didn't know if others had seen that.
[01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:39.880]   - So is what you're saying that you are potentially
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:41.200]   losing some of the protection
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:42.760]   that the CARES Act was providing,
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:46.040]   because you're going from a Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac loan
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:47.140]   to a private loan?
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.720]   - Sorry, so I, as a landlord, as I understand it,
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:54.700]   'cause the houses were owned by,
[01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:58.000]   the mortgages on my rental houses
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.620]   were owned by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac,
[01:24:59.620 --> 01:25:02.680]   the CARES Act prohibited me from evicting,
[01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:05.240]   which didn't matter to me, but it did.
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:07.960]   And then if this is owned by a private bank,
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:09.540]   that CARES Act, which has now,
[01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:10.880]   that provision has now expired.
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:13.320]   But if they did that again, I would be out from under it.
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:14.560]   - That is a great point.
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:15.820]   Now I understand it's for a rental,
[01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:17.160]   not for your personal residence.
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:19.920]   So now as a landlord, you have more protection,
[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:23.360]   because now you're not dealing with the government
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:25.600]   as a lender, you're dealing with a private entity.
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:28.240]   And so unless your state passes
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:30.360]   some kind of broad-based moratorium
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:31.720]   that applies to private lenders,
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:33.080]   you're protected from the federal action.
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:34.040]   Great point, Andy, I love it.
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:34.880]   Good move.
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:38.080]   - Cool. - All right, well,
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:38.900]   that was all I had.
[01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:39.740]   Thank you. - Awesome.
[01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:40.580]   Appreciate the input.
[01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:41.400]   All right, final call of the day.
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:43.640]   We go to, it says Grand Prairie.
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:44.480]   I can't see where that is.
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:45.320]   Michigan, I can't remember.
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:46.960]   Is that Minnesota, Michigan?
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:48.520]   My screen is blank. - Texas.
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:49.360]   - Texas, oh, there we go.
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:52.320]   - It's actually Fort Worth, Texas.
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:54.640]   - Welcome, sir, how can I serve you today?
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:55.680]   - Hi, Josh.
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:59.200]   Your podcast on the New York Times article was fascinating,
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:02.240]   and the way you were able to provide clear insights
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:05.520]   into various tax features and practices,
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:08.860]   and just the mindset one should have towards tax planning.
[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:11.600]   - Thank you. - But my question
[01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:15.000]   goes to some of the pieces I have trouble
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:20.000]   connecting the dots on is things like on whose tax return
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:25.080]   do things like business expenses, losses, depreciation,
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:28.840]   get reported beyond anything that's a sole proprietorship?
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:31.800]   And so we talked about, you talked about Trump's 500
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:35.860]   companies, and so I didn't quite understand
[01:26:35.860 --> 01:26:39.400]   how are Trump's losses in business entities,
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:41.640]   these losses that we talked a lot about,
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:45.080]   how are those making it onto his personal return,
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:50.080]   or reducing his personal income,
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:53.680]   and am I even getting that part of it wrong?
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:58.560]   - Yeah, so it's hard because we're dealing
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:01.080]   with a newspaper article, not the returns,
[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:05.660]   would be my basic approach, and I don't know the answer.
[01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:09.220]   So let me just start with I don't know,
[01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:12.600]   because I'm not competent enough from the newspaper article
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:15.920]   to know all of those questions.
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:18.400]   When, for example, they say he has 500 companies,
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:22.400]   we don't know, I don't know whether those companies,
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:24.580]   what the structure is of those companies,
[01:27:24.580 --> 01:27:27.840]   and how each of them is being taxed.
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:29.560]   Obviously each of them can be a number of,
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:32.160]   can be different structures.
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:35.000]   So they could be pass-through entities,
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.980]   in which, and thus if they're pass-through entities,
[01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:42.720]   then the taxes roll up to the parent organization.
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:44.560]   So if you have your company A,
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:49.560]   and you have subsidiary B and subsidiary C,
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:51.960]   but if subsidiary B and subsidiary C
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:53.780]   are pass-through entities,
[01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:57.080]   then the losses of the profits roll up to company A.
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:58.920]   And so that makes sense, right?
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:02.680]   If Berkshire Hathaway has a loss on Furniture Mart,
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:05.920]   then Berkshire Hathaway is netting that loss
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:07.820]   against the other businesses.
[01:28:07.820 --> 01:28:11.280]   And I don't know the extent to which,
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:13.760]   I don't know the extent to which,
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:15.840]   how his actual companies are structured.
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:17.720]   I doubt the New York Times reporters
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:19.520]   fully understand it as well.
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:21.920]   I mean, it's obviously incredibly complex.
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:26.320]   I don't know, I don't know the answer to that fully.
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:27.480]   I think the important thing,
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:29.600]   that I feel like I glossed over it too much,
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:32.280]   the important thing is not to minimize,
[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:34.440]   when you look at Trump's taxes,
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:38.340]   is that, is not to minimize how big of a deal
[01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:42.540]   his ability to take advantage of that 2009 tax credit was,
[01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:45.400]   that he had a huge amount of taxable income,
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.940]   but because that tax credit was passed,
[01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:50.020]   where instead of his losses being limited
[01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:51.820]   to being deducted over the last two years,
[01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:53.440]   but they could look back,
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:58.440]   then that allowed him to wipe out the big portion of taxes.
[01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:02.080]   With regard to his, you know, the last couple of years,
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:04.420]   what I would say is that probably,
[01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:06.820]   the Times article led me to believe
[01:29:06.820 --> 01:29:09.820]   that just simply his businesses are eating up cash,
[01:29:09.820 --> 01:29:11.960]   and he was getting cash by refinancing.
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:14.740]   And so that's the clear picture they made.
[01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:16.740]   And the point I tried to, that they painted,
[01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:18.580]   and the point I tried to make was,
[01:29:18.580 --> 01:29:21.020]   we don't know whether President Trump
[01:29:21.020 --> 01:29:23.100]   is actually a great businessman,
[01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:26.020]   and his businesses are just doing swimmingly,
[01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:28.480]   and these losses are merely paper losses
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:32.880]   that are offset by other gains in other places, right?
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:35.680]   We don't know if maybe he bought this awesome deal,
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:38.480]   he bought this golf course for $50 million,
[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:40.400]   but in the last three years,
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:43.600]   although he's poured $30 million a year into it,
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:47.040]   and it's thus creating giant losses for him,
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:50.960]   it actually magically became worth $500 million
[01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:52.000]   over the last three years.
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.620]   We don't know if that's true,
[01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:56.520]   or if he's just simply a mediocre businessman,
[01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:58.520]   and these losses are real losses,
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:01.240]   and he is actually scrambling,
[01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:03.540]   like the Times article led us to believe,
[01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:04.640]   that he's scrambling and saying,
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:05.720]   "How can we cover the debt?"
[01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:07.840]   The data is unclear.
[01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:10.020]   And so what I would say is that
[01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:13.040]   while it's impressive planning
[01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:18.040]   that he has been able to reduce his taxable income so low,
[01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:21.000]   that's not to say that that's always the best move,
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:24.040]   because we don't know whether he's actually, again,
[01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:25.400]   a mediocre businessman,
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:27.760]   or whether these are just paper losses.
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:30.720]   So how it's structured, I don't know.
[01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:32.000]   What I would say is that
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.520]   because the vast majority of his empire is real estate,
[01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:38.540]   then there's a parent corporation
[01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:40.400]   or a parent holding company
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:43.840]   that is where the taxes are being paid at the entity level,
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:45.400]   and they're netting the losses against it.
[01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:47.360]   And also with him being very clearly
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:50.320]   a full-time real estate professional,
[01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:57.480]   he can deduct his losses against any other type of income.
[01:30:57.480 --> 01:31:00.840]   And that's something that is available to
[01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:02.880]   a full-time real estate professional.
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:04.320]   That if you are classified
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:06.340]   as a full-time real estate professional,
[01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:08.860]   then you can deduct 100% of your losses
[01:31:08.860 --> 01:31:10.440]   against your ordinary income.
[01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:12.820]   And so if he was earning ordinary income
[01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:13.920]   from his work with a show,
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:16.520]   if NBC was paying him ordinary income
[01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:19.200]   of whatever the price was,
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:21.280]   then, or if his entity,
[01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:22.680]   where he was doing the apprentice through,
[01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:24.880]   was paying him ordinary income,
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:27.480]   because he is a real estate professional,
[01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:29.640]   he can deduct his real estate losses
[01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:31.360]   against that ordinary income.
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:33.920]   Most people don't qualify as a real estate professional,
[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:34.880]   but he clearly does.
[01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:37.960]   And so that would be the other kind of important part
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:41.200]   that would work in that situation.
[01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:42.360]   And so the way you can set that up--
[01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:44.360]   - So that look back,
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:47.560]   the look back then worked on real estate losses
[01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:49.020]   or those business losses?
[01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:50.320]   - I think so, I think so.
[01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:53.360]   - He's going against his personal income
[01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:56.400]   strictly because of that, he's in that industry.
[01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:57.500]   - I think so, yes.
[01:31:57.500 --> 01:32:00.720]   And again, I'm not the world's greatest tax expert.
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:02.040]   I do my very best,
[01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:03.740]   but I wanna always proceed with,
[01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:05.800]   there are people way smarter than me.
[01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:07.560]   I'm just probably one of the few people
[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:10.280]   that publish it, that talks publicly about this stuff.
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:11.720]   But I try to understand it,
[01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:13.240]   and I try to share my understanding with you.
[01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:16.120]   But yes, it's because of his real estate professional status
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:18.840]   that he was able to expand,
[01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:23.840]   when they passed the 2008 expansion of losses,
[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:27.640]   then that allowed him to wipe out the profit.
[01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:30.080]   Because basically, as a real estate professional,
[01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:32.800]   here's what I understood, kind of speaking big picture.
[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:36.480]   President Trump doesn't generally make that much income.
[01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:37.740]   He doesn't usually do that,
[01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:40.480]   because he started with money,
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:42.960]   and then most of his income
[01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:46.920]   has come through developing projects and renting them out.
[01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:50.080]   But he's primarily trying to spend capital gains.
[01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:53.040]   And so he's done most of his investing with debt.
[01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:54.920]   That was what he clearly talked about
[01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:55.800]   in "The Art of the Deal," right?
[01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:56.920]   He was a billion dollars in debt,
[01:32:56.920 --> 01:32:59.820]   and he turned to whichever wife he was married to
[01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:01.360]   at the time, and he said,
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:02.640]   "That bum on the street over there
[01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:04.680]   "has a billion dollars more than I do."
[01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:06.440]   So that was his famous story.
[01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:08.420]   And so most of his income,
[01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:10.240]   sorry, most of his business activities
[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:11.160]   are financed by debt.
[01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:13.360]   That's common in the real estate space.
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:14.920]   He inherited some money.
[01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:17.240]   He used that money for personal expenses,
[01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:19.200]   but then most of his work is with debt.
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:20.220]   And so if you imagine yourself
[01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:22.480]   that you're a real estate developer, what do you do?
[01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:24.300]   Well, you finance the project,
[01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:25.640]   you oversee the work,
[01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:27.680]   and then you refinance the project.
[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:29.380]   And with the refinancing,
[01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:31.420]   you take your profits from the refinance,
[01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:32.500]   no taxable income,
[01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:34.560]   because you're taking a profit from a refinance,
[01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:36.160]   and you're hoping in time
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:38.900]   that the property will appreciate in value.
[01:33:38.900 --> 01:33:40.840]   And if you do this right,
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:43.220]   you have enough money from the refinance
[01:33:43.220 --> 01:33:44.600]   for you to live on,
[01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:46.760]   and thus you don't have taxable income
[01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:48.320]   'cause you're taking out loans.
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:49.760]   But your business,
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:52.100]   the rents that you're receiving from your tenants
[01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:54.000]   are sufficient to cover the mortgages,
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.120]   to cover the notes,
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:57.320]   and you might get a little bit of profit on the top,
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:33:58.500]   but probably not a ton,
[01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:01.180]   especially by the time you bring in depreciation expenses.
[01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:03.720]   So you shelter most of your current profit,
[01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:05.240]   and then your big wins,
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:06.400]   if there are any big wins,
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:07.960]   will come from appreciation,
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:11.000]   which you'll realize when you sell the property.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.400]   So it's very easy for a real estate developer
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:15.400]   to live a very tax-efficient lifestyle
[01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:16.560]   because most of the time,
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:17.760]   the money that they're spending
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:20.360]   for their personal consumption is debt.
[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:23.200]   And they're keeping their portfolio,
[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:25.640]   and thus avoiding incurring capital gains taxes
[01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:27.160]   on the sale of the portfolio.
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:30.800]   Now, what business was that he was involved in changed that?
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:32.880]   Well, his success was The Apprentice, right?
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:34.280]   He had other endeavors.
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:35.500]   He had the stakes.
[01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:37.180]   He had the beauty pageant.
[01:34:37.180 --> 01:34:39.240]   But in my reading about those,
[01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:42.400]   most of those have either been relatively small fish
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:44.840]   or relatively unsuccessful, right?
[01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:45.680]   They just weren't,
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:48.920]   the beauty pageant was a token thing that he liked to do
[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:51.680]   because it gave him a fun way to be this celebrity
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:54.180]   and to look at beautiful women.
[01:34:54.180 --> 01:34:56.080]   But it wasn't a big moneymaker.
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:57.920]   The moneymaker was The Apprentice.
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:34:59.640]   And so when The Apprentice came along,
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:02.800]   that created income that was just pure income
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:03.620]   from the profit.
[01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:05.000]   So that created a hundred,
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.580]   what was it, $400 million of profit
[01:35:08.580 --> 01:35:10.520]   over the course of the running of The Apprentice.
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:12.880]   And so that's what he wasn't able to shelter
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:14.760]   because it was actual profit.
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:16.720]   So when The Apprentice ended,
[01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:19.200]   that ended his cash generating businesses.
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:20.900]   And now he was back to real estate,
[01:35:20.900 --> 01:35:22.480]   which is very tax efficient.
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:25.240]   And then it was a stroke of luck for him
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:27.640]   that he had all these losses from real estate
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:32.260]   that hit that 2008 extension of the look back period.
[01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:33.640]   That was the stroke of luck for him
[01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:36.080]   for him to apply for that $70 million thing.
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:37.440]   And so you can't,
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:39.280]   I've never been able to figure out any way
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:43.760]   that an American can shelter $400 million of profit
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:45.800]   from a TV show.
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:48.920]   There's nothing available that's gonna shelter that.
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:52.000]   You can't also go and all of a sudden
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.840]   buy a bunch of real estate and have that work.
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:56.540]   But for him, he was a full-time real estate guy,
[01:35:56.540 --> 01:35:58.160]   very tax efficient business.
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:35:59.400]   And then he had this big hit
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:01.280]   and then he had a very fortuitous timing
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:02.200]   of that tax deduction.
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:05.220]   And that's the basic underpinnings of the story.
[01:36:05.220 --> 01:36:09.240]   - Okay, well, let me shift gears slightly
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:11.600]   and thinking about this in terms of,
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:17.320]   having our own business as you encourage us to do
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:21.380]   and thinking about starting a small business,
[01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:25.040]   at what point does one move
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:28.560]   from reporting business profit or loss
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:31.160]   through your personal tax return
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:36.160]   to the business entity filing a tax return?
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:41.160]   And then, well, yeah,
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:50.880]   I'm trying to resolve how losses credit to you personally
[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:58.720]   in that case versus to the business entity
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:03.960]   as a separate entity and taxing tax return, I guess.
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:07.140]   - So let's begin with what's deductible for a business
[01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:08.800]   versus what's deductible for real estate
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:10.140]   because that's important.
[01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:13.400]   The reason why President Trump can deduct
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:15.880]   his losses of real estate against his personal income
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:19.000]   is because he is a real estate professional.
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.120]   There are three classifications
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:22.840]   that the IRS uses for real estate.
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:25.120]   One is a passive investor.
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:26.600]   And so if you're a passive investor,
[01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:29.200]   you go and you buy your neighbor's house when they sell it
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:33.200]   and you own one house, then in that situation,
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:36.240]   you are only, wait, would that be a passive investor
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:37.460]   or an active investor?
[01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:40.480]   I need to check the rules on that,
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:43.080]   but let's just punt that.
[01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:45.080]   So if you're a passive investor,
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:47.000]   okay, so I think that this would be where
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.720]   if you go and you join,
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:51.800]   so let's say you join a local real estate investing club
[01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:55.440]   and you are investing in real estate,
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:56.840]   but simply as a passive investor,
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:57.980]   you're not active in the business,
[01:37:57.980 --> 01:38:00.600]   you're investing with a group, a consortium of people,
[01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:02.240]   but then you're a passive investor.
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:06.180]   In that situation, you can only deduct your passive losses
[01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:07.960]   against your passive gains.
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:09.680]   So your pals and your pags,
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:11.280]   which is how we remember it in the CFP, right?
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:14.120]   Your pals and your pags get put together.
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:16.360]   So losses, passive losses,
[01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:18.280]   only are deducted against passive gains.
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:20.680]   And this was a big deal when the tax code changed,
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:22.280]   I guess it was about the '80s,
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:24.280]   because previously people would go
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:26.320]   and they would invest in all kinds of,
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:29.280]   you know, an oil well and all these real estate projects.
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:31.360]   And the reason they did it, they would buy these,
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:33.320]   they would invest into a consortium,
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:35.720]   a company would put together a big real estate project,
[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:37.400]   and they would say, "Listen, if you buy this,
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:39.220]   "then we'll give you a tax shelter for it
[01:38:39.220 --> 01:38:40.360]   "because we're gonna lose money
[01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:42.400]   "by the time we bring in our depreciation expense
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:44.400]   "on our real estate or our depletion expense
[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:45.960]   "on our oil wells,
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:49.920]   "and so we're gonna report to you a passive loss."
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:52.240]   And at that time, you could net your passive losses
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:54.480]   against your other sources of income.
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:56.240]   And so the IRS changed all those rules,
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:58.280]   and forgive me, I'm just off the top of my head here,
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:38:59.540]   I would have to check the dates,
[01:38:59.540 --> 01:39:00.840]   but I think it was the '80s,
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:02.280]   and they have moved all of that.
[01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:04.040]   And so now your passive losses
[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:06.360]   have to get netted against your passive gains.
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:08.560]   And you can only deduct those passive losses
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:10.000]   to the extent that you have gains.
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.800]   So if you buy shares in an oil well,
[01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:16.440]   and your depletion expense exceeds your income,
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:20.600]   your depletion expense exceeds your profits,
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:22.880]   then you won't have any taxes due,
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:25.640]   but those passive losses have to sit there
[01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:29.420]   until that oil well or your other passive losses
[01:39:29.420 --> 01:39:30.720]   generate gains for you.
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:33.000]   So that's the first thing is a passive investor.
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.840]   Now, the second thing is an active investor.
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:37.880]   So here is where you buy your neighbor's house.
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:39.920]   And so as an active investor,
[01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:43.540]   you can deduct losses against ordinary income,
[01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:47.720]   but you can only deduct that up to a limit of $25,000.
[01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:49.760]   And that phases out at,
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:52.520]   it was like $150,000 of adjusted gross income
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:54.920]   for a married couple filing jointly,
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:57.580]   so $100,000 for an individual.
[01:39:57.580 --> 01:40:00.760]   So if you go and you become an active investor,
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:02.280]   you buy your neighbor's house.
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:05.760]   And if that neighbor's house generates a loss for you,
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:08.920]   where the costs of the property
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:11.940]   plus the depreciation expense exceed the profit,
[01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:13.080]   so you have a loss,
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:16.620]   you can net that up to $25,000 of losses
[01:40:16.620 --> 01:40:18.560]   against your ordinary income
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:22.200]   if your adjusted gross income is below $150,000
[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:23.700]   for a married couple filing jointly
[01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:26.160]   or $100,000 for a single individual.
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:28.940]   So that's if you're an active investor.
[01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:30.400]   Now, the third classification
[01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:32.680]   is to become a real estate professional.
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:35.160]   So if you become a real estate professional,
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:38.100]   then you can deduct all of your real estate losses
[01:40:38.100 --> 01:40:40.120]   against your ordinary income.
[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:41.680]   And so again, that's what Trump is doing.
[01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:43.700]   You can deduct all of your real estate losses
[01:40:43.700 --> 01:40:45.800]   against your ordinary income.
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:47.280]   And so what do you do in your household?
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:51.940]   Maybe you have an ordinary income of $500,000,
[01:40:51.940 --> 01:40:54.720]   but your wife is a full-time real estate professional.
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:56.680]   She qualifies as a full-time real estate professional.
[01:40:56.680 --> 01:40:58.280]   She spends the majority of her time
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:40:59.740]   in a real property business.
[01:40:59.740 --> 01:41:04.120]   She spends 750 hours or more per year in that business,
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:06.520]   and she materially participates in that business.
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:09.640]   So now, to the extent that your properties produce losses,
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:13.520]   you can net all of those losses against your earned income.
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:14.440]   So that's the real estate.
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:15.680]   Now let's pivot to business,
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:17.560]   and let's talk about business losses.
[01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:21.700]   So here, the type of ownership matters tremendously.
[01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:22.920]   At the simplest level,
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:24.560]   which I talked about earlier in the show,
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:29.560]   a sole proprietorship has the ability
[01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:36.440]   to deduct unlimited losses against ordinary income.
[01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:40.200]   And so you can deduct any loss in that
[01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:42.000]   against your ordinary income.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000]   An S corporation and a C corporation
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.120]   are limited to deducting their losses
[01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:48.560]   against the capital that's been contributed.
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:50.800]   So you can only deduct your,
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:56.120]   man, I wish I had a reference book in front of me.
[01:41:56.120 --> 01:42:00.920]   You can only deduct your losses
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:04.440]   against what's actually been contributed to the company,
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:08.000]   and against your actual adjusted basis.
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:12.100]   So you can't start an S corporation or a C corporation,
[01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:14.140]   lose a million dollars in those,
[01:42:14.140 --> 01:42:15.600]   and then use that to offset
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:17.580]   your other million dollars of earned income.
[01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:20.120]   You can only use that to reduce you
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:22.320]   up to your basis that you put into it.
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:26.120]   And I can't, since I don't work with it every day,
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:28.160]   I can't do any better than that right at the moment,
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:29.560]   just off the top of my head.
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:30.640]   I would just point out that
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:32.880]   you can't just magically start a company
[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:34.120]   and then use that company
[01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:37.480]   to reduce all the rest of your losses everywhere.
[01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:39.880]   Now, what you can do is you can,
[01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:41.120]   if you're a passive investor,
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:45.360]   you can net passive losses against passive gains.
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:47.520]   And so if you had one company,
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:50.120]   it would be in theory possible to
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:52.640]   net a company,
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:55.040]   one company against another
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:57.000]   if they're related for the individual.
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.200]   But I'm a little lost now.
[01:42:58.200 --> 01:42:59.160]   So I'm gonna stop talking.
[01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:00.080]   And I would say is that
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:02.120]   for some of my expert accountants in the audience,
[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:03.200]   send me an email.
[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:05.540]   And if you can explain this better than I'm doing it,
[01:43:05.540 --> 01:43:07.920]   I'd love to profile this out in more detail
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:08.920]   for the audience.
[01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:11.400]   So send me an email, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:13.000]   But in summary, what I would say is that
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.720]   it's just not possible to do it
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:17.020]   unless you're really involved with real estate.
[01:43:17.020 --> 01:43:20.400]   - Yeah, well, you covered the basic point
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:22.960]   in that real estate's different,
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:24.480]   but these others,
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:28.560]   sole proprietorship works on your personal return,
[01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:30.320]   basically those losses.
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:31.820]   And then these other entities,
[01:43:31.820 --> 01:43:37.460]   I guess you put distinct capital into those,
[01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:41.720]   it becomes a separate entity from your personal
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:46.760]   income and tax return.
[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:48.860]   And only if you get paid from those,
[01:43:48.860 --> 01:43:53.860]   is from those entities is how the two start to mix.
[01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:58.940]   - Right, right.
[01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:00.780]   So if you're gonna have related businesses,
[01:44:00.780 --> 01:44:02.460]   and your businesses,
[01:44:02.460 --> 01:44:04.440]   so let's use an example, okay,
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:06.120]   to try to clarify this.
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:08.500]   I'm not aware of any rule that would say
[01:44:08.500 --> 01:44:13.220]   that you can't have disparate businesses involved
[01:44:13.220 --> 01:44:16.060]   in your business and net them together
[01:44:16.060 --> 01:44:17.180]   if it's part of your activity.
[01:44:17.180 --> 01:44:20.660]   So let's use a company like General Electric, right?
[01:44:20.660 --> 01:44:23.380]   General Electric famously produces stuff,
[01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:24.260]   they make stuff,
[01:44:24.260 --> 01:44:26.780]   but they're also a massive financing company.
[01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:30.600]   And so if you have a company that has two divisions,
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:32.460]   one is a financing company,
[01:44:32.460 --> 01:44:34.260]   and the other makes stuff,
[01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:39.260]   well, you can use that as a way to net that income together
[01:44:39.260 --> 01:44:41.460]   in order to avoid taxes.
[01:44:41.460 --> 01:44:44.000]   So if you're, let's say that your manufacturing business
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.100]   loses money because you've got so much money
[01:44:46.100 --> 01:44:49.100]   on plant, capital, depreciation, et cetera,
[01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:51.920]   but your financing business has very low expenses
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:53.100]   and it makes money,
[01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:55.100]   you have the ability to net those two things
[01:44:55.100 --> 01:44:56.300]   against each other
[01:44:56.300 --> 01:45:00.220]   because in order to reduce your overall taxable income
[01:45:00.220 --> 01:45:01.380]   at the end of the year.
[01:45:01.380 --> 01:45:02.740]   Now, in that situation,
[01:45:02.740 --> 01:45:05.340]   you would clearly have a C corporation, right?
[01:45:05.340 --> 01:45:07.300]   So what happens tax-wise?
[01:45:07.300 --> 01:45:10.420]   The business nets all of the income,
[01:45:10.420 --> 01:45:14.500]   and then the business pays taxes on the profit that year
[01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:17.020]   under the corporate income tax rates.
[01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:20.100]   And then that same business issues a dividend
[01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:21.620]   to their shareholders.
[01:45:21.620 --> 01:45:24.460]   And then the shareholders, when they receive the dividend,
[01:45:24.460 --> 01:45:27.900]   they pay taxes on that dividend income.
[01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:32.400]   And so that's clearly the case with that kind of business.
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:35.180]   And so if you have a business yourself,
[01:45:35.180 --> 01:45:37.120]   where you think that there's something you would do
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:39.780]   that would not be profitable or less profitable
[01:45:39.780 --> 01:45:41.220]   and something that would be more profitable,
[01:45:41.220 --> 01:45:42.700]   you can certainly do that.
[01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:45.380]   You can have in your business multiple lines.
[01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:48.260]   And so you can structure that under your personal business.
[01:45:48.260 --> 01:45:51.060]   And so all of the same rules apply
[01:45:51.060 --> 01:45:52.220]   that I talked about earlier.
[01:45:52.220 --> 01:45:54.420]   If the business is involved in something
[01:45:54.420 --> 01:45:55.860]   and it's something that you would enjoy,
[01:45:55.860 --> 01:45:57.700]   you can structure that under your business.
[01:45:57.700 --> 01:45:58.900]   Now, if it's a C corporation,
[01:45:58.900 --> 01:46:01.260]   the business will net the income
[01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:03.140]   and the losses together underneath it.
[01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:06.700]   And then it'll declare a dividend to you, the owner,
[01:46:06.700 --> 01:46:08.360]   and then you'll pay taxes to the owner.
[01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:10.220]   You can do the same thing in an S corporation
[01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:12.220]   and the taxes will flow through to you.
[01:46:12.220 --> 01:46:14.700]   You could do the same thing in multiple sole proprietorships.
[01:46:14.700 --> 01:46:17.220]   It's just a matter of where does my income come from?
[01:46:17.220 --> 01:46:20.620]   If you have a job, then that was what I was saying earlier
[01:46:20.620 --> 01:46:21.460]   when I was talking about the advantage
[01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:22.700]   of a sole proprietorship.
[01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:24.620]   If you have a job where you're earning a salary
[01:46:24.620 --> 01:46:27.140]   in the family, then the sole proprietorship is useful,
[01:46:27.140 --> 01:46:28.300]   but there's a big danger there
[01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:30.180]   because you don't have any asset protection
[01:46:30.180 --> 01:46:32.420]   and it's more likely to be disqualified.
[01:46:32.420 --> 01:46:34.220]   If you have an S corporation
[01:46:34.220 --> 01:46:37.760]   and you net your activities together,
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:40.100]   you might have multiple forms of business
[01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:41.480]   that you're engaged in,
[01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:43.500]   but I'm not aware of any rule, could be there,
[01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:44.940]   but I'm not aware of any rule that says
[01:46:44.940 --> 01:46:47.820]   these businesses all have to be exactly the same thing.
[01:46:47.820 --> 01:46:48.700]   You just need to make sure
[01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:51.100]   that you report the profits from your business
[01:46:51.100 --> 01:46:54.100]   and you need to prove that these are genuine lines
[01:46:54.100 --> 01:46:55.060]   of business.
[01:46:55.060 --> 01:46:57.460]   So if I have a business that,
[01:46:57.460 --> 01:46:58.500]   earlier I gave the example
[01:46:58.500 --> 01:47:00.500]   of my starting a photography company.
[01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:05.500]   If I have a car dealership
[01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:11.680]   and I also start a photography company,
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:12.880]   I just need to make sure
[01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:16.600]   that the decisions that I'm making under this business
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:20.960]   qualify as being ordinary necessary business expenses.
[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:23.980]   And so I always need to be able to prove to my auditor
[01:47:23.980 --> 01:47:26.080]   that I'm making wise business decisions.
[01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:28.480]   I'm not just throwing money down the drain,
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:30.880]   but if my expenses are ordinary and necessary
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:32.480]   with a clear profit motive,
[01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:33.920]   then I can net them together
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:36.080]   underneath whichever corporation
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:37.480]   I'm paying the taxes out of.
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:39.320]   Okay.
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:41.700]   All right, that helps some.
[01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:44.100]   - Yeah, may you have great wisdom
[01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:49.100]   as you figure out how to make things better from here.
[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:52.260]   All right, I had one more question come in,
[01:47:52.260 --> 01:47:53.100]   but I'm gonna save it.
[01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:55.100]   It came in on the chat from a listener who had to go.
[01:47:55.100 --> 01:47:57.980]   So Ori, call in next week and we'll try it again,
[01:47:57.980 --> 01:47:59.100]   but I'm gonna save that question.
[01:47:59.100 --> 01:48:01.300]   I think an hour and 48 minutes is sufficient.
[01:48:01.300 --> 01:48:03.740]   Thank you all for listening to today's podcast.
[01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:05.220]   I would encourage you, take these ideas,
[01:48:05.220 --> 01:48:06.700]   apply them to your own personal life
[01:48:06.700 --> 01:48:07.540]   and take action.
[01:48:07.540 --> 01:48:08.380]   Thank you for listening.
