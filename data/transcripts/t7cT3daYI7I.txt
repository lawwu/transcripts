[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.720]   Welcome to the Bogleheads Chapter Series.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.800]   This episode was hosted by the Chicago Virtual Chapter
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.800]   and recorded March 18, 2021.
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.560]   It features Stuart Matthews, the designer and developer
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.520]   of the Prolano Retirement Calculator.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.120]   Bogleheads are investors who follow
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.520]   John Bogle's investing philosophy for attaining
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.680]   financial independence.
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.280]   This recording is for informational purposes only
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.640]   and should not be construed as investment advice.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.960]   This is one of the user worksheets
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.320]   that's just part of the Prolano gold calculator.
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.120]   And in it, I've just entered a summary of this scenario
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.160]   that I've built. So let me quickly step through this
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.240]   so you'll have some idea of where I'm
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.920]   going with this demonstration.
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.200]   This is just one example.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.720]   It's not a trivial one, but it can do far more complicated
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.840]   things than this.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.120]   So just take it from the top.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.400]   The demographics, we're talking about a married couple whose
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.400]   ages are 57 and 55.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.200]   They currently live in Maryland, and they
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.240]   plan to relocate to Texas whenever they
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.280]   retire in several years.
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.440]   The general inflation rate assumed
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.400]   is 3% with health care expenses inflating at 2% above that.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.240]   As far as the federal--
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.280]   the calculator does detail federal and state tax
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.160]   calculations.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.520]   So the federal tax law assumed is currently
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.680]   the Tax Cut and Job Act of 2017 up until its sunset year
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.120]   of 2026, at which time it reverts back
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.600]   to the pre-TCJA of 2017 laws, with the tax
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.520]   that was corrected for that year, 2026.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.400]   The initial balances of the accounts in question
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.560]   here are 525K in the husband's tax deferred accounts,
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.920]   150K in the wife's tax deferred accounts,
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.640]   225K in regular investment accounts
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.400]   with a cost basis of 170K.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.760]   They have 10K in checking and savings accounts,
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.960]   and 50K in a 529 plan for their children's education.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.000]   As far as their portfolio is concerned,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.800]   they have asset classes of money markets, stocks, and bonds
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.600]   with real rates of return of minus 2%, 5%, and 2.5%
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.200]   respectively.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.600]   And then the allocations for these accounts
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.360]   are all the same.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.120]   They're 60% stocks and 40% bonds until the retirement date,
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.360]   after which they get a little bit more conservative
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.080]   and go with 10% money market, 40% stocks, and 50% bonds
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.680]   throughout their retirement years.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.680]   As far as income is concerned, he earns 150K currently,
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.560]   increasing at 3% a year, which is at the inflation rate,
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.640]   until his retirement date, which will be May 1st of 2024.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.240]   During this time, he'll be making personal contributions
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.200]   to his 401K of 12.5K with a company match of 6,250.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.760]   She'll be earning 40K, increasing 3% a year
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.800]   until her retirement date, which is the same as her husband's.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.960]   She'll be making $4,000 contribution to her 401K
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.160]   with no company match.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.040]   When he retires, he'll have a part-time job
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.680]   until he turns 67.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.360]   And he'll be self-employed in this job.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.800]   And he'll earn 10K a year, increasing at 3% per year.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.520]   Also, at the time of his retirement,
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.320]   he'll receive a $50,000 fixed pension,
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.320]   which is to say it doesn't have any COLA associated with it.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.280]   It begins on his retirement date.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.080]   And he will have a 50% survivor option
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.200]   should he die before his wife.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.600]   In terms of Social Security benefits,
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.840]   he'll earn $30,000 a year at his full retirement age of 67.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.720]   And she'll earn $222,000 per year
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.640]   at her full retirement age, which is also 67.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.080]   However, he'll be delaying his benefits until he reaches 70.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.200]   But she'll go ahead and start hers at 67.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.040]   In 2030, they anticipate an inheritance
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.760]   of 100K in a brokerage account from his parents,
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.960]   as well as his dad's $50,000 IRA.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.600]   And then she'll do some part-time work.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.920]   They'll hobby and earn $2,500 a year from age 55 to 60,
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.720]   which will be taxed as ordinary income.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.880]   In terms of expenses, they currently
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.720]   own a home, which they're still paying for.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.320]   And they'll be downsizing at the time of their retirement.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.640]   So they purchased this home in 2010 for 300K.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.640]   It's now appreciated up to 400K.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.320]   They still have an outstanding mortgage
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.880]   at $79,500 at 4.5%, a monthly payment of $13.38.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.480]   They do have property taxes, insurance, maintenance,
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.720]   and utilities, which add up to about $15,100.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.960]   They'll be selling that house when they retire.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.720]   And downsizing for a house that is worth $300,000
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.600]   in today's dollars.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.680]   And then they'll leave it in there thereafter.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.840]   And its operating cost will be $13.9K.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.360]   They have two cars currently.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.320]   And they generally plan to replace them every 10 years.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.840]   They've got two children, which are
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.120]   about to start a four-year tour of duty in college, which
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.480]   costs $25,000 per year each.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.840]   And the first of those will be paid for by a 529 plan.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.200]   The other would be paid on the fly.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.600]   Health care costs are being modeled here.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.400]   And they will be varying substantially
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.320]   as they transition from their working years
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.040]   into their Medicare years.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.960]   They'll start at $3,000 a year while they're both still
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.480]   working through a group insurance plan.
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.360]   But that will peak up substantially higher
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.440]   when they retire.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.440]   And they'll go on to Obamacare.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.360]   And their premium will be $15,000 a year
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.440]   prior to any subsidy.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.240]   And we'll talk about that a little bit more
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.680]   when we get to it.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.760]   And then eventually, this will taper off
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.640]   as they both go on to Medicare.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.480]   And I'll show you how that works.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.280]   Their discretionary expenses will be $25,000.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.120]   And in today's dollars, during their working years,
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.800]   and it'll go up to $35,000 in their early retirement years
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.160]   as they do a substantial amount of traveling.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.880]   And then it'll drop off to $22,700 in late retirement.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.720]   Now, should one of them die early,
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.320]   these expenses will be cut by 40% upon that death.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.200]   They also intend some one-off expenses
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.120]   to fund the marriage of their children.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.360]   They're anticipating $15,000 in today's dollars
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:49.360]   for their son in 2027, $25,000 for their daughter in 2030.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.640]   Finally, they have a charitable contribution
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.920]   of $10,000, which will become a qualified charitable
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.720]   distribution when he reaches age 70.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.160]   So what I want to do here is just
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.840]   model, show you how this is modeled in Perlina Gold,
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.680]   then do a baseline analysis of the probability
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.920]   of this couple reaching the end of their expected lifespans
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.320]   without running out of money.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.680]   Then we'll do some other things.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.840]   We'll do a quick bear market analysis on their plan.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.240]   We'll do a Roth conversion at some point.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.080]   We'll show you how they can optimize their Social Security
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:23.840]   start ages.
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.440]   I'll tell you what ages they plan,
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.760]   but there might be better dates.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.120]   We'll take a look at that.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.680]   Then we'll look at the sensitivity of their plan
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.800]   to changes in key variables, like rates of return, inflation,
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.640]   et cetera.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.680]   Then we'll do a couple of what if scenarios,
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.080]   like an early death, loss of the pension.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.880]   And then finally, we'll just look
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.560]   at how the tool can deal with alternate spending strategies.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.040]   What I did here was show you specifically
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.600]   what they plan to do, but there's
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.920]   other ways the tool can do spending strategies as well.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.760]   So with that as the scenario that I
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.220]   wanted to show you how we model, I'm
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:03.340]   going to jump over to the calculator itself.
[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.160]   And I just took a shortcut, and here it is.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.280]   This is the home page.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.440]   So the calculator, again, as I said,
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.560]   does not take you by the hand and walk you through.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.920]   You have to think your way through this thing,
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.560]   but it's organized logically, and it's
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.880]   broken down functionally.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.480]   And you navigate among those functions
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.720]   by this navigation bar at the top of the page.
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:32.300]   So the home, financial assets, income, and expenses functions
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.740]   are primarily input functions.
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.980]   And then the tabular projections,
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.900]   graphical projections, and reports
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.780]   are primarily output functions.
[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.380]   And then the analysis function is a combination.
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.580]   It's got some inputs, and it's got some outputs.
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.060]   And that's where we're going to find the Monte Carlo
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.260]   analysis and the historical analysis.
[00:08:55.260 --> 00:09:00.120]   Social security, start age optimization, Roth conversions,
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.640]   and other things.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.300]   So we're going to just start off on it.
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.960]   It's going to walk through this thing left to right,
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.440]   starting with the home page and walk
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.680]   through these various functions to show you
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.960]   how the scenario that I just described is input here.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.400]   So again, I said this is Excel.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.520]   You can see the Excel menus at the top,
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.200]   and it's basically table-oriented.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.060]   But it's designed such that we don't
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.340]   need any of these Excel menus at the top,
[00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:30.060]   so I'm going to get rid of them by clicking this link right
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:30.560]   here.
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.160]   It says hide those Excel menus.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.700]   Boom, they're gone.
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.340]   OK, we don't need them.
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.740]   OK, so we're talking about a married couple here.
[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.020]   So this is a toggle button.
[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.620]   If they were single, if Joe was single, we just click that.
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.900]   And if Joe, he's single, it would gray out the boxes
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.100]   associated with his wife.
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.200]   But right now, we're going to bring Jane back.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.120]   So you see the names are Joe and Jane.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.200]   These are their birthdates.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.240]   And then the tool calculates their age
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.040]   based on this birthdate.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.560]   This is their age on January 1 of 2021, which is the year we're
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:09.120]   going to begin this model.
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.960]   So basically, this page is collecting
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.600]   some very fundamental assumptions,
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.840]   such as their life expectancies and then
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:20.260]   their assumptions relative to inflation and taxes.
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.500]   And I didn't mention up front, but the two models,
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.020]   three independent, at least large,
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:29.220]   mostly independent scenarios simultaneously.
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.220]   And you'll see most of the pages that we're
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:35.060]   going to walk through have the inputs
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:39.180]   for that function for that scenario listed side by side.
[00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.980]   So this part of the table here are
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.940]   the inputs for scenario one.
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.980]   These are the inputs for scenario two.
[00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.860]   And these are the inputs for scenario three.
[00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:54.620]   So for a given scenario, the tool
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.080]   has to collect inputs across all of these functions.
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.020]   We need to give it these basic assumptions.
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:02.020]   We need to talk about the financial assets, the income,
[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:02.940]   and the expenses.
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:07.420]   So each page contributes some part of a given scenario.
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:08.700]   Again, they're free.
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.820]   And you can name them down here at the bottom.
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.500]   So this is a short name.
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.620]   And whatever these short names are, it appears here.
[00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.980]   And you'll see that repeated on most of the other pages.
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.940]   You can put a longer description of each scenario
[00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.100]   here just for your own reference.
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.060]   Now, I did say up on the--
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.860]   when I was defining the scenario,
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:34.780]   the tax law, in effect, is the Tax Cut and Job Act of 2017.
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:37.860]   So and that is going to revert back
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.460]   to the prior law in the year listed here.
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.260]   So it's 2026.
[00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.060]   But if you think that's not going to happen,
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.260]   you can change it to whatever date you want it to be.
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:48.140]   You can delete it.
[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:53.100]   And then the TCJA of 2017 will go on forever.
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:57.300]   OK, so that is basically what we do on the home page.
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.820]   And so then I'm going to move on to the next page, which
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.020]   has to do with financial assets.
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.740]   And here, you're going to see that there
[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:10.980]   are some additional pages which fall under financial assets.
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:16.780]   Initial balances, management, asset classes, and so on.
[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.220]   So the first-- and I'm just going to walk through them.
[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:20.580]   I'm not going to do all of these.
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.980]   I'm going to hit the ones that are
[00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.980]   pertinent to our example here.
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.340]   These are the initial account balances.
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:32.020]   So the items in gray are the account types
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.940]   that Prolano Gold models.
[00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:40.860]   So there are the tax deferred accounts for Joe, for his wife,
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.500]   then his joint Roth accounts.
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.100]   They're treated as joint by the calculator.
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.740]   Regular investment accounts, inherited accounts,
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:53.740]   and they can be traditional and Roth for husband and wife.
[00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.180]   And then your cash accounts, such as your checking
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:00.660]   and savings accounts, qualified tuition plans, 529 plans,
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.620]   and then health savings accounts.
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:07.820]   So these are the entities that are modeled by the tool,
[00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:10.260]   the ones that I'm selecting here.
[00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:15.180]   But each of them here contains additional sub-accounts
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.300]   that you can enter here.
[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.740]   And these are strictly here to help you
[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.740]   enter in your initial balances.
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:25.380]   It does not actually model these sub-level accounts.
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.580]   It only models the total account here.
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.740]   But initially, I said the--
[00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:37.700]   so here is the 425K in Joe's account.
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.220]   There's 100K in his wife's account.
[00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:47.340]   225K in the regular investment accounts, of which there is a--
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.020]   there is some cost basis here.
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:55.420]   So there is currently $55,000 of unrealized capital gains
[00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:59.820]   as part of this 225K in these accounts.
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:03.500]   There are no inherited accounts as of the start of the model.
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.340]   And there's $10,000 in the checking and savings,
[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.460]   and there's $50,000 in the 529 plan,
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:14.100]   for a total starting balance of $785,000.
[00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.060]   OK, I'm going to move now to the Management page.
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:21.300]   There are a number of things that can be done on this page.
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.580]   The one that I'm going to just focus on briefly
[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:26.980]   is the Withdrawal Priority Table.
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.940]   Should we get into a situation where the couple bid model has
[00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.220]   a negative cash flow, we need to talk
[00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.500]   about the withdrawal priority.
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.300]   Where do we go to get the money to cover
[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:37.620]   that negative cash flow?
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:41.020]   And that's what's done with this table.
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:46.860]   The choices are the regular investment accounts,
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.460]   the husband's tax-deferred account, the wife's
[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.860]   tax-deferred account, and the Roth accounts.
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.700]   And those can be put in any order.
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:59.540]   So I think that there's 24 ways you can arrange that.
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.020]   And those are listed here in this pull-down menu.
[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:03.580]   You can pick whichever one you want.
[00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:04.820]   I picked the first one.
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.420]   That's one that actually tends to be the best.
[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.980]   And then you can pick a different withdrawal priority
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:12.380]   for each of the scenarios.
[00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:17.340]   This table does other things.
[00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.620]   You can see there are a number of things down below.
[00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:20.940]   But at this point in time, I don't
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.420]   think I want to go into those.
[00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.820]   I'm going to move on.
[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.580]   The next thing is Asset Classes.
[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:31.780]   So one thing that may separate the Perlina Calculator
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:35.940]   from other calculators, it doesn't simply
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:37.780]   ask you what rate of return you think you're
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.220]   going to get on a given account.
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:47.140]   It derives that from underlying asset classes
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:50.540]   and from an asset allocation per account.
[00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.860]   And on this page, we're talking about the asset classes.
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.460]   And it can be as simple as a single asset.
[00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:58.060]   If you really just want to say, I just
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:02.140]   want to specify my rate of return as 5% or 7%
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.500]   or whatever I want it to be, I can just say,
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.380]   I'm going to just use one asset.
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.540]   And I'm going to just, for the sake of this example,
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.380]   I said, I'm going to show you how we do that with scenario 3.
[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:12.700]   And I'm just going to call it--
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:13.860]   I'm going to keep it simple.
[00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:17.020]   I'm going to keep it simple asset with a real rate
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:21.900]   of return of 3 and 1/2% and a standard deviation of 5%.
[00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.020]   But if you don't want to keep it quite that simple,
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:25.100]   you can do something else.
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:29.540]   But there are up to 10 asset classes that you could enter.
[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:33.540]   I personally keep it simple with maybe two or three.
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.340]   This is kind of what I use.
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:36.880]   These are not necessarily my numbers,
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.900]   but these are the asset classes that I tend to use.
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.940]   And if you want to go from something complicated
[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.980]   to just default, you can click this button here.
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:48.580]   And it will load this in as a default setting.
[00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:52.020]   So for this example, I've said the money market asset
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:57.620]   class for scenario 1 has a real rate of return of minus 2%.
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:00.860]   In other words, it's falling behind inflation,
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.820]   but has a very small standard deviation.
[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.700]   So it's very consistent.
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.860]   For the stocks, I've said a real rate of return of 5%
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:11.140]   with a 20% standard deviation.
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:14.900]   And bonds, real rate of return of 2 and 1/2%
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:19.300]   with a 7 and 1/2% standard deviation.
[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:23.620]   And all of these are the three scenarios
[00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:28.540]   use the same assets with the same assumptions
[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:32.580]   about their rate of return and standard deviations.
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.820]   The 529 plan, it doesn't get into the--
[00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:39.900]   it's not as complicated as asset classes and asset allocation.
[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.700]   For these, you do simply specify what is the rate of return
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:46.580]   you think you're going to get on your 529 plan investments
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.620]   and what rate and what standard deviation.
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:54.100]   So I mentioned earlier that the tool does fixed rate.
[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.540]   I think I mentioned it does three types of analysis.
[00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.540]   One is the fixed rate analysis, where
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:02.980]   it just uses an average rate of return each year.
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:07.740]   And these are those average rates of return.
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.860]   But for Monte Carlo analysis, these
[00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:14.380]   are the arithmetic means.
[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.380]   And these are the standard deviations,
[00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.700]   which are used to generate the random rate of return
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:23.180]   every year in that simulation.
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.700]   More on that later.
[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.540]   OK, so I mentioned to get the rate of return
[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:33.060]   for a given account type, we need two things.
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.500]   We need the rate of return, and we need the asset allocation.
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:40.420]   So I'm going to skip over to the asset allocation right here.
[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:45.900]   This is a busy looking table, but it's not really
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.580]   that bad, but it is organized.
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:51.780]   These are the allocations for scenario one.
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.700]   These are for scenario two.
[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.220]   These are for scenario three.
[00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.940]   And then these are the various accounts.
[00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.980]   There's a regular investment account,
[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.900]   the tax deferred account for the husband, for the wife,
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.300]   and there's the Roth account.
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:09.980]   And then, so down below here, let's just say we're going--
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.540]   you can specify different allocations
[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:16.540]   for up to five different periods in time.
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.460]   And in this example, I've used two different time periods,
[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.220]   called period one, period two.
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:25.060]   Period one begins right now, 2021.
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:28.700]   Period two begins in 2027.
[00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:36.940]   You specify those years here, and then you come down here,
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:41.900]   and the asset classes that you input over here
[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.860]   are replicated on this page, and they show up here.
[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:46.660]   You cannot change them here.
[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.620]   These are simply copied from the asset classes page.
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.540]   But here, you go in here and you say,
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:56.940]   these are my allocations of these asset classes
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.820]   for each of these accounts.
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:02.020]   And to make it simple on this example,
[00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:04.740]   I've used the same allocation for every one of them.
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:08.780]   And as I said earlier, during the first period of time,
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:10.780]   while the couple are still working,
[00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:12.220]   it's a little bit more aggressive
[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.140]   than it will be later.
[00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:16.180]   So it's 60% stocks, 40% bonds.
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:18.740]   When they get retired, they'll invest
[00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:25.620]   10% of each account in money markets, 40% stocks, 50% bonds.
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.540]   So now what the tool does is, based on the rates of return
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:32.540]   you put over here on this page, and this asset allocation here,
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:36.500]   it generates an aggregate rate of return,
[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.460]   and that's a real rate of return.
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.620]   So for period one, it's 4%.
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.540]   For period two, it's 3.05%.
[00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:48.020]   It's a little bit more conservative.
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:50.700]   It's a little bit lower rate of return.
[00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:54.460]   And then here, these are the rates of return
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:58.020]   associated with the cash account, which
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.660]   would be your checking and savings accounts.
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.980]   So there are no assets associated with them.
[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:06.260]   You just specify the rate of return directly.
[00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:09.220]   So I've done the same thing for scenario one.
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.060]   Scenario two are identical.
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.180]   The one I will show you, we'll deal with it a little bit
[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:13.740]   later.
[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.220]   Just for you, you just want to keep it simple.
[00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:16.980]   I don't want to deal with all these asset classes.
[00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.620]   I just want to tell you what my rate of return is going to be.
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.300]   Therefore, we use the Keep It Simple
[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:26.220]   asset, which had a rate of return of 3.5%.
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:27.580]   So you come over here and say, I'm
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:31.060]   allocating 100% of this account to that asset.
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.980]   And therefore, the aggregate rate of return
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:39.660]   is 3.5%, just like you specified on the asset classes page.
[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:43.500]   So that's how the tool derives the rate of return
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.620]   to apply to each of these accounts.
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:51.740]   And it uses that in the fixed rate and the money
[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:54.700]   follow projections.
[00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:55.700]   OK.
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:58.340]   One other thing we need to talk about before we leave this,
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:04.100]   the financial assets area, is the asset class taxation.
[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:07.500]   And this pertains only to the regular investment accounts.
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:08.660]   We know how it's--
[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:12.300]   so tax-deferred accounts and Roth accounts are simple.
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.300]   Everything that comes out of a tax-deferred account
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.540]   is taxed as ordinary income.
[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:20.340]   Everything that comes out of a Roth account is tax-free.
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.780]   So we don't have to deal with that.
[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:24.700]   But we do have to deal with the regular investment account.
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.940]   And so you have four choices of how
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:31.740]   each of the assets are taxed within the regular investment
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:32.460]   account.
[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:34.740]   Could be just taxed as simple interest,
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:39.500]   could be taxed like a qualified dividend
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.140]   as a long-term capital gain.
[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:46.060]   It could be taxed as a long-term capital gain
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:47.420]   when it's withdrawn.
[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:49.220]   Otherwise, it's not taxed.
[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:57.180]   And/or it could be tax-free, such as a municipal bond one.
[00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:57.660]   OK.
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:00.540]   So I've set it up this way to make it simple.
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.820]   Money markets, I'm assuming, are taxed as simple interest.
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:05.580]   Stocks, I'm assuming, get a little bit
[00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:09.060]   of just simple dividends, unqualified dividends,
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:10.380]   taxed at 5%.
[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:14.700]   But 95% of the assets associated with stocks
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.980]   are taxed only when they're withdrawn.
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:20.140]   Otherwise, they continue to grow.
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:24.340]   And with the keep it simple, I said it's 50% simple interest,
[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:27.220]   50% when it's withdrawn.
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:28.980]   And they're all the same.
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:31.860]   So with that, I am through talking
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.060]   about financial assets.
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:36.420]   And then we'll move on to the income page.
[00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:38.780]   Again, it's organized just like the others.
[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:44.900]   These sets of fields are associated with scenario one.
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.380]   This is scenario two.
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:48.060]   This is scenario three.
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.580]   Again, you can see that the name we
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:53.500]   gave with each of those scenarios is listed up here.
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:57.020]   And then here are the items that we can enter data for.
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:00.940]   This is a very long table.
[00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:02.740]   There's three.
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:07.140]   And for that reason, there are some links up here,
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.580]   some little hidden buttons that allow
[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:13.820]   you to scroll from one major function to the next.
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:16.820]   So at the top of the page, there's the employment income
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:17.340]   stream.
[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:18.340]   There's three of them.
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.300]   Beneath that, there's pension income.
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.220]   I'm going to click this button here.
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:28.620]   It will scroll down to bring the pension streams up
[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:29.620]   to the top of the page.
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:30.900]   So there are two.
[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:34.620]   So you can see you can identify two pensions for husband
[00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:38.300]   and wife for each of the three scenarios.
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:41.940]   Now we're going to scroll to the social security inputs
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:43.580]   for each of three scenarios.
[00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:48.660]   And then there's windfalls.
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.060]   You can be taxable.
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.620]   There's non-taxable windfalls.
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.980]   Then if you've still got yet other streams of income
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:59.300]   you need to specify, you can do that down here.
[00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.380]   There's five of these other income streams
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:06.660]   that can be defined for each of the husband and wife
[00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:08.300]   for each of the scenarios.
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:13.460]   Going down further, you can define two annuities
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.380]   for husband and wife for each of the scenarios.
[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.060]   And then if you anticipate inheriting
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:23.140]   an IRA, a traditional IRA, or a Roth IRA,
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.220]   at some point in the future, you can do that.
[00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:29.100]   And then finally, you can define a reverse mortgage.
[00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.420]   Now with that, I'm going to quickly show you
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:35.540]   how I entered the data that I described for this scenario.
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.620]   At the top are the retirement dates.
[00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.540]   I said this couple is going to retire on the same day.
[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:44.620]   That's going to be May 1, 2024.
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:49.100]   And they're both currently working.
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:52.580]   So I'm going to put that under employment income
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:56.300]   stream number one, which starts when he's 55
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.540]   and it ends when he's retired.
[00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:00.860]   Now you can define these start and stop dates
[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:08.180]   for any of these blocks of income stream.
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:12.060]   You can define them either by an age, by a year,
[00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:17.500]   by a specific date, or by the retirement date, which is here.
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.980]   So if you want to tie this income stream to that date,
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:25.020]   what you do is just type in an R right there.
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:27.940]   So this income stream is going to begin immediately
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:31.620]   and it's going to end on May 1, 2024.
[00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:34.900]   So in the meantime, it's going to be $150,000 increasing
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:36.540]   to 3% a year.
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:41.420]   $12,500 going into his IRA and the company
[00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.660]   is going to kick in $6,250.
[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:48.060]   Meanwhile, the wife starts these two years younger.
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:49.780]   She's starting now.
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.740]   Her income stream of $40,000 is going
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:54.860]   to end when she retires on May 1, 2024.
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:56.940]   That will also increase to 3% a year.
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:02.140]   She'll be contributing $4,000 a year into her 401(k).
[00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:05.700]   And so now I'm going to go down to the pension streams
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:09.780]   where Joe is going to have a pension income
[00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:13.380]   stream that starts when he retires on his retirement
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.260]   date of May 1, 2024.
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:19.260]   And it goes indefinitely.
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:22.620]   It's the amount is $25,000 and that's fixed.
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.700]   And it does not increase.
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.180]   But it does have a 50% survivor benefit
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:30.020]   should he die before his wife.
[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.420]   I want to go down to Social Security.
[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:38.700]   And here I said that Joe will have a $30,000 benefit
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:42.580]   if he added in his full retirement age of 67
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:46.860]   his wife will have 22k and her retirement age was 67.
[00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:49.940]   However, Joe actually intends to work until he's 70.
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:54.500]   So this amount will be increased at, I think, 8% a year
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.180]   until he reaches age 70.
[00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:57.900]   And it will begin.
[00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:00.020]   And hers will begin at the full retirement age.
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:03.260]   So it will be $22,000 from the start.
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:08.660]   OK, I said that Joe will be inheriting money
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:09.580]   from his parents.
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:22.020]   It will be $50,000 in a brokerage account in 2030.
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:24.740]   And his wife will be doing some part-time work
[00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:28.580]   earning $2,500 a year from 55 to 60.
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.340]   It goes up at the inflation rate and will
[00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:33.140]   be taxed as regular income.
[00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:36.460]   But you do have the option if you could borrow something
[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:40.580]   that's not taxable or taxable as capital gains.
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.140]   Those are options as well.
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:45.260]   Just scrolling on down, no annuities,
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:48.700]   but there is an inherited IRA coming at some point.
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:51.820]   They anticipate that being $50,000 a year
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:55.180]   and then-year dollars in the year 2030.
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:59.980]   And it will have a distribution period of 10 years.
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:04.020]   Now, so all three of these scenarios are the same.
[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:07.260]   I don't think I put any differences in them.
[00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:11.100]   So that's how you define the income a problem ago.
[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.980]   Now we're going to move to expenses.
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:18.180]   Again, there are a number of subtables here,
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:22.460]   different categories of expenses, which have nuances
[00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:23.860]   into how they're modeled.
[00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:28.100]   So the tool does not simply say, here's an expense,
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:29.780]   here's a start date, here's a stop date,
[00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:31.940]   and then here's how much it increases per year.
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.540]   This tool goes way, way beyond that.
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:37.100]   So on this page, it models properties,
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:38.540]   such as homes and cars.
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:43.580]   So what I've said, as I said,
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:46.060]   the current, this couple currently owns a home.
[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:47.740]   They bought it in 2010.
[00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:51.060]   They paid $300,000 as a cost basis for this home.
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:53.940]   It's currently valued at $400,000.
[00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:58.700]   It has a mortgage on it at $75,900 at 4.5%.
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.660]   Monthly payment is $1,338.
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.580]   They expect to sell it in the year 2027,
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:07.540]   and they will have a realtor fee of 6% when they do that.
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:10.100]   You can see it.
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:11.540]   So when they sell this home,
[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:14.860]   they'll be buying another retirement home in that same year.
[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:19.140]   They'll be paying $300,000 for it.
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:20.260]   They will be paying cash.
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.460]   There will be no mortgage,
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.460]   and they don't ever intend to sell it.
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:25.460]   And I said they had a couple of cars.
[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:28.780]   They bought one in 2012, another in 2017.
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.340]   You see, this is what they paid.
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.700]   This is what they're worth.
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.100]   They have a mortgage on one of them.
[00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:37.140]   These are depreciating some every year.
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:38.300]   And when he sells this one,
[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:40.300]   he expects to buy this one to replace it.
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:41.140]   When they sell this one,
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.820]   they're going to buy another one here to replace it.
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.420]   And when they sell that one,
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.260]   they're going to replace it with this one.
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:51.500]   So that's the purchase and the sale of each other.
[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:52.420]   There's 10 roads.
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:57.020]   You can model 10 different properties on this table.
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:59.780]   So this is the top table is the acquisition
[00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:01.780]   and the loan and sale information.
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:06.780]   The table below applies to the same properties.
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:11.180]   So that whatever name you type in here is replicated here.
[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:12.780]   But these get other costs.
[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:14.940]   These are some costs of ownership,
[00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:18.060]   such as property taxes, insurance,
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.060]   and annual operating costs.
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.260]   Gasoline for cars,
[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:23.420]   maintenance for the homes and the cars,
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:24.700]   then utilities.
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:31.460]   This is the one page where the three scenarios
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:33.420]   don't line up side by side,
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.700]   because as you can see, this table is very wide.
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:38.180]   It just wouldn't work to have them side by side.
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:40.660]   So they're stacked on top of each other.
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:43.740]   And so these links here help you scroll
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:44.580]   from one to the other.
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.500]   Right now, we're looking at scenario one.
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.540]   We can look at scenario two by clicking that.
[00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:50.740]   That now brings up scenario two.
[00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:53.620]   There's some click that to bring up scenario three.
[00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:55.700]   In this case, they're all identical.
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:57.860]   And at the bottom of the page,
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:01.900]   there's some summary information that is calculated
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.660]   based on the inputs in the tables above.
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:07.780]   Now, we're only looking at one scenario at a time.
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:09.660]   In this case, this is probably the first time
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:12.060]   we've seen this little gizmo here,
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:14.260]   which says you can click this button
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.340]   to specify which scenario you want,
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:17.820]   either one, two, or three.
[00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:19.860]   The one that's active is listed here.
[00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:21.460]   So right now, we're looking at scenario one.
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:24.340]   If I wanna go to scenario two, I just click that.
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:29.340]   And this will change the scenario two, which is the same.
[00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:32.980]   Okay, so the left part of the table is a summary
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:36.020]   across all of the 10 assets.
[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:37.900]   And this is just one of them.
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:41.420]   This table, this page potentially goes to the right
[00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.260]   about five or six feet.
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:45.740]   But that's very cumbersome to try to scroll.
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:48.020]   So what this capability here just lets you look
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:49.700]   at whichever one you want.
[00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:53.060]   You click up or down to look at a particular property.
[00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:54.220]   And this is the sum.
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:57.700]   So on the property one, the current home,
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:59.460]   so here's the loan.
[00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:00.900]   They're paying that off.
[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:03.220]   It's going toward zero.
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:04.220]   Here's the monthly payment.
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:05.460]   There's the value.
[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:06.980]   You see the value of the house is going up.
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:07.900]   Equity is going up.
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:10.900]   These are the taxes, the insurance, and so on.
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:14.100]   Then here's the second property.
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:17.340]   It kicks in when they sell the first one in 2027.
[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:21.460]   And it continues on to the end of the modeling period.
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:26.220]   So you can see these are the annual expenses
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:27.860]   when a property is sold.
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:29.660]   There's a windfall.
[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:31.420]   The net expense is a difference
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:35.300]   between the expense and any windfall.
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.900]   Otherwise, it's just the annual expense.
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:40.100]   These are the tax deductions.
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:42.340]   And then here's the total equity.
[00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:45.780]   Well, that's basically how you specify property.
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:47.740]   This tool also does rental property,
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:50.620]   very similar to the personal property,
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:53.380]   but it's more complicated.
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:56.500]   But that probably only applies to very few people.
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:57.780]   So we're definitely not gonna,
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:00.220]   we're gonna skip over that in this demonstration.
[00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:03.300]   Okay, one other thing, let me go back.
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:07.260]   I failed to mention, for any of these properties,
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.980]   you can do a home equity loan as well.
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:12.820]   You pick the one property you wanna do a home equity loan,
[00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:14.420]   fill out the details here,
[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:15.900]   and you can do a home equity loan
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:19.860]   or a home equity line of credit, whichever you choose.
[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:21.860]   We're not gonna do that in this example.
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:23.700]   Okay, now moving on to children,
[00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:26.820]   which is second expense category,
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:28.700]   which is different from all others.
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:31.900]   It's basically, the table at the top
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:35.740]   deals with college education expenses for the children,
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:37.180]   for up to four children.
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:40.220]   And the table below deals with the expenses
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:43.740]   for those children prior to their college years.
[00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:47.620]   So in this example, we've got two kids, John and Sue.
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:49.660]   John's gonna start college this year.
[00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:51.300]   Sue's gonna start in a couple of years.
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:54.900]   Therefore, Sue's expenses in the next couple of years
[00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:56.900]   are listed here, they're $8,000 a year.
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:03.060]   So the annual cost of college is $25,000.
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.940]   They will be going for four years.
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:08.260]   The parents are only gonna pick up 25% of that though.
[00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:12.100]   And for John, they can anticipate funding that
[00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:15.140]   with the 529 plan, which had an initial balance,
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:16.460]   which we already specified.
[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:19.420]   I think it was $50,000 already there.
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:21.300]   But for Sue, we're just gonna do,
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:23.220]   we're gonna pay as we go.
[00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:26.340]   So the details of how all that lays out is not shown here,
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:29.060]   but we'll get to it a little bit later
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.820]   when we get to the tabular projection.
[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:35.020]   Healthcare expenses is yet a different,
[00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:39.500]   a different way of modeling an expense.
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:43.380]   As I mentioned, when I was briefing the scenario,
[00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:49.820]   these, their healthcare expenses vary quite a bit
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:51.900]   from during their working years
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:56.260]   as they go into their retired, early retired years,
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:59.660]   and then ultimately on to their Medicare years.
[00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:03.700]   So there are fundamentally five periods of time
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.740]   that the tool deals with.
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:08.220]   The first of those applies,
[00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:12.860]   and all of these apply to married couples in general.
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:15.740]   Period one is when both partners
[00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:18.540]   of the marriage are working.
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:20.820]   Period two follows that,
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:23.380]   and that's when only one of them is working.
[00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:28.980]   Period three is when neither of them is working,
[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:33.220]   yet none, neither of them has reached Medicare age yet.
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:36.740]   Period four is when only one of them
[00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:39.260]   has reached age 65 and gone on Medicare.
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:41.060]   And then finally period five
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:44.420]   is when both of them are 65 and on Medicare.
[00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:47.380]   So for each of those periods of time, there's two rows.
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:49.820]   One of the first row deals with insurance premiums,
[00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:52.460]   the other deals with out-of-pocket expenses.
[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:55.620]   So here's the numbers that I've chosen for there.
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:58.420]   And then you can see when there is no period two
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:36:59.660]   because they both retire,
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:01.820]   they both stop working on the same day.
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:04.140]   So they immediately go from period one to period three,
[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.660]   and this is consequently blacked out.
[00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.540]   At this point in time, they go on Obamacare,
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:12.260]   and the premiums go up substantially,
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:14.540]   but this is the actual premium they pay.
[00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:19.540]   And prior to any subsidy being applied,
[00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:24.660]   then these are their out-of-pocket expenses.
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:29.660]   And then as the husband goes on to Medicare,
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:32.740]   the expenses will start coming down a little bit,
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.460]   and then ultimately it'll go down further
[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:36.820]   when they both get on the Medicare.
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:41.820]   And so the tool will, it'll automatically calculate
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:47.820]   Medicare Part B premiums for you if you check this box.
[00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:50.260]   If you don't check it, you have to know the name of it.
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:52.380]   In this example, I'm assuming the tool
[00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:55.940]   is calculating the Medicare Part B premiums.
[00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.420]   You would still, if you have supplemental insurance
[00:37:58.420 --> 00:37:59.820]   or Part D insurance,
[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:03.660]   you would need to enter those premiums here or here.
[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:08.460]   Now, if any of these expenses are paid with pre-tax dollars,
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:10.500]   you can enter what portion of it is paid
[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:13.420]   with pre-tax dollars in these fields.
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:15.900]   Moving down below, now this part of the table
[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:20.340]   deals with Obamacare Affordable Care Act health insurance.
[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:23.380]   You just check if you want to use it,
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.220]   you just check the box.
[00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:29.500]   For period three, these periods are the same as these periods.
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.420]   So if you're gonna use Obamacare in period three,
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:33.460]   you check that box.
[00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:36.340]   For period four, you check that box.
[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:40.020]   And then assuming you are gonna use ACA insurance,
[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:43.520]   this is where you put in the key number,
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:47.500]   which goes into the calculation of the subsidy.
[00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:50.140]   This is one of the, so this is the cost of the,
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.740]   I think what you call the second lowest,
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:57.020]   the second least expensive silver plan premium.
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:39:00.740]   So in this case, it's $12,000.
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.380]   So your subsidy, the subsidy for this couple
[00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:05.780]   will be based on this number
[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:10.260]   and their modified adjusted gross income.
[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:14.420]   So those two factors go into calculation of the subsidy.
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:16.660]   And there's some tables behind the scenes here,
[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:20.080]   which are used to calculate those values.
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:23.900]   Another thing that you can enter on this table
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:26.660]   is what happens after if one of the spouses die,
[00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:31.660]   because these are expenses for both members of the marriage.
[00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:34.100]   If one of them dies, what's gonna happen?
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:35.980]   In this case, we're assuming that these costs
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:39.860]   will be cut by 50% upon the death of the first spouse.
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:41.660]   And then finally at the bottom,
[00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:44.380]   if there's long-term care costs that you anticipate,
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:47.220]   you can specify that down here.
[00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:51.020]   Annual cost, what year it begins and how long it goes.
[00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:52.620]   If you leave that blank,
[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:54.860]   it begins at that age and lasts forever,
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:56.900]   for the lifetime of this person.
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:01.780]   So that is how health care is done.
[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:08.100]   Now, moving to discretionary expenses.
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:09.420]   This is another big table.
[00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:11.260]   It's got three segments to it.
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:13.620]   Scenario one, two, and three.
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:15.820]   And then each of these scenarios
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:19.020]   is further divided into three time periods,
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:21.060]   with the idea being your expenses
[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:24.300]   are probably gonna be different in your working years
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:28.100]   than they are during your early retired years,
[00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:30.660]   and then may change again further
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:32.460]   in your late retirement years.
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:36.540]   So in this example, all the costs are,
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:37.540]   I think they're the same,
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:41.900]   except I put in a bigger number here for period two,
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:43.940]   which will be the early retired years,
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:47.380]   anticipating that the couple anticipates doing some travel.
[00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:52.180]   So that number may peak up during this period too,
[00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:54.740]   but ultimately they get a little bit older at 20, 37,
[00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:58.060]   or slowing down again, and the number comes back down.
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:03.060]   So the discretionary expenses are 27.5 for period one,
[00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:06.660]   45K for period two,
[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:11.660]   and then dropping back down to 25K during retirement,
[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:13.780]   during period three.
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.380]   And should, again, what happens
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:19.580]   if one of the partners of the marriage passes away?
[00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:22.820]   These expenses are probably going to reduce,
[00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:25.260]   and you can specify by how much down here.
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:28.220]   In this example, I'm assuming they dropped by 40%
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:30.620]   after the death of the first spouse.
[00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:36.620]   Now, I'll go to another table, miscellaneous expenses.
[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:42.820]   This is generally for capturing one-off costs,
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.540]   like the weddings, it doesn't have to be one-off,
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:47.380]   but in this case, it is.
[00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:53.860]   John, the son's wedding, $15,000 in the year 2027,
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:57.860]   just one time for the start year in the second year.
[00:41:57.860 --> 00:41:59.340]   The start and stop year are the same,
[00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:01.400]   same for Sue's wedding.
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.740]   There's the cost, it occurs in 2030.
[00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:05.860]   These are today's dollars,
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:09.020]   but they will be increased up to that point in time.
[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:13.980]   And then both scenarios use the same data here.
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:17.660]   Now, the tool also allows you to model term life insurance,
[00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:19.180]   a whole life insurance program.
[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:21.620]   I'm going to skip over that for this example.
[00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:26.300]   And then finally, the final piece of expense inputs here
[00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:28.140]   is charitable contributions.
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:31.860]   In this case, I just picked one charity.
[00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:35.700]   The amount is $10,000, it starts this year,
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:39.420]   increases at the inflation rate,
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:43.620]   and it is to be treated as a qualified charitable
[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:48.620]   distribution or donation at age 70.
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:56.420]   So, again, this is for scenario one,
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:58.900]   scenario two, scenario three.
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:03.300]   Okay, so that completes the input.
[00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:05.300]   I have now defined the scenario.
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:08.100]   Now we can see what the outputs are.
[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:11.060]   Jim, is there a way for me to,
[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:14.540]   there's a menu at the top that's,
[00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:19.540]   the zoom table at top is blocking my,
[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:22.860]   what I'm trying to get to.
[00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:25.480]   - Like the yellow bar,
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.840]   do you have like a yellow bar around the screen?
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:31.980]   You may be able to click it and it may not be real visible,
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:33.260]   but it may actually work.
[00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:37.340]   You can move some of those controls, Stuart.
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:38.340]   - How do I?
[00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:39.540]   - Grab them and move them.
[00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:40.820]   - Just grab it and move it?
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:41.860]   - Just drag it, yeah.
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:44.020]   - Oh, okay.
[00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:45.140]   Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:45.980]   Perfect.
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:47.620]   Okay, now we can see what we're doing.
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:52.060]   Okay, so now those are the input screens.
[00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:54.380]   Now I'm going to skip over analysis for the moment.
[00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:58.660]   I'm going to show you some of the tabular projections
[00:43:58.660 --> 00:43:59.780]   produced by the tool.
[00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:05.140]   There are eight separate views, customizable views.
[00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:07.460]   You can define what these views are
[00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:09.740]   and what data goes into these views,
[00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:10.860]   but I've got them set up.
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:13.300]   And so it's income, contributions, expenses,
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:15.860]   and so forth over to summary.
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:17.220]   And then additionally,
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:20.620]   you can look at the details of the adjusted gross income
[00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:23.140]   and your itemized deductions.
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:25.580]   But let's just start over here with income.
[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:26.420]   So you can see,
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:31.420]   so these are the fixed rate analysis results.
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:36.620]   All these are based on the fixed rate returns
[00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:38.380]   that we define on the asset classes
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:40.580]   and asset allocation pages.
[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:42.340]   And so Joe's income is,
[00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:45.340]   you can see it's here,
[00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:49.140]   starts at 150 and drops down when he retires here in 2024.
[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:50.820]   He only worked a partial year.
[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:52.500]   So you can see it's starting to step down.
[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:54.820]   Then he took that part-time job,
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:57.980]   earning $10,000 a year for several years.
[00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:01.300]   His wife earned $40,000 a year after her retirement date,
[00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:03.820]   I think in May of 2024.
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:08.100]   And then Joe has a pension that kicks in
[00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:09.500]   on his retirement day here.
[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:13.660]   So he gets a partial year here,
[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:17.820]   and then in full years here thereafter.
[00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:22.380]   But remember, I told you this was a fixed pension.
[00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:24.020]   It does not increase over time.
[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:26.380]   We're currently looking at this data
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:28.540]   in terms of today's dollars.
[00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:30.980]   If I switch it to future year dollars,
[00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:33.540]   you'll see it comes back to the $25,000.
[00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:36.660]   And then I think I also mentioned
[00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:40.500]   it has a 50% survivor option.
[00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:45.340]   So in his death here at age 85,
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:46.940]   so he goes away,
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:49.660]   but now his wife is still going for several more years,
[00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:54.660]   and his pension drops to 50% of the $25,000.
[00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:59.700]   Okay, I'm gonna switch back to today's dollars.
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:02.100]   You can see social security kicks in here,
[00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:04.060]   and this is the portion of it that is taxable
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:05.980]   based on the modified adjusted gross rate,
[00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:10.500]   or the taxable amount based on the AGI.
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:12.740]   That determines how much of the social security income
[00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:15.100]   is taxable, and that's presented to you here.
[00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:18.820]   Here's another page that shows just a few contributions.
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:21.860]   These are Joe's contributions, his 401(k).
[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:23.820]   These are Jane's contributions,
[00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:27.340]   and these are the company, this is Joe's company numbers.
[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:30.620]   Then here's a page that shows the expenses.
[00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:34.660]   These are the, this came off the expenses page.
[00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:38.660]   The, I mean, the net, the property page.
[00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:41.860]   This came off the children's page.
[00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:46.860]   These are the, we initially had $50,000 in the 529 plan,
[00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:51.900]   but that wasn't enough to fund the first kid's education.
[00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:53.340]   We had to kick in some more money,
[00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:55.900]   so that's, that contribution is here.
[00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:57.700]   These are the healthcare expenses.
[00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:00.980]   We talked about it, it starts low at $3,000 a year,
[00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:04.660]   but then it goes up high, and then comes back down again.
[00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:11.820]   Once we get onto Obamacare,
[00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:14.020]   there are some subsidies that are created.
[00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:16.060]   You can see those are listed here,
[00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:20.420]   and they serve to reduce the healthcare expenses here.
[00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:24.620]   So this takes into account the application of that subsidy.
[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:28.660]   We had a miscellaneous expenses
[00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:31.740]   to pay for those two weddings, that's what these are.
[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:34.740]   And then these are the specific discretionary expenses,
[00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:39.340]   which included the increased spending for the travel
[00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:40.900]   during the early retirement year,
[00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:42.580]   the 10-year ban there, I believe,
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:45.580]   and then it drops back down to about 25,000.
[00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:48.500]   Then upon the death of the husband,
[00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:50.980]   it drops by 40% down to this level.
[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:56.180]   Then I think that the final expense that we specified
[00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:59.740]   was the charitable donations.
[00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:03.780]   They start off as a non-QCD prior to age 70,
[00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:08.780]   but at age 70, they become qualified charitable donations.
[00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:12.380]   And basically these then come out
[00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:17.380]   of Joe's tax deferred accounts as RMDs,
[00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:18.740]   but they're not taxable.
[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:21.460]   The account for his RMD, but they're not taxable.
[00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:27.260]   So that is the expenses page.
[00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:31.740]   Now here's a page that shows the detailed tax information.
[00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:34.340]   I told you this still does detailed federal
[00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:36.660]   and state tax calculations.
[00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:39.220]   And these are some of the information
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:40.500]   associated with that.
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.740]   Here's the AGI column.
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:44.180]   And if you want to, if you see this,
[00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:45.540]   you want to say, what the, how did that,
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:46.740]   how did I actually get it down?
[00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:47.740]   What are the details?
[00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:51.340]   You can come over here and there are the details,
[00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:52.700]   this page.
[00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:55.980]   So there's the sum and here are all the components of it.
[00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:57.900]   And it's actually wider than this page.
[00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:00.500]   So you can scroll over to see some more of it there.
[00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:04.060]   And these are the itemized deductions.
[00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:05.460]   Should you be able to itemize,
[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.340]   these are the details of that.
[00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:08.660]   Now we're going to go back.
[00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:10.700]   This is the tax page again.
[00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:12.900]   Here's reportable capital gains.
[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:16.180]   These are the deductions and exemptions.
[00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:21.100]   So there's AGI minus this, it's federal taxable.
[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:22.220]   There's a state taxable.
[00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:25.980]   These, here's a federal income tax, state income tax,
[00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:27.740]   which goes away by the way,
[00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:30.740]   when this couple relocates from Maryland to Texas
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:34.580]   at the end of 2027, which we specified on the homepage.
[00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:37.620]   While they're still working,
[00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:42.140]   they've got social security tax, that's this.
[00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:45.100]   And then the overall effective tax rate
[00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:46.180]   is shown in this column.
[00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:48.580]   This is their marginal tax rate.
[00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:53.220]   Starts off at the 22% range, drops down to 10%,
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:57.420]   finally gets up into the 15% range when the RMBs kick in.
[00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:00.540]   And that is that.
[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:03.780]   Now, so here is a page that shows,
[00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:06.140]   what are the various accounts doing?
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:08.140]   We talked about those accounts initially.
[00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:10.540]   So there's a 529 plan.
[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:13.460]   There's a cash, there's a cash, there's a cash account.
[00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:15.060]   There's a regular investment accounts,
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:18.100]   both tax deferred accounts for husband and wife.
[00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:22.780]   For all the accounts and inherited IRA account,
[00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:24.620]   the health savings account.
[00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:28.340]   And this is the total of these savings accounts.
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:30.340]   This is the equity and the property.
[00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:32.820]   And this is the total net, which is net savings
[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:34.700]   plus the equity and the property.
[00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:40.060]   And so the growth over time,
[00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:41.940]   you see these are the rates of return
[00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:44.140]   based on what we defined over here
[00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:47.420]   on the financial assets as an allocations page.
[00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:49.740]   But over here, we said, these are real.
[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:51.780]   These are the real rates of return.
[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:54.260]   Over here, these are the nominal rates of return,
[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:57.900]   which is basically the real rate of return plus inflation.
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:01.260]   So you can see they started at 7%,
[00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:03.460]   they dropped down to 6.1,
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:06.780]   and that's where they remain to the end.
[00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:09.220]   And then these are the actual growth amounts.
[00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:13.540]   These are actual dollar amounts of that growth.
[00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:16.220]   These are in terms of today's dollars.
[00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:18.460]   If you wanna look at it in terms of future year dollars,
[00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:20.700]   you click this button and then you get that.
[00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:23.660]   Okay, what about withdrawals?
[00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:26.700]   One of the withdrawals we know we're gonna have
[00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:29.660]   is we're gonna be taking money out of that 529 plan
[00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:31.660]   in favor of First Kids College.
[00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:34.380]   And then RMDs are gonna start.
[00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:36.900]   And they start at age 72.
[00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:39.900]   And that begins, so that the age is shown here
[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:43.820]   is the age of the husband at the beginning of the year.
[00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:46.740]   But we know his birthday was sometime during the year,
[00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:50.580]   so that RMD, so he reaches 72 sometime during this year.
[00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:52.740]   And so that's when those are due.
[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:55.860]   His wife begins two years later, and those are their RMDs.
[00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:02.020]   And even though Joe passes away at this point in time,
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:04.740]   that RMD continues and goes to his wife.
[00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:06.860]   She inherits that.
[00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:11.660]   But we do have a negative cash flow situation going.
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:13.660]   So there's unscheduled withdrawals
[00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:15.660]   from the regular investment account.
[00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:18.940]   I believe we must have negative cash flow.
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:21.500]   And so yes, indeed we do.
[00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:23.420]   So here's a summary page.
[00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:27.540]   And this is a total of the income, total expenses.
[00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:30.220]   This is the difference between them.
[00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:31.820]   This is the cash flow.
[00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:33.340]   It's positive while they're working,
[00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:37.860]   but when they reach their retirement age in 2024,
[00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:41.340]   then they get into a negative cash flow situation.
[00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:45.660]   And this is the overall withdrawal rate.
[00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:48.620]   Total property, total property.
[00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:49.820]   They have a loan for a while.
[00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:51.620]   There's the property loan balance.
[00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:52.860]   There's the equity.
[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:55.500]   Again, net savings, then the total net worth.
[00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:56.740]   So going back to withdrawals,
[00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:58.860]   we do have a negative cash flow going.
[00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:01.260]   Therefore, there's gotta be withdrawals
[00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:04.100]   taken to cover that from somewhere.
[00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:07.180]   And because of the withdrawal priority
[00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:10.620]   that we specified back here, regular first,
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:14.540]   and then the husband's tax deferred account,
[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:18.660]   it starts taking those,
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:20.620]   covering those negative cash flows
[00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:22.460]   from the regular investment account.
[00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:23.820]   And that's what these are.
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:30.860]   But ultimately, I think that, let's see.
[00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:37.780]   The regular investment account runs out of money here.
[00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:39.420]   So now we've got to go somewhere else
[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:43.140]   to cover the negative cash flow in 2030.
[00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:49.220]   So in 2030, or 2031,
[00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:53.140]   we have to start taking from Joe's tax deferred account,
[00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:55.340]   and that's what these are.
[00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:58.620]   - Okay, so that's the tabular projections.
[00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:01.660]   And one other thing, if you don't like the way this is,
[00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:03.620]   there's a lot of flexibility here.
[00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:07.340]   First of all, if you don't like the way this is organized,
[00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:10.460]   you want it to be organized in some other way,
[00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:12.700]   you can just take that,
[00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:15.340]   click on that column that you want to move,
[00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:17.420]   and go over here and move it to the left.
[00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:20.460]   Move it back to the right.
[00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:24.700]   Move it over there, move it to the end.
[00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:26.100]   Put it wherever you want it.
[00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:30.460]   If you don't like the title that I've given it,
[00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:33.060]   you can delete that header, call it something else.
[00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:41.900]   I just have to remember how to do it.
[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:44.340]   You click the add header, come down here.
[00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:48.220]   Something else.
[00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:54.460]   So you have flexibility.
[00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:58.460]   You can change these things any order you want.
[00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:01.540]   You can change these headers, expand those columns.
[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:04.940]   Additionally, I told you, you can define these eight views,
[00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:05.900]   however you want them to be.
[00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:09.620]   You do that from this tabular projections, major page,
[00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:12.940]   you come over to the view management sub-page,
[00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:15.660]   and then here are all the columns of data
[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:16.500]   that are available.
[00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:19.420]   I think there's 130 some columns of data.
[00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:21.980]   So it's far more than one page wide.
[00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:24.060]   You do have to scroll to see all of them.
[00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:30.500]   But here are the eight views.
[00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:32.700]   You can define, call them whatever you want to call them.
[00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:33.820]   If you don't want to call it any kind,
[00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:35.780]   you type in something, change it
[00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:37.980]   to whatever you want to call it.
[00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:40.300]   And then you check, you just put checks.
[00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:42.500]   These are the columns of data I want to include
[00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:43.940]   on that page.
[00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:46.220]   You just go through, you check whichever box,
[00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:48.100]   whichever columns you want,
[00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:50.420]   and it will appear on that page.
[00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:52.980]   This row right here tells you
[00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:56.020]   whether there's actually any data in that column or not.
[00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:58.140]   So you can see, if it has a no,
[00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:02.460]   I didn't check it for the most part.
[00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:03.780]   So you can just go through there
[00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:05.980]   and pick whichever views you want.
[00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:06.820]   So that's it.
[00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:08.820]   I won't dwell on it anymore unless there's some questions,
[00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:10.220]   but then I'm gonna, so now I'm gonna move
[00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:12.460]   to the graphical projections.
[00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:15.020]   I said this thing produces outputs
[00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:17.340]   in terms of table and graphs.
[00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:21.580]   So here's a graphical view of the savings and net worth.
[00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:24.380]   There's quite a bit of data on here.
[00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:29.100]   The bar chart portion of this thing
[00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:31.260]   is all the savings related things.
[00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:34.740]   And these are stacked bar charts.
[00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:39.100]   So the top is the overall net worth.
[00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:42.660]   And so at the top, the top segment there
[00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:45.140]   is the total equity and property.
[00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:48.100]   The bars beneath that are the various components
[00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:49.420]   of your savings.
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:52.700]   And then the line graph is income.
[00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:56.100]   The blue line is income, and this line is the expenses,
[00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:59.700]   and they are calibrated against the scale on the right.
[00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:03.340]   The bars are calibrated against the scale on the left.
[00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:05.500]   And you can show this in terms of today's dollars
[00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:07.060]   or future dollars as well.
[00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:12.060]   Okay, with all that said, I've got one other thing.
[00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:14.060]   One of these is reports.
[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:16.660]   The tool is designed to be an interactive tool.
[00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:18.500]   You make your input, you see the outputs,
[00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:20.140]   and you can flip back and forth.
[00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:22.940]   You can see all the outputs.
[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:26.100]   But if you wanna produce it, produce a report, a PDF,
[00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:29.060]   you can produce a PDF file from this page,
[00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:32.260]   and you can arrange that in a landscape orientation
[00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:33.660]   or portrait orientation.
[00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:35.980]   It creates an input report, an output report.
[00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:39.340]   I'm not gonna do it, but it generates a PDF file,
[00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:41.620]   and you can print it, share it with someone else,
[00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:43.340]   whatever you wanna do with it.
[00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:46.100]   Okay, with all that said, now let's do some analysis.
[00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:49.700]   So based on all these inputs,
[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:51.460]   how's this couple gonna fare?
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:55.580]   So I'm gonna start off by doing a Monte Carlo analysis
[00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:57.580]   on scenario one.
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:58:01.180]   And to do that, I'd select this,
[00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:05.300]   but the analysis type that I'm going to do is shown in red.
[00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:08.220]   Right now, it's Monte Carlo is selected.
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:10.140]   If you wanna do historical, you click that,
[00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:11.980]   and see it changes to red.
[00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:13.700]   I'm gonna go back to Monte Carlo
[00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:16.820]   and click update the active analysis.
[00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:18.780]   And it's gonna take several seconds.
[00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:20.420]   It's gonna do that analysis.
[00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:23.420]   There it is.
[00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:29.900]   And so there are two primary things shown here.
[00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:33.060]   The red line sneaking through the middle there
[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:37.540]   is the fixed rate analysis
[00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:41.700]   based on average rates of return of each account.
[00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:45.140]   And then the blue bands are the Monte Carlo analysis.
[00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:53.060]   The product goal uses 500 different test cases
[00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:55.500]   in its Monte Carlo analysis.
[00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:59.540]   And the blue bands are trying to show you
[00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:02.420]   the distribution of those results
[00:59:02.420 --> 00:59:04.500]   across all 500 test cases.
[00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:07.820]   And they're arranged by a percentile.
[00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:11.500]   They're 10% bands.
[00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:14.500]   The lowest band is not shown,
[00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:16.780]   and neither is the highest band.
[00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:19.380]   So the first band down at the bottom
[00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:21.540]   is the results that show up
[00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:24.340]   in the 10th to the 20th percentile.
[00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:27.260]   This is the 20th to the 30th, and so on up.
[00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:30.460]   So this is the 80th to the 90th percentile.
[00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:31.300]   With the cursor on there,
[00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:35.180]   it shows you what percentile range we're talking about.
[00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:40.180]   So you can see, based on the standard deviation
[00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:44.460]   that I specified earlier,
[00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:49.460]   we get quite a bit of a range in these results over time.
[00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:52.780]   But in this particular case,
[00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:57.380]   the company had a 98% success rate
[00:59:57.380 --> 01:00:00.980]   at the end of their life.
[01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:03.500]   So I'd say that's pretty good.
[01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.900]   - Stuart, this is Jim. I have a question.
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:06.740]   - Yes, Jim.
[01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:09.180]   - I noticed when you set up the original assets,
[01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:10.500]   you put the stock market, I think,
[01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:13.380]   at 5% with a 20% standard deviation.
[01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:16.100]   That's reflected here, right?
[01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:18.780]   That's some of what you're seeing here.
[01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:21.660]   My question is, I'm not used to thinking about it
[01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:23.260]   within a standard deviation world.
[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:26.020]   Is that typical, or what would you say
[01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:29.380]   about the way you set this up with the 5 and 20?
[01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:32.980]   - Well, the Monte Carlo analysis is based on,
[01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:35.860]   you use it, random rates of return.
[01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:37.180]   Yeah, I mean, what it's trying to do
[01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:40.740]   is simulate market volatility.
[01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:45.380]   And it does that by using random rates of return,
[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:49.380]   using a normal distribution.
[01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:53.580]   And to do that, it needs to generate random numbers.
[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:56.900]   And those random numbers are based on two things.
[01:00:56.900 --> 01:01:01.900]   One is the mean, which we define over here.
[01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:04.620]   - Yeah, I guess my question is more,
[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:09.500]   how would you describe a 5% return, 20% standard deviation?
[01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:13.540]   Is that like the '80s, or is it like the market is now?
[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:15.660]   How would you give people a feel
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:17.300]   for how you put that input in?
[01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:20.220]   - Well, I'll tell you, I'm gonna give you tips
[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:21.420]   from bogey heads.
[01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:25.980]   You see this link right there I didn't mention?
[01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:29.580]   Oh, well, I'm sorry, I'm sharing my screen.
[01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:31.460]   That's gonna mess me up big time.
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:32.940]   Oh, well, here it is.
[01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:34.820]   Did everybody see that?
[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:43.260]   - Yeah, we saw it, yes.
[01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:47.100]   - I mean, are you still seeing the spreadsheet
[01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:50.460]   or are you seeing the Bogey Heads website?
[01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:52.740]   - We're actually seeing the spreadsheet.
[01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:53.900]   It could be that you asked,
[01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:56.820]   you told it to share the Excel application,
[01:01:56.820 --> 01:01:58.580]   but you can also share your screen.
[01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:00.980]   - Yeah, I'll just...
[01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:06.380]   - Actually, I've got a question I posted in the chat,
[01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:07.980]   but are there defaults?
[01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:09.300]   For most people that aren't familiar
[01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:11.300]   with the recommended standard deviations
[01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:12.180]   or current thinking,
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:14.580]   are there defaults built in that we can use?
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:17.540]   - Absolutely, so that's right here.
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:19.580]   I'm just gonna click it.
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:23.060]   I don't know that, I'm gonna click and see what it does.
[01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:28.780]   But yeah, yes, and those are the defaults.
[01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:32.220]   So I just clicked to load the defaults.
[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:34.940]   What it did was load these three asset classes
[01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:39.940]   and it used this rate of return
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:41.620]   and this standard deviation.
[01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:43.940]   And so the tips on the Bogey Heads there,
[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:47.980]   I thought that was, that's a pretty good article
[01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:50.220]   on the website there that provides,
[01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:56.340]   it provides historical rates of return
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:03:00.100]   for various asset classes, stocks and bonds,
[01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:02.540]   and what the standard deviations have been.
[01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:08.660]   And it also, there's other pieces on that webpage
[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:10.540]   that show what they predicted,
[01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:12.900]   someone predicts it's going to be in the future.
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:14.740]   I think John Bogle is one of the people
[01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:17.020]   who contributed to that at one point in time.
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:19.740]   I think his inputs were there last time I looked at it.
[01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:22.740]   - Yeah, he's the, if you click the link,
[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:24.140]   it takes you to the wiki,
[01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:27.180]   the historical and expected returns page on the wiki.
[01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:30.380]   - Okay, Bob, if you want to share your screen,
[01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:31.700]   you could show it.
[01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:34.780]   - Okay, yeah, it might be easier.
[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:39.780]   Let me, I've got mine on full screen now.
[01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:45.820]   - Should I stop sharing?
[01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:47.260]   - No.
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:48.220]   - Yeah, go ahead and stop.
[01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:49.860]   You can restart after we're done here.
[01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:51.340]   - Okay, okay, there we go.
[01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:59.220]   - I see there's a comment in the chat window
[01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:04.220]   that Joel uses 6% nominal with a 20% standard deviation.
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:13.260]   - There's also somebody asking as to
[01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:15.500]   whether there's a silver edition available
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:17.820]   in between the bronze and gold.
[01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:20.900]   - Not, no, there is not.
[01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:23.580]   At one point in time, there was one,
[01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:26.980]   but there's not currently.
[01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:28.620]   - So can y'all see my screen now?
[01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:32.860]   - I'm still seeing the asset class screen.
[01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:34.380]   - Oh, we're seeing, Bob, you're sharing.
[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:35.220]   That's your screen, yeah.
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:36.580]   - I'll go to my mouse.
[01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:40.980]   So yeah, if you click on the tips from Bogleheads,
[01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:49.100]   it takes you there, which has...
[01:04:49.100 --> 01:05:00.340]   Anybody see what I'm looking at?
[01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:01.740]   - Yes, very helpful, thank you.
[01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:03.620]   - All right, that's all it did.
[01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:05.460]   Just wanted to illustrate what was happening
[01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:06.460]   if you click the...
[01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:11.740]   All right, I'm not sharing it.
[01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:14.500]   (mouse clicking)
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:16.500]   Okay.
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:27.580]   Okay, are we back to me now?
[01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:30.140]   - Yeah, go ahead, Stuart, thank you.
[01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:31.340]   - Okay, sure.
[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:34.500]   So Jim, did that get your question answered, sort of?
[01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:37.660]   - Yes, I'm gonna dig into that page that you guys said
[01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:39.700]   and try to understand the feel for it.
[01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:42.100]   I do a lot of statistical things,
[01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:44.460]   but I never really looked at it in the market.
[01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:45.860]   - Okay.
[01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:50.860]   So you can see there's a little bit
[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:54.660]   of a yellow line showing up back there.
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:57.300]   That's because we did, I think it's probably
[01:05:57.300 --> 01:06:01.020]   because I clicked that load to defaults
[01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:04.740]   and it changed the rates returned just a little bit.
[01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:07.380]   So I'm gonna update the analysis.
[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:09.820]   And it's...
[01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:14.820]   And there it is, okay.
[01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:18.860]   And so that's a Monte Carlo analysis.
[01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:21.340]   And again, the last, the success rate
[01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:23.900]   over the last 10 years of the modeling period
[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:26.780]   up to the death of the wife is shown here.
[01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:30.020]   It's nearly 100%.
[01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:31.780]   You can also show expenses.
[01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:34.100]   The title is Total Savings and Total Spend.
[01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:37.660]   You can show expenses here as well.
[01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.700]   And it shows up, it's calibrated
[01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:41.860]   against the scale on the right.
[01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:44.020]   And there's this gray band here
[01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:48.220]   where the dashed line is the expenses
[01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:53.220]   with the fixed rate, fixed rate return expenses.
[01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:59.580]   And the gray band around that is the Monte Carlo analysis.
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:06.380]   So as you earn more, if you're doing well
[01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:10.100]   in your Monte Carlo analysis,
[01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:12.620]   you're gonna, your accounts are gonna earn more.
[01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:14.220]   You're gonna be paying more taxes.
[01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:18.420]   And that's probably what causes the certain amount
[01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:21.500]   of width in that band of expenses there.
[01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:24.620]   But it's, I built in the ability to hide it
[01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:27.860]   because it lays on top of that, of the blue bands.
[01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:29.900]   And sometimes it can be very wide
[01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:31.540]   and almost cover up the blue bands.
[01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:34.780]   So therefore I generally run with it hidden.
[01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:38.420]   We wanna look at historical results.
[01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:39.940]   I will click it and then I'll describe
[01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:41.220]   how it works briefly.
[01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:47.740]   Okay, there's a result using historical analysis.
[01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:52.860]   When I was, so this is using historical data
[01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:55.700]   and I needed to show you where that is defined
[01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:59.300]   on the financial assets, historical data.
[01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:04.980]   And here's, so this has historical data built into it
[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:09.540]   and it has S&P returns based from Robert Shiller
[01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:12.460]   go all the way back to 1871.
[01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:17.180]   And then there's information from, let's see,
[01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:22.180]   the Stern School of Business has the treasury bills
[01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:26.220]   and treasury bonds data going back to 1928.
[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:28.060]   And that's, so that's what these are.
[01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:31.460]   These are the historic returns that I just described,
[01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:33.980]   Shiller returns, these are the Sterns returns.
[01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:38.860]   And if you have your own data that you can use,
[01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:41.260]   that you wanna define for your own asset classes,
[01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:45.020]   you can do that with these extra columns over here.
[01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:49.780]   But for this example, we're using this,
[01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:54.700]   the history data that I got from Shiller and Sterns.
[01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:58.020]   And so the way that the historic analysis works
[01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:03.020]   is it just runs through these sequences one after another.
[01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:06.540]   And so let's say that, just to make it simple,
[01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:09.220]   let's say I have 50, I have,
[01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:12.100]   let's say I have a hundred years worth of history data
[01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:15.620]   and the lifespan that I'm gonna model is 50 years.
[01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:20.620]   So the first test case I do is to do 50 years of history,
[01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:25.460]   beginning with the 1928 data and go 50 years.
[01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:30.460]   So that's test case one, is the 1928 through 1978 data.
[01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:34.980]   And then for test case two,
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:39.380]   I'll start with 1929 and go through 1979.
[01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:44.380]   Test case three starts with 1930 through 1980 and so on,
[01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:49.380]   until we can't go any further without running out of data.
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:54.380]   So if I have a hundred years of history data
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:57.060]   and a 50 year lifespan,
[01:09:57.060 --> 01:10:01.700]   that means I can get about 50 years worth of,
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:03.860]   I can get 50 test cases.
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:07.580]   So that's fundamentally what this thing is doing.
[01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:11.380]   When I run a historical analysis,
[01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:14.000]   it uses the history data that's available.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.780]   And based on the lifespan of the people we're modeling,
[01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:21.260]   it will do as many test cases as it can.
[01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:24.300]   And then it will present the distribution of results
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:28.580]   by percentile using these blue bands, like you see here.
[01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:33.580]   And in this case, the success rate is much lower at only 79%.
[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:37.300]   Okay.
[01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:40.140]   So that is the fundamental analysis.
[01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:44.500]   Let me see, what I wanna do, hit on a few other things.
[01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:48.220]   - We have a question I can throw in here.
[01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:50.140]   Could you describe some of the major differences
[01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:52.380]   in the bronze and gold and maybe of the things
[01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:54.540]   you've covered so far and what you would see
[01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:55.740]   in bronze versus gold?
[01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:56.580]   - Oh, right.
[01:10:56.580 --> 01:10:57.940]   Yeah, sure, sure, sure.
[01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:02.940]   Bronze is a pretty high fidelity calculator as well,
[01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:08.500]   but it does not do detailed tax calculations.
[01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:13.500]   And it doesn't, it basically specify income stream
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:15.860]   by it starts here, it ends here.
[01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:16.980]   Here's the income.
[01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:18.260]   Here's how much it is.
[01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:20.780]   This is how much it inflates per year.
[01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:23.220]   And that's how you define income.
[01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:25.620]   Expenses is basically the same way.
[01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:30.180]   It doesn't get into these detailed, nuanced expenses,
[01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:33.020]   such as how to model property, mortgages,
[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:36.340]   healthcare, and college educations, all that.
[01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:38.100]   You just list the expenses.
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:42.100]   When they start, when they end, are they fixed expenses?
[01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:44.900]   Do they inflate with inflation, change with inflation?
[01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:51.060]   And you specify the tax rate that you expect to use,
[01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:53.020]   the effective tax rate.
[01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:58.020]   And that's what it does, but it does generate RMDs.
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:02.180]   You don't have to specify what RMD is.
[01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:04.060]   It knows how to calculate RMDs.
[01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:09.780]   It does do Monte Carlo analysis.
[01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:10.740]   Though it's much simpler.
[01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:11.580]   It's much simpler.
[01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:13.220]   It runs much quicker than this one.
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:17.820]   It does not do the historical analysis.
[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:22.300]   It does present the data in tabular form,
[01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:25.180]   as well as in graphical form.
[01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:28.460]   But it's a much, much simpler calculator,
[01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:30.780]   much easier to use.
[01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:35.020]   Both of these have a user manual that goes with them,
[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:39.500]   the bronze manual, probably 20 or 30 pages.
[01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:42.860]   The gold manual is 180 pages.
[01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:48.860]   So this one, the gold will do Roth optimizations.
[01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:52.820]   Bronze will not.
[01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:58.060]   Gold will, it does detailed modeling
[01:12:58.060 --> 01:12:59.860]   of your social security.
[01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:03.460]   It will tell you the optimum age to start
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:05.980]   your social security, for both husband and wife.
[01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:07.340]   Bronze will not do that.
[01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:10.340]   So that's an overview.
[01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:14.900]   Does that generally cover what you wanted to hear?
[01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:16.140]   - Yes, very good.
[01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:18.060]   There are a few questions I could ask now.
[01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:20.140]   Someone said they opened up the bronze version,
[01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:21.820]   put Joe's age at 42,
[01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:25.660]   and they got a circular reference on Excel.
[01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:27.180]   I don't want to belabor that one,
[01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:28.780]   but just thought I'd mention it.
[01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:31.180]   - Oh, okay.
[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:38.580]   Okay, I think I'm going to guess one.
[01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:39.940]   I know what it is.
[01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:44.580]   Yeah, one of the things that the bronze calculator does
[01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:47.620]   is it does iterative calculations on taxes.
[01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:49.100]   Gold does not.
[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:51.900]   And if you do not have it set up to run,
[01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:55.620]   it's possible you have another Excel file
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:58.020]   that has come up and it's taken Excel
[01:13:58.020 --> 01:14:00.180]   out of the iterative calculation mode,
[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:03.620]   you will get a circular calculation error every time.
[01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:07.980]   Because basically, if Excel does iterative calculations,
[01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:11.420]   it has circular references.
[01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:14.940]   But if it's in the iterative mode,
[01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:17.980]   it will iterate until it resolves the answer.
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:19.380]   So that's how we do it.
[01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:22.300]   So the calculation, the circular references
[01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:27.300]   are not a problem until you turn off iterative calculations.
[01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:28.340]   So if you-
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:29.180]   - All right.
[01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:30.580]   - Pardon me?
[01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:31.420]   - Yes, thank you.
[01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:32.940]   Okay.
[01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:33.780]   Second question.
[01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:38.820]   Second question, you may have covered it,
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:39.660]   I may have missed it,
[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:43.580]   but could you describe anything about health care,
[01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:47.420]   premium tax credits or subsidies?
[01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:49.740]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:54.660]   Let me go back to that.
[01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:57.660]   We're going over that maybe too quickly.
[01:14:57.660 --> 01:15:04.820]   I think premium tax credits and subsidies are synonymous.
[01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:11.300]   And so the subsidy depends on a few things.
[01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:15.460]   One of which is this benchmark cost
[01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:19.540]   of the silver plan cost.
[01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:21.620]   I don't know if I can quote with a term,
[01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:24.540]   it's the second lowest cost silver plan
[01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:26.700]   in your geographical area.
[01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:32.460]   And so that is taken into account.
[01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:34.980]   Also your modified adjusted gross income.
[01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:38.820]   You have got to be between one times and four times
[01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:42.220]   the federal poverty level to qualify for a subsidy.
[01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:45.060]   If you do qualify,
[01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:48.940]   then the tool will calculate your subsidy
[01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:51.780]   based on this number here
[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:53.860]   and your modified adjusted gross income.
[01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:58.860]   So the Obamacare algorithm determines
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:04.300]   how much you're expected to pay for your insurance
[01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:08.500]   based on your magic.
[01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:11.780]   And so the tool does that behind the scenes here.
[01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:12.620]   - Yeah, thank you.
[01:16:12.620 --> 01:16:13.820]   I must've stepped,
[01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:15.420]   I had to take care of a personal problem.
[01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:16.940]   I must've just missed that slide.
[01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:18.260]   - So does that answer it for you?
[01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:19.700]   - Yes.
[01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:22.100]   Do you anticipate making some changes for this?
[01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:24.620]   There's just recently they passed some law last Thursday
[01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:27.020]   with raising the subsidy.
[01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:27.860]   Okay.
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:28.700]   Could you speak to that?
[01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:30.380]   - I have to familiarize myself exactly
[01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:32.860]   with what to change and then I will do it.
[01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:34.340]   - Okay, thank you.
[01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:38.100]   We have some questions about Roth conversion optimization.
[01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:40.140]   If you could demonstrate that or speak to it.
[01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:40.980]   - Yes, I was going to go.
[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:42.420]   I was going to get to that.
[01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:46.340]   I was going to use a different example.
[01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:50.020]   I did a Roth conversion on this particular example,
[01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:51.020]   but it was not very,
[01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:55.220]   basically it's not very effective to do a Roth conversion.
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:56.780]   Let me show you real quick.
[01:16:56.780 --> 01:17:00.740]   So you do, that's what it falls under analysis.
[01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:03.980]   And there are some sub pages here.
[01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:06.140]   Plan Roth conversions is one of them.
[01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:11.180]   And again, it's oriented scenario one, scenario two,
[01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:14.260]   scenario three for both husband and wife.
[01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:16.820]   I need to get this thing out of the way again.
[01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:26.980]   So the input fields over here are for the husband.
[01:17:29.140 --> 01:17:30.860]   These over here are for the wife.
[01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:36.780]   Basically, you can either say,
[01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:38.940]   we're not going to do conversions.
[01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:41.380]   We're going to do, I'm going to click this,
[01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:45.700]   but you can do fixed duration conversions.
[01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:51.740]   We're basically just going to start.
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:54.740]   So there's three different options.
[01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:55.700]   We're not going to do any.
[01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:58.580]   We're going to do a fixed duration conversion
[01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:01.260]   or we're going to do a tax bracket up,
[01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:04.220]   tax bracket restricted conversion.
[01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:07.580]   So for this right here, we're showing fixed duration.
[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:09.860]   It's going to start in a particular year.
[01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:11.260]   We're going to do this percentage
[01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:13.100]   of the tax deferred account.
[01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:16.620]   We're going to do it over a period of this many years.
[01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:20.380]   And that's what we're going to do.
[01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:22.940]   Meanwhile, you can do the wife
[01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:25.740]   and either do them or not do them also.
[01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:27.980]   Give you both fixed duration,
[01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:30.980]   but you can say independently of the husband,
[01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:32.300]   this is when she's going to start.
[01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:34.340]   This is how, what percentage of her account
[01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:37.220]   we're going to convert over so many years,
[01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:40.300]   three years, whatever, however many years you want to take.
[01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:41.340]   That's how you do it.
[01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:47.140]   If you do, incidentally, you can see,
[01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:49.500]   we just, I just did that and it changed it.
[01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:50.620]   And it said, okay,
[01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:53.500]   that made $126 difference over the long term.
[01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:55.740]   Not much difference.
[01:18:55.740 --> 01:19:00.740]   So now let's look at tax bracket restricted.
[01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:04.180]   The only thing that changed here is
[01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:07.420]   how many years you want to do it over.
[01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:09.220]   It is no longer a factor.
[01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:10.060]   It'll do it.
[01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:11.980]   It'll do it as quickly as it can,
[01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:14.420]   given the, how much you can put in the,
[01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:16.260]   how much you can do,
[01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:19.100]   given the limit of the tax bracket that you specified.
[01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:20.580]   Now we're here.
[01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:23.500]   We said, this is max tax bracket I wanted to use.
[01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:27.340]   I do not want to get out of the 22% tax bracket
[01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:29.620]   while we're still under TCJA.
[01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:34.220]   If we, once we get beyond that out in 2026,
[01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:36.500]   the 22% bracket is going to go away.
[01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:39.380]   It's going to be replaced with a 25% bracket.
[01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:43.780]   So you'll see the options in here have two different values,
[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:45.580]   but basically there are seven,
[01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:49.780]   there's seven brackets that the dual is good.
[01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:53.140]   And depending on which tax law we're under,
[01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:58.140]   it's either 24% or 28%, 32%, 33% and so on.
[01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:03.860]   So you can, so in this case,
[01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:07.020]   we've said we're going to do 50% of the account
[01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:08.740]   starting in that year.
[01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:12.260]   With a limit of this 22% or 25% bracket,
[01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:15.300]   you can see the red line indicates
[01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:17.460]   the results of the projection.
[01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:22.460]   The fixed rate projection over time is worse initially,
[01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:25.900]   but it slowly gains ground because you're paying,
[01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:28.300]   now here you begin to pay less tax
[01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:33.300]   'cause you've got the money out of the tax deferred account
[01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:36.780]   and the RMDs are lower, therefore the taxes are lower.
[01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:39.420]   So the Roth starts gaining ground.
[01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:41.980]   And ultimately though, it doesn't quite get there.
[01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:44.940]   So that's how that can be done.
[01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:47.220]   And then you can finally optimize it.
[01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:51.220]   And I'm going to just do that and we'll see what it does.
[01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:52.900]   I mean, when you do optimize,
[01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:57.220]   it does a husband and wife together.
[01:20:57.220 --> 01:21:02.220]   It uses the tax bracket restricted method
[01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:06.660]   and tries to figure out what percentage of the account
[01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:07.900]   gives the best result
[01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:10.820]   and which tax bracket gives the best result.
[01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:12.460]   And then it presents it here.
[01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:21.020]   In this case, it's saying converting 25% of the account
[01:21:21.260 --> 01:21:26.260]   is best, staying under the 10% bracket is best.
[01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:29.900]   It basically makes no difference.
[01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:33.860]   It's only a $2,800 difference over the long-term.
[01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:39.140]   However, that's using absolute dollars.
[01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:44.260]   The one thing we do know is that money in a Roth account
[01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:47.420]   is worth more than money that's in a tax deferred account.
[01:21:47.420 --> 01:21:52.420]   So the tool will recalculate based on
[01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:57.780]   the average marginal rate over your lifetime.
[01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:00.980]   And it will decide what are the effective
[01:22:00.980 --> 01:22:02.260]   number of dollars involved.
[01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:05.220]   In this case, the Roth conversion looks a little bit better
[01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:06.980]   but not still not very impressive.
[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:09.980]   $16,000 better long-term.
[01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:14.380]   So anyway, this is not a very dramatic example.
[01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:17.300]   I do have a different one that I can use
[01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:22.300]   that let me go just do that, let me go just do that.
[01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:23.820]   - Yeah, let me check with,
[01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:25.380]   Margaret asked that question originally.
[01:22:25.380 --> 01:22:26.780]   Margaret, does that answer your question?
[01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:29.500]   Or do you have any detailed Roth conversion question?
[01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:32.300]   - I'd actually like to see the other case
[01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:37.300]   where you've got higher amounts in the tax deferred
[01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:39.260]   if you have something along those lines.
[01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:40.260]   - Yes, ma'am, I do.
[01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:42.620]   So let me, I'm gonna leave.
[01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:46.060]   I'm gonna go back to the homepage.
[01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:51.060]   I'm gonna go to this subpage called simplified inputs.
[01:22:51.060 --> 01:22:55.740]   And so this is what you might use if you're just gonna,
[01:22:55.740 --> 01:22:58.060]   I just brought up this really complicated tool.
[01:22:58.060 --> 01:23:00.780]   I really don't wanna read a hundred page manual today.
[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:02.260]   I wanna put in some basic things
[01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:04.700]   like I might have a really simple calculator
[01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:05.780]   and I just wanna get started.
[01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:06.940]   I wanna kind of see how it goes.
[01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:09.180]   So this is what I'm gonna use for this example.
[01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:13.340]   So again, just 3%, 3% inflation,
[01:23:13.340 --> 01:23:16.540]   $2 million in a tax deferred account.
[01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:21.540]   And in a couple of it's already basically retired.
[01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:27.660]   So I'm gonna go ahead and tell it to go ahead
[01:23:27.660 --> 01:23:30.380]   and populate the tool with these simple inputs.
[01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:31.780]   And it's, are you sure you wanna do it?
[01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:34.380]   Yes, I wanna do this.
[01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:37.180]   So right now it's populating those pages
[01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:39.940]   we already looked at with this simple data.
[01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:42.220]   It's eliminated everything I put in before.
[01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:46.700]   Put in the case, it says it's done.
[01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:49.500]   Now we're gonna go do the homepage
[01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:51.340]   and just take a quick look.
[01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:54.020]   Here's the initial balances.
[01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:57.460]   Now you can see we've got the $2 million in tax deferred,
[01:23:57.460 --> 01:24:00.660]   500K in regular.
[01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:02.460]   And now let's go back over here.
[01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:08.820]   And let's start just by running an analysis.
[01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:11.220]   Let's see, you know, with no Roth conversions,
[01:24:11.220 --> 01:24:13.420]   let's see what this looks like real quickly.
[01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:18.820]   Okay, we're doing, okay, that's a historical analysis.
[01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:22.900]   I'm gonna switch and do Monte Carlo.
[01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:32.820]   Okay, now let's go do a Roth conversion.
[01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:39.260]   All I gotta do is come here and click optimize.
[01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:42.300]   (mouse clicking)
[01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:46.300]   First thing it does is it doesn't really know
[01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:48.380]   what you've already done in Monte Carlo analysis
[01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:51.220]   to compare to, so it's gonna do that first.
[01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:52.420]   So that's what it just did.
[01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:55.100]   Now it's working on the optimization
[01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:56.580]   and the Roth conversion.
[01:24:56.580 --> 01:25:05.540]   It's saying here the Roth optimization
[01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:09.220]   does yield better results than not doing it.
[01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:12.100]   And get that out of the way.
[01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:15.020]   In terms of, okay, it's quite a bit better this time.
[01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:18.300]   That's still in terms of the effective dollars.
[01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:21.300]   Let's look in terms of absolute dollars.
[01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:24.340]   Okay, so this is just count all dollars same.
[01:25:24.340 --> 01:25:26.540]   A dollar in tax deferred is just as good
[01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:31.540]   as a dollar in Roth in this particular graph.
[01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:34.580]   You can see, so the blue line is the baseline.
[01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:36.020]   The red line is the what if line
[01:25:36.020 --> 01:25:38.060]   if we actually do this Roth conversion.
[01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:40.060]   That's what it's gonna look like.
[01:25:40.060 --> 01:25:41.740]   So you can see there's a crossover point
[01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:45.300]   out there in 2043 or so.
[01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:47.340]   All of a sudden now from that point forward,
[01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:49.060]   the Roth is better.
[01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:50.460]   It falls behind initially
[01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:52.820]   because we got the big tax bill to pay
[01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:54.700]   as we do the conversions.
[01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:56.140]   But now we're gaining ground
[01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:58.100]   because we have less taxes to pay
[01:25:58.100 --> 01:26:00.180]   because of the lower RMDs.
[01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:03.100]   So it goes on and gains and keeps on gaining
[01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:04.940]   from there on out.
[01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:06.820]   And one thing that I'll point out here
[01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:09.540]   is that I think the key is
[01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:14.540]   that we have to get apples and apples.
[01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:16.900]   We got the same rate of return
[01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:18.540]   across all of these accounts.
[01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:21.700]   You could make this example look really bad
[01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:24.860]   if you had a great rate of return on a tax deferred
[01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:27.420]   but a poor rate of return on the Roth account.
[01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:31.380]   In this case, we're talking apples and apples.
[01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:33.820]   So you can see that over time,
[01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:36.340]   the Roth account gets ahead.
[01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:39.180]   But if we look in terms of effective dollars,
[01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:41.380]   it's ahead from the get-go
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:44.620]   and stays ahead by the amount of 400
[01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:47.300]   and then ultimately ends $400,000 ahead.
[01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:56.420]   So is that a better example?
[01:26:56.420 --> 01:27:01.220]   - Yeah, that's much better.
[01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:06.220]   So do you then produce some kind of a year-by-year chart
[01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:11.260]   that will show how much is being converted each year
[01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:13.580]   and what tax brackets it's optimizing on?
[01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:18.460]   - Yes, as under the tabular projections.
[01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:20.220]   Let's go back to...
[01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:26.820]   Gotta get this thing out of the way again.
[01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:31.660]   Withdrawals.
[01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:42.020]   Here are those Roth conversions.
[01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:47.140]   This is the amount every year.
[01:27:47.140 --> 01:27:49.260]   In today's dollars,
[01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:51.500]   there's the amount in future year dollars.
[01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:55.740]   Let's see, let's look at the taxes.
[01:27:55.740 --> 01:27:57.540]   Let's see, it said...
[01:27:57.540 --> 01:27:59.540]   Let me refresh my memory here.
[01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:04.540]   It said the 12 to 15%, 12 or 15% bracket.
[01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:11.380]   And you can see, and that is what it is.
[01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:18.140]   And out here is actually years up every dollar
[01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:24.100]   in that bracket, in those brackets.
[01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:30.660]   And so the amount of taxes.
[01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:35.660]   So the federal income tax, let's see.
[01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:39.300]   I'm gonna have to...
[01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:40.140]   To do what I wanna do,
[01:28:40.140 --> 01:28:42.780]   I gotta bring those Excel menus back to the top,
[01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:46.060]   but I wanna use the tool to add these numbers for me.
[01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:53.700]   So with the Roth conversions going on,
[01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:57.980]   the taxes pays $417,000.
[01:28:57.980 --> 01:28:59.620]   But if we come back over here
[01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:03.540]   and turn off those conversions,
[01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:08.060]   and go back,
[01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:12.980]   we can see now we're paying $768,000
[01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:14.300]   in federal income tax.
[01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:20.620]   So that's why the Roth conversion is advantageous.
[01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:23.060]   It reduces those taxes substantially.
[01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:27.060]   (mouse clicking)
[01:29:27.060 --> 01:29:29.980]   And so here's what the accounts are doing.
[01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:34.700]   The tax deferred account begins.
[01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:36.140]   Oh, excuse me.
[01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:38.140]   I gotta go back and turn that on again.
[01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:45.860]   Okay, we're back to that.
[01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:49.220]   And so we start off with $2 million
[01:29:49.220 --> 01:29:51.260]   in the tax deferred account.
[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:56.260]   And then the Roth account is coming up here.
[01:29:56.260 --> 01:30:02.260]   You can see it's getting bigger and bigger as we go.
[01:30:02.260 --> 01:30:05.020]   And if you wanna do,
[01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:06.700]   you could put these on the same page.
[01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:09.220]   I don't currently have them on the same page,
[01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:11.820]   but you could get them on the same page
[01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:13.220]   with this view management.
[01:30:13.220 --> 01:30:19.580]   I'm just gonna demonstrate that for you right quick.
[01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:21.620]   I think I'll put on the accounts page.
[01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:22.460]   I'm gonna come over here.
[01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:27.460]   I'm gonna find that, those Roth conversions.
[01:30:27.460 --> 01:30:29.020]   Let's see if I can find it.
[01:30:29.020 --> 01:30:32.980]   (mouse clicking)
[01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:47.780]   Okay, here it is.
[01:30:48.620 --> 01:30:53.060]   Okay, so I've added that to the accounts page.
[01:30:53.060 --> 01:30:55.580]   Go back to it.
[01:30:55.580 --> 01:31:02.780]   And here are those Roth conversions here.
[01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:05.500]   As you can see, it messed up the headers.
[01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:06.340]   It does do this.
[01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:09.900]   Anytime you add data, you have to redo the headers.
[01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:12.500]   For now, just delete them.
[01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:18.060]   But if I wanna put these, so you can see,
[01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:20.060]   there's the tax deferred account.
[01:31:20.060 --> 01:31:21.540]   There's the Roth account.
[01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:23.340]   Here are the Roth conversions.
[01:31:23.340 --> 01:31:26.220]   I wanna move them over there where I can see it.
[01:31:26.220 --> 01:31:28.220]   Let's just put all these together.
[01:31:28.220 --> 01:31:33.620]   So there you go.
[01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:37.260]   There's the tax deferred account going down,
[01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:38.460]   Roth accounts going up,
[01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:40.300]   and these are the conversion amounts.
[01:31:41.300 --> 01:31:44.060]   (mouse clicking)
[01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:50.980]   Anything else in that regard?
[01:31:50.980 --> 01:31:52.820]   - Joel had a couple of follow-up questions.
[01:31:52.820 --> 01:31:55.500]   Joel, do you wanna explain your questions?
[01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:59.100]   - Sure, can you hear me?
[01:31:59.100 --> 01:32:00.620]   - Yes.
[01:32:00.620 --> 01:32:01.460]   - Great.
[01:32:01.460 --> 01:32:06.020]   So I've kind of built my own Roth conversion engine.
[01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:10.660]   And what I found was sort of a mixture of things
[01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:12.820]   worked best in my case.
[01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:16.620]   So I started retired at 58.
[01:32:16.620 --> 01:32:20.060]   So I had like five years where I could convert
[01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:23.420]   to a higher tax bracket and not worry about IRMA.
[01:32:23.420 --> 01:32:27.540]   But after IRMA hits, then I kind of went and said,
[01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:31.340]   "Okay, for the next 10 years, I wanna convert to 22%."
[01:32:31.340 --> 01:32:35.380]   But for the first five years, I wanna convert for 24%.
[01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:37.860]   And so I wanted to be able to mix and match
[01:32:37.860 --> 01:32:42.860]   a little bit more than what I saw in your demo.
[01:32:42.860 --> 01:32:46.460]   So I was wondering, is that capability there
[01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:50.180]   or is that maybe a future enhancement?
[01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:51.580]   - Partially, I'll show you one.
[01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:53.660]   Let's go back 'cause I skipped over that.
[01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:58.740]   It will let you specify an IRMA limit.
[01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:04.500]   It won't let you pick a different marginal tax bracket.
[01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:06.060]   It will go with one or the other.
[01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:07.380]   I mean, it would go with only one.
[01:33:07.380 --> 01:33:08.980]   You cannot change that.
[01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:11.660]   So yes, maybe a future enhancement for now.
[01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:12.500]   It's only one.
[01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:17.500]   However, it does let you specify the maximum IRMA bracket
[01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:19.060]   if you choose to.
[01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:20.540]   Right now it says there's no limit,
[01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:24.260]   but if you want to limit it in there
[01:33:24.260 --> 01:33:26.820]   so that Roth conversions don't drive
[01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:31.820]   your Medicare costs up, you can do that.
[01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:34.460]   - Okay.
[01:33:34.460 --> 01:33:37.180]   - It partially does what you ask, I think.
[01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:38.340]   - Okay.
[01:33:38.340 --> 01:33:39.500]   Yeah, I mean, this is a,
[01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:43.420]   Roth conversions are really tricky, tricky thing.
[01:33:43.420 --> 01:33:44.260]   - Indeed.
[01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:48.620]   One thing I failed to mention is that
[01:33:48.620 --> 01:33:53.620]   they always give respect to the ACA subsidies as well.
[01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:59.340]   A Roth conversion will never cost you a subsidy.
[01:33:59.340 --> 01:34:01.260]   So it will take it right up to the limit,
[01:34:01.260 --> 01:34:04.260]   but it won't take you that $1 over,
[01:34:04.260 --> 01:34:07.260]   such as you lose that Obamacare subsidy.
[01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:08.660]   It'll do everything it can.
[01:34:08.660 --> 01:34:10.420]   It'll get right up to the edge
[01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:14.820]   until you're no longer eligible for the ACA.
[01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:17.300]   When you've gone on Medicare, for example,
[01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:19.700]   then it'll go ahead and ease the Roth conversion.
[01:34:19.700 --> 01:34:22.340]   - Okay.
[01:34:22.340 --> 01:34:24.940]   And then sort of the second follow-up was,
[01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:27.700]   (audio cuts out)
[01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:34.420]   on equities.
[01:34:34.420 --> 01:34:39.420]   And the IRA would certainly be mostly bonds.
[01:34:39.420 --> 01:34:44.260]   So there would certainly be a difference
[01:34:44.260 --> 01:34:47.220]   in rate of return expected between the two.
[01:34:47.220 --> 01:34:51.900]   Assuming you guys are doing sort of a boggle head
[01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:58.100]   tax advantaged, tax aware analysis.
[01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:02.940]   It seems like that would be a good thing to assume
[01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:07.380]   is a Roth would have a higher rate of return than your IRA.
[01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:11.500]   Or am I not thinking about that correctly?
[01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:17.100]   - I'm an engineer, not an advisor.
[01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:18.660]   So I basically don't go there,
[01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:19.940]   but you can definitely do that.
[01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:21.100]   If that's what you think is right,
[01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:22.580]   you can most assuredly do it.
[01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:24.980]   - I did it this way.
[01:35:24.980 --> 01:35:27.500]   I just said, just kept a level playing field
[01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:32.500]   just so we could just see what the absolute--
[01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:35.180]   - Yeah, there's another tool IRRP
[01:35:35.180 --> 01:35:38.100]   where we have to do that level playing field.
[01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:41.780]   Otherwise the analysis kind of goes wonky
[01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:44.100]   when you try to optimize.
[01:35:44.100 --> 01:35:49.100]   And I was just curious that if you kind of kept it true
[01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:54.020]   where Roth would have a higher rate of return,
[01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:57.300]   how would that change your optimization then?
[01:35:57.300 --> 01:36:03.860]   - Well, it would use a higher rate of return.
[01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:05.780]   It would just go, I mean,
[01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:08.700]   the optimization will take that into account.
[01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:13.700]   - So what we see in IRRP is it really jacks up
[01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:18.540]   the Roth conversions quite a bit above
[01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:21.580]   what would seem to be practical
[01:36:21.580 --> 01:36:25.260]   because it's chasing that extra return
[01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:26.900]   as part of the optimization.
[01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:31.300]   So I think it might be interesting to sort of,
[01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:34.580]   if you could quickly demo or talk to it,
[01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:38.340]   how it would handle that.
[01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:39.540]   - Let me do it.
[01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:43.260]   Well, let's just say we're gonna go 100% stocks,
[01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:44.940]   0% bonds.
[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:46.100]   - Yeah.
[01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:46.940]   - Let's see.
[01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:50.460]   Okay, this was my selling.
[01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:52.860]   I gotta go over here and make a quick change.
[01:36:52.860 --> 01:36:54.020]   We'll say, what did we say?
[01:36:54.020 --> 01:36:57.140]   5% stocks, real return 5% stocks?
[01:36:57.140 --> 01:36:57.980]   - Yeah.
[01:36:57.980 --> 01:36:59.460]   - Bonds that good?
[01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:00.780]   - Sure, good enough.
[01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:01.620]   - Okay.
[01:37:01.620 --> 01:37:05.420]   So that gives us an overall real rate of return
[01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:09.780]   on the Roth account of 5% versus 3.5% on tax deferred.
[01:37:09.780 --> 01:37:11.660]   - Right.
[01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:13.580]   - Fair enough, okay.
[01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:15.180]   Now let's go see what we can do.
[01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:16.740]   - Um.
[01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:21.300]   - Let me just interrupt you for a second.
[01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:23.900]   Norman, are you saying you're gonna be starting
[01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:26.620]   in about, what, 18 minutes?
[01:37:26.620 --> 01:37:33.020]   - Yes.
[01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:35.340]   - Okay, we'll be done in eight, we'll make,
[01:37:35.340 --> 01:37:37.940]   we have a shared account here, which we're using.
[01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:39.940]   So we gotta wrap this up at 18 minutes
[01:37:39.940 --> 01:37:42.660]   because the San Francisco group is gonna be starting
[01:37:42.660 --> 01:37:45.220]   their meeting on real estate.
[01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:46.340]   And in fact, if Norman,
[01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:47.700]   if you wanna put the link out there,
[01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:49.900]   if anybody else wants to join into that one,
[01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:54.740]   but I'm gonna let Stuart follow up here.
[01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:56.420]   And then I wouldn't mind if Bob,
[01:37:56.420 --> 01:37:58.340]   if you would talk about how you use the tool
[01:37:58.340 --> 01:38:01.020]   because you helped orchestrate this whole meeting
[01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:06.980]   after Stuart finishes the Roth stuff.
[01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:10.260]   - Sure.
[01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:13.260]   (mouse clicking)
[01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:27.260]   Okay, so I just reran that example.
[01:38:27.260 --> 01:38:29.660]   You can see that, yeah, the difference is huge.
[01:38:29.660 --> 01:38:33.780]   That was a five and a half million dollar advantage
[01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:36.100]   in terms of effective dollars,
[01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:39.020]   or almost five and a half million dollars
[01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:40.380]   in absolute dollars.
[01:38:40.380 --> 01:38:44.740]   When you're getting a much better rate of return
[01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:45.740]   on the Roth account.
[01:38:45.740 --> 01:38:50.860]   - And did that, how did that change?
[01:38:50.860 --> 01:38:54.100]   What targets it picked for the optimization?
[01:38:54.100 --> 01:39:01.380]   - It went and said 90, switching 95% of the account
[01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:05.620]   and going up to 32, 33% on the tax bracket was the best.
[01:39:05.620 --> 01:39:08.060]   - Okay, so it really jumped up the tax bracket
[01:39:08.060 --> 01:39:10.260]   and the amount that it converted.
[01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:11.100]   - Yes.
[01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:13.060]   - Interesting.
[01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:13.980]   - But what it does,
[01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:17.540]   it just simply runs through all the possibilities
[01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:19.740]   and then it looks and sees which one's best
[01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:23.500]   and presents it.
[01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:25.820]   - Got it.
[01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:29.340]   - And then if you leave this page like this,
[01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:31.820]   that's what the model is gonna assume
[01:39:31.820 --> 01:39:35.660]   and all the other, anywhere else you go, this is it.
[01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:38.500]   So if you just want to play with it,
[01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:39.780]   didn't want to leave it there,
[01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:43.420]   then you got to go back and take it out of this mode.
[01:39:43.420 --> 01:39:47.340]   So just rotate between these three options.
[01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:49.340]   Okay.
[01:39:49.340 --> 01:39:55.100]   Is there anything, other questions
[01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:57.860]   or shall I show you just a couple more things or?
[01:39:57.860 --> 01:40:02.020]   - How about Bob, you take a minute
[01:40:02.020 --> 01:40:05.300]   and explain your situation in life
[01:40:05.300 --> 01:40:06.860]   and why you like the tool?
[01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:07.780]   - Oh, sure.
[01:40:07.780 --> 01:40:09.980]   - What features you use?
[01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:12.220]   - Bob, shall I stop sharing?
[01:40:12.220 --> 01:40:13.300]   - You can just leave that up.
[01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:14.900]   I'll just talk for a second.
[01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:19.300]   Right, I had initially planned
[01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:22.100]   when I purchased the tool in the last year
[01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:24.980]   to retire in June of this year and decided not to,
[01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:27.340]   but this is one of the things that happened to work.
[01:40:27.340 --> 01:40:30.460]   But I wanted to, my wife is already retired
[01:40:30.460 --> 01:40:33.860]   and I wanted to have confidence that we were making the,
[01:40:33.860 --> 01:40:37.780]   you know, I was under the impression from other tools
[01:40:37.780 --> 01:40:39.260]   that we were financially independent,
[01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:43.780]   but I liked some of the videos
[01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:45.700]   that I watched about ProLana Gold.
[01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:48.060]   And I think I've mentioned in the last meeting
[01:40:48.060 --> 01:40:50.460]   that can I retire now?
[01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:52.420]   Darren Kirkpatrick is a big fan.
[01:40:52.420 --> 01:40:54.700]   He's done reviews of all a number
[01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:57.780]   of different retirement calculators.
[01:40:57.780 --> 01:41:02.580]   And he is a huge fan of ProLana.
[01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:06.180]   And I wanted to ask Stewart, where did the name come from?
[01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:07.020]   - ProLana?
[01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:08.460]   - Yeah, what is ProLana?
[01:41:08.460 --> 01:41:09.980]   Does it have a meaning or?
[01:41:09.980 --> 01:41:14.860]   - Yeah, it's my great-grandmother's given name.
[01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:16.020]   - Oh, okay.
[01:41:16.020 --> 01:41:17.780]   - I was doing some genealogy work
[01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:21.100]   and I was spending a lot of time dealing with her
[01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:22.820]   when I started this business.
[01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:24.580]   And I was like, well, obviously I need a name.
[01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:25.420]   Well, I used it.
[01:41:25.420 --> 01:41:28.940]   - Well, you know, I've used it because,
[01:41:28.940 --> 01:41:32.500]   well, it modeled all our different income streams.
[01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:33.340]   I have a pension.
[01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:34.940]   My wife will have a pension.
[01:41:34.940 --> 01:41:36.540]   I haven't taken mine yet,
[01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:41.020]   but the tax effects of those things, social security.
[01:41:41.020 --> 01:41:45.140]   We own, have bought property
[01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:46.540]   where we plan to build a house.
[01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:47.820]   I modeled that.
[01:41:47.820 --> 01:41:52.020]   Some things that Stewart didn't show
[01:41:52.020 --> 01:41:55.780]   and he modeled some things that my kids are out of college.
[01:41:55.780 --> 01:41:58.700]   So 529 plans aren't relevant to me.
[01:41:58.700 --> 01:42:03.700]   I have health insurance through my retirement system.
[01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:08.820]   So I just, especially this page we're looking at now,
[01:42:08.820 --> 01:42:10.660]   this is something I was really concerned about
[01:42:10.660 --> 01:42:14.020]   because a lot of our, the vast majority of my assets
[01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:17.060]   are in our two tax deferred accounts,
[01:42:17.060 --> 01:42:20.940]   my 401, 403B and my wife's 401K.
[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:25.940]   So this gave me doing the various scenarios
[01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:31.340]   and just playing with what ifs, more confidence.
[01:42:31.340 --> 01:42:35.660]   I mean, I had used IORP and FireCalc
[01:42:35.660 --> 01:42:37.220]   and some of the other free tools.
[01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:41.700]   And there's, you know, and the one that's available
[01:42:41.700 --> 01:42:48.060]   through the Bottlehead site, which retirement--
[01:42:48.060 --> 01:42:51.100]   - I think it's a retiree portfolio model or something.
[01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:53.540]   - Yeah, retirement portfolio model.
[01:42:53.540 --> 01:42:54.580]   That I've used all of them.
[01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:59.580]   They all have some, just like anything,
[01:42:59.580 --> 01:43:02.060]   have advantages, disadvantages,
[01:43:02.060 --> 01:43:06.940]   but I really liked and still continue to like PraLana.
[01:43:06.940 --> 01:43:09.280]   And I think I told this story last time
[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:13.780]   that I started using it and I ran across an issue
[01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:16.180]   where it looked like my state tax for my pension
[01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:18.180]   wasn't being calculated right.
[01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:22.100]   I fired off an email and within an hour,
[01:43:22.100 --> 01:43:24.660]   I think Stuart answered it himself,
[01:43:24.660 --> 01:43:27.820]   telling me, you know, basically he answered the question,
[01:43:27.820 --> 01:43:31.140]   but he said it was in the manual very politely.
[01:43:31.140 --> 01:43:34.180]   And then from that point on, I started reading the manual,
[01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:39.180]   which has got, I mean, who writes 180 page manual anymore?
[01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:43.320]   But if you wanna know something about how the tool works,
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:44.980]   it's in the manual.
[01:43:44.980 --> 01:43:49.980]   And so I've made a point of reading the manual a lot more,
[01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:52.360]   but I think I've said enough.
[01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:55.140]   - Okay, one thing, a question came up
[01:43:55.140 --> 01:43:58.700]   and I think we should end this meeting in about six minutes.
[01:43:58.700 --> 01:44:02.540]   That'll give the San Francisco group
[01:44:02.540 --> 01:44:06.180]   about five minutes before, sorry to push against that.
[01:44:06.180 --> 01:44:08.900]   They've also included the Zoom link in the chat.
[01:44:08.900 --> 01:44:10.820]   So if anybody's interested in that,
[01:44:10.820 --> 01:44:14.060]   but the question that was two questions for Stuart.
[01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:17.500]   One, could you explain how the purchase licensing
[01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:20.240]   ongoing changes works in the future?
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:23.860]   - Yes, it's done on an annual basis.
[01:44:23.860 --> 01:44:28.140]   You buy the tool, I set it for $99.
[01:44:28.140 --> 01:44:30.020]   It's been $99 for years.
[01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:32.500]   I don't really anticipate changing that.
[01:44:32.500 --> 01:44:36.060]   And then it's always developed and released
[01:44:36.060 --> 01:44:38.780]   on a calendar year basis.
[01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:42.980]   So 2020, 2021, I'm releasing early January,
[01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:44.420]   as early as I can.
[01:44:44.420 --> 01:44:46.420]   And then I make updates throughout the year.
[01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:49.220]   If I need, if I find bugs, I fix them.
[01:44:49.220 --> 01:44:51.060]   I fix them as quickly as I possibly can.
[01:44:51.060 --> 01:44:52.740]   I put out a new version.
[01:44:52.740 --> 01:44:56.580]   You're in, if you're on the 2020, that year's license,
[01:44:56.580 --> 01:44:59.180]   you get all the updates for free, of course.
[01:44:59.180 --> 01:45:04.180]   And then I charge, I give a 50% discount
[01:45:04.180 --> 01:45:06.980]   to upgrade from one year to the next.
[01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:10.260]   So if you've got a license for 2021,
[01:45:10.260 --> 01:45:15.260]   you can upgrade to the 2022 model for $49.
[01:45:15.540 --> 01:45:18.100]   And as long as you keep, you keep up every year,
[01:45:18.100 --> 01:45:19.740]   it'll be $49.
[01:45:19.740 --> 01:45:22.420]   And then you get the new model
[01:45:22.420 --> 01:45:25.020]   and all the updates that come along with it.
[01:45:25.020 --> 01:45:28.980]   And I generally do not put out enhancements during the year.
[01:45:28.980 --> 01:45:32.500]   I just fix, I just fix problems that I discover
[01:45:32.500 --> 01:45:34.820]   or that someone discovers and brings to my attention.
[01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:35.980]   I fix them.
[01:45:35.980 --> 01:45:40.780]   And the tool is, as you can see, it's quite complex.
[01:45:40.780 --> 01:45:42.380]   There's a lot of data to enter into.
[01:45:42.380 --> 01:45:47.380]   It has the ability to export your data from one copy
[01:45:47.380 --> 01:45:50.860]   and import it into another copy.
[01:45:50.860 --> 01:45:52.380]   So it's relatively easy.
[01:45:52.380 --> 01:45:57.380]   It's not, it's not nothing, but it's relatively easy.
[01:45:57.380 --> 01:46:00.700]   Download the new model, import the data
[01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:02.980]   that you exported out of the previous one.
[01:46:02.980 --> 01:46:05.340]   And it's, compared to the way it used to be,
[01:46:05.340 --> 01:46:08.580]   those imports and exports run really quickly.
[01:46:08.580 --> 01:46:09.660]   - Okay, thank you.
[01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:11.020]   - They take several seconds.
[01:46:11.020 --> 01:46:12.900]   Can you spend four minutes and talk about
[01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:16.140]   the study sensitivities and optimization tabs?
[01:46:16.140 --> 01:46:16.980]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:46:16.980 --> 01:46:21.940]   So I like to go back to, I'm going to go back.
[01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:23.580]   I'm going to do what I just talked about, import.
[01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:26.820]   I'm going to import the file.
[01:46:26.820 --> 01:46:29.340]   Let me get back to where we started from.
[01:46:29.340 --> 01:46:30.860]   You're going to see exactly how long it takes
[01:46:30.860 --> 01:46:31.700]   to do an import.
[01:46:31.700 --> 01:46:33.140]   That's what I'm doing right now.
[01:46:33.140 --> 01:46:38.460]   Okay, that's it.
[01:46:38.460 --> 01:46:39.380]   It's done.
[01:46:40.700 --> 01:46:41.820]   I'm going to quickly go over here.
[01:46:41.820 --> 01:46:45.020]   I'm going to do, I'm going to rerun
[01:46:45.020 --> 01:46:46.700]   the analysis real quickly.
[01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:55.940]   Okay, I'm going to go to optimization.
[01:46:55.940 --> 01:46:58.820]   What I'm going to do run for you is optimize
[01:46:58.820 --> 01:47:00.540]   social security start ages.
[01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:03.060]   And this is not to say, this is the,
[01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:05.020]   it's not going to give you the ages where you,
[01:47:05.020 --> 01:47:08.340]   this is not going to give you the age
[01:47:08.340 --> 01:47:09.900]   at which you earn the most money.
[01:47:09.900 --> 01:47:11.700]   It's going to be the ages that result
[01:47:11.700 --> 01:47:14.900]   in the greatest savings at the end of your life.
[01:47:14.900 --> 01:47:17.100]   And so it's presented in this matrix.
[01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:21.340]   And the best answer is this dark green box
[01:47:21.340 --> 01:47:22.180]   in this matrix.
[01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:25.220]   So that's with Joe, when Joe is 68
[01:47:25.220 --> 01:47:27.380]   and Jane's start age is 65.
[01:47:27.380 --> 01:47:30.340]   That yields the greatest savings
[01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:32.100]   at the end of the modeling period.
[01:47:32.100 --> 01:47:37.140]   And, but these lighter green squares indicate
[01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:39.580]   choices that are almost as good.
[01:47:39.580 --> 01:47:42.140]   In this case, they're 99% as good.
[01:47:42.140 --> 01:47:44.660]   We say, well, what about the ones that are 98% as good?
[01:47:44.660 --> 01:47:45.900]   Let's look at that.
[01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:48.580]   Okay, there's a bunch more to pick from.
[01:47:48.580 --> 01:47:49.580]   Okay, so that's one.
[01:47:49.580 --> 01:47:52.340]   Now let's look at study sensitivities.
[01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:53.340]   It's this page here.
[01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:56.820]   So here is the fixed rate returns
[01:47:56.820 --> 01:47:58.860]   that was established when I ran the analysis
[01:47:58.860 --> 01:48:00.340]   just a while ago.
[01:48:00.340 --> 01:48:02.700]   And so now we can, we can do some what ifs.
[01:48:02.700 --> 01:48:08.180]   It lets you look at the effect of changes
[01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:10.140]   in the key parameters in the model.
[01:48:10.140 --> 01:48:12.180]   And the key parameters in question
[01:48:12.180 --> 01:48:14.140]   are the ones that are listed down here.
[01:48:14.140 --> 01:48:20.180]   And so let's look at, so here when I ran the analysis,
[01:48:20.180 --> 01:48:23.540]   it saved the setting of each of those parameters
[01:48:23.540 --> 01:48:26.100]   in that gray row right there.
[01:48:26.100 --> 01:48:28.020]   And so if I want to change those,
[01:48:28.020 --> 01:48:30.140]   I just click this up or down button here.
[01:48:30.140 --> 01:48:34.140]   So if I want to change inflation from three, raise it up,
[01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:34.980]   there's 3.1.
[01:48:34.980 --> 01:48:37.660]   And you can see that did have an effect
[01:48:37.660 --> 01:48:41.660]   at the end of the model, it made a $10,000 difference.
[01:48:41.660 --> 01:48:45.460]   I keep clicking it and you can see it's getting worse.
[01:48:45.460 --> 01:48:47.220]   Now let's go back, let's revert back
[01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:48.540]   to where we started from.
[01:48:48.540 --> 01:48:51.780]   What about if I earn more money on my regular savings?
[01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:56.180]   I'm clicking it up at just a 10th of a percent,
[01:48:56.180 --> 01:48:59.060]   but across the whole span of the model,
[01:48:59.060 --> 01:49:00.580]   you can see what that's doing.
[01:49:03.220 --> 01:49:08.220]   What about if I don't earn as much on Roth?
[01:49:08.220 --> 01:49:09.980]   Well, let's see.
[01:49:09.980 --> 01:49:12.180]   Well, right now I don't have a Roth conversion in,
[01:49:12.180 --> 01:49:14.420]   so if I click this, it won't have any effect.
[01:49:14.420 --> 01:49:19.700]   What about Joe's retirement age?
[01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:21.340]   He's planning to retire in 2024.
[01:49:21.340 --> 01:49:23.100]   What if we add some to it?
[01:49:23.100 --> 01:49:26.580]   Like, whoa, that makes a difference.
[01:49:26.580 --> 01:49:28.460]   If it works another year,
[01:49:28.460 --> 01:49:31.980]   it adds quite a bit of difference only at the end.
[01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:34.340]   Okay, but what about social security?
[01:49:34.340 --> 01:49:38.100]   Over here, I just said that the optimum answer
[01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:41.940]   is 68 for Joe and 65 for Jane.
[01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:43.380]   Let's see if this agrees.
