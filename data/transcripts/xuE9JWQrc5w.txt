[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.820]   As of this moment, as I record,
[00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.060]   Pastor John and Noel are on a ministry trip
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.080]   through Holland, France and Germany.
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.040]   Earlier in the year, they were in South America,
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.880]   you might remember.
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.920]   Earlier in the spring, they were in Ireland
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.440]   and in Edinburgh.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.340]   All those trips being ministry trips
[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.260]   on behalf of Desiring God,
[00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.240]   and I know several financial partners are listening,
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.040]   and you make those trips possible.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.600]   So thank you for your partnership with us.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.200]   Looking back when Pastor John was on his trip
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.640]   to Edinburgh, Scotland, he answered questions
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.080]   from the audience in one setting.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.800]   And one of those questions was from a wife
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.440]   who is a Christian, but is married
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.280]   to an unbelieving husband.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.600]   And she asks, "Where do I draw the boundary lines
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.600]   in my submission to him?"
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.140]   Here is the interchange moderated by local pastor
[00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.260]   and church planter, Andy Prime.
[00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.480]   Have a listen.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.760]   - Staying within the context of family,
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.360]   someone's asked, "I was saved after I got married.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.160]   I accept the biblical teaching that my husband
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.280]   is the head of the house and family.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.760]   What advice do you give to a woman in this situation?"
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.760]   So I'm presuming the husband is an unbeliever.
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.840]   - An unbeliever.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.680]   - I presume so.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.680]   - Well, there's a text written for you.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.240]   It's 1 Peter 3, one to six.
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.240]   It's written to women who are married to unbelievers.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.000]   So my first advice would be memorize those verses.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.040]   And they are most remarkable.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.000]   And I love those verses.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.360]   I love them for myself, frankly.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.720]   Most of the texts that are written for women in the Bible
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.160]   I find very helpful for me.
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.800]   But that's the place.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.800]   And the burden of that text is that your life
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.240]   is essential to your words.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.080]   I mean, it says that he may be one without a word.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.760]   Now, I don't think that is an absolute,
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.120]   I mean, you can't ever talk about Jesus with your husband
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.960]   because he's gotta know you're a believer
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.880]   or he can't be converted.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.240]   And it says he will be converted.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.040]   So he's gotta know the gospel.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.000]   And so I think it means don't harangue him,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.360]   don't nag him, don't preach at him.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.680]   But in all humility, in all lowliness,
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.520]   somewhere along the way,
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.800]   lay your heart bare before this man
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.760]   as to where you stand and why you're there.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.800]   Not in a preaching way, but a testimony way.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.840]   This is why I love Jesus.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.680]   I believe that loving Jesus will help me love you better.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.200]   So please don't think that when I put him first,
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.600]   I'm loving you worse.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.760]   It doesn't work that way, honey.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.240]   It doesn't.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.160]   It doesn't.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.160]   I will love you better for loving him more.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.840]   Now, he may find that unintelligible,
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.760]   but you need to then show that, you need to prove that.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.040]   And it's very complex in a day like ours
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.040]   when spousal abuse is the first thing people think of often
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.520]   when you talk about submission.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.520]   And there is a real kind of submission
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.840]   that does not make your husband your absolute Lord.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.080]   That text makes no sense
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.420]   unless Jesus is your Lord above your husband,
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.400]   because you're aiming to convert the husband
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.720]   to the Lord that's above you, you both.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.160]   And if you're aiming to convert your husband,
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.240]   clearly you have not submitted to his wrong ideas.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.920]   I mean, think through the implications of this text
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.840]   for what submission does and doesn't mean.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.460]   It doesn't mean that your brain has been surrendered
[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.060]   to the unbeliever's brain,
[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.740]   because if it were, you'd become an unbeliever.
[00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.560]   And the text clearly says, "Stand your ground, woman.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.780]   "Stand your ground."
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.700]   You have an independent relationship with the Lord
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.380]   that's authentic and unshakable,
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.380]   no matter what he says, no matter what he does.
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.320]   This is real, and Jesus is your Lord,
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.180]   and you want him included in that.
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.700]   That's a remarkably independent,
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.120]   in a sense you might say non-submissive.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.260]   So at the level of intellectual commitments,
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.540]   you're committed to Jesus, not to what the husband believes,
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.200]   which means that submission has a flavor about it
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.020]   that's not absolutistic in the sense of,
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.980]   this man is my Lord, whatever he says goes.
[00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.020]   It doesn't, whatever Jesus says goes.
[00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.260]   But oh my, once you have rested in Jesus
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.060]   and longed to show this man as a leader,
[00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.920]   that is honor his leadership.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.520]   He may not even be a leader,
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.080]   but you're gonna do everything you can
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.080]   to honor that leadership and call out of him
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.020]   all the initiatives, all the protection, all the provision.
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.980]   Those are the three words that I think headship implies,
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.700]   that is protecting this woman.
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.680]   I'm gonna die for her if I have to.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.260]   She is my woman, nobody can have her but me,
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.860]   and I'm protecting her against everything
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.020]   that might hurt her.
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.540]   Number two, I'm gonna do everything I can to provide her,
[00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.440]   even if I've got a disability and she has to work for me,
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.460]   I'm gonna do everything I can to be the provider
[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.940]   and I'm gonna take initiatives.
[00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.540]   I'm talking to the men now really,
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.220]   but that's what she wants to awaken and win from him.
[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.860]   And I think there are submissive ways to say no
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.260]   to an unbelieving husband.
[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.620]   If he wants you to do group sex,
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:38.100]   you're gonna say, I can't, I love you,
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.860]   I think this is bad for you, bad for us,
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.960]   can't do that because of Jesus.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.420]   So, with all the texts in the Bible
[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:48.460]   that talk about subordination,
[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.920]   children to parents, wives to husbands,
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.980]   citizens to governments and church members to elders,
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.140]   those four groups, all of them are qualified,
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.140]   they're not absolute, right?
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.260]   You don't do everything a government says,
[00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.020]   you don't do everything a wacko elder says
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.620]   who's left of faith,
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.540]   you don't do everything a parent tells you to do
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.100]   if they try to get you to join them in sinning in some way.
[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:19.100]   The absoluteness of Jesus relativizes,
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:24.460]   qualifies the subordination of a child,
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.860]   a wife, a citizen and a church member.
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.420]   Amen, that was John Piper answering audience questions
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.480]   in Scotland earlier this year.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.760]   Well, Pastor John is with Noel finishing up a ministry trip
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.260]   in Holland, France and Germany.
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.720]   They'll be headed back home to Minneapolis
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.680]   in the next day or so.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.700]   Would you please consider praying for their safety
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.260]   as they travel home and for the ongoing fruitfulness
[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.640]   of their investment in this trip?
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.200]   We would really appreciate it.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.100]   Well, before Pastor John left for this trip,
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.440]   we recorded a slew of new episodes in the studio,
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.300]   including the next one which comes out on Friday
[00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.620]   about false teaching.
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.460]   We should be aware of false teachers, of course,
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.340]   but should we call out false teachers in public?
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.540]   Why or why not?
[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.380]   When or when not and who should do it?
[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.460]   It's a great little batch of related questions from you.
[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.340]   It's up next in a brand new episode
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.200]   coming up next time on Friday.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.220]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.140]   Thanks for listening.
[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:19.140]   We'll see you then.
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.300]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:34.300]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
