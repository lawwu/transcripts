[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.740]   We have a large and distinguished panel,
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.340]   individuals who have worn many hats as financial advisors,
[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.860]   educators, authors, medical professionals.
[00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.460]   I'm going to be very brief about the introductions
[00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.220]   so that we can get into the meat of our discussion.
[00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.860]   I encourage you to look at everybody's bios
[00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.220]   on the Bogle Center website and go on to their websites.
[00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.740]   There's so much wonderful material.
[00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.600]   Many of you already heard Rick Ferry, Paul Merriman, Dana
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.900]   Anspach, and Jim Dolley speak yesterday as part
[00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.620]   of Bogleheads University.
[00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.260]   Today, joining them is Bill Bernstein,
[00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.060]   who we know as a neurologist by training,
[00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.340]   co-founder of Efficient Frontier Advisors,
[00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.380]   author of several books, also a Bogle Center board member,
[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.580]   and my former colleague, Jonathan Clements,
[00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.900]   longtime personal finance columnist at The Wall Street
[00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.180]   Journal, and more recently, founder and editor
[00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.180]   of the Humble Dollar website.
[00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.860]   So we're going to talk about a bunch of investing topics,
[00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.540]   try and cover a lot of territory.
[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.340]   If you have questions, Mike Piper will be gathering them.
[00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.620]   So Mike, could you stand up if you're in the room?
[00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.880]   Back there.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.540]   So feel free to bring your question over to Mike,
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.740]   and we'll save some time at the end to discuss those.
[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.380]   So I think we're going to start with the climate interest
[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.340]   rates over the last couple of years.
[00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.900]   Total bond market returns were negative in 2021 and last year,
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.020]   and so far this year by a bit.
[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.420]   The indications lately are that rates may be higher for longer.
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.540]   And I'm wondering, for the panelists, how that has
[00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.140]   changed-- if it has changed-- how
[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.540]   it has affected your thinking about fixed income exposure,
[00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.300]   maturities, types of bonds to hold.
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.980]   And I'm going to ask Bill to start us off on that.
[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.140]   Thank you for not asking me where I think interest rates
[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.500]   are headed, because there are only three kinds of people
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.740]   there-- the ones who don't know, the ones who
[00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.060]   don't know they don't know, and then, finally,
[00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.740]   the ones who know they don't know but whose jobs
[00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.460]   and whose paycheck--
[00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.460]   it depends upon appearing to know.
[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.100]   And they're the most dangerous ones.
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.580]   I think it really depends upon where
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.220]   you are in your life cycle.
[00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.980]   If you are saving for retirement and you're accumulating,
[00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.300]   you really shouldn't have that much in the way of bonds.
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.660]   You should have as much stocks as you can tolerate.
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.380]   And your bonds should be short, nominal bonds
[00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.700]   of the safest available.
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.420]   They should be treasuries, basically.
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.180]   If you're an older person who is in the decumulation phase,
[00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.220]   you are now faced with what may be
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.860]   one of the great bargains of a lifetime, which
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.420]   is the ability to defuse your real living
[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.260]   expenses at a high real rate.
[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.020]   Tips are now yielding about roughly 2.4%
[00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.380]   across the yield curve.
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.420]   So let's say you're approaching geyserhood.
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.500]   You're 60, 70 years old.
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.300]   And you can buy a ladder that goes all the way out
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.980]   30 years, which is almost certainly
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.100]   going to be beyond even the most optimistic life expectancies
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.980]   that most of you are going to have.
[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.820]   And you can guarantee a real consumption at multiple points
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.460]   out to 30 years.
[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.540]   You can do it with a fund.
[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.780]   You can do it by buying individual tips.
[00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.140]   And I think that this is an enormous opportunity.
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.940]   I don't like long-term bonds.
[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.940]   I make an exception for tips, because there you
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.460]   don't have to worry about inflation inflating
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.620]   the value away.
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.820]   So would you advise people to put all
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.740]   of their fixed income exposure-- someone
[00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.300]   who is at that laddering point, heading into retirement--
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.640]   would you go all tips?
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.020]   It depends upon their burn rate.
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.740]   If you're a kind of person who's got a very low burn
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.980]   rate, or a zero burn rate, but certainly a 1% or a 2% burn
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.540]   rate, it really doesn't matter what's in your portfolio.
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.580]   You're going to do fine.
[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.100]   And you don't really need that tips ladder out there.
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.460]   But if you're burning 4% or 5% or 6%,
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.500]   I think a healthy dollop of tips would be worthwhile.
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.700]   I personally don't need them in my own personal portfolio.
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.540]   But I really like having them there.
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.980]   I've got now a nice dollop of them.
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.400]   When I need to go to bed at night, I don't count sheep.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.380]   I count my tips.
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.860]   Dana, I know in your portfolios you don't use tips.
[00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.700]   You use nominal bonds.
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.560]   As you're doing your planning, has the current interest rate
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.540]   environment changed what you're doing with clients?
[00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.700]   Not fundamentally.
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.540]   I really like what Rick said yesterday
[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.740]   about philosophy versus strategy.
[00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.380]   So it hasn't changed our philosophy.
[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.900]   There are a few strategic decisions.
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.140]   The biggest impact it has had is on managing short-term cash.
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.180]   So two years ago, it made no sense
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.020]   to spend a lot of time managing cash
[00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.700]   to get an extra 0 basis point.
[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.020]   But now, if you have someone taking $10,000 a month out
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.260]   and you need to hold about $100,000
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.220]   of very liquid assets to meet that monthly withdrawal,
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.220]   it does make sense to manage that cash
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.620]   by managing short-term treasuries and the money
[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.580]   market.
[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.980]   So that's the biggest impact it has had.
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:46.420]   It has also had the impact of us extending our bond ladders.
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.820]   People are more willing to do that.
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.940]   You can lock in 5% yields.
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.300]   Two years ago, no one was excited about locking in 2%
[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.100]   yields.
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.500]   And so it has changed behavior and willingness of people
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.820]   to say, yeah, I do want to build up my bond ladder.
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.260]   I do want to do more of that.
[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.820]   But philosophically, no, it hasn't changed our approach.
[00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.620]   Other people who are doing things in the fixed income
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.100]   area we want to talk about while we're in this space?
[00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:23.900]   I just think it's dramatically better than fixed income.
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.780]   And nobody wants it now, right?
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.500]   At the end of the price, nobody wants it.
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.060]   And yet, it's a much better deal than you
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.460]   could get two years ago.
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.660]   So the other thing is it's made me much more patient
[00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.500]   to have a little bit of money, system, cash.
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.620]   You know, the cash track is really a thing.
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.100]   I mean, if your money system, the way that you invest it,
[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.380]   now to make 5%, I want to be 100%.
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.180]   And that doesn't hurt nearly as much as when
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.860]   it was only making 1%.
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.580]   And Jim, while you have the microphone,
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.940]   so let's talk about--
[00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.140]   tips, obviously, are such a great way
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.860]   to hedge against inflation.
[00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.780]   I'm interested in how much you worry
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:05.020]   about inflation, and are there instruments besides tips
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:09.260]   you look to hedge inflation longer term?
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.860]   I'm incredibly worried about inflation.
[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.660]   You know, Bill has talked about the four horsemen, you know,
[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.300]   that really are serious dangers to a portfolio.
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.420]   And the most common one of those is inflation.
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.540]   So any time you build a portfolio,
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.380]   whether it's designed for inflation or not,
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.980]   you should be thinking about inflation.
[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.100]   You need to beat inflation.
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.540]   It's the enemy's chief-- or the investor's chief enemy.
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.420]   And so-- but trying to hedge inflation in the short run
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.740]   is really hard.
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.300]   In the long run, it's not that hard.
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.380]   You've got good tools.
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.860]   You've got tips.
[00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.820]   You've got I-bonds on the fixed side.
[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.540]   You've got stocks and real estate
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.700]   and those sorts of things on the equity side.
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.300]   And in the long run, I don't think
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.940]   it's necessarily all that difficult for an investor
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.020]   to design a portfolio that's going
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.260]   to keep up with inflation.
[00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.340]   But I think a lot of people were surprised in the last two
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.820]   or three years when inflation came up how hard it
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.340]   was to kind of stick with it in the short term.
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.180]   And I think a lot of people were surprised when maybe tips
[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.180]   didn't do that so well, when real rates went up.
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.980]   And of course, when rates go up, the value of a bond goes down.
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.740]   And I think that surprised a lot of people
[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.380]   that expected when inflation showed up,
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.460]   unexpected inflation showed up, that their tips would somehow
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.140]   protect them.
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.380]   And they didn't feel like they did that very much,
[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.300]   I don't think, for most of us in 2022.
[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.700]   Well, I think we always get those reminders of how
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:29.380]   incredibly complicated bonds are in general.
[00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:34.980]   And TIP certainly adds a whole additional dimension to that.
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.940]   When you're thinking about hedging against inflation
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.060]   long term, what should be the asset classes
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.620]   that I should focus on most?
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:48.540]   Anyone?
[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:54.820]   Well, historically, we would look to stocks to be the best.
[00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.580]   But to the extent that we use fixed income--
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.700]   and we don't manage money, and we don't give advice
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:01.700]   to individuals.
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.380]   But to the extent that we use fixed income,
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.060]   we're always short to intermediate, never long.
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.180]   I think that's what Bill said.
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:14.220]   And so I think those are-- we don't look to gold,
[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.820]   for example, or commodities, but basically
[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.380]   have a balanced portfolio of the big, the small, the value,
[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.620]   and the growth, and the US, and the international,
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.020]   and the REITs, and the emerging markets.
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:29.980]   And in there, you're going to have some combination that
[00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:34.540]   is likely to be a kind of an all-weather portfolio.
[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:38.100]   At least that's what one hopes.
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.500]   Other thoughts on the mix?
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:40.740]   Jonathan?
[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.780]   So inflation is less of a concern
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.860]   if you're still in the workforce.
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.300]   Prices rise, so should your salary.
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.300]   It's a much bigger issue for retirees.
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.260]   And the greatest defense for anybody
[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.980]   who's retired against inflation is to delay Social Security.
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.300]   I mean, it's the best inflation-indexed annuity
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.820]   out there.
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:02.140]   If you can afford to, and your health is decent,
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.900]   or the health of your spouse is decent,
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.240]   delaying Social Security at age 70
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.940]   is, I believe, probably the smartest financial move
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.340]   any retiree can make.
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.100]   And because of recent inflation, it looks even smarter.
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.220]   A thought on inflation, in terms of how it impacts retirees,
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:26.740]   it impacts different demographic segments differently.
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:31.540]   And so we talk about the go-go years, the slow-go years,
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.420]   and the no-go years in retirement.
[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.540]   And we offer inflation raises to our clients.
[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:41.280]   And I would say 60% to 70% of them turn them down and say,
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.380]   no, what I'm getting covers my expenses,
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.900]   even with the recent price increases that we've seen.
[00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:51.380]   Now, for people that are in the lower demographic,
[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.420]   they're spending less than $100,000 a year,
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.180]   basic increases in gas and food prices
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.940]   are going to have a much bigger bite into their budget
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:01.700]   than people in some of the demographic sectors
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.060]   where they're spending more.
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.980]   So we definitely see that in real life.
[00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:08.540]   And we see that as people get into those slow-go years,
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.200]   they're spending naturally declines.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.900]   And so inflation is real.
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.980]   It's there, but it's not impacting them, perhaps
[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:22.380]   the same as someone that's still actively out there traveling
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:26.620]   and buying furniture and paying for their kids
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.380]   and all of those types of things.
[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:35.020]   So looking at the US stock market, one of the trends
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:38.300]   that we see is increased concentration.
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.340]   A lot of the markets return this year
[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.060]   has come from what people refer to
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:47.380]   as the magnificent seven tech and tech-adjacent stocks,
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:51.300]   which recently represented about 30% of the value of the S&P
[00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.860]   500.
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.780]   So I'm wondering, does that concentration
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:00.540]   change the way you feel about using market-weighted indexes
[00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:05.580]   like the total stock market return or the S&P 500
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:06.820]   in portfolios?
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.380]   Rick?
[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:10.980]   Oh, this is loud.
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:16.900]   So no, because if money came out of the mega-cap eight, which
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:21.220]   is the magnificent seven plus one,
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:24.380]   it's probably not going to leave the stock market.
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:27.540]   So the fact that it might come out of those large-cap stocks
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:31.300]   and get dispersed among the mid-cap and small-cap stocks
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.500]   keeps the same money in the market.
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.540]   Therefore, if you have a total stock market index fund,
[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.420]   you shouldn't see any effect.
[00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.340]   The only issue would be if the money came out
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:45.460]   of those magnificent seven or mega-cap eight
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.180]   and just left the market totally.
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.700]   Yes, then you would have an impact.
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:52.380]   But I think that the people who are in stocks
[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.660]   tend to stay in stocks.
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.740]   So we just get the dispersion of that money
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.660]   would be sent across the rest of the spectrum of stocks
[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:01.380]   into a total stock market investor.
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.860]   It's the same amount of money, same value of the market.
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.100]   So it won't make any difference, in my view.
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:11.620]   So if you've been writing about this stuff for four decades,
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:15.460]   which I have, you start to see the same stories over and over
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.580]   again.
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:19.900]   And when people talk about the concentration in the stock
[00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:23.740]   market, this is a story that can be written every year.
[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:27.740]   It's a simple mathematical phenomenon known as skewness.
[00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:32.620]   The most a stock loses 100%, but its potential gain is infinite.
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:35.520]   And almost every year, the stock market
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.420]   is driven higher by a minority of stocks
[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.020]   that have fabulous gains.
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.860]   Those, of course, are the stocks that catch people's attention.
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.660]   Those are the stocks that make it into the headlines.
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:50.460]   Those are the stocks that cause people to give up indexing
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:53.500]   and go and try their hand at picking hot stocks
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.540]   in the same way they try their hand at trying
[00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.420]   to pick hot lottery tickets.
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.860]   And it normally has the same unhappy ending.
[00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:05.100]   Don't be put off by all these conversations
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.460]   about how concentrated the indexes are in certain stocks
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:12.100]   and how the market has been driven by a minority of stocks.
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:16.380]   It has always been ever so, and it will always be ever so.
[00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.860]   And it's because of this notion of skewness.
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.260]   Yeah, it's an interesting exercise
[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:25.700]   just to go back 50, 60, 70 years into 10-year intervals,
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.020]   look at what the megacaps of the era were.
[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:30.460]   1970s, what were they?
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.780]   They were oil stocks.
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:34.500]   If you put all your money into oil stocks in the '70s,
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.380]   you didn't do so well.
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:39.140]   1980s, it was IBM.
[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.380]   Investing a lot of your money in IBM in the '80s
[00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.380]   wasn't such a great idea either.
[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.340]   And it just rolls forth decade by decade by decade.
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.900]   It's probably one of the worst bets you can make
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.900]   is buying Decile One and only holding Decile One largest cap
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.900]   stocks.
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:59.060]   I think Jonathan has this line about the look
[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.620]   at the person in the mirror in the morning
[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:04.580]   is your biggest enemy.
[00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:11.260]   And I find that the big decision is, what am I today?
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.860]   Am I still a buying holder, or am I market timer?
[00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.980]   And in theory, we all believe that we've
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:19.980]   got to find the one that's going to serve us best.
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:23.300]   But there's something that throws us off along the way,
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.340]   and we start to change the nature of how
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.980]   we approach the decision making.
[00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:32.180]   And the minute you get into this pattern,
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:37.220]   I think you're at risk of chasing either a fad
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.660]   or been hot recently, and it feels
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:42.620]   like there's going to be more of that,
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.820]   so you want to do something about it.
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.420]   I really have tried to encourage people,
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.740]   figure out how much in stocks, how much in bonds,
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:53.660]   diversify, with or not without small cap value, by the way.
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:01.180]   And just be happy.
[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:06.180]   When we go beyond that, we tend to do more harm.
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.860]   By the way, Paul, you missed your cue
[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.580]   in the question about inflation, because small cap value
[00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.460]   stocks are a marvelous hedge against inflation,
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:14.900]   better than the broad stock market.
[00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:27.460]   So one of the things-- we talk about buy and hold,
[00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.580]   but it's hard, because you feel periodically
[00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:33.860]   that, oh, maybe I should do something different.
[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.300]   I thought it was really interesting in the session
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:40.300]   that Jim did as part of Fogelhead's 101 yesterday.
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.780]   He talked about reasonable portfolios versus
[00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.220]   unreasonable portfolios.
[00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.180]   But the reasonable portfolios are what?
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:52.100]   28 of them you listed?
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.980]   I mean, I could have listed a lot more than 28.
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.820]   I've got a blog post with 200 of them.
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.980]   The point is there's hundreds of them.
[00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:01.580]   So I think a question for us, then,
[00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:04.700]   is when I look at all the possible reasonable
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.620]   portfolios-- and that reasonable portfolio could
[00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:12.860]   be a single, all-in-one fund, or it could be 15
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.500]   or more individual funds--
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:21.660]   what do you think is the number of funds that potentially
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:27.580]   makes sense for someone to be able to stay the course?
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:30.460]   As far as the number of asset classes in a portfolio,
[00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.380]   I look at three as kind of about the minimum.
[00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:36.740]   I think there's real benefits in going up to about seven,
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.740]   maybe very minor benefits in going as high as 10.
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:42.740]   Beyond that, you're playing with your money.
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.620]   Those are asset classes which may or may not
[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.740]   require separate mutual funds, or ETFs, right?
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:50.440]   Yeah, the beautiful thing about indexing
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.940]   is you only need one fund for the asset class.
[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:55.100]   So I am perfectly content to let Jerry
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.300]   manage all of my US stocks.
[00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.820]   Every day, he goes to work with a team of 25 people
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:05.820]   and works very hard to manage my money, and I appreciate that.
[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:09.500]   And he's managing a lot of my money, but he does it very well.
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.060]   And that's all the exposure I feel
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.340]   like I need to that particular asset class.
[00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:16.060]   Now, if you are in more actively managed stuff,
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.340]   you've got to have more holdings, for sure,
[00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.500]   because you need to diversify and manage your risk.
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.460]   So Jim, what are the six or seven asset classes
[00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:25.460]   that you look to?
[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.820]   Well, I think that's not necessarily something
[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:31.100]   anybody else needs to model, right?
[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.340]   I think having multiple asset classes
[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:35.140]   is a wise thing in a portfolio.
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.180]   Does everyone have to have the same asset classes?
[00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:38.060]   No.
[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:41.500]   Some good asset classes I think people really ought to consider--
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.980]   US stocks, international stocks, nominal bonds,
[00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.740]   inflation-indexed bonds.
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:51.500]   I'm a fan of small-value stocks, along with Bill and Paul.
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.820]   I am a fan of real estate.
[00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:54.780]   So there's six.
[00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:57.040]   And I think when people are getting into six and seven,
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:00.100]   they're probably looking at those sorts of asset classes.
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.980]   But there's plenty of others out there.
[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.260]   There's 20 or 30 asset classes, and it's
[00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:05.980]   OK to include some of those.
[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.540]   You don't need all of them, though.
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:12.660]   You know, a lot of you probably weren't here last year,
[00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.340]   but Mike Piper said something that
[00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.900]   was very profound last year, which
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.940]   is the sorts of things that we all obsess about.
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.180]   You know, how much small value?
[00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:20.820]   How much REITs?
[00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.980]   God, do I want to own precious metals equities?
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:27.140]   Do I want to own one fund, or five funds, or eight funds?
[00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.900]   That's a piddling significance.
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.620]   What is really important is, do you have disability insurance?
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:35.500]   Do you have good life insurance when you're young?
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.820]   Are you giving enough money away to your kids
[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:39.800]   and your grandkids?
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.700]   Those are the really important questions.
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.620]   The most important thing about the complexity
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:46.100]   of any portfolio is not what it looks like,
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:47.780]   but can you stick with it?
[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.620]   That is far more important than whether you own one asset
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:52.860]   class or 12.
[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.100]   And so given that that is the challenge,
[00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.460]   and I think it's a challenge we all face personally,
[00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.780]   even if you say, I'm going to stick with it,
[00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:03.940]   there are times that suddenly that feels hard.
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:06.500]   What advice would you give to people
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.660]   in how they construct their portfolios
[00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:12.420]   or how they live their lives to help them stay the course?
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.700]   Yeah.
[00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:17.580]   A suboptimal portfolio that you can stick with
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.700]   is better than an optimal portfolio of one
[00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:20.940]   you can't execute.
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:21.940]   It's just that simple.
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:23.900]   So pick something that you can stick with it.
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:30.980]   So you can stick with a simpler portfolio
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:34.580]   a lot easier than a complex portfolio.
[00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:37.140]   And John Bogle said this a long time ago.
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:41.220]   And I brought it up yesterday in one of my slides.
[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:44.020]   If you're just a market investor and you're
[00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.380]   investing in the total stock market and the market goes
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.620]   down, you know your portfolio is down.
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.580]   And most people can accept that.
[00:20:53.580 --> 00:21:00.000]   If you're doing a slice and dice portfolio, which--
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.380]   And it's going down, or it's not keeping up with the market,
[00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:08.900]   so many concerns you.
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:09.660]   More.
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.620]   And maybe you're more apt to make changes,
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.780]   more apt to capitulate on that strategy.
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:18.780]   So I think the simpler you make your portfolio, the better.
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:23.840]   I think that it is a matter of having the right portfolio.
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:27.260]   But the problem that I've found over the years
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:30.780]   is most people have not actually identified
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:34.260]   not just the potential return-- now that's the easy part--
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:38.140]   but making sure they know what building loss
[00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:40.540]   factor there's going to be in that portfolio.
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.640]   And if you're going to find a portfolio you're
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.140]   going to stick with, it isn't going
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.140]   to be because of the upside, generally.
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:48.780]   It's going to be because of the downside.
[00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.660]   And the industry oftentimes will ask,
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.460]   are you willing to lose 20% of your money?
[00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:58.740]   Well, if you are, it's OK to be in the stock market.
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.700]   What they should be saying is, are you
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.780]   willing to lose half of your money?
[00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:06.220]   Then if you are, you should be in the stock market.
[00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:08.940]   And if you're not, you've got to put enough fixed income
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:12.340]   into the portfolio to bring the potential loss down
[00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:16.460]   to where you are willing to say, yes, I'm willing to do that.
[00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:19.420]   Then I think you can stay the course.
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.460]   But you've got to somehow get there.
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.420]   We call it education.
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:29.820]   Sort of at a related note, Bill, this year
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:34.060]   the second edition of your Four Pillars of Investing book
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:35.500]   was published.
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.300]   Could you tell us a little bit about the way
[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:40.700]   you're thinking about investing has
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:42.980]   changed since the initial edition, which
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:44.300]   was, what, 20 years ago?
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.580]   Yeah, two ways.
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:49.100]   I was very impressed with a quote from a man
[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:50.540]   by the name of Robert Kaplan, who's
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:55.220]   a historian, who said that half of everything is geography,
[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:57.340]   and the other half is Shakespeare.
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:00.740]   And I realized that that pertains almost precisely
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:03.940]   analogously to investing, which is that half of it
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:07.260]   is mathematics, but the other half is Shakespeare.
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:11.300]   And the answer to investing better and better
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:12.540]   is not more and more math.
[00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:14.820]   And there are a lot of people on the Bogleheads forum,
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:18.780]   I think, who believe that, unfortunately.
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.900]   It's, can you handle the vicissitudes of the marketing
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.420]   of your own psychology?
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.620]   So long-term capital management, most brilliant mathematicians
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:28.760]   out there planted their faces because they
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.940]   didn't understand enough about market history
[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.500]   and their own psychology.
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:36.780]   They didn't realize that every 10 years or so,
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.900]   the wheels come off the machine.
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:41.260]   And by the way, their model was only based on four years
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:45.420]   of data, so that was another little mistake that they made.
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:47.500]   So it's the importance of the psychology,
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:51.860]   and I tend to de-emphasize the importance of the math.
[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:56.620]   I think if you can get within a factor of two
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:58.380]   on anything in investing, you're probably
[00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:00.620]   doing very, very well.
[00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:02.060]   I'm reminded of the joke that says,
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.620]   how do you know the financial economists have
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:05.300]   a sense of humor?
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:07.100]   It's because they use decimal points.
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:10.060]   So that's the first thing.
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.380]   And the other thing that I've realized over the years
[00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:14.380]   is the importance of liquid assets.
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.820]   You've got to be able to sleep through the worst of times.
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:19.340]   How well you do in the long term depends
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:23.480]   upon how you react in the worst 2% of times, all right?
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.060]   And that's because that's when you're
[00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:28.260]   most likely to interrupt the magic of compounding
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:32.340]   and disobey Charlie Munger's first rule of compounding,
[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:35.020]   which is to never interrupt it.
[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:37.260]   There is a reason why Warren Buffett holds
[00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:41.940]   20% of Berkshire in T-bills, because he can sleep at night.
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:44.940]   Or when the 300-year flood hits his insurance companies,
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:47.580]   he'll survive, and no one else will.
[00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:51.180]   You have to have that same sort of outlook as well.
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:54.820]   So those are the two basic things that changed.
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:58.620]   One of the situations where we come up
[00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:02.420]   against that question of balancing finance, mathematics,
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:08.380]   and emotions is when someone has a lump sum, a windfall of money
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:11.220]   that they might invest in the stock market.
[00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:15.700]   So Paul, could you talk to how you approached that question
[00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:17.580]   when you're talking to someone about,
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:21.300]   do I put my pile of money into the stock market tomorrow,
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:25.660]   or do I dollar cost in over time?
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:28.500]   Well, it's been 10 years since I've had to do that for people.
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:32.980]   But when I did, first thing we have to figure out
[00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:35.660]   is who we think they are in terms
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:39.660]   of their emotions of being able to actually put it
[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.220]   all in at one time.
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:42.980]   The industry, of course, says that you're
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:46.020]   best off to get everything to work immediately.
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.400]   But of course, that's the industry
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.300]   that wants us to invest through them, basically.
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:53.300]   And immediately, for most people,
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:57.140]   is actually probably not the best way.
[00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:59.380]   Because there is some probability
[00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:01.580]   that the next thing that's going to happen
[00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:03.780]   is the market's going to go down,
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:06.380]   and this is not what they were prepared to go through
[00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.140]   with all of that money.
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:11.240]   Whereas if you dollar cost average it in,
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:16.540]   and it is a form of diversification, dollar cost
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:17.780]   averaging.
[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:23.700]   And as somebody recently said, any time you diversify,
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.660]   you're settling for second best, in a sense.
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.340]   And so dollar cost averaging is something
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:32.420]   where you are likely settling for a second best,
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:35.420]   but it's something that you should be able to do.
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:38.460]   Or if-- and I found it's worked often
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:42.660]   with a client that couldn't trust either way.
[00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:45.340]   Half of it buy and hold, immediately put it to work.
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:48.620]   The other half, you dollar cost average in.
[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:51.580]   And in a sense, you've got the best of both worlds.
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:55.700]   I guess, in a way, you can't do wrong except for one thing.
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:59.420]   At the end of the dollar cost averaging, or the lump sum,
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.540]   the market can still go down.
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:05.860]   So you never outrun the market if you're
[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:09.580]   worried about it going down.
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:13.980]   So I have immense respect for Paul,
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.900]   but I disagree with him on this point.
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.060]   I think dollar cost averaging is for wimps.
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:21.100]   Because of what Paul just said at the end.
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.500]   At the end of this dollar cost averaging period,
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.900]   whether it's in three months, or six months, or a year,
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:27.020]   guess what?
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:30.220]   The whole portfolio is exposed to the market.
[00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:33.980]   And if you're not OK with that, what that indicates to me,
[00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:37.380]   maybe your asset allocation is too aggressive for you.
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:39.580]   And you ought to dial it back until you
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:43.420]   are willing to lump sum this new money into your asset
[00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:45.380]   allocation.
[00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:48.660]   And so I don't see a big role for dollar cost averaging.
[00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:51.260]   I think it's a psychological crutch.
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.060]   The historical record is that you
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:55.100]   will do worse most of the time.
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:56.580]   Not all of the time, of course.
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:59.020]   But because the market goes up most of the time,
[00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:00.580]   most of those additional investments
[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:01.980]   you make over the next few months
[00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:03.540]   are going to be at higher prices.
[00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:04.820]   And you're getting a worse deal.
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:07.660]   So I think you really need-- if you're really
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.300]   having trouble putting a lump sum in,
[00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.620]   you ought to look more carefully at your overall asset
[00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:13.380]   allocation, because eventually, you're
[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:14.540]   going to be lump summed in.
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:19.300]   I think you're wrong, Jim.
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:26.380]   I'm older than you are.
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:34.620]   And I am willing to take second best.
[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:37.540]   That's why I have bonds in my portfolio.
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.140]   So it's just another defensive strategy.
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:42.020]   In fact, probably the expert on this
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:44.820]   is Jonathan Clements, since he speaks
[00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:47.580]   to the emotional side of this process.
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:49.620]   I'm curious what side you come down on.
[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:56.500]   Thanks, Paul.
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:03.740]   Yeah, I think it's very hard to get somebody
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:08.780]   to put a lump sum into the stock market based
[00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:12.460]   with the possibility that the market is going
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:14.460]   to drop dramatically tomorrow.
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.380]   But I think before we say, yes, you should lump sum it,
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:20.540]   or yes, you should dollar cost average, what people need to do
[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.780]   is step back and say, how important
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:27.460]   is this sum of money compared to what I already have
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:29.740]   and what I will need in the future?
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:32.820]   So if grandma dies, and you've already
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:37.180]   got a $2 million portfolio, and she leaves you $100,000,
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:38.580]   invest it right away.
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:41.660]   $100,000 compared to the $2 million you already have,
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:43.220]   not a big deal.
[00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:47.900]   If you have $100,000 and grandma leaves you $2 million,
[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:49.780]   it's a much tougher decision.
[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:52.860]   And I can understand why somebody might actually
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:55.500]   listen to Paul and put it in more slowly.
[00:29:55.500 --> 00:30:04.740]   Jim is absolutely right that dollar cost averaging
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:05.380]   is for wimps.
[00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:07.140]   The trouble is that most of us are wimps.
[00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:07.620]   All right?
[00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:16.020]   All right, I'll throw my $0.02 in.
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.860]   So investing in the market is painful,
[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:20.440]   because you know as soon as you invest, it's going to go down.
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.180]   You know that's going to happen, right?
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:27.420]   So you either rip the big Band-Aid off one time
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:29.340]   and do it Jim's way, and you're done.
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:30.980]   You're in, and that's it.
[00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:31.580]   You're done.
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.820]   Or you have to rip multiple Band-Aids off
[00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:37.980]   over a long period of time.
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:41.140]   And a lot of people might rip one, or two, or three off,
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.420]   but they never get to ripping the fourth one off.
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.060]   They start looking at the markets.
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:46.420]   They start coming up with reasons
[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:49.660]   not to do that dollar cost average, that third or fourth
[00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:50.460]   one, or so forth.
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:55.220]   And a lot of times, at least if it's-- it doesn't get done.
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:58.500]   So ripping the Band-Aid off one time
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.620]   and getting it done Jim's method,
[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:03.380]   I find actually gets the money invested.
[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:07.500]   And dollar cost averaging often doesn't get the money invested,
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:11.900]   because you have to make the decision to hit the button
[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.500]   to invest the money multiple times,
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.780]   and your mind is playing all kinds of tricks on you
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:17.940]   during that period of time.
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:20.220]   Unless, of course, you have a fantastic money manager
[00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:22.560]   like Paul managing your money, and then you
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:23.860]   don't have to worry about that.
[00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:27.140]   Because he'll do it for you without any pain whatsoever.
[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:27.980]   Not anymore.
[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:31.300]   So I think that was just great.
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:34.260]   This was just totally encapsulated
[00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:39.500]   the interplay of the math and the emotions of investing
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:40.620]   that we all struggle with.
[00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:43.500]   So I'm going to thank all six of you for that.
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.460]   We're going to try and move on.
[00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:49.980]   But I will just also just remind you, if you have any questions,
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:51.740]   please give them to Mike Piper.
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:53.820]   I think in about another five minutes,
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.380]   we'll try and move on to questions.
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:59.420]   So we'll still have 10 minutes to do questions.
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:03.420]   Coming back to-- coming to a classic bogleheads question,
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:08.180]   looking at US versus international stocks,
[00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:12.980]   over the trailing year, total international and total US
[00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:15.380]   stocks are just about neck and neck.
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:18.340]   And I point that out because that's the exception.
[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:21.900]   Because over so many other trailing periods, year
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:25.860]   to date, three years, five years, 10 years, 15 years,
[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:30.140]   US stocks have done so much better than international.
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:32.820]   So the question is, I'm wondering
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:37.100]   about what your views are on international diversification.
[00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.020]   Should I bother?
[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.620]   The flip side of that is, so if I've
[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:43.860]   had international stocks as part of my portfolio forever,
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:45.020]   do I stay the course?
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:47.180]   Or gosh, should I maybe change my mind
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.100]   and get rid of that now?
[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.020]   Jonathan, you want to start us off on that one?
[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:52.420]   Let me kick this party off.
[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:56.220]   It's the end of the year.
[00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:57.980]   You're looking back.
[00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:03.180]   Your home market has been the most fabulous performer,
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:07.380]   not just for the past year, not for the past decade,
[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:09.260]   but for multiple decades.
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:12.620]   It is the hottest market in the world.
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:18.860]   Why in the world would you possibly invest abroad?
[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:21.340]   This, of course, was what Japanese investors
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:25.020]   were faced with at year end 1989.
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:27.580]   And those who suffered from home bias
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:30.420]   are still sitting with portfolios
[00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:35.020]   that are underwater more than three decades later.
[00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:37.740]   That is why I invest internationally.
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:40.340]   Because unlike the rest of you who
[00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:42.860]   think that US is the only place to invest,
[00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:44.740]   I do not have a crystal ball.
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:47.820]   I do not know what will happen in the decades ahead.
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:51.300]   But I know that if I am globally diversified,
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:54.940]   the sort of hit that has been suffered by Japanese investors
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:57.340]   will not happen to me.
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:01.580]   Yeah, here's the rub, which is that there's
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:05.140]   no question that the US economy and the earnings of US
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.540]   corporations are growing faster than that
[00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:09.780]   in the rest of the developed world.
[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:14.660]   The problem is that if you put $1 million into US stocks,
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:19.100]   you are getting perhaps $30,000 or $35,000 worth of earnings.
[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:22.980]   If you put them into ex-US stocks, foreign stocks,
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:24.060]   you're getting twice that.
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:26.100]   You're getting $70,000.
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:29.620]   And I think it's a pretty good bet that that $35,000 you're
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:32.300]   going to get in US stocks and earnings
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:37.620]   is not going to grow fast enough to overtake the $70,000 you're
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:39.980]   going to get from foreign stocks.
[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:42.500]   You see the same thing with dividend yields as well.
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.820]   And that's the math.
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:48.780]   The Shakespeare is the Kahneman-Tversky availability
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:51.380]   heuristic, which is we always look backward
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:52.580]   at the last decade.
[00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:56.820]   And we say, why have I invested in this dog of an asset class?
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:57.620]   I'm done with it.
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:59.220]   I don't want to face it anymore.
[00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:01.980]   I'm going to sell it and only invest in US stocks.
[00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:05.940]   And three times out of four, that's a big mistake.
[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:07.460]   Dana?
[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:10.260]   I will say the all-weather portfolio
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:13.060]   that I talked about yesterday that held up better
[00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:16.500]   under the worst case scenarios did have a higher allocation
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:19.300]   to small cap value and international
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:23.260]   than perhaps a traditional portfolio would.
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:27.620]   I think it's also interesting that we so often
[00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:31.940]   look at the combination of US and international.
[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:34.740]   And once we have those, we're diversified.
[00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:37.540]   Oftentimes, it's viewed as if you own the total market
[00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:40.220]   indexes in the US and the international.
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:43.420]   You're diversified.
[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:47.820]   In reality, historically, we expect certain kinds
[00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:52.020]   of returns, I think, from large cap blend stocks.
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.300]   And we expect different kinds of returns
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:56.300]   from small or value stocks.
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:36:02.500]   So it may be that what we should be talking about, I think--
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.180]   what we should be talking about is not
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:08.260]   should we about international versus US--
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:14.220]   that maybe a better diversifier is the small in the value,
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:17.740]   even if some of those end up being international.
[00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:19.140]   That all can work.
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:24.700]   But that diversification is a more true diversification
[00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:30.780]   than getting large cap US blend and international large cap
[00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:31.860]   blend.
[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:36.500]   And I think it will do more for the investor than being--
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:39.500]   you'll do better with the small and the value
[00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:42.380]   and the big blend in the US.
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:43.820]   You don't need international.
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:48.860]   International may give you some lower volatility
[00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:54.620]   because of the diversification of--
[00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:57.660]   this is a word I can't remember anymore, I'm sorry--
[00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:03.940]   but that-- well, I'm going to stop right there.
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.520]   I understand what you're saying, Paul.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.600]   I've got to call the home.
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:11.520]   Look, first of all, you get three different types
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:13.300]   of diversification with international.
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:16.060]   You get more stock because I think
[00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:17.940]   the international markets have--
[00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:20.140]   the Vanguard International Fund, Total International
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:22.780]   has something like 4,000.
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:24.700]   I mean, Jerry, you can correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:26.460]   but 4,000 some odd names.
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:28.460]   So you're getting more diversification
[00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:30.660]   because you're getting more companies in there.
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:32.080]   But the second thing you're getting
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:35.060]   is you look at those companies, the industry
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:37.740]   groups of international stocks are
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:40.380]   quite a bit different than the industry groups of US stocks.
[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:43.060]   A lot less technology, a lot more brick and mortar
[00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:47.540]   companies, value companies, if you will, to Paul's point.
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:50.620]   So you get that more industry diversification, a more
[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:52.780]   global industry diversification.
[00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:54.940]   So that's the second type of diversification.
[00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:57.960]   And third, you get currency diversification.
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.620]   I mean, the dollar has been very strong.
[00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:01.820]   We've benefited from that as US investors.
[00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:03.660]   I don't know how long that's going to last,
[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:06.860]   but if the dollar does start going down
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:09.300]   relative to international currencies,
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.100]   you've got currency diversification.
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:13.420]   So you're getting more stock, you're
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:17.840]   getting more industry, broader industry diversification
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:20.420]   with international, and you're getting currency diversification.
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:25.020]   So I think that's a good bet to have 30% to 40%
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:28.820]   of your portfolio in international stocks.
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:32.240]   Mike, if you get a chance and want to bring up our audience
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.820]   questions, we'll try and do some of those.
[00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:52.620]   First question is, given recent bond performance,
[00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:57.440]   could you discuss the pros and cons of investing and holding
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.740]   actual bonds, individual bonds, like US treasuries
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:01.940]   versus bond funds?
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:10.580]   I will say, I mentioned this to Karen yesterday.
[00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:13.700]   One question I got quite a bit yesterday, just one on one,
[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.420]   was should I sell my bond funds right now?
[00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:18.600]   And it came back to a conversation
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:21.220]   earlier here of discipline and what does it
[00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:23.180]   take to stick with your strategy.
[00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:26.660]   I think you really need to know why you own what you own.
[00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:28.460]   So if you own bond funds and you're
[00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:30.300]   rebalancing to an allocation, you
[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.700]   should have a rebalancing frequency.
[00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:33.860]   And that's what you do.
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:36.420]   And you don't deviate from that strategy.
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:37.900]   And one of the most important things
[00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:41.520]   is sticking with a strategy over time.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.180]   In our practice, we prefer individual bonds
[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:47.500]   because we're using them to meet a specific liability
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:48.540]   in the future.
[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:51.660]   We have planned out what cash flows someone needs.
[00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:53.460]   That bond makes a perfect choice.
[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:56.380]   We know when it matures exactly what we're going to get.
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:59.540]   So I think you really have to decide what your investment
[00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:01.780]   approach is going to be.
[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:04.460]   And once you decide that, that's going to lead you
[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:07.780]   to the right choice for you.
[00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:11.500]   I agree completely with Dana that a ladder
[00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:14.220]   of individual bonds is superior in the sense
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:16.100]   that you can match liabilities and expenses.
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:19.620]   You can't do that easily with a bond fund.
[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:21.180]   It's really a matter of convenience.
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:23.780]   It's really a pain that took us to put together a bond ladder.
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:27.420]   It's easy to buy a bond fund.
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:31.060]   And the way I look at it, ETF versus open-end, close-end,
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:33.100]   do you own the individual treasuries
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:34.780]   if that's what you're going to be owning?
[00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:36.300]   You're going to get a Reuben sandwich.
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.600]   It doesn't matter whether it's wrapped in yellow paper,
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:39.980]   or green paper, or red paper.
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:42.440]   At the end of the day, it really doesn't matter that much.
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:45.140]   It's really a matter of convenience and psychology
[00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:48.380]   before anything else.
[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:50.060]   I think it's important to point out
[00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:51.540]   there's a difference between trying
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:55.860]   to buy treasuries individually versus a treasury fund
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:58.460]   and trying to buy individual corporate bonds versus
[00:40:58.460 --> 00:40:59.380]   a corporate fund.
[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:01.500]   I think there's a real diversification need there
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.500]   when you get into corporate bonds.
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:05.780]   And to not quite as much of an extent,
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:08.920]   also muni bonds, that it's worth using a fund for those.
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:10.460]   But I think you've got an option when
[00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:13.100]   it comes to nominal treasuries and TIPS.
[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:15.400]   [END PLAYBACK]
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.780]   Thank you.
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:20.720]   One question we had, I'll probably
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:22.300]   address this to Jonathan, since you
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.180]   talked about the value of waiting
[00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:28.300]   to collect Social Security.
[00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:31.100]   If I could collect my Social Security earlier
[00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:36.740]   and invest all those dollars, why wouldn't I do that?
[00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:39.020]   There are various questions that make my head explode.
[00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:41.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:44.220]   One of them, and I won't go back to it, but one of them
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:48.460]   is the bond fund versus individual bond question.
[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:50.420]   So much nonsense said about that.
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:53.020]   Similarly, why don't I take my Social Security
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:54.060]   early and invest it?
[00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:56.980]   Well, yeah, if you take your Social Security early
[00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:59.960]   and you invest it in stocks, yes, you're
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:02.340]   taking on more risk, but yes, you should do better.
[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:05.740]   But it's an apples to oranges comparison.
[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:10.260]   You're comparing a government guaranteed flow of money
[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:12.420]   to investing in the stock market.
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:16.260]   If you take more risk, yes, you should earn higher returns.
[00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:20.300]   But if you compare taking Social Security early and going out
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:24.940]   and buying bonds or bond funds, no.
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:26.980]   Obviously, it's not going to be sensible.
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:29.020]   Most people in retirement are going
[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:33.060]   to want a stream of income they get every month,
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:37.180]   and preferably an income stream that is indexed to inflation
[00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:39.540]   and is at least partially tax-free.
[00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:42.260]   And that is what Social Security will deliver.
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:44.940]   We also know from the research that retirees
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:48.340]   who have predictable income from a pension,
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:51.420]   from Social Security, from an immediate fixed annuity,
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:53.100]   tend to be happier.
[00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:55.020]   Frankly, when people claim that they're
[00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:57.460]   going to take Social Security early
[00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:00.900]   and invest it in the markets, if you dig beneath the surface,
[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:03.100]   what you tend to find out is they have already
[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:05.880]   claimed Social Security early, and now they're
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.740]   trying to justify what they've already done.
[00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:10.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:15.260]   Moving on to a different question,
[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:19.100]   if I have a certain percentage of my portfolio
[00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:21.740]   that I want in bonds, and I don't
[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:24.740]   have any more space in my tax-deferred accounts,
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:28.220]   would you recommend buying munis in my taxable brokerage
[00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:29.780]   account?
[00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:34.860]   How do I decide if munis are right for me?
[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:36.460]   I think that's exactly how you decide
[00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:38.060]   whether munis are right for you.
[00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:40.940]   I used to have a portfolio that was all sheltered.
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:43.140]   Now I have a portfolio that's almost all taxable.
[00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:45.620]   That's just the way my financial life has gone.
[00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:49.540]   And so my bonds are now mostly in taxable.
[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:52.820]   And because I'm in a high tax bracket, that means muni bonds.
[00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:57.060]   And so I think we're forced by our circumstances
[00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:58.580]   to invest in muni bonds.
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:01.780]   I just can't put everything into a tax-protected account.
[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:03.820]   It's too small of a percentage of my portfolio.
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:05.920]   So something's got to go into taxable.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.380]   And if it's going to go into taxable and is bonds for me,
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:11.820]   that means muni bonds.
[00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:14.100]   In terms of deciding if you should have munis,
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:16.740]   you look at the taxable equivalent yield.
[00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:19.940]   So what would you have to earn on your muni after taxes
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:24.300]   to make it equivalent to a taxable bond?
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:27.220]   Thank you.
[00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:28.300]   Going to like this one.
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:30.420]   Are index funds a bubble?
[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:31.820]   We'll let the panel address that.
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:36.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:36.780]   No.
[00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:39.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:43.080]   They've done very well, though.
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.000]   No.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.260]   Index funds a bubble?
[00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:47.000]   Is that what the question was, you said?
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.500]   No.
[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:50.000]   No.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:55.280]   I think it's important to realize that, yes, US
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:58.320]   stocks have done great over the last decade.
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:44:59.920]   But I've got a lot of index funds
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:02.640]   that haven't necessarily done that great
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:03.520]   over the last decade.
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:04.680]   Those are index funds, too.
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:07.080]   So I wouldn't say that because it's an index fund,
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.200]   it's a bubble.
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:11.320]   I mean, the index fund is just matching the market.
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:11.880]   That's it.
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:14.280]   Whatever that market may be.
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:17.200]   And just to add to Jim's point, if you
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:22.400]   have a cap-weighted index fund, every stock that it owns,
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.880]   individual investors actually manage their portfolio
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:28.520]   own in exactly the same percentages
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:30.000]   if you look at them collectively.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.040]   So if index funds are a bubble, then so
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:37.360]   are all active investors invested in those stocks.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.760]   Yeah, there's a whole list of really stupid things
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:43.080]   that active managers say about index funds.
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:47.080]   And I think that's number two or three on the list.
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:49.560]   It's pretty high up on the list.
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:51.520]   OK.
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:55.880]   I wanted to ask you, looking out at the landscape of investment
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:59.840]   products and services at Vanguard and at other firms,
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:03.320]   I'm wondering, are there developments of note
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:06.520]   that you think could be beneficial or handy
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:09.280]   for investors or things you're seeing
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:12.040]   that you're particularly concerned about these days?
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:18.040]   Are you asking about products that should be available that
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:18.920]   are not?
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:19.420]   It could be.
[00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:20.120]   It could be that.
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:22.560]   Or it could be things that are available.
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:23.880]   Well, I'll make a pitch, and I've
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:27.320]   been doing this for a long time, for balance ETFs
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:31.040]   that we can put in taxable accounts, where
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:35.160]   the tax efficiency of the ETF would be--
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:38.360]   using that to create redemption baskets within the ETF
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:44.640]   would be a real benefit in a balanced portfolio.
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:46.280]   So you could buy one fund.
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:49.320]   You could buy a balanced index fund in your taxable account
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:53.120]   that has municipals in it, no capital gain distributions,
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:55.400]   fairly low dividend distributions.
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:56.800]   I think that would be beneficial.
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:59.480]   But it's not out there.
[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:01.280]   I mean, Alan Roth isn't up here right now,
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:04.160]   but I'll put in a plug-in for his favorite idea,
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.000]   or what I think is his favorite idea, which
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:11.160]   is, if you take the current TIPS yield of, let's say, 2.4%,
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:14.920]   and you amortize that over 30 years into a sinking fund
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:18.240]   so that you get an inflation-adjusted real income
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.200]   every year for 30 years-- you basically
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:24.080]   are making a ladder-- then you have about a 4.8% burn
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:25.160]   rate out of that.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:29.400]   A real burn rate of 4.8% every year goes up by inflation.
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:33.200]   And it would really be nice if some large index fund
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:40.800]   provider would provide a fund like that, dated to 2053, 2043,
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:46.520]   and so forth, that would yield that amortized real interest
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:48.760]   payment over the lifetime of it.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.120]   It would have a fixed duration.
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:55.240]   But there are some fixed duration TIPS funds, ETFs now,
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:55.840]   right?
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.840]   Yes, but they're constantly rolling.
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:47:59.600]   There's some brand new ones that basically
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:00.960]   function as individual TIPS.
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.720]   They're basically one-year TIPS, which
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:05.140]   don't make a lot of sense to me, because you might as well
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.960]   just buy the darn TIP for that year.
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:10.520]   One product-- it's not necessarily new,
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:13.440]   but it addresses the concern that Jim brought up
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:15.800]   in terms of, when you're buying individual bonds,
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:18.560]   it can be very safe to buy Treasury bills or agency bonds
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:19.160]   or CDs.
[00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:20.680]   But when you get into corporates,
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:22.320]   now you're taking on some risk.
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:24.240]   So there are packages of bonds.
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:25.600]   It's called bullet shares.
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:26.920]   It's basically an ETF.
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:28.000]   It's a package of bonds.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.520]   They all mature about the same time.
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:32.080]   And so I think products like that
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:35.160]   can be a good hybrid that allows you to create somewhat
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:39.080]   of a bond ladder, but still getting diversification
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:42.720]   if you were going to go into corporates.
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:46.120]   If I could have one wish out of Vanguard,
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:48.480]   it would be that they would fix it
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:53.920]   so we can buy ETFs other than Vanguard with partial shares.
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:57.040]   I think that'll change the life of a lot of investors
[00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:00.000]   who don't have a lot of money.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.560]   OK, I think we have run out of time.
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:05.440]   I want to thank an incredible panel--
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:10.600]   Bill Bernstein, Rick Ferry, Paul Merriman, Dana Anspach,
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:12.640]   Jonathan Clemens, Jim Dolley.
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:16.640]   It's been great to hear all your observations, your disagreements.
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.440]   Thank you.
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:21.800]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:25.160]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:26.960]   Thanks.
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:31.120]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
