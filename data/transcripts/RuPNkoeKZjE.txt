[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   >> The choir has just invited us to fill this place with heavenly music,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   which we are definitely going to do in just a moment.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   And even later this evening in a very special way.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   And I say that because tonight at the very end of Pastor Charles' message,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   we're going to ask the overflow rooms to come into the worship center,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   to fill the aisles, to be all of us together as one,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   and to end the night with worship and song together.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   So when you see or hear Pastor Charles pray at the very end of his message tonight,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   that will be your cue, overflow, to come and be with us here in the worship center.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   But before that, we have a moment now to pray and to fill this room with praise before God.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Bow with me in prayer.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Heavenly Father, we gather tonight as men numbering in the thousands,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   but we sing together as messengers with one voice, one heart, one Lord.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   We gather to lift up our praise to the fullest of our capacity,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   to reach, as it were, the fringes of heaven,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   and to invite the angels to wonder at the joyful sound that echoes off these walls.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   We come even now imploring you, our great Savior,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   to fill our souls with joy and to fill your ears with praise.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   May all that takes place in this hour be a sweet aroma to you,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   for you are our soul's delight.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And we pray this in Jesus' precious name, amen.

[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   to publicly say, on the behalf
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   of all of us here, to Dr. John MacArthur,
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   we love you, we thank God for you, and we are praying
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   for you. Amen.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   [applause]
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   [applause]
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   And then let me say as a guest here
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   at Grace Community Church for this conference, well technically at this point,
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   I know ecclesiology doesn't work this way, but I feel I'm a part
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   of Grace Church at this point, but
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   as a guest here for this conference, I want to say
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   on the behalf of all of us gathered, to the pastors,
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   to the staff, to the conference coordinators,
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   to the more than 1,000 volunteers of this church who have served us
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   this week, thank you for serving us well.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   Thank you for serving us well. Amen.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   Amen. Amen.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   Amen.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   Amen.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   [applause]
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   This afternoon in the bookstore,
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   I was asked by a young man, Christian, student at the university,
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   how does a 17-year-old pastor a church?
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   There are a lot of answers to that question. One answer
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   to that question is that I believe a pastor
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   needs a pastor. And as a young man,
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   God brought a pastor into my life, and I am honored that he's here tonight,
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   Dr. Melvin Vaughn Wade, who is at this point 80 years old,
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   who served for 42 years the Mount Moriah Baptist Church in Los Angeles.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   He is here to pray for his son as I preach tonight. Dad, would you stand?
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   I'm grateful for you being here with me tonight.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   [applause]
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   Would you bow with me in a word of prayer?
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   Heavenly Father, we praise you for
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   What a privilege it is for us to be gathered tonight to sing
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   praise to the matchless name of Jesus,
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   who is our all-sufficient prophet, priest, and king.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   Now we ask that you would cause our worship
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   to go higher as you deepen our understanding of your word.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   Open our eyes that we may behold wonderful things from your word.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   Give us ears to hear what the Spirit says
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   to the church. Help us, Lord,
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   to receive with gentleness the implanted word that is able to save our souls,
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   and help us to be doers of your word, not hearers only, lest we deceive ourselves.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   Grant me tonight -- you know the burden under which
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   I preach tonight -- help me, Lord.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   Guide my thoughts, guard my heart, govern my words
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   so that everything I say would be consistent with sound doctrine.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   And as the seed of your word is planted and watered, we know that only you
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   can give the increase. So we reserve for you, as always, the highest praise and
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   full credit for the fruit that shall come from this time. In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   Would you turn your attention with me tonight to Isaiah chapter 55.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   Isaiah chapter 55
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   records the great invitation.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   Permit me to read
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   the chapter to you in its entirety.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   "Come, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   And he who has no money, come, buy and eat.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   Come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   Why do you spend your money for that which is not bread,
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   and your labor for that which does not satisfy?
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   Listen diligently to me, and eat what is good, and delight yourselves in rich food.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   Incline your ear and come to me.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   I hear that your soul may live, and I will make with you an everlasting covenant,
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   my steadfast, sure love for David.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   Behold, I made him a witness to the peoples, a leader and commander for the peoples.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   Behold, you shall call a nation that you do not know,
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   and a nation that did not know you shall run to you,
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   because of the Lord your God and the Holy One of Israel,
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   for he has glorified you.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   Seek the Lord while he may be found.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   Call upon him while he is near.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   Let him return to the Lord, that he may have compassion on him,
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the Lord.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways,
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   and my thoughts than your thoughts.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return there,
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   but water the earth, it can bring forth and sprout,
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   So shall my word be that goes out from my mouth.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   It shall never return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose,
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   and shall succeed in the thing for which I send it.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   For you shall go out in joy and be led forth in peace.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   The mountains and the hills before you shall break forth into singing,
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   Instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   Instead of the briar shall come up the myrtle.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   And it shall make a name for the Lord,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   Amen.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   Crescenzio Ibarra recorded a brief video inviting family, friends, and neighbors
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   to a birthday party for his 15-year-old daughter, Ruby.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   It was to be a grand affair with food and music and games,
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   including a horse race with a 10,000 pesos prize.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   "Everyone is invited," says Crescenzio in this 45-second clip
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   as he stood with his wife and daughter.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   When the local photographer uploaded the video to the community's Facebook page,
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   he inadvertently clicked "public" instead of "private."
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   1.2 million people are SVP'd for Ruby's birthday party.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   The video was shared 978,000 times.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   #15Deruby was a trending topic on social media.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   The Mexican Airlines Interjet got in on all the fun
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   and offered 30% discounts for people buying tickets
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   to this small northern Mexico town for Ruby's birthday party.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   The party took place December 26, 2016.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   If you pull clips, newsreels of it, you'll see how overwhelmed the young lady
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   seemed to be by the spectacle of it all.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   The young man actually died in a freak accident during the advertised horse race.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   Ruby's mother, Aneldo, complained to a reporter.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   "My husband gave the invitation, but just to those who lived in the neighboring regions,
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   I don't know who copied it, but they posted it and it went out, wait for it,
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   as if it was an invitation to the whole world."
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   Ruby's hijacked birthday party illustrates the tragedy of fallen humanity.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   We receive invitations from the world that are not meant for us.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   We respond to invitations from the world that cannot fulfill what they promise.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   Sin makes us all excited about what is not actually true
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   and causes us to ignore what is ultimately true.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   C.S. Lewis said, "I would suppose that our father does not find our desires too strong,
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   but too weak."
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   We are half-hearted creatures fooling about with sex and ambition and alcohol
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   when infinite joy has been offered to us.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   We are like ignorant children who continue, he said, playing with mudplies in the slums
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   because we don't know what it means to be offered a holiday at sea.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   Lewis concluded, "We are far too easily pleased."
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   But I want to remind us tonight, brothers, true satisfaction is only found
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   in the great invitation that God extends to guilty sinners.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   There is arguably no greater statement of that great invitation than Isaiah chapter 55.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   Isaiah chapter 53 predicts and proclaims the redemptive work of the suffering servant.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   We see in chapter 54 the benefits of that redemptive work of the servant
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   for the people of Israel.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   But chapter 55 gives a wide-ranging, far-reaching, and life-transforming invitation
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   to all who would receive the handout of amazing grace.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   God graciously extends a great invitation for unworthy sinners to get right with Him.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   I believe this is an appropriate word for us to conclude this conference with.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   We have spent this week considering what it means to proclaim Christ to the ends of the earth.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   Isaiah 55 reminds us that the magnitude of our message is the motivation for our mission.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   God extends a great invitation for guilty sinners to get right with Him.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   Isaiah chapter 55 presents two truths about this great invitation.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   On one hand, Isaiah 55 presents a great invitation that is too good to be true.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   A great invitation that is too good to be true.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   Divine judgment on rebellious and stubborn sin resulted in the Babylonian captivity,
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   but here God graciously offers to feed and fulfill and forgive His people.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   As you read through this chapter, you should know that this great invitation is more than a good opportunity.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   It's a God-given obligation.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   There are some 12 commands in the first seven verses of this chapter.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   God commands sinners to come to Him, trust His promises, and repent of their sins.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   See it in the text.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   First, God commands sinners to come to Him.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   In verse 1, the call to come is issued four times.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   Come, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   He who has no money, come, buy and eat. Come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   True satisfaction is available in God, but the sinner must come to Him.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   Would you note the condition for coming?
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   Come, everyone who thirsts.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   This great invitation is extended to anyone and everyone who recognizes His spiritual neediness.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   Mark it down, brothers. Self-sufficiency automatically disqualifies you from spiritual benefits.
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   Only thirsty people can receive the living waters.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   John chapter 7, verse 37, Jesus says, "If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink."
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   Here in Isaiah 55, God talks as if He is a street merchant, standing on the corner,
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   offering food and drink to the needy who would pass by.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   But unlike the street merchant, God offers His wares free of charge.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   Come, He says, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   And he who has no money, come, buy and eat. Come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   This is the handout of amazing grace.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   Matthew chapter 5, verse 3 says it this way, "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of God."
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   We are the privilege of declaring this gracious message, this great invitation,
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   that God offers wine and milk without money and without price.
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   Richard's notes here, "It cost us nothing. It cost Christ everything."
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   Look at verse 2.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   Verse 2 asks, "Why do you spend your money for that which is not bread,
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   and your labor for that which does not satisfy?"
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   Verse 1 tells us that sin robs us of spiritual resources.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   Verse 2 tells us that sin robs us of spiritual discernment.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   Sin makes fools of us.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   The rich live by their money. The poor live by their labor.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   Both waste their lives on the ways of sin.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   And the question of verse 2 is, "Why? Why?"
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   We spend our money on what sin offers only to find out it's not real bread.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   We spend our labor on what sin offers only to find out that it does not satisfy.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   Why?
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   The spirit of the question is that of Matthew chapter 16, verse 26.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   "For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?"
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   What does it profit a man to live in a big house in a gated community,
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   but your soul is homeless before God?
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   What does it profit a man to drive a fancy car with two names on the hood,
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   but your soul is thumbing a ride?
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   What does it profit a man to wear fancy clothes with a European designer's name on the label,
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   but your soul is naked before God?
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   "Don't waste your life," is the call of the messenger here,
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   "on that which does not save, will not satisfy, and does not last."
[00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   Instead, verse 2, "Listen diligently to me and eat what is good and delight yourselves in rich food."
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   The one who hears and trusts and obeys this great invitation will be fully satisfied.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   What does that mean?
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   It's John 5, verse 24.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   "Truly I say to you, whoever hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life."
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   He will not come into the judgment.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   He is passed out of death into life.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   God commands sinners to come to Him.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000]   And then God commands sinners to trust His promises.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   Verse 3, "Incline your ear," "Incline your ear," He says, "and come to Me."
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   "Hear that your soul may live."
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   Again, God extends this great invitation for the sinner to come.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   "Would you note, you must incline your ear," and the sinner must hear.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   "Hear" reminds us, brothers, of our urgent mission.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   Romans 10, verse 17, "Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the message of Christ."
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   The one who inclines his ear to hear this call of God's sovereign and amazing grace
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   will receive new life, abundant life, eternal life.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   The great invitation has a lifetime guarantee.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   "How so?" because the verse says, "I will make with you an everlasting covenant."
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   "My steadfast, sure love for David."
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   These words affirm that the great invitation that God offers and the satisfaction that
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   He gives is all of Him.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   It is by divine accomplishment, not human achievement.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   And it is modeled after His covenant love, His loyal love, His steadfast love for David.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   The covenant He established with David of a permanent throne and an unending line in
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   2 Samuel chapter 7 verses 12 through 16.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   This is no doubt talking about David and his royal line, but this passage speaks beyond
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   that.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   We'll get a hint of that in verse 4, "Behold, I made him a witness to the peoples, a leader
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   and commander for the peoples."
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   This points us beyond David to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   In fact, specifically Acts chapter 13 verse 34 says, "As for the fact that He, God, raised
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   Him, Christ, from the dead, no more to return to corruption, He has spoken in this way,
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   'I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.'"
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:00.000]   This great invitation is only received by faith in Jesus Christ.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:08.000]   John 14 verse 6 declares, "I am the way and the truth and the life.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   No one comes to the Father except through Me."
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   Let me say that again and affirm Jesus does not say, "I will show you the way."
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   He does not say, "I will tell you the truth."
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   He does not say, "I will model the life."
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   He says, "I and only I," in contradistinction to everyone else.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   "I am the way, the truth, the life.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   No one comes to the Father except through Me."
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:05:00.640]   Verse 5 speaks directly to this Messiah's servant, "Behold, you shall call a nation
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:05.560]   that do not know you, and the nation that did not know you shall run to you because
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:14.920]   of the Lord your God and of the Holy One of Israel, for He has glorified you."
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:17.360]   This is an affirmation of the Great Commission.
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:25.640]   Matthew chapter 28 verses 18 through 20 record the marching orders of the church, "All authority
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:30.240]   has been given to me in heaven and on earth.
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:37.480]   Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the
[01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:45.880]   Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:46.880]   you.
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:56.320]   And behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:58.360]   God commands sinners to come to Him.
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:00.800]   God commands sinners to trust His promises.
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:07.240]   And God commands sinners to repent of their sins.
[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:18.040]   This great invitation is extended to all, but verses 6 and 7 remind us that the sinner
[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:27.320]   must come on God's terms, not his own.
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:32.360]   What are God's terms?
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:44.120]   I could summarize verses 6 and 7 in one word, "Repent."
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:49.920]   Verse 6 says, "Repent immediately.
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:55.240]   Seek the Lord while He may be found.
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:59.080]   Call upon Him while He is near."
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:12.880]   The guilty sinner, the needy sinner, is to seek the Lord and call upon the Lord when?
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:19.800]   While He may be found, while He is near.
[01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:26.600]   Does that language shake you, brothers?
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:36.240]   It presses the urgency of our gospel message.
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:38.800]   Sinners must seek the Lord while He may be found.
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:46.200]   They must call upon Him while He is near.
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:54.720]   There is a time when God is not near enough to be found.
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:59.560]   When is that time?
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:08.920]   I don't know, and I don't want to know, and neither do you.
[01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:15.320]   The urgency of this call to repentance is that we should seek the Lord while He may
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:21.760]   be found and call upon Him while He is near.
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:25.480]   God is sovereign.
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:26.480]   Life is short.
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:31.000]   Death is coming for us all.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.720]   Hell is the destiny of the unrepentant.
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:42.120]   Everyone will spend eternity somewhere, and there is no hope of salvation without hearing
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:47.480]   the gospel, repenting of your sins, and putting your trust in the blood and righteousness
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:49.000]   of Jesus Christ.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:54.320]   We must leave here and preach this gospel with a sense of urgency.
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:58.480]   Seek the Lord while He may be found.
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:03.400]   Call upon Him while He is near.
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:09.160]   Not only should we call on sinners to repent immediately, verse 6, we should call on them
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:14.640]   to repent completely, verse 7.
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:17.720]   Let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts.
[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:22.960]   Let him return to the Lord that he may have compassion on him and to our God, for He will
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:27.800]   abundantly pardon.
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:37.280]   I think this is one of the best explanations of what repentance is that you'll find.
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:40.640]   Not the verbs.
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:45.880]   The wicked is to forsake his way.
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:51.640]   The unrighteous man is to forsake his thoughts.
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:10:02.480]   And then once sin is forsaken, he is to return to the Lord.
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:06.680]   That's it.
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:13.980]   Forsake your way and return to the Lord.
[01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:20.280]   And if the sinner will do this, what will God do?
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:25.480]   He will have compassion on him.
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:32.920]   If you return to God, if you come to God, He will -- hear this beautiful language -- He
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:42.600]   will not just pardon, He will abundantly pardon.
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:51.120]   Isaiah 55, verse 7 affirms Isaiah chapter 1, verse 18, "Come now, let us reason together,"
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:52.120]   says the Lord.
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:56.120]   "Though your sin be as scarlet, I'll make it white as snow.
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:59.920]   Though it be red as crimson, I will make it white like wool."
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:09.480]   And so these first seven verses present to us a great invitation that is too good to
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:14.280]   be true.
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:20.200]   Now consider the rest of the chapter.
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:26.920]   Verses 1 through 7 is a great invitation that is too good to be true, and then verses 8
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:38.680]   through 13 present a great invitation that is too good not to be true.
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:47.000]   The axiom is, "If something seems to be too good to be true, it probably is."
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:54.080]   That is rightly the cynical mindset of the world that we live in.
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:12:00.960]   The world is filled with bait-and-switch invitations, "But let God be true, though every man be
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:04.960]   a liar."
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:13.760]   One commentator said that the gospel is not a little psychological uplift.
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:23.200]   It is tomorrow's world headlines today.
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:28.080]   The rest of this chapter gives three reasons why you can trust this great invitation that
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:32.680]   God extends to unworthy sinners.
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:39.880]   The first reason is because of how God thinks.
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:46.480]   Verses 6 and 7 says, "If sinful people will forsake their way and return to the Lord,
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:52.040]   He'll be compassionate, He'll abundantly pardon."
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:13:00.540]   And the sinner hears this and says, "This is just too good to be true."
[01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:17.160]   Then the passage says, "Don't judge how God thinks based upon how you think."
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:25.080]   Verses 8 and 9, "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:26.080]   the Lord.
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:31.080]   For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:35.760]   thoughts than your thoughts."
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:39.960]   Two points here that need considering.
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:48.320]   The text first, it says, "God's thoughts and ways are different than ours."
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:55.560]   John Oswalt wrote, "Our understanding is not the measure of what God can do.
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:14:02.400]   His thoughts and ways are not like our thoughts and ways."
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:07.600]   When I was a boy, I spent every moment I could with my father and it just, it felt like living
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:08.600]   in a classroom.
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:12.640]   He was always teaching me something, and every now and then, he would just be talking and
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:16.800]   share something, and I would just be blown away and say, "Dad, boy, I never knew that."
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:21.600]   And there were occasions he would say, "Son, there's enough you don't know to start a whole
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:28.040]   new world."
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:30.080]   And it's true of all of us.
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:41.840]   Proverbs 3 verse 5 says it this way, "Trust in the Lord with all your heart and do not
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:44.680]   lean on your own understanding."
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:55.380]   Translation, "Do not depend on what you think you know."
[01:14:55.380 --> 01:15:01.240]   God's thoughts and ways are different than ours, but not only different, God's thoughts
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:05.880]   and ways are higher than ours.
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:08.920]   How high?
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:17.840]   Verse 9, "As the heavens are higher than the earth."
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:27.880]   God's thoughts and ways are infinitely above our thoughts and ways.
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:36.040]   He is, in the language of Ephesians 3 verse 20, able to do far more abundantly than all
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:46.160]   that we could ask or think.
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:53.720]   We can't measure the gospel, don't measure the gospel by human reasoning.
[01:15:53.720 --> 01:16:01.920]   Romans chapter 5 verse 7 says, "Scarcely would a man die for a righteous person.
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:07.900]   Perhaps for a good man one would dare to die, but God so commended His love toward us that
[01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:18.780]   while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
[01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:29.020]   There is no reason, we have no right, we have no reason to second-guess a God like that.
[01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:39.340]   We should trust Him, we should serve Him, and we should praise Him.
[01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:47.740]   Psalm 145 verse 3 declares, "Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised, and His greatness
[01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:50.800]   is unsearchable."
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:57.420]   If God was an average God, average praise would be acceptable.
[01:16:57.420 --> 01:17:01.820]   If God was just an ordinary God, then ordinary praise would be okay.
[01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:11.860]   But great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised, and His greatness is unsearchable.
[01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:18.540]   We trust this message of God's sovereign grace to save sinners in Christ because of how God
[01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:29.140]   thinks and because of how God speaks.
[01:17:29.140 --> 01:17:31.480]   God's thoughts and ways are different than ours.
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:34.340]   God's thoughts and ways are higher than ours.
[01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:40.700]   How then can we know God's thoughts and understand God's ways?
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:44.580]   Verses 10 and 11 says, "For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not
[01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:49.460]   return there but water the earth, making it bring forth and sprout, giving seed to the
[01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:55.940]   sower and bread to the eater, so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth.
[01:17:55.940 --> 01:18:00.680]   It shall never return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose and
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:07.200]   shall succeed in the thing for which I send it."
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:10.800]   God speaks through storms.
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:15.220]   The snow and rain do not fall from heaven and evaporate.
[01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:18.600]   God is at work through them.
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:26.560]   In a real sense, the precipitation from heaven produces transformation on earth.
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:31.800]   Look at verse 10 again, "As the rain and the snow come down from heaven, it does not return
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:43.920]   there, but God uses it to water the earth, making the earth bring forth and sprout."
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:50.920]   Notice this next phrase, I love it, "giving seed to the sower," that's the beginning of
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:58.760]   the process, "and bread to the eater," that's the end of the process.
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:05.740]   That God, who is at work through storms, is at work through His Word.
[01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:08.560]   Look at verse 11.
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:12.100]   Notice how God speaks about His own Word.
[01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:20.000]   He calls it, "My Word that comes from my mouth."
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:25.520]   Second Timothy chapter 3 verse 16 and 17 affirms this, "All Scripture is breathed out by God
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:31.400]   and is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness,
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:36.720]   that the man of God would be complete and equipped for every good work."
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:45.320]   The Bible is not man's thoughts about God, it is God's self-revelation.
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:52.140]   The nature and character and authority of Scripture are rooted in the nature and character
[01:19:52.140 --> 01:20:00.560]   and authority of God Himself.
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:09.240]   So we have the confidence concerning this Word that we preach that God's Word will never
[01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:13.680]   return to him empty.
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:16.920]   God's Word will accomplish that which He purposes.
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:21.800]   God's Word shall succeed in the thing for which He sends it.
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:27.440]   So we preach this message and proclaim this Christ with confidence because of how God
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:37.760]   thinks, because of how God speaks, and then because of how God works.
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:46.520]   Verse 12, "You shall go out in joy and be led forth in peace."
[01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:50.800]   In a real sense, this is a reference to the Babylonian captivity.
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:55.960]   God will deliver His people, but they will not come out by their own strength or power
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:57.260]   or resources.
[01:20:57.260 --> 01:21:04.640]   They shall go out because they are led forth by divine intervention.
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:15.840]   By God's sovereign grace, they shall go out in true joy and be led forth in real peace.
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:22.320]   Here we see another affirmation that what God will do through Israel will be much bigger
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:26.240]   than Israel.
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:41.280]   Verse 12 pictures it as having effects on nature, the created world.
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:49.920]   See it in verse 12, "The mountains and the hills before you shall break forth into singing,
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:57.920]   and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands."
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:21:58.920]   I like that.
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:09.560]   I know some people that pick churches to make sure none of that happens.
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:16.280]   The glory of God's triumphant grace will be so great that all of nature will join in.
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:26.200]   "The hills shall break forth in singing, the trees of the field shall clap their hands."
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:27.520]   This is our hope in Christ.
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:37.200]   Romans chapter 8 verse 21 points to that day where creation itself will be set free from
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:47.380]   its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God.
[01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:54.320]   So verse 12 shows us how God graciously gives that which is not deserved, and then verse
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:23:00.280]   13 shows us how God mercifully withholds what is deserved.
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:11.820]   "Instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress, instead of the briar shall come up the myrtle."
[01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:16.920]   And Adam and Eve sinned in the Garden of Eden.
[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:20.460]   The ground was cursed because of Adam's sin.
[01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:25.980]   When he worked by the sweat of his brow, there would be many times when the earth would only
[01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:37.080]   produce thorns and thistles, but when God works, death is transformed into life, judgment
[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:44.740]   is transformed into salvation, curses are transformed into blessings, barrenness is
[01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:58.260]   transformed into fruitfulness, and briars are transformed into evergreens.
[01:23:58.260 --> 01:24:02.940]   Why does God work this way?
[01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:21.300]   Verse 13 says, "And it shall make a name for the Lord, an everlasting sign that shall
[01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:22.300]   not be cut off."
[01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:23.300]   Do you see that second to the last line?
[01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:27.460]   Let me land there.
[01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:36.620]   All of this is for the sake of His name.
[01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:48.500]   I called my wife this morning, checked on her and the kids.
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:51.260]   She says, "You hadn't talked to your daughter yet?"
[01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:52.260]   "No."
[01:24:52.260 --> 01:24:57.420]   My 16-year-old, Haley, she says, "You'll hear about the incident she had in school.
[01:24:57.420 --> 01:24:59.860]   She shocked her teacher."
[01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:01.580]   I said, "What happened?"
[01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:08.700]   She says, "Her teacher knows you are a minister, and they started having a spiritual conversation,
[01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:15.340]   and the teacher was asking about you and about your teaching and about the church."
[01:25:15.340 --> 01:25:23.060]   And in the conversation, Haley mentioned, Crystal says, that you were in Los Angeles
[01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:29.060]   speaking at the Shepherd's Conference at John MacArthur's church.
[01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:33.460]   The teacher said to my daughter, "Wow, that's a big deal."
[01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:36.860]   Crystal said, Haley told the teacher, "No, it's not.
[01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:52.060]   My daddy is a nobody."
[01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:57.680]   And I know she was telling the truth.
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:05.220]   When I return home from trips like this, my daughter, Haley, 16 years old, hugs me and
[01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:08.060]   says, "I'm glad to have my daddy back.
[01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:09.060]   How did it go?"
[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:11.140]   I tell her how I went at the event.
[01:26:11.140 --> 01:26:13.540]   She says, "That's great, daddy.
[01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:14.540]   But you know you're a nobody.
[01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:16.660]   You're just my daddy.
[01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:19.820]   You're a nobody."
[01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:27.820]   And when I share with the family, doors God has opened and projects God blessed us to
[01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:37.380]   complete, she rejoices and prays God with us, and tells me how proud she is of me, and
[01:26:37.380 --> 01:26:47.500]   then always adds, "But don't forget, daddy, you are nobody."
[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:57.340]   May every one of us leave here with that reminder.
[01:26:57.340 --> 01:27:03.740]   God did not call you to preach, brother, to make your name great.
[01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:10.540]   He didn't call you to the place you serve to make your name great.
[01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:16.060]   May the Lord help us to preach faithfully this good news of Jesus Christ and die and
[01:27:16.060 --> 01:27:30.840]   be forgotten if the name of Jesus can't go forth to the nations.
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:38.620]   We have been doing something wrong this week if we don't leave here singing Psalm 115,
[01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:42.780]   verse 1.
[01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:55.000]   Not unto us, not unto us, O Lord, but to Your name give glory
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:13.900]   for Your steadfast love and Your faithfulness.
[01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:20.440]   My daddy ran away from home when he was a boy.
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:31.720]   A white family took him in and helped raise him, sent him to school.
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:37.160]   And after his first year, as he'd be going into his second year, he ran into financial
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:43.840]   struggles and didn't know if he'd be able to continue, and he was pointed to another
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:51.440]   white family there who were offering to help him.
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:56.920]   The family invited my dad to dinner.
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:29:02.260]   During the dinner, the father, the man of the house, asked my dad about his testimony
[01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:07.360]   and called a ministry.
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:15.120]   And the dinner ended with that man pulling out his checkbook and writing a check to pay
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:21.680]   the expenses for my father's schooling.
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:29.280]   My dad said, however, when he got the check and looked at it, the old man didn't like
[01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:39.480]   his expression and said, "Son, what's the matter?"
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:41.720]   My dad said, "Oh, it's nothing.
[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:48.840]   I just see that you misspelled Charles on the check."
[01:29:48.840 --> 01:30:03.400]   The old man said, "Son, it ain't your name on that check that counts, it's mine."
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:15.200]   And may we leave here knowing there's only one name that counts.
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:19.000]   He's Adam's maker.
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:23.860]   He's Abel's vindicator.
[01:30:23.860 --> 01:30:25.880]   He's Moses' bush on fire.
[01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:30.360]   He's Gideon's fleece.
[01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:34.560]   His name is Jesus.
[01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:38.960]   There is a name I love to hear.
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:41.680]   I love to sing its words.
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:50.500]   It sounds like music in my ears, the sweetest name on earth.
[01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:59.680]   It tells me of my Savior's love who died to set me free, and it tells me of His precious
[01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:05.600]   blood, the sinner's perfect plea.
[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:10.320]   Oh, how I love Jesus.
[01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:14.360]   Oh, how I love Jesus.
[01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:19.600]   In fact, right now I wish I could say it the way I feel it.
[01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:29.720]   Oh, how I love Jesus because He first loved me.
[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:32.320]   Let's pray.
[01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:51.040]   Heavenly Father, we give You praise for Your sovereign grace, Your free invitation to guilty,
[01:31:51.040 --> 01:32:03.240]   rebellious, unworthy sinners, near and far, of every nation, tribe, tongue, and people
[01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:11.080]   who would hear the good news of the bloody cross and empty tomb of Jesus Christ and turn
[01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:17.680]   from their sins and trust in Him.
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:23.600]   You offer free forgiveness and new life and eternal hope.
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:30.720]   We thank You that You have not only reconciled us to Yourself through Christ, but You have
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:39.680]   made us ministers and messengers of reconciliation, ambassadors of Christ, heralds of Your Word
[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:43.960]   and the testimony of Christ.
[01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:52.080]   I pray that we would leave this place, wherever You have called us to serve.
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:33:07.960]   May we head back to our assignments, consumed with this good news to proclaim.
[01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:15.200]   And I pray even for those who are in hard places, I'm asking in the name of Jesus that
[01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:21.180]   despite the difficulty of the setting, I pray that the magnitude of our message would be
[01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:24.600]   the motivation for our mission.
[01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:33.440]   And Lord, we also take this opportunity to pray Your blessings on the Grace Community
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:36.520]   Church.
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:44.880]   You have used this pastor and this congregation and the ministries of this local church to
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:58.200]   bless so many of us, to teach us, to encourage us, to strengthen us.
[01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:12.200]   We pray, Father, that You would heal and strengthen and sustain our dear brother, Dr. MacArthur.
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:22.120]   We pray that during these days You will prove afresh in his experience that Your grace is
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:26.720]   sufficient for us and Your strength is perfected in our weakness.
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:30.520]   And then we pray that You would put ahead Your protection around this church.
[01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:34.760]   We know that the enemy has plots and schemes, Lord.
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:38.880]   Make the devil behave.
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:46.280]   Protect this church and its witness in this community and throughout the nations.
[01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:56.200]   Smile on these brothers who joyfully spread this good news in states across this country
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:35:00.520]   as we leave here and outposts around the world.
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:05.200]   And may it all be to the praise of Your glory we ask in Jesus' name, amen.
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:06.200]   Amen.
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:07.200]   [APPLAUSE]

[01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:15.700]   the impact of all that has taken place the last few days here.
[01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:18.700]   The preaching was more than good.
[01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:23.200]   Stylistically or homiletically, it was important preaching.
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:26.700]   It was troubling, and it was soothing as well.
[01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:29.200]   But more than that, more than that,
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:34.200]   the music has been uniting and stirring and powerful.
[01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:39.700]   But more than that, the look in your eyes
[01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:44.700]   and the glow of your faces and the firmness of your handshakes
[01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:50.700]   and the sound of your singing just fills our hearts with joy.
[01:42:50.700 --> 01:42:53.700]   And we are so thankful because all of us here at Grace
[01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:58.700]   Community Church have desired to be that cup of water for you
[01:42:58.700 --> 01:43:03.700]   who labor so hard in the field for the Lord.
[01:43:03.700 --> 01:43:06.200]   And so we're thankful on behalf of the elders of Grace
[01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:09.700]   Community Church, thank you for letting
[01:43:09.700 --> 01:43:16.200]   us serve you in this way because we serve the King of Heaven
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:17.700]   just like you.
[01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:19.200]   And please accept this invitation
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:23.700]   to come back next year, and let's do this whole thing again.
[01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:26.200]   All right?
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:27.700]   Don't forget before you leave, I'm
[01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:30.200]   going to pray that you take your belongings home
[01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:33.700]   and know that the Shepherds Conference media is already
[01:43:33.700 --> 01:43:35.700]   online for you to enjoy.
[01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:36.200]   All right?
[01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:38.200]   Let's pray together.
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:41.700]   Oh, Holy Lamb upon the throne, as we have just sung,
[01:43:41.700 --> 01:43:45.700]   be blessing, honor, glory, power for the battle
[01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:47.700]   you have already won.
[01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:50.200]   And take these soldiers who serve you
[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:53.200]   in the trenches of this war and equip them
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:56.700]   with the armor and shields and breastplate that
[01:43:56.700 --> 01:44:01.200]   can protect them and allow them enough victory to stand strong
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:06.700]   as men and enough struggle to lean upon you as a child.
[01:44:06.700 --> 01:44:10.200]   And may the result of our time together deepen their resolve,
[01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:14.700]   strengthen their faith, and broaden their impact
[01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:18.200]   for your gospel all around this world.
[01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:20.200]   And we pray these things in the name
[01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:25.200]   of the one who shed his blood for us, the nobodies of his
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:26.700]   body.
[01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:28.700]   Amen.
[01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:30.700]   Blessings to you all.
