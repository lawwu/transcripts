[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:10.440]   Our next speaker is Alan Roth, MBA, CPA, CFP.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.440]   He has a lot more letters behind his name than I do.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.400]   So he's at least four times smarter than me,
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.680]   I think is the way that what that means.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.320]   He is the founder of a fee-only hourly
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.580]   financial advisory firm.
[00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.560]   He has 25 years of experience in corporate finance.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.420]   He was the corporate finance officer
[00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.960]   of two multi-billion dollar companies,
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.440]   works as a consultant.
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.280]   He is the author of an investing book.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.240]   He is an investment and financial columnist
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.720]   for the AARP, for etf.com, for Financial Planning Magazine.
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.280]   And most importantly, my favorite reason why I like Alan
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.420]   is something he hasn't done for quite some time,
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.240]   this role he had as a columnist called The Mole,
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.900]   where he went undercover in the financial planning industry
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.840]   and basically revealed all their secrets.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.860]   So he hasn't done that for over a decade,
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.160]   but it's still my favorite role, Alan.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160]   And thank you for being here today.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.900]   (audience applauds)
[00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.480]   - Wow, skies are opening up when I talk.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.000]   Yeah, The Mole was the most fun I ever had writing.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.560]   Bear the right amount of risk.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.100]   How do we typically, holy crap.
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.340]   How do we typically determine the amount of risk to take?
[00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.860]   We take a risk profile questionnaire.
[00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.700]   And I know it doesn't seem like it today,
[00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.260]   but these are the returns of the total US in blue,
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.300]   total international in red, and total bond.
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.460]   And we are in the single worst nine months in bonds
[00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.500]   that has ever happened before.
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.900]   But still, bonds are a whole lot less risky than stocks.
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.680]   And by the way, there are some wonderful opportunities
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.460]   in this bond route.
[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.100]   Something like TIPS a year ago,
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.540]   you could earn a negative 1.6 return, real return.
[00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.660]   Today it's a positive 1.7.
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.540]   So there are some really good things
[00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.220]   about this really bad bond market.
[00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.540]   How do we typically determine our risk?
[00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.020]   Raise your hand if you've ever taken
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.740]   a risk profile questionnaire.
[00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.740]   Vast majority of people, me too.
[00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.460]   Well, Jason Zweig of the Wall Street Journal,
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.540]   who'll be here tomorrow, says they're worthless.
[00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.060]   And I say, Jason, I completely disagree with you.
[00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.220]   They're not that good.
[00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.940]   They're actually dangerous.
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.060]   Why?
[00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.620]   Because the way we feel about risk is not stable.
[00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.380]   And the bigger one is they don't measure
[00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.180]   one's need to take risk.
[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.660]   I've taken risk profile questionnaires.
[00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.940]   I love to take them.
[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.140]   And I get, I should be 70% to 140% in stocks.
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.840]   I should have a margin account.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.300]   By the way, what would have happened
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.160]   to that margin account in today's market?
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.460]   It would have been called.
[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.940]   I'm 45% in stocks.
[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:14.780]   Why?
[00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.500]   Because we've won the game.
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.540]   Our need to take risk is low.
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.140]   So there is a company that I think has
[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.660]   the single best risk profile questionnaire out there.
[00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.300]   Not at liberty to mention their name,
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.560]   but it starts with a V.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.180]   So here is an example of one question.
[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.100]   In 2008, stocks lost over 31%.
[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.940]   If this happened again, what would I do?
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.580]   And I answered it truthfully.
[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.100]   I would buy more stocks, which is what I did in 2008.
[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.260]   But one, it was really, really hard.
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.260]   And two, if I were 80% stocks,
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.740]   I never would have had the cash or the courage
[00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.000]   to buy more stocks back then.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.460]   So feelings about risk.
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.740]   Beginning of this year, I'm hearing a lot of,
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.900]   I've got a long investment horizon,
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.420]   so I'm comfortable being 100% in stocks.
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.660]   Now I'm hearing, this has never happened before.
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.540]   Bonds and stocks at the same time,
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.300]   I'm going all to cash until things settle down.
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.340]   I'm not panicking.
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.060]   This is logical, rational.
[00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.100]   They're panicking.
[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.380]   So I want to make someone in this audience
[00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.200]   a hundred billion dollar bet.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.780]   And I'd rather have some diversity
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.700]   rather than a white male, okay.
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.280]   So who would take this bet
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.440]   where there's a 99% chance of winning?
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.140]   If I tell you that if you lose, you die.
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.960]   Your spouse dies, your children die.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.560]   Probably wouldn't take that bet.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.000]   So we want to look at probabilities and consequences.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.720]   So we typically ask,
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.240]   how would you feel if your stocks lost 50%?
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.880]   Maybe the better question is,
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.360]   how would you feel if you couldn't send your daughter
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.800]   to that prestigious college
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.840]   that she worked so hard to get into?
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.280]   If you had to work another decade
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.240]   in that awful stressful job with that horrible boss,
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.840]   if you couldn't buy the lake house.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.700]   So again, you have to think in terms of consequences.
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.480]   So willingness to take risk.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.200]   I know from a guy,
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.600]   getting in touch with your feelings sounds a little weird,
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.900]   but you really have to imagine
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.760]   what it would be like if things don't work out.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.040]   Test the ability to rebalance in a bear.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.960]   The only good thing about this bear market
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.840]   is that with bonds and stocks going down,
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.840]   there's less of a need to rebalance.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.980]   I'm so cheerful.
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.920]   So I had a lot of people that say to me,
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.640]   oh no, no, I don't panic in a bear market.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.840]   Then they come to me as clients,
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.920]   and where did all these tax loss carry forwards come from?
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.000]   So in my opinion, the biggest predictor
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.040]   of how someone's gonna perform in the next bear market
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.180]   is what they did in the last bear market.
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.200]   So money and happiness.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.840]   I'm really disappointed Jonathan Clements isn't here
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.660]   'cause he taught me so much about money and happiness.
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.960]   I don't know, he put his family above me.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.620]   I just don't understand that.
[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:32.600]   But anyways, if Elon Musk makes another billion dollars,
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.880]   yes, he'll be happier, but when you lose money,
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.900]   you get roughly twice as much misery
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.800]   as happiness from making money.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.520]   Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel Prize
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.980]   for Prospect Theory on that.
[00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.100]   So how much risk should you take?
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.160]   A 65-year-old with a $2 million portfolio
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.360]   needs $50,000 a year above Social Security,
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.620]   and the high willingness to take risk,
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.740]   they don't have much of a need, a conservative portfolio.
[00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.820]   The above with a million-dollar portfolio,
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:06.980]   they've gotta have it grow,
[00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.100]   so maybe take a little bit more risk.
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:15.780]   If they had a low willingness to take risk,
[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:16.980]   probably shouldn't take much
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.460]   because they will sell when stocks go down.
[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.380]   A 45-year-old saving for retirement
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.020]   with a high willingness can be aggressive.
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.280]   A low willingness, again, conservative
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.200]   because they're not gonna stay.
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.900]   A 25-year-old, I'm not a fan of 100 minus your age,
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.720]   if they're saving money that they need in two years,
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.860]   don't wanna take a lot of risk with it.
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.380]   A 25-year-old who just inherited two million,
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.820]   we don't know how he or she is gonna behave.
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.680]   So again, in concept of taking risk,
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:56.180]   the only one that should have an aggressive portfolio
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.300]   is someone that has the high need
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.920]   and as hard as it is to measure
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.700]   the high willingness to take risk.
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.540]   And Carl Richards has it right.
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.900]   We buy high, sell low, we repeat 'til broke.
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:12.780]   Never take uncompensated risk.
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:20.540]   96% of stocks have earned, on average,
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.900]   the same amount as the Treasury bill.
[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.940]   There's a handful of stocks that drive the return.
[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:28.840]   And guess what?
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.340]   I don't know what those will be going forward.
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:38.140]   And I'm gonna brag, I owned Zoom
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.760]   before I even knew what Zoom was.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:41.660]   Guess what?
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:44.460]   Vanguard Total Stock Index Fund.
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.420]   Okay.
[00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:49.340]   What about asset classes with low or negative correlations?
[00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:53.140]   Commodity futures, foreign currency futures, options.
[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.420]   Can somebody tell me the one thing
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.340]   that all three of these have in common?
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:05.740]   In the aggregate, not a penny has ever been made
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.640]   before costs.
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.440]   There's someone on the other side of the trade.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.380]   Inverse S&P 500 funds, triple inverse S&P 500 funds.
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:19.380]   And don't laugh, I've had really sophisticated clients
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.500]   that were private equity managers, mutual fund managers
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.500]   that owned both an S&P 500 index fund
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.180]   and an inverse S&P 500 index fund.
[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.960]   That's like betting on both teams.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.520]   You can't win through a bookie.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.580]   Gambling half your net worth in Las Vegas,
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.560]   it'd be more fun than many of these other things.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.340]   So low or negative correlations isn't enough.
[00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:45.820]   You also need a positive expected long run return.
[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.840]   REITs sometimes have a negative correlation.
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.420]   Lately, as Christine Benz has pointed out,
[00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.340]   very positive correlation.
[00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:57.820]   Precious metals and mining funds, I think they're great,
[00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.180]   but you've got to have a stomach of lead
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.940]   to stay the course there.
[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:06.040]   The penalty for not knowing your risk.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.940]   I'm not at liberty to say the Chicago-based
[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.920]   research company this came from.
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:18.340]   But overall, an individual investor underperforms the fund,
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:24.400]   not from fees, 'cause the fund has the fees baked in,
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.080]   by 1.73%, by either performance chasing,
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.920]   not knowing our risk, et cetera.
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.800]   So the old paradigm is unrisked.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.400]   If you can't be right, at least be consistent.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.880]   But these are the three, what I call
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.480]   the second-grader portfolios,
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:43.080]   or the three-fund portfolio from Taylor Larimer,
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.680]   total US, total international, total bond,
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.840]   and it's 90%, 60%, or 30% risky,
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.960]   and guess what, they all performed roughly the same.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.280]   So pick an asset allocation that's gonna match
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.400]   your willingness and your need to take risk.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.680]   Imagine the pain of if things don't work out.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.320]   Think of asset allocation as a binding contract,
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.640]   and I tell my clients, I enforce based on guilt.
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.360]   You only wish a large New York law firm
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.920]   were out to ruin your life by comparison.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.840]   And when I disagree with a client, I negotiate.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.520]   For instance, in good times, the client might say,
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.760]   I wanna be 70% stocks, and I think 60% is more appropriate.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:31.760]   I'll say, start with the 60, and then if stocks
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.000]   go down into 20% below where they are today,
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.340]   and your appetite is still there, then go to 70,
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:42.920]   I'm testing their resolve, I'm not timing the market.
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:46.240]   And guess what, how many clients come back to me
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.200]   in that bear market and say they wanna increase,
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.280]   it's hard enough to get them to rebalance.
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.120]   Thank you.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.120]   - Thank you.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.940]   (whooshing)
[00:11:55.940 --> 00:12:05.940]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
