[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.800]   Today we highlight an excerpt from a Q&A session Pastor John recently led with the students
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.120]   at Westminster Seminary in Philadelphia. Earlier that day he had just delivered the lecture
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.780]   "The New Calvinism and the New Community" on March 12th of this year. Here's a question
[00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.080]   that came from one student.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.420]   Hi Dr. Piperat, I appreciated your thoughts this morning on New Calvinism and I was just
[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.040]   wondering if you could speak to how the New Calvinists or how the Reformed can relate
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.480]   to broader evangelicalism. Like I noticed what you had done a couple years ago by inviting
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.240]   Rick Warren to speak at Desiring God. But I'm also wondering, you know, very practically
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:47.400]   would you advise that we commend a Christian to go to Rick Warren's church or a church
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.320]   that doesn't embrace the doctrines of grace?
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.960]   Depends on what else is available. Better to go to church, defective church, than no
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.400]   church. Church is a given in the New Testament. You're not part of a church, you're not part
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:13.240]   of Jesus. So that's a big deal. And there aren't many perfect churches. Like none. So
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.040]   yeah I'd send people to Rick Warren's church in a minute. Unless there was something more
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.960]   robust, more full. I mean I don't know if you heard my 90 minute conversation with Rick.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.680]   It's online. And Rick is a Calvinist. He's a five point Calvinist. His problem is, and
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.600]   I don't care if he hears this, because I told him face to face, his problem is he doesn't
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.560]   foreground it. It is so backgrounded nobody would know it. Doctrine plays such a small
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:45.060]   role in his preaching. He would say, "but not in our church." He said, "I would take
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.480]   any random 500 people from Saddleback and put them against any random 500 people at
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:02:00.200]   Grace Church under John MacArthur and my people would win theologically." That's what he said.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:07.180]   I don't know if that's true. But at least you know he's thinking we do curriculum here
[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.520]   and I get people by talking about five ways to be happy and then they go from base one
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:21.480]   to base two to base three, home run, and then go over to John MacArthur and play ball. I
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.000]   don't think that's a good way to do church. I think if you background doctrine so consistently
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.680]   that eventually you're going to not do as much good as you could. So I told him at the
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.920]   end of that conversation, "Rick, I'm an older guy. I'm older than you are. Believe it or
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.960]   not, I'm older than you are. And I'm exhorting you, spend the last 10, 20 years of your ministry
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.760]   going deep and not just going wide and I think you'll have a longer legacy."
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.240]   But your bigger question is how to relate to the wider evangelical church. I would hope
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.780]   that people come to your churches, you become a pastor, they come to your churches and their
[00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.640]   first thought is not, "They believe in the five points here." That should not be their
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.360]   first thought. Their first thought would be, "They've got a gigantic Jesus here, gloriously
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.160]   able to meet my needs, forgive my sins, save my soul, and meet every practical need in
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.160]   my life. This is a great place to worship King Jesus. What's behind this? Well, it happens
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:23.160]   to be Reformed theology." You don't keep it secret, but there's a way. When you read the
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:30.320]   New Testament, your first impression is not, "Ah, five points everywhere." Once you see
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:39.760]   them, you spot them. But it's not written that way and our preaching shouldn't sound
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.760]   that way. It shouldn't sound doctrinaire and packaged and tulipy. It should sound, I mean
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.240]   the smell of the tulips should be there. They don't smell good though, do they? Roses would
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:58.240]   be better. So yes, we should have huge overlapping commitments with the broad, generic evangelical
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.640]   community and should not be trying to draw a little line, "Oh, I'm not one of those kind
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.640]   of people." I just think we will have a better impact for the things we love about God, the
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.800]   true things about God, if we're not constantly fingering all the badnesses that are in the
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:25.240]   broader evangelical world, but instead of being robustly strong in the goodnesses of
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.920]   Reformed thinking.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.440]   That was Pastor John at a recent open forum with the students of Westminster Theological
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.920]   Seminary. And that hour and a half interview between John Piper and Rick Warren recorded
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:41.920]   on May 1st, 2011 can be watched at DesiringGod.org. The best way to find it is to go to our website,
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.680]   DesiringGod.org and search for the blog post, which is titled, "John Piper Interviews Rick
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.360]   Warren on Doctrine." And the video is embedded in that blog post.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.800]   So what have been the most difficult and crippling challenges John Piper has faced in the ministry?
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.680]   We'll talk about that tomorrow. Until then, I'm your host Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening.
