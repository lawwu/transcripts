[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.400]   A podcast listener named Sam writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, I enjoyed your
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.940]   episode on cussing, which was episode 97, a very popular episode. It was an
[00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.440]   excellent biblical presentation. My question is how some Christians, even
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.320]   preachers, use what appear to be offensive words. My heart is broken when
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.560]   I hear words from the pulpit such as, and I'll read them, "shoot, crud, dang, crap,
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.280]   friggin, and others." How should we as Christians react to these words when we
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.080]   hear them in the pulpit?" Yeah, and it's a lot of worse, it's a lot worse than that.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.120]   And I just came from a situation where I heard plenty of it in a Christian
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.560]   context for reasons I'll try to address in a minute. But let's begin by
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.720]   preempting a legitimate pushback, because I'm gonna, I'm gonna side with Sam. I
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.840]   don't like this tendency. I think it's not good, not biblical, and has
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.120]   sinful roots. But there is a legitimate pushback, and let me address it. Paul used
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.600]   scatological or garbage language, for example, I'm thinking of dung and refuse,
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.800]   to refer to his former legalistic life in Philippians 3.18. I count everything as
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.240]   refuse or as garbage or as dung. And I've heard some people try to justify using
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.840]   the S-word here. I doubt that very much. We don't have any, we don't have any
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:39.520]   knowledge that would help us know the nature between the S-word, crap, dung,
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.800]   refuse. I mean, they get increasingly grotesque, right? And so there's no
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:52.320]   way exegetically to say for sure which of those Paul nailed, and therefore to
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.600]   try to argue with confidence that you could be as offensive as
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.160]   possible here, because Paul was, I doubt it very much. He did call his adversaries
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.120]   who advocated that dung-like way of life, dogs, and there were probably reasons for
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.040]   that. That was chapter 3, verse 2 of Philippians. And in Galatians 5.21, he
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.980]   says, "I wish those who unsettle you would emasculate themselves, castrate
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.840]   themselves." And Jesus, of course, called the destructive teachers broods of
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:29.080]   vipers, and there are others. So there is a whole group of words and sentences in
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.520]   the New Testament where Christ and the Apostles were very severe with
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.200]   adversaries of the Christian faith, or people who purported to teach the
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.680]   Christian faith and who were false teachers. So I will not say there's an
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:52.240]   absolute prohibition of using severe, cutting, aggravating, edgy language in
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:59.920]   some situations of conflict where huge and deadly things are at stake, and
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.440]   some Christians are just way too soft in their reaction to these, and we should
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.280]   rebuke them as well. But there is a big difference between the kind of
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.440]   seriousness that Jesus and Paul had when they spoke these things. There was
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.560]   nothing cavalier, there was nothing jokey, there was nothing trendy, there was no
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.520]   effort to be cool. I mean, the spirit in which the words were used by Jesus and
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:35.180]   Paul were radically different than what I think most pastors are trying to
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.720]   conjure up when they use them. Now, with that caution or preemptive strike
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.640]   against a criticism, let me go ahead and share Sam's concern about pastors and
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.360]   church leaders who seem to go out of their way to flaunt coarse, rude, dirty,
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:57.280]   questionable language. Let's just take one passage of the several we could go
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.000]   to and draw out two or three lessons from it, and I'm thinking of Ephesians 5, 3, 4,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.360]   and 5, and the thing we should watch for in these three verses is how verse 5
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:17.320]   is the ground of verse 3, manifestly, you'll see it, and then to ask, "Why is
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:24.440]   verse 4 inserted in there?" Because it just seems a break in the flow. So
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.800]   here goes. "Sexual immorality," this is verse 3, chapter 5, Ephesians, "Sexual
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.200]   immorality and all impurity and all covetousness must not even be named
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:43.360]   among you as is proper among saints or holy ones." Now that's the end of verse
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.400]   3. Now let me jump to verse 5. "For you may be sure of this, that everyone who is,"
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.100]   and then he names those three again, "sexually immoral, impure, and who is
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.640]   covetous," that is an idolater, "has no inheritance in the kingdom of God." So
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:04.440]   verse 5 is manifestly a repetition of the three sins of verse 3, and then given
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.600]   as a reason for why we should avoid them, namely, you won't enter the kingdom of
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:14.120]   God if you follow them. Between those two verses is this, "Let there be no
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:21.320]   filthiness or foolish talk nor crude joking which are out of place, but
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:29.640]   instead let there be thanksgiving." Now I paused long over this and thought, "Okay,
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.440]   this is interesting. I see the argument and the flow of thought perfectly from
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:42.600]   3 to 5, and I wonder why inserted and then not picked up again in verse 5, Paul
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:49.280]   put in verse 4, "Let there be no filthiness or foolish talk or crude
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.880]   joking which are out of place, but instead let there be thanksgiving." And I
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:00.920]   would suggest that Paul is warning against not just the heart disposition,
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:09.000]   like covetousness, or outward behavior, like sexual immorality, but also the
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.520]   verbal expression of these as well. In other words, the mouth is brought into
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.760]   consideration between verses 3 and 5 so that it would be clear it's not just
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:26.160]   what you do with your groin or your heart, but with your tongue, your mouth, as
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:33.640]   well. If it's wrong to do sexual things wrong, he's saying, I think it's wrong to
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:39.440]   be cavalier and coarse in verbalizing those very things. There's a lot of
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.080]   things people are willing to take on their mouths that they would not take in
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:51.160]   their hands, and they wouldn't take into their lives. So recently I heard a
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:59.120]   young leader say to hundreds of Christians in a
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.360]   joking way about someone who had criticized him the day before, "Screw you!"
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:11.840]   And he laughed! I mean, everybody laughed. Almost everybody. I didn't. And then
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:17.120]   realizing he'd gotten a good laugh, he did it again with another person. He said
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:24.960]   the same thing again and got another slightly less laugh. Now what's going on
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:31.680]   here? I think Paul would say that if you don't really believe someone should be
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:39.640]   screwed, you shouldn't say that. Why do you let your mouth do what you would not
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:45.600]   allow at another physical level? What's the deal here? I think that's the point
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:50.920]   of putting verse 4 between verses 3 and verse 5. And I would apply the same
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:56.720]   thing to bathroom language that you would never take in your hand, or hell,
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:05.480]   or damn, which you would never actually apply to anybody. You're taking them in a
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:11.840]   cavalier way; you're not taking seriously the very realities that you are speaking
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:19.920]   of. So the principle seems to be a pure heart and pure hands should be
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:26.400]   accompanied by a pure tongue. I think that's the point of verse 4. And here's
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:31.520]   the second thing to notice in that passageâ€”the word "proper" and the word
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.040]   "out of place." Some things are not proper; some things are out of place. Now isn't
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.760]   it interesting that Paul uses the category not just of right and wrong,
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:45.880]   good and bad, but of proper and improper, and out of place and in place. And that
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:51.480]   relates to the way he talks about love in 1 Corinthians 13 5, where he says
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:57.360]   love is notâ€”in ESV it says "rude." In the old King James it said, "Love does not
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:05.960]   behave itself unseemly." Well, what that means is love does not consider the long
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:12.520]   accepted present cultural mores and practices and then arrogantly offend
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:19.400]   against them. Love doesn't do that. Why doesn't love do that? Well, love is not
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:24.680]   stiff-necked and assertive. There's so much sense of "I can do what I want to do,
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:29.000]   I can say what I want to say," and there's behind it a kind of "me"
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.120]   assertion that "I can do this," and there's a pride underneath a lot of this
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:39.720]   language. Sometimes there's a weakness that needs to be propped up by a little
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:46.880]   braggadocio or a little edginess. Or, most commonly, I think, there's a desire to be
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:52.840]   thought-worldly wise, which contradicts Paul's statement in 1 Corinthians 14,
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:58.160]   "Be babes in evil and in thinking be mature." What does it mean to be a "babe in
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.840]   evil"? It means don't have a lot of experience with that, don't get good at
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.240]   that, don't know much about that, and a lot of young guys, they think exactly
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.520]   the opposite. They think, "I don't want to be a baby in evil. Good grief. I need to
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.480]   watch the movies, I need to listen to the shows, I need to use the
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:20.120]   language so I don't look like I'm a baby in evil." It's just the opposite of Paul's.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:25.920]   They want to look savvy and experienced in evil. "Oh, I don't do it, I just say
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:33.720]   it." Because they're so afraid of whatâ€”I forget who the original use of it
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:38.480]   wasâ€”but they're so afraid of cool-shaming, being shamed for not being cool. You're
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:43.720]   gonna look too prudish, you're gonna look like goody-two-shoes, you're gonna look
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:49.960]   like you're afraid. So, "Oh God, please don't let me be labeled as puritanical
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:54.800]   anything but puritanical, anything but legalistic, oh God." And so there's a lot
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:02.520]   of pride behind this usage. So, for these two reasons, I would
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:08.760]   discourage pastors from common, ordinary, habitual use of questionable language.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:15.400]   Number one, purity of mouth should be in step with the purity of the hands and
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:21.200]   the purity of the heart, and number two, love does not behave itself unseemly. It
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:26.720]   seeks to be proper and in place rather than out of place. It seeks to honor
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:33.880]   commonly accepted standards because it is humble and not self-asserting. Thank
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:38.400]   you, Pastor John. This episode is built off of episode number 97 on cussing, and
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:43.160]   it's one of almost 700 episodes we now have in our archive. To find that archive
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.160]   or to ask Pastor John a question of your own, or for really anything you need to
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:52.760]   know about this podcast, go to DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.400]   Well, how should we address friends who undergo a sex change and want to be
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.920]   called by a name that does not reflect their biological gender? What do we do?
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:06.200]   It's a question Jonathan Edwards never addressed, but John Piper will tomorrow.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:10.320]   I'm your host Tony Reinke. I'll see you then.
