[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.320]   We're joined one last time with our guest Jen Wilkin, a wife, mom, Bible teacher, and
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.040]   the author of the fabulous book, Women of the Word, How to Study the Bible with Both
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.680]   Our Hearts and Our Minds.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.760]   Jen, you once tweeted this, "Women teachers, let's shift the emphasis from 'Girl, you're
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:31.460]   a precious daughter of the King' to 'Behold your King, lift up your eyes.'"
[00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.840]   That sounds like it's right at the heart of your whole aim of what you're trying to accomplish
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.360]   in equipping women to read their Bibles whole, cover to cover.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.360]   So expound on that tweet for us.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.360]   What were you getting at?
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.040]   So the number one topic that I'm asked to speak on when people invite me to come speak
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.320]   is identity, what is my identity in Christ?
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.120]   Women are consumed with, "Who am I?"
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.240]   And that's a valid question.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.480]   That's probably the most basic question that any human being can ask.
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.540]   But the Bible is not silent on that question.
[00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.240]   It says that we are image bearers, we're created in the image of God.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.640]   But we have a hard time understanding the implications of that.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:19.800]   And not only that, but because we as humans are so inward focused, part of, I would say,
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:28.120]   the first step in becoming a child of God is recognizing that the center of the universe
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.040]   is Him, not us.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.600]   And so I think that the reason the self-esteem messages that are common in women's circles
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:42.480]   don't stick to our ribs is because self-esteem detached from any idea of who God is, is just
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.920]   not a lasting message.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.720]   It requires constant reaffirmation.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.720]   But what we lack is a vision of God high and lifted up.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.360]   That once we understand that the God who has thought relationship with us is a transcendent
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.040]   God, it rightly orients us first to Him, and then it rightly orients us to ourselves, and
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.240]   then it rightly orients us to our neighbor.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.760]   It helps to get the order right for us to be able to live out the great commandment
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.200]   to love God and love our neighbor as we love ourselves.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:21.080]   It is accurate to say that our lack of self-love is prohibiting our love of neighbor.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.040]   But the root problem is not that we don't love ourselves accurately.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.400]   It's that we don't love God accurately.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.720]   And when we begin to love Him the way that we should, then our self-love falls into the
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.720]   right category.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.440]   We understand that we are accepted in Christ, that we have been given much grace, that God
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.080]   is faithful to His covenant, whether we are faithful or not.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.840]   And all of these ideas, right thinking about God, then train us to love our neighbor from
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.600]   a place of graciousness, because we understand we're loved from a place of graciousness,
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.240]   and so on and so forth.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:04.120]   The precious daughter of the king language is everywhere in Christian women's circles.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.080]   And while I want to point it out and ask some questions about it, I don't want to diminish
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.360]   that it is a beautiful idea.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.840]   I just want the idea to be framed within the beauty of who the king is, rather than some
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.680]   princess mentality, which I think we could all acknowledge has not done women any favors
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.760]   in any variety, whether it came from Disney or whether it came from fairy tales or you
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.760]   name it.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.360]   We are precious daughters of the king, but it is because of the king's preciousness that
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.240]   we can understand the significance of that statement.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.320]   That's a really good word.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.160]   And I think this next question is related, or it seems to be to me, what would you say
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.040]   to Bible readers who on a regular basis open their Bibles with some felt need in their
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.800]   life and then they go and look for the one verse that applies to that felt need?
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.480]   It becomes almost a default way.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.280]   I'm not saying it's wrong to do that on occasion, but this almost becomes the default way many
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.660]   people approach their Bibles.
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.440]   How do you address this pattern?
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.040]   I actually have a name for that method of Bible reading.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.800]   I call it the Xanax approach to Scripture.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.960]   And it's where I just want to medicate my feelings with the Bible.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.760]   And so, you know, if I've had a week where I'm feeling anxious, then I'm obviously going
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.040]   to write Philippians 4, 6 on a note card, be anxious for nothing, but in all things
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.360]   through prayer and supplication, I'm going to write that down.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.520]   I'm going to repeat it like an incantation over myself and ask the Lord to give me comfort
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.640]   around that.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:42.000]   If I'm exhausted, I'm going to quote, "Come to me all you who are weary and heavy laden."
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.240]   And even though that's actually about soul rest, not about physical rest, but that's
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.080]   not going to bother me because I'm just tired, man.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.080]   I just need some answers.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.040]   You know, if I and if I feel ugly, I mean, this is the one that the women, you know,
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.160]   when we make pink parts of the Bible, if I feel ugly or my pants don't fit, I'm going
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.880]   to go to Psalm 139 and tell myself that I'm fearfully and wonderfully made about 500 times.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.080]   And so I'm not just going to self-medicate.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.400]   When I find something like that, that I think hits me in a warm and fuzzy place, I'm going
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.240]   to begin dispensing medication to all of my friends via social media with these verses
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.600]   that I found.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.240]   And I think the issue is that when we come to the Bible that way, we're asking the Bible
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:32.640]   to operate according to our terms rather than asking the God of the Bible to speak to us
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.800]   on His terms.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.760]   So I don't know anyone who's having a bad week who looks up Jeremiah 17 9, "The heart
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.240]   is deceitful and desperately wicked.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.240]   Who can know it?"
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.280]   There are plenty of passages in the Bible that don't deliver an immediate dose of emotional
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.000]   satisfaction to us, but they serve a very important formative purpose for us.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.840]   So we end up when we read the Bible that way, we end up with spot knowledge of the Bible
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.480]   that is ultimately unhelpful, because we have picked only those passages that yield something
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.960]   to us immediately.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:09.120]   You're never going to read the book of Leviticus if this is your approach to the Bible.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.860]   You're never going to read Lamentations.
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.760]   You know, you're going to stick to the parts that give you what you think you need from
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:20.120]   the Bible rather than asking the God of the Bible to ministry to you through His word
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.520]   on His terms.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.280]   That's brilliant and exactly right.
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.440]   Plenty of passages in the Bible don't deliver an immediate dose of emotional satisfaction
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.960]   to us, but they all serve an important formative purpose within us.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.700]   So I'm tweeting that as soon as we're done, Jen.
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.440]   And our time is ending.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.440]   What a wonderful week.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:47.520]   Again, Jen's book, Women of the Word, four years old and has now sold 200,000 print copies.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.500]   It's a book, but it's a book not for women only, as you like to tell men, just rip the
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.500]   cover off.
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.800]   Rip the cover off.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.800]   That's right.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.800]   That's all you got to do.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.840]   You might have to Google rheumatites and just see what those are.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.480]   But other than that, you should be fine.
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.480]   Well, whatever.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.480]   I have no idea what those are.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.160]   But this was an edifying week, Jen.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.160]   Thank you.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.560]   Thanks for having me on.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.240]   That was Jen Wilken, grateful for her time over the past week.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.760]   And next time on Wednesday, John Piper is back in the studio.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.040]   We have a question from a listener who says she doesn't want to waste her life, but she
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:24.240]   also feels like she is only wasting her life because her life is trapped by unremitting
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.240]   fatigue.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.360]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.680]   We'll see you on Wednesday with Pastor John.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.160]   We'll see you then.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:30.780]   [END]
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:31.780]   Pastor John, thank you so much for being here.
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:32.780]   We appreciate it.
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:33.780]   We appreciate you being here.
[00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:34.780]   I'm going to be a little bit more quiet, but we appreciate you being here.
[00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:35.780]   And we appreciate you being here.
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:36.780]   We appreciate you being here.
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:37.780]   And we appreciate you being here.
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:38.780]   We appreciate you being here.
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:39.780]   We appreciate you being here.
