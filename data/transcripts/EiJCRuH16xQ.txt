[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.440]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in the second chapter and the first three verses.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:18.200]   The first three verses in the second chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:25.600]   And you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein in time past
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.280]   ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.960]   of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience, among whom also
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.480]   we all had our conversation in times past, in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:53.880]   desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature the children of wrath, even
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:20.520]   as others.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.400]   We come back to this vital and all-important statement once more.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.720]   We are looking at it for the fourth time.
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:39.640]   And we have spent this time with it because it surely is one of those fundamental statements
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:49.080]   which is absolutely vital to any true understanding of the Christian message of salvation.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:56.440]   Now I have suggested that the best way of dividing this tremendous statement, this extraordinary
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.720]   synopsis of the biblical teaching and doctrine with regard to sin, is to look at it like
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.700]   this, that first of all the apostle describes our state and condition in sin.
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:17.880]   We are dead in trespasses and sins, entirely governed by the evil principle that is at
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:25.400]   work in this world, in the children of disobedience, controlled by these unseen spiritual forces
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.440]   and powers, headed up by the devil himself, the prince of the power of the air.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.360]   That is our condition.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:42.400]   That is the state of all until they become regenerate and receive new life from God through
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.440]   Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.600]   Then secondly we considered as to why we are in that condition.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.360]   And there we saw that the apostle's teaching is that this is something which is true as
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.640]   the result of the fall of men.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.480]   We are born like that.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.120]   We are like that by nature.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.360]   It is true of all, he says, we all had our conversation, even as others, by which he
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.000]   means the rest of mankind.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.200]   It is universal and it has come to pass in that way.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.800]   Then last Sunday morning we went on to consider the manifestations of this in practice.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.400]   The life of the unbeliever, says the apostle, is a life lived in trespasses and sins.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.800]   Well, why?
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:38.680]   Well, it's because he is really governed by the lusts of the flesh, which in turn manifest
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.160]   themselves as desires of the flesh and desires of the mind.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.120]   And we looked into that last Sunday morning and we saw how true it is.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:57.920]   We all confirm it in our own experiences that until this new life from God comes into us,
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:06.200]   we are indeed governed by these drives, these desires, these lusts of the body, the flesh,
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.800]   and of the mind.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.040]   And so we live a life of trespasses and sins.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.760]   But now we come to the last step, the last thing that the apostle has got to say about
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.360]   men in sin.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:28.640]   And that is, of course, that he is under the wrath of God.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.600]   Now we can regard this, if you like, in this way.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:43.920]   Here the apostle is telling us about men in sin as sin affects men's standing before
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.920]   God.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:51.200]   Or, if you like it in other language, what the apostle is dealing with here is what God
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:05:00.760]   thinks and says and does about men in that condition which I have already described.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.320]   And of course there is no question at all but that this is the most important aspect
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.800]   of the subject.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:14.280]   The others were terribly important, but there is nothing which is as important as this.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.800]   And of course it is because we so constantly forget this, that the world is as it is today,
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.100]   and indeed the church is as she is.
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:28.000]   We are so self-centred, we are concerned about ourselves, and we fail to remember that the
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.360]   most important thing about everything is the way in which God looks down upon it.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.020]   Now that is the subject with which we have to deal of necessity this morning.
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.180]   And the apostle puts it like this.
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:55.980]   He says that we were all by nature the children of wrath, even as others.
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.400]   Now here we have a twofold statement.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:05.320]   There are two things stated there, and there is no doubt at all, but that these two matters
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:12.140]   that we are compelled to look together at this morning are two of the most difficult
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:19.220]   and perplexing subjects in the whole realm and range of biblical doctrine.
[00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:24.180]   And that is why, of course, they have often led to great perplexity.
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:33.700]   And they are subjects which people oftentimes in their ignorance not only fail to understand,
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:34.700]   but resent.
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:41.740]   There is no subject perhaps which has more frequently led people to speak unconsciously
[00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:47.500]   in a blasphemous manner than this very matter which we are now going to look at together.
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:57.100]   The apostle says two things, that we are all under the wrath of God, and secondly, that
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:02.380]   we are all under the wrath of God by nature.
[00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:08.240]   Now then, why should we look at these things?
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.580]   Someone may well ask that question.
[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.300]   Why spend the morning on a subject like this, a difficult subject?
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:21.340]   There are so many other things that are interesting at the moment and attracting attention.
[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.940]   Why not deal with them?
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.260]   And in any case, the whole position of the world is such.
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.180]   Why turn to something like this?
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.260]   Why must it be high doctrine of this type?
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:39.700]   Well, lest there be someone who is harboring some such idea and is provoked to put such
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:44.980]   a question, let me give you certain reasons that under it why it behoves us to consider
[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:45.980]   this matter.
[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:50.740]   The first is that it is in the Scripture.
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:55.860]   It is here in the Bible, and as I will show you, it is everywhere in the Bible.
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:00.180]   And if we regard this as the word of God, we cannot pick and choose.
[00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:05.540]   We must take it as it is and consider its every part and portion.
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:13.780]   Secondly, we must do so because what we are told here is, after all, a question of fact.
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.600]   It is not theory, it is a question of fact.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:21.300]   If the biblical doctrine of the wrath of God is true, well then it is the most important
[00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:25.540]   fact confronting every one of us at this moment.
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:30.540]   Infinitely more important than any international conference that may be held.
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:35.300]   Infinitely more important than whether there is to be a third world war or not.
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:40.780]   If this doctrine is true, well then we are all involved in it and our eternal destiny
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:41.780]   depends upon it.
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.540]   It is a question of fact.
[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:49.500]   Then another reason for considering it is this.
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:55.620]   That the apostles' whole argument at this point is that we rarely cannot understand
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:59.660]   the love of God until we understand this doctrine.
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:03.820]   It is the way in which we measure the love of God.
[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:09.660]   Now there is a great deal of talk about the love of God, and yet you know where we truly
[00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.060]   to love God.
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.940]   We would express it, we would show it.
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.340]   To love God is not merely to talk about it.
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:23.780]   To love God, as he himself points out everywhere in his word, is to keep his commandments and
[00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.340]   to live for his glory.
[00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:34.540]   Now the argument here is that we really cannot understand the love of God unless we see it
[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:39.820]   in the light of this other doctrine, which we are now considering together.
[00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.700]   So it is essential from that standpoint.
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.940]   But let me put it in this way.
[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:54.220]   I suggest to you that you will never truly understand why it is the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:10:00.560]   the eternal Son of God, had to come into this world unless you understand this doctrine
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.580]   of the wrath of God and the judgment of God.
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:08.900]   Now as Christians we believe that the Son of God came into this world, that he laid
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:14.220]   aside the signs of his eternal glory, was born as a baby in Bethlehem, and endured all
[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:19.520]   that he endured because that was essential for our salvation.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:24.060]   But the question is, why was it essential to our salvation?
[00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:30.340]   Why did all that have to take place before we could be saved?
[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:35.760]   Now I defy anybody to answer that question without bringing in this doctrine of the judgment
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.920]   of God and of the wrath of God.
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:45.820]   And still more is this true when you come to look at the whole doctrine of the cross
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.940]   and the death of our blessed Lord and Saviour.
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.220]   Here is the question.
[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.580]   Why did Christ die?
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.020]   Why had he to die?
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:03.060]   If we say that we are saved by his blood, why are we saved by his blood?
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:09.180]   Why was it essential that he should even die on that cross and be buried and rise again
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.620]   before we could be saved?
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:15.140]   Now there is only one adequate answer to that question, and that is this doctrine of the
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.660]   wrath of God.
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:24.860]   The death of our Lord upon the cross is, I suggest to you, unnecessary unless this doctrine
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.400]   is true.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.500]   So you see, it is a vital matter for us to consider.
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.940]   And lastly, I put it in a very practical form.
[00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:41.660]   I believe this doctrine is absolutely essential from the standpoint of a true evangelism.
[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:45.780]   Why is it that people do not believe in the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:49.500]   Why is it that people are not members of the Christian church?
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.040]   Why are they not Christians?
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.580]   Why does the Lord Jesus Christ not come into their calculations at all?
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:12:00.380]   Well, you know, in the last analysis, there is only one answer to that question.
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:04.540]   They do not believe in him because they have never seen any need of him.
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:09.280]   And they have never seen any need of him because they have never realized that they are sinners.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.700]   And they have never realized that they are sinners because they have never realized the
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:17.740]   truth about the holiness of God and the justice and the righteousness of God.
[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:24.300]   They have never known anything about God as the judge eternal and about the wrath of God
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.340]   against the sin of men.
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:33.720]   So you see, this is absolutely central in evangelism.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:41.420]   If we really believe in salvation, I say, and in the absolute need of Christ, well then,
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:42.900]   we must start with this doctrine.
[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:43.900]   Very well.
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.900]   There are the reasons for considering it.
[00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.140]   The apostle supplies them.
[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:48.340]   I am simply repeating them.
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:52.740]   Well now, let us look at the two statements themselves.
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:59.460]   The first thing the apostle says is that we are all of us who are born into this world
[00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:03.420]   under the wrath of God.
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:11.380]   He says we were all the children of wrath, even as others.
[00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:17.220]   We were all the children of wrath as the rest of mankind was.
[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:21.420]   That is what "even as others" means.
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:27.900]   Now here I say we come face to face with this tremendous doctrine, which of course I know
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:36.980]   full well is not only unpopular at the present time, but is even hated and detested.
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:43.220]   And people can scarcely control themselves as they speak about it.
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:49.020]   The whole modern idea has been, as you know, for a number of years, that God is a God of
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.740]   love and you must think only of God in terms of love.
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:59.860]   And to talk about the wrath of God, we are told, is utterly incompatible with any idea
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.420]   of God as a God of love.
[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:04.340]   The way in which it is put is this.
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:10.220]   They say of course that idea of the wrath of God stems from that ancient idea of God
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.580]   as a sort of tribal God.
[00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:16.340]   They say the trouble is there are still certain Christians who believe in that God of the
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:20.580]   Old Testament, who was nothing of course but a tribal God.
[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:25.380]   The gods of mythology and so on, they were all of that type and of that kind.
[00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.460]   They displayed their anger and their wrath.
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:33.900]   But of course they say we know now from the New Testament and from Jesus that this is
[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.540]   quite wrong and quite false.
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.760]   We no longer believe in the God of the Old Testament, they say.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:43.740]   We believe in the God of the New Testament, in the God and Father of our Lord and Saviour
[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:44.740]   Jesus Christ.
[00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:47.780]   You are familiar with the argument.
[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:52.860]   Indeed they go further, and some of them put it like this.
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:59.300]   They would say that it is only in this present century that we really have become sufficiently
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.580]   enlightened to understand these matters.
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:07.820]   They say in the last century, even to the beginning of this century, people still believed
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.300]   in the wrath of God.
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:14.180]   But they say it was a completely false conception of God.
[00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:19.940]   I remember reading once in a very learned book a man solemnly stating that this idea
[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:25.180]   of the wrath of God was nothing but a kind of projection into the character of God of
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:33.660]   the typical Victorian father, the stern, repressive father that kept his children down and disciplined
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.620]   them so severely and punished them.
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:40.540]   And they said people just carried that idea over and they projected it right into God
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.820]   himself.
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:45.780]   But it was nothing but a false bit of psychology.
[00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:51.740]   And that by now, they argue, we have delivered ourselves from all this and we know that the
[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:55.780]   idea of wrath in a God of love is something which is self-contradictory.
[00:15:55.780 --> 00:16:03.580]   Therefore, I say we must look at this.
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.860]   Let me clear away one preliminary misunderstanding.
[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:12.340]   There are some people who completely misinterpret the very term wrath.
[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:19.520]   They think of wrath instinctively as some uncontrolled manifestation of anger.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:24.620]   They cannot think of the term wrath except in somebody who is trembling in a rage and
[00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:32.260]   pale with passion and who has entirely lost self-control and is just speaking in a violent
[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.540]   manner and doing violent things.
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:39.940]   Well, that is quite a false idea with regard to wrath.
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:44.620]   Sinful men, it is true, sometimes does manifest his wrath in that way.
[00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:51.340]   But all that is not by any means an essential part of this term wrath.
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:57.500]   Wrath is nothing but a manifestation of indignation based upon justice.
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:02.260]   Indeed, I will go further and I will say this.
[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:07.620]   That wrath, the wrath of God according to the scriptural teaching, is nothing but the
[00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:10.220]   other side of the love of God.
[00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:17.080]   Indeed, it is the inevitable corollary of the rejection of the love of God.
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:22.060]   God is a God of love, yes, but God is also a God of justice and of righteousness.
[00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:27.100]   And if God's love is spurned and rejected, there remains nothing but the wrath and the
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:29.980]   justice and the righteousness of God.
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:34.020]   Very well then, but let me try to demonstrate to you that this is something which is taught
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:37.220]   everywhere in the scripture.
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:41.060]   Go back to your Old Testament and you will find it at the very beginning.
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:46.060]   When men fell in the Garden of Eden, you remember that this is what happened.
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:49.660]   God visited him and spoke to him, pronounced judgment upon him.
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:55.980]   He drove him out of the garden and there at the eastern gate of the garden were the cherubims
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:59.300]   and the flaming sword.
[00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:00.820]   What is the meaning of the flaming sword?
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.980]   Well, it is just this very thing.
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:06.220]   It is the sword of God's justice.
[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:12.860]   It is God's sword of wrath and of punishment, punishing men for his sin and making it impossible
[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:18.500]   for him to come back of his own and eat of the tree of life and live forever.
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:25.580]   There is at the very beginning a manifestation of God's righteous judgment, his wrath upon
[00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:26.980]   sin.
[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:33.100]   But then you find it running right through the Old Testament in the deluge, the flood,
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:39.700]   the story of Sodom and Gomorrah, the various punishments of the children of Israel, the
[00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.780]   punishments of individuals.
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:45.420]   Why the Old Testament is simply full of this.
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:49.860]   God has given his law and he has pronounced that if men break it, he will punish them.
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:50.980]   That is wrath.
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:54.260]   And when they have done so, he has punished them.
[00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:59.420]   He has punished individuals, he has punished the nation, even his own chosen people.
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:04.860]   He punished them, he poured his wrath upon them by raising up the Chaldean army which
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:09.740]   came and sacked Jerusalem and carried away the people as captives into Babylon.
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:14.020]   That is a manifestation of the wrath and the righteous judgment of God.
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.460]   You see, it is everywhere in the Old Testament.
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:21.300]   You really cannot believe the Old Testament unless you accept this doctrine of the wrath
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:22.300]   of God.
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:28.220]   And of course, when you come to the New Testament, in spite of what all these modern critics
[00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:32.500]   would have us believe, the doctrine is there everywhere.
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:35.140]   The first preacher in the New Testament is John the Baptist.
[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.140]   What did he say?
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:39.460]   He said, "Flee from the wrath to come.
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:42.380]   Repent and be baptized, every one of you.
[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:43.900]   Flee from the wrath to come."
[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:48.060]   The Pharisees came to be baptized of John and he looked at them and said, "Who hath
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:51.780]   warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.220]   It was his great message.
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:58.860]   Indeed, it was the message of the Lord Jesus Christ himself who repeated those self-same
[00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.200]   words.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:06.780]   But in a most amazing way, we find it in the verse that is generally quoted as the supreme
[00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:11.020]   statement of God as a God of love, John 3.16.
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:17.820]   "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son."
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:18.820]   Why?
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:19.980]   Why did he do so?
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:29.820]   The answer is, "That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.420]   life."
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:34.740]   The alternative to everlasting life is perishing.
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.340]   And it is John 3.16 that teaches it.
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:42.820]   But the 36th verse of that third chapter of John is still more plain.
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:43.820]   Listen.
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:49.460]   "He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life.
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:54.940]   And he that believeth not the Son shall not see life.
[00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:59.780]   But the wrath of God abideth on him."
[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:03.580]   Here we are, you see, all men are under the wrath of God.
[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:09.860]   And unless we do believe on the Son of God, the wrath of God abideth upon us.
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:12.100]   What could be more plain or explicit?
[00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:17.100]   In John's gospel, the apostle of love, there it is.
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.620]   But then the apostle Paul teaches it equally clearly.
[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:24.620]   Preaching in Athens he says that "God hath appointed a day in which he will judge the
[00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:27.980]   whole world in righteousness by this man whom he hath appointed."
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:28.980]   Judgment.
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:32.820]   The wrath of God.
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:40.020]   In Romans 1.18 we read, "For the wrath of God is manifested, is already revealed from
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:44.380]   heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men."
[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:48.020]   Paul has no gospel apart from this.
[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:52.700]   It's because of the wrath of God that he's preaching the gospel.
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:57.620]   In this epistle to the Ephesians, which we are looking at in the fifth chapter and the
[00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.500]   sixth verse, you get exactly the same thing.
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:06.780]   "Let no man deceive you with vain words," says Paul, "for because of these things cometh
[00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:12.020]   the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience."
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:18.180]   Paul in summarizing his gospel to the Thessalonians in the first epistle and in the first chapter
[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:27.540]   and the last verse says that the Thessalonians have turned to Christ and await him from heaven.
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:28.540]   What for?
[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:35.140]   Well, he says, "Because he saves us from the wrath to come."
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:36.980]   Still the same idea.
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:41.860]   And if you go right on to the book of Revelation, you will find it there in a most remarkable
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.660]   phrase.
[00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:46.220]   Do you remember it?
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:50.460]   It's a phrase about the wrath of the Lamb.
[00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:54.420]   It seems quite contradictory, quite paradoxical.
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:55.540]   A lamb.
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:23:02.660]   You think of a lamb in terms of innocence, harmlessness, and yet there is this pregnant
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:07.140]   phrase, "the wrath of the Lamb."
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:11.580]   It is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the whole world, who is to judge the
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.180]   world in righteousness.
[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.180]   The wrath of the Lamb.
[00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:22.060]   So you see this idea that love and wrath are incompatible is just a complete denial of
[00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:24.300]   the plain teaching of the scripture.
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:31.340]   Indeed, I would go so far as to say this, that unless we start with this idea of the
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:37.740]   wrath of God against sin, we cannot possibly understand the compassion of God.
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:40.740]   We cannot understand the love of God.
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:47.220]   It's only as I realize God's wrath against sin that I realize what he has done in himself
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:50.660]   providing a way of salvation from it.
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:53.620]   And if I don't understand this, I don't understand that.
[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:57.820]   And my talk about the love of God is mere sentiment.
[00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:04.660]   It's mere loose sentimental vanity, which is indeed a denial of this great biblical
[00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:07.140]   doctrine of the love of God.
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:15.460]   One of them, the apostles' teaching is that until we believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:20.020]   we are under the wrath of God.
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:24.620]   And the wrath of God is an expression of God's hatred of sin.
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:28.220]   It is an expression of God's punishment of sin.
[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:35.580]   And it is a clear statement of this effect, that if we die in our sins, we go on to eternal
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:40.020]   punishment, unrelieved.
[00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:42.020]   That's the teaching of the scripture.
[00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:47.900]   The wrath of God against sin manifests itself in hell.
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:54.540]   Where men and women remain outside the life of God in misery and wretchedness, slaves
[00:24:54.540 --> 00:25:00.900]   to their own lusts and desires, selfish and self-centered, the wrath of God manifests
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:04.540]   itself in that way.
[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:11.260]   And the apostles' teaching is that that is the position of all who are not Christians.
[00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.880]   They are under the wrath of God in this life.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:18.500]   They will remain under the wrath of God in the next life.
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:26.260]   That is the position of the sinner according to the scriptures.
[00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:32.820]   If you object to the idea, you are objecting to the scriptures.
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:37.140]   You are setting up some philosophical idea of your own instead of the plain teaching
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:38.140]   of the scripture.
[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:42.780]   You are not arguing with me, you are arguing with the scriptures.
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.580]   You are arguing with these holy apostles.
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:48.400]   You are arguing with the Son of God himself.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:53.260]   If you believe this word is divinely inspired, well then you must not say, "But I don't
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:54.260]   understand."
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:55.940]   I'm not asking you to understand.
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:57.780]   I don't understand it.
[00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:00.300]   I don't pretend to understand it.
[00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:07.740]   But I start from this basis, that my mind is not only finite but is furthermore sinful,
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:13.300]   and that I cannot possibly understand the nature of God and the justice and the holiness
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:14.300]   of God.
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:19.460]   If you are going to base everything on your understanding, well then my friend, you might
[00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:21.340]   as well give up at this point.
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:26.780]   For the Bible tells you that the natural man and the natural mind cannot understand the
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:29.260]   things of the Spirit of God.
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:34.220]   It was the desire to understand that led to the fall.
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:38.340]   Intellectual pride and arrogance is the last sin.
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:41.120]   And I stand here not to ask you to understand.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:44.980]   It is my commission to proclaim the message.
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:56.300]   And the message is that all are under the wrath of God until they believe in the Lord
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.260]   Jesus Christ.
[00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:00.540]   But indeed I must go one step further.
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:04.820]   That brings me to deal with the second matter.
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:12.580]   The apostle says that we are all in that condition by nature.
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:19.780]   We were all by nature the children of wrath, even as others.
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:22.460]   What does this mean, "by nature"?
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:26.340]   Well I was trying to show a fortnight ago, so I needn't stay with it this morning,
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:31.780]   but this has one meaning only, and that is "by birth".
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:40.180]   We were all by our very birth the children of wrath, even as others.
[00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:48.300]   Now you notice, the apostle does not say that we become the children of wrath because of
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.300]   our nature.
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:52.820]   He says we were.
[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:57.620]   In other words, the apostle, like the whole of the Bible, does not teach that we are born
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:02.780]   into this world in a state of innocence or in a state of neutrality, and then because
[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:07.340]   we sin we become sinners and thereby come under the wrath of God.
[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:08.340]   It isn't what he says.
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:10.940]   He says the exact opposite.
[00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:17.060]   He says we are born into this world under the wrath of God.
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:21.160]   From the moment of our birth we are already under the wrath of God.
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.540]   It isn't something that is going to happen to us.
[00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:26.620]   It isn't something that results from our actions.
[00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:30.980]   There are people who teach that, but that, it seems to me, is a blank denial, not only
[00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:36.780]   of the teaching here, but as I want to show you, of the teaching elsewhere in the Scripture.
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:41.540]   He doesn't say that we are under the wrath of God because of our nature, or because of
[00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:45.800]   the manifestations of that nature.
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:53.580]   He says that we are that by birth.
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.060]   Now then, what does this mean?
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:59.340]   Well, the answer to that, of course, is found in that fifth chapter of the epistle to the
[00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:02.820]   Romans which we read together at the beginning.
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:09.900]   That is the very thing which the apostle argues there from verse 12 to the end of the chapter.
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:10.900]   What is the argument?
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:14.780]   Well, let me just summarize it for you.
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:22.020]   You remember that in that chapter, the one great point the apostle is concerned to prove
[00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:33.780]   is this, that our relationship as believers to the Lord Jesus Christ is exactly analogous
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:38.660]   to our relationship formerly to Adam.
[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:42.480]   You remember the comparisons, how he goes back and forth.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:48.500]   He talks about what was true in Adam, not only so, but we joy in God through our Lord
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:49.500]   Jesus Christ.
[00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:56.380]   Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, so death passed upon all men, so
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:59.820]   the second men, and so on.
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:04.980]   Now I commend you to read again carefully that fifth chapter of Paul's epistle to the
[00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:08.740]   Romans, and especially from verse 12 to the end.
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:13.700]   And you'll see that all along he says, "We were like that in Adam, we now are like this
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.200]   in Christ."
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:20.480]   So that as you come to interpret this, you must bear that in mind.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:26.440]   If you believe that I am what I am in Christ because of what God has imputed to me in Christ,
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:31.320]   you must believe exactly the same on the other side, what was imputed to me in Adam.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:34.520]   That's the argument.
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:38.380]   But the apostle is not content merely to state it generally.
[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:40.520]   You remember that he states it in particular.
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:42.600]   Let me pick out the important verses.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.240]   Take verse 12.
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:55.680]   "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:02.920]   passed upon all men, for that all have sinned."
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:06.480]   The punishment of sin is death.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:09.320]   Adam sinned and death came upon him.
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:13.520]   Yes, but not only upon Adam, but upon all men.
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:18.600]   As the result of Adam's one sin, death passed upon all men.
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:19.600]   Why?
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:23.160]   Well, all sinned in Adam.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.840]   Wait a minute, that's just a statement.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.320]   I'll expand it later.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:31.680]   But come on to verses 13 and 14.
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:36.000]   There is no more important passage in the whole of Scripture than this fifth of Romans.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   Paul here introduces a statement in brackets.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.040]   The bracket starts at the beginning of verse 13.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.040]   Listen.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:52.600]   "For until the law, sin was in the world; but sin is not imputed where there is no law.
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:32:00.320]   Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:02.720]   similitude of Adam's transgression."
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:07.960]   Now what does all this mean?
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:12.040]   I wonder whether anybody sitting in one of those pews at this moment is beginning to
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.280]   say to himself, "What's all this about?
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:15.360]   I can't follow this.
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.640]   I want some simple gospel of comfort."
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:23.140]   My friends, we like to think, don't we, that because we live in the twentieth century,
[00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:27.840]   we are greatly superior to all generations that have ever lived before us.
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:31.800]   That we are so learned and intellectual, we understand great things the other people were
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:32.800]   primitive.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:37.680]   Now the apostle Paul wrote these words to people nearly two thousand years ago, and
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:40.360]   he meant them to understand them.
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:42.480]   And he wasn't writing to great philosophers.
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.880]   He was writing to simple Christian believers.
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:49.560]   Many of them were but slaves, others were soldiers in Caesar's household, and Paul
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:53.640]   meant those people to understand these things.
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:59.160]   I frankly cannot understand modern Christians who must be spoon-fed, and who just want something
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:01.480]   nice and easy and simple.
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:06.800]   If you do not understand this doctrine, well then you are rejecting God's word.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:09.160]   Very well, what's it mean?
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.160]   Well, let me try to show you what it means.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:17.480]   Paul says, "Until the law, sin was in the world."
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.480]   The law was given through Moses, you remember.
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:25.800]   But there was that long interval between Adam and Moses.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:35.440]   At the least, it was probably a period of some 2,500 years.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:42.100]   Now then, during that whole long period, sin was in the world.
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:46.520]   But sin, he says, is not imputed where there is no law.
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:51.000]   In other words, if there isn't a law to define sin, the sin isn't brought home to
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   a man.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.680]   The business of law is to bring the sin home.
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:58.320]   If there were no laws, for instance, this morning about parking and about motoring,
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:02.840]   well, you and I might still do the wrong things, but if there were not a law about these matters,
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:03.840]   we couldn't be punished.
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:05.240]   That's what he's saying.
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:08.120]   Sin is not imputed where there is no law.
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:15.720]   Nevertheless, he says, death reigned from Adam to Moses.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.440]   Now here's the problem.
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:24.880]   Though the law was not given until Moses, there was no law from Adam to Moses, people
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:27.320]   still died.
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.440]   All the people born into the world died.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:32.240]   Well, why did they die?
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.840]   That's the question.
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:38.440]   What is it that produced death in those people, though there was no law imputing sin at that
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:39.440]   period?
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.160]   And the apostles' answer is this.
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:43.360]   There is only one explanation.
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:48.720]   They all died because they were involved in the sin of Adam.
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:50.760]   There's no other explanation.
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:56.880]   The only reason why sin reigned from Adam to Moses is that that one sin of Adam brought
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:01.040]   death upon the whole of his posterity.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:06.200]   In other words, we are born by nature the children of wrath.
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:09.880]   Now then, notice the next thing which is still more extraordinary.
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:18.120]   He says this is true, death reigned from Adam to Moses even over them that had not sinned
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:21.280]   after the similitude of Adam's transgression.
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.280]   What does that mean?
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:30.200]   Well, he says that death reigned even over those persons who had not actually committed
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.280]   an act of sin as Adam did when he fell.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.440]   Who were they?
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:37.800]   And there's only one answer.
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:45.200]   They were infants who died in infancy because all other men sinned.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:50.200]   Everybody who has lived since Adam has committed deliberate acts of sin.
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:54.520]   The only people who have not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:59.600]   have not deliberately sinned, were infants who were too young to exercise their will
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:03.080]   because they're not conscious.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:10.600]   And death reigned, says Paul, from Adam to Moses even over infants also.
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.120]   Why do infants die?
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.720]   And there's only one answer.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:20.360]   Infants die because Adam's transgression involves them.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:27.200]   Death passed upon all men, even them that have not sinned after the similitude of Adam's
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.920]   transgression.
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:29.920]   What a statement.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:32.520]   We go on to verse 15.
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:35.480]   But not as the offense, so also is the free gift.
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:42.640]   For if through the offense of one many be dead.
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.280]   There it is again, you see.
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.840]   Then he goes on to the other side about Jesus Christ.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.800]   Come to verse 16.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:52.640]   And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:59.760]   Now then, for the judgment was by one to condemnation.
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:03.520]   But the free gift is of many offenses unto justification.
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:08.400]   The judgment, the condemnation, was by one to condemnation.
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:12.160]   The one sin of Adam brought this upon the whole of mankind.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:20.520]   But conversely, he says, many sins are forgiven in the righteousness of one, even Jesus Christ.
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:23.800]   But still go on to verse 18.
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:35.440]   Therefore, as by the offense of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation.
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:38.840]   Isn't that as explicit as a thing could be?
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:49.720]   As by the offense of one, judgment came upon all men, no exception, to condemnation.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.680]   We are born the children of wrath.
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:38:05.600]   And finally, in verse 19, for as by one man's disobedience, many were made sinners.
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:14.800]   You and I and all mankind were made sinners by that one sin of Adam.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.880]   That's the teaching.
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:25.880]   We were all by nature the children of wrath, even as others.
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:28.360]   Ah, you say, I don't understand that.
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:29.640]   I can't grasp that.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.280]   It seems to me almost immoral.
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:36.880]   My dear friend, I say exactly the same by way of reply once more.
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:39.720]   Of course you don't understand it.
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:42.720]   Who can understand such things?
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.220]   It's not a question of understanding.
[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:47.680]   It's a question of whether you believe the Scriptures or not.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:53.360]   For the Apostle says exactly the same thing in 1 Corinthians 15, that great and mighty
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:39:00.600]   chapter which is read at funeral services, "As in Adam all died, so in Christ shall
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:03.120]   all be made alive," and so on and so forth.
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:06.320]   It's precisely the same argument.
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:11.160]   It's the basis of the Christian faith.
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:16.280]   Whether we understand it or not, I say, it is the truth.
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:20.320]   You've got to explain the universality of sin.
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:27.040]   You've got to explain the universality of death, and especially the death of infants.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:30.840]   And this is the biblical answer.
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:35.640]   Adam was the whole of humanity.
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:39.120]   He represented the whole of humanity.
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.920]   He was our federal head.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:47.000]   As the Lord Jesus Christ is the representative of all who are saved, as his righteousness
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.920]   is imputed to us, so Adam was the representative, and his sin is imputed to us.
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:54.120]   We fell in him.
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:40:00.320]   We are damned in him, in exactly the same way as those who believe in Christ are redeemed
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:03.960]   by him and saved in him and righteous in him.
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.680]   That is the argument.
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:10.560]   And if you believe the one side about Christ, you must believe the other about Adam.
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:13.280]   If you deny this, you are virtually denying that.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.920]   Let us be careful, therefore, my friends.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:21.320]   To me, nothing is more tragic than the way in which Christian people bring the relics
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:26.240]   of their philosophies and their own understandings into the Christian faith.
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:30.800]   And they who claim to believe the Bible from cover to cover, reject it at this point because
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:37.280]   they do not like it or because they cannot reconcile certain matters.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:40.760]   But the reconciliation is here for us.
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:50.840]   Though we were such, dead in trespasses and sins, hateful and hating one another, polluted
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:41:00.360]   by sin, sinful in practice, living in trespasses and sins, and under the wrath of God and absolutely
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:08.240]   helpless and hopeless, the very God against whom we have sinned, the very God whom we
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:16.240]   have offended, has himself provided the way of deliverance for us.
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:24.840]   And that in the person of his own dearly beloved Son, from whom he did not spare even the suffering
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:33.240]   and the agony and the shame of Calvary and that cruel death, he has offered us and provides
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:45.080]   for us a way of complete deliverance and reconciliation to himself, in spite of the fact that our
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:56.120]   sin in Adam and our own sins and our own sinful state deserve nothing but his eternal wrath.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.880]   That is the love of God.
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:11.040]   That is the love so amazing, so divine, that God could do that for us, who deserve nothing
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.040]   but eternal wrath.
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:19.600]   May God in his grace, therefore, enable us to receive these things, that together, God
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:27.560]   willing, we may go on next Sunday morning to that next verse with its glorious "But
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:36.640]   though that was true, but God who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:44.560]   loved us, even when we were dead in trespasses and sins, hath quickened us together with
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:45.560]   Christ."
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:51.080]   Blessed be the name of God.
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:55.000]   Amen.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.920]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
