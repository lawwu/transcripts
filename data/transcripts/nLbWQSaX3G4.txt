[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.140]   Welcome back. On Friday of last week in APJ 1869, I think it was, we looked at the terrible
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:20.480]   things that Satan can do to people and to us. We saw that Satan can bring on physical
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:27.320]   suffering. He's behind much sickness. We know that Satan brought a thorn of physical
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.320]   pain into Paul's life. He can even throw Christians into prison, we saw. Satan got
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:41.040]   Jesus arrested, beaten, and thrown on a cross. And just as he sought to destroy our Savior,
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:49.080]   Satan seeks to destroy our faith today. He's very powerful. But he's not all powerful.
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.800]   Where Satan acts, he only acts by permission and never with ultimate control. Nevertheless,
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:03.040]   he's real. He's strong. He's evil. And he's on a very long leash. And even on that long
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:10.080]   leash of God's providence, he does terrible damage. Those were the points from that recent
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.040]   episode, "Satan is no Joke." But there's another reality we must add into the mix, and it's
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:23.840]   this. There's only one finally destructive weapon in the artillery of Satan. Only one.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:31.480]   One lethal weapon that he can wield over you and over me. What is it? Here's Pastor John's
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.480]   answer in a 1996 sermon.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.240]   All the old high priests, remember what they did in the Old Testament? They had bulls and
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.680]   they had goats and they had doves and they'd go into the Holy of Holies and they'd take
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.920]   blood and spill it on the altar, cover the sins of the people for a year, perhaps on
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.240]   the Day of Atonement. And they had to do it for their own sins, too. And here comes Jesus.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.320]   And he has in his mind, "I'm going to do a high priestly work one time and it's over.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:11.800]   No more temple sacrifices when I'm done because the blood I'm taking is not the blood of a
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.000]   bull, the blood of a goat, the blood of a lamb, the blood of a dove. It's my blood.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.120]   Infinitely valuable blood. And I'm going to pour it out one time." Or another image would
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.040]   be, "I'm going to go in there and I'm going to lie down and I'm going to die. I'm going
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.880]   to do that. I'm going to finish this whole system of sacrificial offerings once for all
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.080]   by laying down my life that I might propitiate sins."
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.480]   So the aim of his death is to make propitiation for the sins of his people, verse 17, and
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.680]   the aim of his death is to destroy or nullify the power of the devil and his power over
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:03:01.400]   death in verse 14. Christ strips the devil of his power in death by propitiating sins.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.720]   Now we've got to deal with that word "propitiate," okay? It's okay if you don't know that. It's
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.480]   okay. It's not common parlance in American vocabulary. You won't hear it on TV, probably.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.440]   You won't read it in the newspaper, and even Christians have pretty much dropped it. But
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.920]   let's get it, okay? Let's just get it. Stick it in so you can use it now and then with
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:29.800]   people you ought to use it with. To propitiate in the context of judgment and punishment
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:40.620]   for broken law, to propitiate is to take away the wrath and the anger of the offended party.
[00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:47.620]   To propitiate their wrath. So here's God the lawgiver in justice and holiness who has the
[00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:54.880]   expectation that people will love him, honor him, trust him, obey him, delight in him,
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.860]   and the whole world falls short of that expectation. And therefore the justice of God kicks in
[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:10.040]   and he has a legitimate just anger against sinners. Now the solution to that is not only
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.440]   to deal with the guilt of sin, but the anger of God. We've got to get rid of his anger.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.200]   We can't. There's not a thing in the world you can do to do that. Only one person can
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:29.080]   take away the anger of God. God. And since he's just, he doesn't just say, "Well, we'll
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.920]   let bygones be bygones. I'll sweep my anger under the rug and sin is okay. It's not a
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:40.600]   big deal. My honor is not worth dying for." Instead what he says is, "I love you so much
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:50.240]   and I love my honor so much that I will send my son as the high priest to absorb my anger."
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.160]   That's what happened at the cross. He put his son forward and son willingly in love
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.560]   to us and in love to his father, lays his own life down on the altar of the cross as
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.560]   a high priest and as the offering of the high priest. And God pours out on him the
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:17.360]   curse of law. Galatians 3.14, he became a curse for us. And in doing that, drains every
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:28.240]   drop of the wrath of God against his elect dry. In Jesus Christ there is therefore now
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:36.880]   no what? Condemnation. This is a glorious, this is what was meant back in chapter 2 verse
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:45.720]   4 when it said, "Oh, don't neglect your great salvation." This is a great salvation. Now
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.960]   we're right on the brink of answering our question. We're not there yet. We haven't
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:56.880]   got it solved, but we've almost got it solved. The question was, how is it that the death
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:06.360]   of the son of God, Jesus Christ, our high priest, by propitiating sin, defeats the devil?
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:12.880]   How is it that the devil loses his power to destroy you through death because of that?
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:20.960]   There is only one lethal weapon in the artillery of Satan. If you've ever thought about this,
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:28.680]   listen carefully. There's only one lethal, deadly, final, destructive weapon in the artillery
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:36.000]   of Satan. You know what it is? Your sin. Nobody goes to hell because of being harassed by
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.080]   the devil. Nobody goes to hell because of being possessed by the devil. Nobody goes
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.800]   to hell because of being oppressed by the devil. Nobody goes to hell because of seeing
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.040]   green apparitions on their ceiling at night and hearing weird noises under the bed, which
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:57.480]   are real. Nobody goes to hell because of that. People go to hell for one reason, unforgiven
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:05.760]   sin. Period. That's all. Satan has one way to get you to hell, keep you from a savior,
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:11.440]   and get you to sinning. That's all. He can't scare you. I mean, let's get rid of our fear
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:19.600]   of this guy. He has one deadly weapon. Sure, he can rough you up. He can kill you. Revelation
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:25.000]   2.10, he has thrown many of you into jail. For 10 days, you will suffer and you're going
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.680]   to die. Satan can kill you today. This text does not mean that Satan's hands are bound
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.680]   and that he can't make you sick or that he can't make you dead. It means the one who
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:44.680]   had the power of death to destroy you no longer has that power. Death, where is your victory?
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:56.120]   Oh, death, where is your sting? It's gone. Why? Because the law is satisfied and sins
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:01.800]   are forgiven. And all Satan can do is look you in the face and just rage at you. And
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:06.800]   if you're covered by the blood of Jesus, if you're clothed with the righteousness of Jesus
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:13.680]   Christ, you can look him right in the face and say, "Be gone, Satan." Or if he rages
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.680]   against you such as to put you in jail or to make you sick or to kill you, you can smile
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.680]   back at him and say, "I'm free from the fear of this thing."
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.800]   Powerful clip. This is from John Piper's sermon preached on June 23, 1996, titled "Jesus
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:34.040]   is able to help those who are tempted," a sermon on Hebrews 2, verses 14 to 18. And
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:40.040]   of course, that sermon is online at DesiringGod.org. And if you find a powerful sermon clip like
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:44.040]   this one, send it to me. Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title, the timestamp
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.880]   of where the clip happens in the audio, and make a note of what stands out to you. Put
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:52.840]   the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it right to me at AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.

[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:05.400]   Well I cast my cares on God, and those cares keep finding their way back to me. So how
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:11.280]   do I get rid of those cares for good? It's a great question from a college student, and
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.240]   it's up next time. I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we'll rejoin in studio with Pastor John
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.760]   on Friday to talk about casting our cares on God. I'll see you then.
