[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140]   Well, let's, uh, let's just go around the horn who voted for Trump.
[00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.720]   Let's all raise their hands for those who voted for Trump.
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.720]   Ready?
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.720]   One, two, three.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.720]   Go.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.720]   I voted twice.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.720]   I voted twice.
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.720]   Me too.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.720]   For me, it was so easy.
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.000]   How many swing states did you vote in?
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.400]   I voted in four swing states.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.400]   They sent multiple ballots to my house.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.080]   I filled in all of them.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:39.120]   Okay, let's start.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.120]   Hey everybody.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.120]   Welcome back.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.120]   It's my Jake Allen impression.
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.000]   God, your energy is so dorky.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Welcome.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Welcome.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   I'm a Tim Waltz.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   I'm Tim Waltz of the All-In Pod.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Welcome.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Welcome.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Welcome.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   I'm a Tim Waltz of the All-In Pod.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Welcome.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Welcome.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   I'm a knucklehead.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Did you just sashay into your seat?
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   I am right here.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Show us your jazz.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Show us your jazz hands.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.080]   By the way, that name, just enjoy that name, Tim Waltz, while you can because you're never
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.880]   going to hear about that guy again.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.120]   He's going to be more forgettable than Tim Cain.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.360]   They're going to be doing SNL skits on how forgettable he is.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.320]   That SNL skit was next level.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.320]   I agree.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.320]   Okay.
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.760]   So today we are going to cover the biggest-
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.760]   Anything in the news?
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.760]   Right.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.760]   We'll start out with a little housekeeping and then we'll get into it.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.680]   So like and subscribe on YouTube, youtube.com/atallin.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.580]   We're trying to hit a million subscribers.
[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.960]   Don't forget the holiday party, allin.com/events.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.800]   It is Saturday, December 7th in SF.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.300]   We have a couple of great announcements for the holiday party, which I think we are spending
[00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.440]   way too much money on.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.200]   Steve Aoki will be DJing.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.200]   Nice.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.200]   What?
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.080]   Andrea Botez will be there doing the opening DJ set and her sister Alex will be joining
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.080]   us as well.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.640]   Andrea and Alex will also be playing the Botez sisters.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.440]   We're going to have a chess tournament during the party, which will be super fun.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.640]   Sax, you can get in on that.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.000]   Challenge Alex Botez or David Sax to chess.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.960]   Gary Richards, also known as Destructo-
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.840]   This is Alex's chance for a rematch.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.840]   That's right.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.400]   As I recall, I beat her last time.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.020]   And we will have the board on screen.
[00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.400]   You totally told me to go f*** myself and wouldn't give me anything.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.160]   I also blundered my queen and still won on time, which I will always hold dear in my
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.160]   heart.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.160]   She needed more time.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.280]   If we had given her more time, that was a really tough situation.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.280]   She would have crushed all of us.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.280]   4v1.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.280]   Tough.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.280]   Yeah.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.280]   But it's going to be a great show.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.280]   Other guests to be announced in the future.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.480]   VIP is almost sold out.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.840]   We're doing like a special dinner after the live show and then the party is going to be
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.840]   awesome.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.580]   Casino games, food, drinks, DJs.
[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.800]   This is just to have fun, guys.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.920]   This is not meant to be kind of like the summit type show.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.240]   We're going to just have a great time.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.400]   So we hope everyone will join us.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.560]   And if you've got startups that want to join, please come on by, buy some tickets.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.560]   And it'll be fun.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.560]   How much is this costing us?
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.560]   A million dollars.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.560]   A million bucks?
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.560]   A million bucks for a party.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.880]   The odds are we're going to lose money on this.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.080]   The idea was to see if we could- How many tickets are we selling?
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.080]   Not enough, apparently.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.080]   Not enough.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.080]   Yeah.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.080]   What's the total attendance size?
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.080]   Max.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.080]   Sax, you just won the White House.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.080]   I think you're five.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.080]   Anybody can do this.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.760]   Anyone can do this math.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.400]   How big is the theater and what are we charging for the tickets?
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.400]   Well, it's not a theater.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.320]   So there's like, the tickets are like 500 bucks, I think.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.080]   I love you being the moderator and taking all the arrows.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.080]   This is great.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.080]   Oh, it's not a theater.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.080]   What is it?
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.080]   I'm never moderating again.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.080]   Well, it's the PFA.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.040]   Remember where they used to have the Exploratorium?
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.560]   That building where they built for the World's Fair or whatever.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.240]   So it's in there and it's all empty.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.240]   So we're kind of taking that.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.360]   We're building a stage inside.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.440]   We're going to build all the set and everything.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.440]   It should be fun.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.440]   Okay.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.440]   So first of all- I want to be there.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.440]   That sounds great.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.440]   If you could take some pictures.
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.440]   Send me some photos.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.760]   Unless it's Mar-a-Lago, Saks will not show up.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.040]   I want to just congratulate- It's like, "Oh, we're spending a million
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.040]   dollars?
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.040]   I won't be there."
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.040]   Next!
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.040]   Okay.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.040]   Sorry.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.040]   Keep going.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.680]   I want to congratulate someone really special without whom Trump would likely not have been
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.920]   elected president.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.440]   So your bravery, your ingenuity, your creativity.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.280]   You led the way and you brought millions of people the direct news they couldn't get anywhere
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.280]   else.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.280]   Jason, congrats.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.280]   Yes.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.280]   Thank you.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.000]   You inadvertently architected a system that's helped return Trump to the White House.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.680]   And for that, many people are praising you today.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.680]   Absolutely.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.680]   Congrats, Jason.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.680]   How does it feel to have finally accomplished your dream?
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.680]   Feels great.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.680]   Feels great.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.680]   Absolutely.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.680]   Big shout out to J-Cal to kick this off.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.680]   I did see a tweet where somebody gave me a lot of credit for moving the Overton window
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.080]   in Silicon Valley.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.640]   And they said that Jason was indispensable as my foil.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.640]   Yes!
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.720]   If I didn't have him to dunk on for four years with my political takes, it wouldn't have
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.960]   been nearly as effective.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.960]   So thank you for that.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.960]   No.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.960]   I'm here for you.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.920]   I am avid to your costellum.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.280]   Your internal MSM debating partner.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.160]   We need someone to represent the legacy media point of view.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.160]   Absolutely.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.160]   Absolutely.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.160]   Okay.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.160]   So let's kick it off.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.120]   Sax, you were at Mar-a-Lago on election night.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.240]   I thought it'd just be great if you could tell us a little bit about what the scene
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.240]   was like.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.240]   How was it?
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.520]   And when did you guys kind of know that Trump had kind of the victory in the bag?
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.080]   Was it pre the polls coming in?
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.600]   Because you had pollster data early or, you know, tell us a little bit about the experience
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.440]   there and when it all kind of came together.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.160]   Yeah, I went over there, I guess, around 730, I want to say, Eastern Time.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.960]   Tucker invited me to come on his show.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.800]   Tucker was doing a live stream from the library at Mar-a-Lago, had actually never been over
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.800]   there before.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.120]   There was also a dinner going on in the ballroom, which was, I think, primarily for Mar-a-Lago
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.120]   members.
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.960]   And, you know, there were some senators there, members of the campaign.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.080]   And then there was another room set up with a bunch of TVs for basically the staff to
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.660]   watch the results come in.
[00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.480]   When I first got there, people were kind of just watching, trying to find out the early
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.480]   results.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.600]   I would say that the whispers were positive, but people didn't fundamentally know more
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.040]   than the rest of us.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.880]   You know, everyone's kind of waiting for the results to come in.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.400]   I did get a chance to take a photo with the president.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.800]   Actually, Elon came in separately around the same time, and we got a very memorable photograph
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.360]   here.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.880]   When I shook the president's hand, I got to tell you, he was cool as a cucumber.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.000]   He did not seem nervous at all.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.880]   Did he feel confident, like he had it in the bag?
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.000]   Yeah, I think he was confident, but I don't think he was acting like he had it in the
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   bag or anything like that.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   They didn't know yet.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.600]   But he was just super, super relaxed and calm, and taking photos with everyone, he was in
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.600]   a good mood.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.960]   So, you remember the moment when his hand touched yours?
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.320]   I guess I'm hacking a little bit.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.320]   I'm just saying.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.560]   Did he give you the shake?
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.320]   He gives that little shake to exert a little dominance.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.800]   Did he give you the shake?
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.840]   It was just a normal handshake, but my point is I could detect no nervousness whatsoever
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.880]   on his part.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.080]   And look, the rest of us, we were nervous, and we were wondering what was going to happen.
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.240]   The whole country was nervous, yeah.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.240]   And what were you guys doing?
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.320]   Just hanging out, having cocktails, having dinner, just everyone was meandering, chilling?
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.320]   What's the scene like?
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.360]   What's the scene like at Mar-a-Lago?
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.360]   There's a dinner in the ballroom.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.680]   Actually, I saw Jared there.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.920]   Jared was very nice to me.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.280]   He asked me, "Do you want to sit down at the dinner?"
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.520]   And I could have joined him, but then I decided to do the live stream with you guys, and I
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.000]   pulled in Don Jr., and we did the live stream with Don Jr.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Like I said, it was-
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Are you officially a Mar-a-Lago member, by the way?
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   No.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   500 large?
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   No.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Oh, my Lord.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Is that true?
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   500,000?
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Well, that's what Don Jr. told us.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   But look, there's a process to get in.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   I mean, I don't live in Palm Beach.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.240]   That's the Palm Beach community, is members of Mar-a-Lago.
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:41.480]   So I think that there were ... It wasn't a huge group of people at Mar-a-Lago, and really,
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.080]   all the supporters were convened at the convention center in Palm Beach.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.160]   There were thousands of people there.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.120]   I think originally they had talked about doing an election night party at Mar-a-Lago, but
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.440]   it just got too big, so they moved it to the convention center.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.840]   So I don't know.
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.720]   Whatever it was that I dropped off the live stream with you guys, I then moved to the
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:04.040]   convention center, got back on with Newt, and then we were kind of waiting at the convention
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.040]   center.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.360]   We were all feeling good, increasingly so, throughout the night.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.840]   I would say that when Pennsylvania finally got called, then I think everyone knew that
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.060]   it was in the bag at that point, and it was just a matter of time before the election
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.280]   got called for Trump.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:23.960]   And then at some point, they kind of herded us downstairs into that large ballroom where
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:28.440]   Trump gave his victory speech with the rest of the campaign staff.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:34.760]   So the final tally, it looks like, is going to be 312 electoral college votes for President
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.400]   Donald Trump versus Kamala Harris' 226.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:45.880]   Just for context, in 2016, Trump won with 304 electoral votes, and Biden won in 2020
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.680]   with 306.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.300]   So it's a pretty sweeping victory.
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:54.720]   He won all the supposed swing states this year fairly resoundingly.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.520]   There's no real super close calls, there's some close calls, but pretty resounding victory.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.440]   Chamath, what happened?
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.760]   >>Corey: Wow, it's a really good question.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:12.680]   I think that there's many layers of the answer, but I think in its most basic calculation,
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.760]   I think that the bottom fell out of the Democratic Party.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:26.480]   And if you look at why, there's a simple explanation, and then there's the more nuanced explanation.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:31.240]   I think the simple explanation is they just lost the script.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:40.640]   I think that there was so many people that just got really tired of being spoken at and
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:49.560]   labeled misogynist, racist, fascist, transphobe, whatever it was.
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:55.200]   And there was just these litany of these judgmental labels that would come out instead of engaging
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.200]   on the topics at hand.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:04.760]   So I think the Democratic Party played this game of trying to use identities, genders,
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:12.080]   races as a bid to basically get people that they thought should always vote in their direction
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.400]   to continue to support them.
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.840]   And instead what happened was people just started to think for themselves and say, "Hold
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.840]   on a second.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.080]   I'm just a normal person that wants to be left alone.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.640]   What matters to me?"
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:28.640]   And I think what Donald Trump spoke to was a desire for folks to have economic prosperity,
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:34.960]   a safe neighborhood, a predictable educational curriculum where these kids could go to school,
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.760]   not be indoctrinated and come out the other side and just know some useful skills so that
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.640]   they could get a good job and do better than they did.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.080]   And all these basic truths ended up on the ballot.
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:49.520]   And so it was a bunch of perception versus just a bunch of hard realities.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:56.160]   And I think Trump stayed focused and ultimately made sure that people understood that that's
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.240]   what he was focused on.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:03.580]   And I think the Democrats just went to this place of demagoguery and labels.
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.920]   And I think it was just a resounding defeat.
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:12.060]   And David, I just want you to just to put a pin on how resounding it is.
[00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:18.380]   In California and New York, which I would say are the two most prolific bastions of
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:26.500]   elitist liberal thinking, Democrats won those states in some of the narrowest margins they've
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.340]   ever seen.
[00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:33.020]   I think in 2020, they won California by 29 points.
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:36.460]   It was barely half is what they won by this year.
[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.760]   In New York, it shrunk to a 12 point margin.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.000]   So what is this telling you?
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.840]   It's telling you that the Democrats really need to retool and get back to first principles.
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:55.800]   It was a cataclysmic dismissal of wokeism, of cancel culture, of judgmentalism.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:03.880]   It was a ringing endorsement of a meritocracy, of just plain simple common sense, of talking
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:12.380]   with people and to people, being able to tolerate disagreements, remaining friends.
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.860]   All of those things were on the ballot.
[00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:18.660]   And it was just an absolute resounding victory for just normalcy.
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.700]   That's what I think we saw.
[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.100]   We saw a return to normalcy.
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:28.260]   Jason, do you think that that message got across more clearly in this election than
[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:34.940]   ever before, as some have claimed, because of the power of alternative media for reaching
[00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:39.940]   the audience rather than having everything pushed through reporters in traditional legacy
[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:40.940]   media?
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:45.620]   In this case, many of the candidates, particularly on the Republican side, went direct to the
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:51.140]   audience through long form podcasts like ours, but also Joe Rogan and Lex and many others.
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.500]   And did that move the needle for a lot of people in a way that won this?
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.860]   Or was it the policies and the difference alone?
[00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:57.860]   Yeah.
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:03.460]   Well, clearly, being on podcasts was a major part of Trump's strategy that people are starting
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:05.340]   to report on right now.
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:08.500]   And in media, you go where the audience is.
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.620]   And I think the Democrats just didn't get that.
[00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:16.900]   Now, stepping back, I think the number one problem here is the candidate that the Democrats
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.220]   put up.
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:21.900]   And probably the close number two is inflation.
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:27.340]   And the economy, as we all know, it's the economy, stupid.
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:33.380]   If you were paying $2 for a cheeseburger at McDonald's, and now it's $4, that's what people
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:34.780]   are going to remember.
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:40.020]   And the inflation that occurred over this last four years was huge.
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:43.820]   And people cited that over and over and over again.
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:47.260]   So there's probably three buckets you could put this conversation into.
[00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.620]   First, the candidate, Kamala Harris was a terrible candidate.
[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.500]   She was put in at the last minute.
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.740]   And she was anointed and she didn't go through a proper primary.
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.140]   I think that's probably number one in this entire thing.
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:00.140]   It was a terrible thing.
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.820]   You're saying you're saying number one is the candidate.
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:02.820]   Kamala.
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.280]   Everyone's the candidate.
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:08.220]   Number two, I think because remember, Trump was incredibly unpopular as well.
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.580]   And all credit Trump for winning and running an incredible campaign.
[00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:15.540]   I mean, just they they crushed it.
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:22.220]   Podcasts with JD Vance turned out to be spectacular on podcasts and really delivered the message.
[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:26.260]   And you know, the number two is obviously inflation in the economy.
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:31.340]   And then I think number three is the bucket that Chamath started with, which is the country
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:39.180]   really, really does not like being told that they're racist or sexist, etc, cancel culture.
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:42.180]   And you put those three things together.
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:46.160]   One of the things that's coming out right now is some of the ads and that will play
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.160]   an ad here.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.160]   I wanted you guys to see this.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.940]   I think this ad sums up exactly how bad Kamala was.
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:57.700]   And we'll combine this ad with just some of the statistics that have come out of how many
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:58.700]   people have gone right.
[00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:03.020]   This is Charlemagne the God from the Breakfast Club, for those who don't know, in a Donald
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.020]   Trump ad.
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:11.180]   What taxpayer funded sex changes for prisoners, surgery, for prisoners, for prisoners, every
[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:15.620]   transgender inmate in the prison system would have access.
[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:20.340]   Hell no, I don't want my taxpayer dollars going to Kamala supports transgender sex changes
[00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:21.700]   in jail with our money.
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:27.740]   Kamala even supports letting biological men compete against our girls in their sports.
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.860]   Kamala is for them.
[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:31.500]   President Trump is for you.
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.300]   I'm Donald J. Trump, and I approve this message.
[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:39.420]   And so how does Kamala come back from this with black voters, with male voters, with
[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:43.260]   people who are tired of having this agenda shoved down their throat?
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.940]   Obviously, it's going to be incredibly difficult.
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.700]   Plus she was in charge of the border, claimed she wasn't.
[00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:54.140]   Plus she was in charge of, you know, and Biden were in charge of the economy when inflation
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:55.140]   spiked.
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:59.220]   Terrible candidate combined with a bad track record, combined with a flawless campaign
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:02.420]   from Trump, I think easy victory.
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:09.380]   And you know, if we pull up this F.T. chart, Nick, that I sent you ahead of time, and I
[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:13.940]   tweeted this, you know, Americans love winners and innovation and they hate socialism and
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:14.940]   this woke nonsense.
[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:19.980]   And if you look at how Trump's support increased, look at this, Chamath.
[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:27.300]   Every single demographic, black, Asian, Hispanic, 18 to 29, 30 to 34, female, white college
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:34.300]   men, except for two, 65 year old plus, very moderately, very modestly went left.
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:39.580]   And white college women very modestly went left in terms of increasing support.
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:44.140]   Otherwise a hard shift, right, including in some categories.
[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:48.900]   So the biggest shift, right, was in Hispanic and Asian populations.
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:54.940]   And these are groups of people, I think, who you can double click on young people, Hispanic
[00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:55.940]   and Asians.
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:56.940]   Asians believe in meritocracy.
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:01.420]   I think is what most people have read into that dramatic swing.
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:06.860]   And Hispanics are anti or more traditional family values and that's probably what pushed
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:07.860]   that so far, right.
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:12.780]   But I wanted to just get your take on that chart, Chamath, in relation to your handicapping
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:13.980]   of the election.
[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:18.540]   And then how much Kamala and how much the inflation played into it.
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:23.540]   I think that there are three ways to kind of identify and tell me if you guys think
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:24.740]   these are the wrong vectors.
[00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:30.660]   Either the policies, the candidate, and the methods of the campaign.
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:31.660]   All of it.
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:32.660]   All three.
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:33.660]   Right.
[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:36.700]   That's how I kind of break down what happened in the selection cycle.
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.300]   There's a big difference between the candidates as people.
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:45.140]   Some people cannot see past the fact that Kamala did not get any primary vote.
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:49.820]   Some people cannot see past the behavior of Donald Trump on Twitter.
[00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:54.420]   And when he talks to people and how he has talked to people and perceived to be a bully
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:58.500]   and the felony conviction, and some people cannot get past other factors of those two
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.500]   candidates.
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:00.500]   And then some people can get past it.
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:06.540]   I've been saying this since I'm blue in the face, but I'll try it again.
[00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:12.780]   I think that the mainstream media has been working hand in hand with the Democratic Party
[00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:19.100]   to propagate and move forward an agenda that tried to vilify Donald Trump.
[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:25.940]   I did not know that when I initially encountered him in 2015 as a candidate.
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:32.300]   But what you're supposed to do as an adult is once you start to see a pattern of behavior,
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:36.500]   you know, this is for the safety, security of your family.
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:40.020]   This is about how you think about economically taking care of your family.
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:42.780]   Like, you have to re-underwrite decisions from first principles.
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:48.260]   You must be prepared to change your mind when you see important information.
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:52.260]   And I have said this till I blew in the face, but I'll say it again.
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:59.580]   If I think of all of the people in the political infrastructure of America that I have met
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:04.460]   and spent time with from Bill Clinton on, I remember sitting and having dinner with
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:10.940]   Barack Obama the day of Brexit and getting a note that he read and he said, "Oh my gosh,"
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.500]   and says, "Wow, the UK just pulled out."
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.700]   I was sitting across from him that dinner.
[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:19.520]   I've been with all of these people.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:24.820]   The Democrats only come to me to ask me for money.
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:33.140]   The only politician that has ever called me just to have a conversation, just to say thank
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:37.780]   you and be kind, the only one has been Donald Trump.
[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.020]   Isn't that incredible?
[00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:45.220]   Of all of the people, every other person has only ever called and asked me for money.
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.260]   So what does that mean?
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:55.100]   I think what it means is that there has been a concerted effort to perturb the way that
[00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.660]   you interpret who he is.
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:03.860]   Separately, there's been a concerted effort to prop up whoever is sitting against him
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.800]   in opposition.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:12.260]   And I think this is an opportunity to finally acknowledge that if you trust these traditional
[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:18.700]   legacy sources of helping you to get to a decision, you're going to get tricked.
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:26.220]   There's that old saying, "Fool me once, shame on you, but fool me twice, shame on me because
[00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:29.500]   I am now allowing this to happen."
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.900]   And I think that for a lot of Americans, that is what happened.
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.740]   I think it is really as simple as that.
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:42.980]   I think they were able to see through the veneer of an attempt to malign and corner
[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:50.500]   somebody, and on the other side, an attempt to basically play on vibes and feelings and
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.600]   emotions.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.540]   And I don't think that America wants that.
[00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:56.460]   That is not what they want in running the country.
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:01.420]   They want somebody serious running the country where you can have disagreements with them
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:05.460]   and you can still find an opportunity to work together with those people.
[00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:06.460]   I think it's that.
[00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:15.300]   JS: Sax, do you think about how important the policy versus the individual versus the
[00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:21.280]   way they ran the campaign, the media, and how they reached people as kind of three vectors?
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.540]   And if so, how would you kind of rank those three in importance and what changed people's
[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.340]   votes and got them to vote differently than they did in the last election?
[00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.060]   Ax: Yeah, I think it's a pretty good framework.
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:33.700]   I mean, you have the message, you have the messenger, and I guess you have the campaign
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.420]   at a tactical level.
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:40.620]   I think it's a little bit unfair to blame this entire defeat on Kamala Harris being
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.340]   a bad messenger or candidate.
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:44.340]   It's true.
[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:45.340]   She's not the greatest candidate.
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.900]   She has a lot of problems.
[00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:50.860]   However, I don't think she was dealt a particularly strong hand.
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:57.740]   The fact of the matter is that we did have rampant inflation in this country that really
[00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:01.860]   hurt people in their pocketbooks every time they went to the grocery store.
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:06.300]   And that resulted from the trillions of spending that was agreed to by virtually the entire
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.580]   Democratic Party.
[00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:12.140]   Remember, not only did they pass trillions in spending, they wanted four and a half trillion
[00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:13.980]   more for Build Back Better.
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:18.220]   And the only reason that didn't happen is because Manchin and Sinema voted against it.
[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:22.180]   Can you imagine how much worse inflation would have been?
[00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:25.460]   Manchin was driven into retirement, and Sinema was basically kicked out of the party.
[00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:28.260]   She effectively told us that at the All-In Summit.
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:31.420]   So this defeat is on the entire Democratic Party.
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:35.960]   The Democratic Party was in support of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's agenda.
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.140]   They were in support of the de facto open border policies.
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:45.040]   They were in support of the soft-on-crime Soros D.A. decarceral policies.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:49.640]   You can see that even in California, which is a deep blue state, there's a huge backlash
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:55.720]   to this sort of insane soft-on-crime agenda the Democrats have.
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:03.200]   70% of California voted for Prop 36, which basically reversed the excesses of Prop 47,
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:07.540]   which a decade ago basically made shoplifting legal in California.
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:10.920]   You know who opposed Prop 36 despite its massive popularity?
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:11.920]   Gavin Newsom.
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.680]   Kamala Harris wouldn't say whether she supported it or not.
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:19.800]   So what you see is that even in blue states, the Democratic Party elites are completely
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.140]   out of touch with what people want.
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:28.480]   And then finally, you've got foreign policy, where I think that the Democratic agenda basically
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:32.800]   wanting to engage in a proxy war with Vladimir Putin because he's the incarnation of all
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.760]   evil, that I think is blown up in the collective West face.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:41.000]   That has been a disaster that was supported by the entire Democratic Party.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.040]   So on issue after issue that I think mattered in this election, you cannot just put the
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.200]   blame on Kamala Harris.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.540]   It's got to be on the Democratic Party as a whole.
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:55.800]   And just to echo what Chamath said about the cultural stuff, they've talked down to us.
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:56.960]   They've lectured us.
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.360]   They've insulted us.
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:59.920]   They've censored us.
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:00.920]   They've gaslit us.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.400]   They've tried to cancel us.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.400]   They tried to cancel us.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.200]   They tried to punish dissent with lawfare.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:10.040]   They turned Elon into an enemy, which was the single worst own goal in history.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.520]   Remember, this wasn't just...
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.520]   And Joe Rogan.
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.520]   Don't forget Joe Rogan.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:14.520]   But it wasn't...
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:15.520]   Joe Rogan out as well.
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:16.520]   Bernie supported Joe Rogan.
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:21.280]   But with Elon, it wasn't just disinviting him or never inviting him to the EV summit.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:25.720]   It goes all the way back to Lorena Gonzalez's tweet, telling him to F off and leave the
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.100]   state of California.
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:32.200]   So look, the Democratic Party as a whole has to own this, and they're not going to start
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:37.920]   winning elections again until they have an improvement in their agenda, not just their
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:38.920]   messenger.
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:44.880]   So Saxe, is this the nature of democracy, that over time, when you have a two-party
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:50.880]   system and one party veers too far to the left or one party veers too far to the right,
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:55.920]   people jump ship to the other party, and ultimately they pull the policies of the party that they
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.080]   left back to the middle?
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:01.480]   And that's the way democracy is supposed to work and has worked historically?
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.240]   So is this the way it's supposed to go?
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:07.920]   And do we project that four years from now, the Democrats will need to be and need to
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:13.120]   adjust to the center, and we'll see less of this extremism because of the way the voting
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.360]   turned out this election cycle?
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:19.600]   - I think that's a very interesting question is whether the Democrats have the necessary
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.960]   introspection to learn from this loss.
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:25.960]   I would say that one of them does, if you look at Matt Iglesias, who's someone I've
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:30.880]   sparred with on TwitterX, who is a Democrat partisan.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.720]   He basically tweeted a list of principles that he thought the Democrat Party needed
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.720]   to adopt.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:36.720]   I read it and retweeted it.
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:40.040]   I said, laughing my ass off, this is a list of Republican principles.
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:43.840]   It was all about opposing woke and being in favor of merit and innovation.
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:44.840]   - Tolerance.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:45.840]   - Tolerance.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:46.840]   I'm like, great, look, you know what?
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.880]   If the Democratic Party wants to adopt these principles, that's a wonderful thing for the
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:50.880]   country.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.840]   I hope that they do it, okay?
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.120]   But will they do it?
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.000]   I have my doubts.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   You look at this tweet by Ari Fleischer, where he talks about who the Democratic Party now
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   is.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.400]   I think that this is a really important tweet, because it sort of tells you, Sax, who's going
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.720]   to be left in the room.
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:08.720]   - Exactly.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.840]   - If these are the only people left in the room, the last thing they're going to do is
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:12.840]   admit defeat.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:13.840]   - Right, exactly.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:21.280]   So what you see is that the Democratic Party base is these very affluent, very overeducated,
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.120]   very non-religious types.
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:27.640]   And frankly, I wonder whether they're too out of touch to know they're out of touch.
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.560]   They're certainly very whiny and entitled.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:35.080]   And I just don't think they're going to cede control of the party without a fight.
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:40.960]   And frankly, they've disappeared so far up their own woke asses that I don't think they
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.700]   can find an electoral majority if they try.
[00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:47.760]   So if these people stay in control of the party, and these are the people who you're
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:52.760]   seeing having a mental breakdown on TikTok, they're posting all the videos, they're insulting
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:53.800]   the electorate.
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:58.880]   And let's face it, it's not just on TikTok, it's on the legacy media, it's on MSDNC.
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:05.040]   It's basically the legacy media who are trying to diagnose a psychosis in the American electorate
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.760]   to explain why they were so wrong.
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:12.400]   If those people stay in control, I think that the Republicans could have an electoral majority
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.960]   as far as the eye can see.
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.500]   - I completely agree with you.
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:21.180]   And I'll go even further, which is I think that the Democrats will lose one of California
[00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:23.280]   or New York in the next eight years.
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:24.880]   - If they don't attack, right?
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:25.880]   So that's the key question.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:26.880]   - They're not going to attack.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:33.400]   - Do you think that the intelligentsia, quote-unquote, the Bill Gates, Reid Hoffmans of the world
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:40.520]   that funds Dustin Moskovitz, that funds the Democratic apparatus at the highest level,
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:47.160]   if they can't change, what are the odds that the state infrastructure or the local infrastructure
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.400]   changes?
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:54.120]   I think maybe on the margins, the local infrastructure can change more quickly and adeptly because
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:58.280]   it just costs a lot less money and it's much more concentrated.
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:01.480]   But I think the states are very laggard in that sense.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.160]   And I think that they take the table scraps of what's left over.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:10.300]   So if you have the Democrats lead, there is no chance that unless they change the planks
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:14.500]   at their platform, that the state legislatures in New York and California are going to change
[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:15.500]   what they believe.
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:18.320]   - Nick, pull up the link I just sent.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.660]   So let me just underscore an important aspect for you guys on this, which is the amount
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:24.120]   that the Democrats spent in this campaign.
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.580]   And obviously they saw a significant negative return.
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:32.520]   They lost across the board, Senate majority, House majority, governorships, the White House,
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.520]   but they spent more.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:37.960]   Here, you can see the difference between the Harris campaign and the Trump campaign spending.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:43.640]   Harris campaign spent nearly $900 million, the Trump campaign, 350 million.
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:48.840]   If you look at the super PACs, the super PAC spent 1.4 billion on the Dem side, roughly
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:52.280]   400 million, 450 million on the Republican side.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:58.440]   And if you scroll down in some of these key Senate races, the Dems far outspent the Republicans
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.440]   and still lost.
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:05.180]   The Ohio Senate race, Sherrod Brown, $58 million of spending, Bernie Moreno, 21 million and
[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:06.880]   Bernie Moreno had a resounding victory.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:13.740]   Jon Tester, 84 million of spending, Tim Sheehy, 22 million, Tim Sheehy won the election.
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:17.160]   So across the board, the spending was greater.
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.100]   The return was negative.
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:21.840]   Money cannot overcome common sense.
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:27.920]   So my question again is, does this not necessitate attack to the center for the Democrats?
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.920]   They want to see the party survive.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.540]   And if they're going to continue to lose like this, they will not continue to maintain the
[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:37.280]   same policy agenda that got them into this position in the first place.
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:41.160]   J. Cal, do you think that the Democratic Party will need to attack to the center and that
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.080]   they're going to start to adjust because of this?
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.280]   They started that process.
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:48.360]   They knew that going into this election and they started moving to the center.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:53.680]   It was laughable in some cases because you have like Kamala talking about providing sex
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:58.260]   changes for prisoners and you know, all of those receipts came out.
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:02.220]   So even as she started to try to get to the center, people didn't buy it.
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:03.800]   So of course they're going to.
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:08.600]   But what's very interesting about spend there and the genius of Trump is earned media.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.040]   What's earned media?
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:15.240]   When you are trying to get hits in media, you will put them into two buckets, paid and
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.240]   earned.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.720]   What you just showed was paid.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.860]   Paid is considered what you do if you can't earn media.
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:24.600]   All in podcast is an example of earned media.
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.680]   We do this every week.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.840]   We earned our audience.
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:29.540]   We didn't pay anybody for this audience.
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:32.000]   And I think that was, you know, what Trump did.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.840]   And importantly, someone that comes on the show earns that.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:36.840]   Correct.
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:39.280]   So that's the piece of this that I think is so important.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:42.040]   You don't have to pay to go on Joe Rogan.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:48.520]   But the candidate that the Democrats put out there was so bad that she could not even.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:54.400]   And I think Saks is, you know, master at setting people up here.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:58.220]   The Democrats put up a horrible, horrible candidate.
[00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:00.540]   And I know Saks is saying, oh, it's not Kamala's fault.
[00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:06.340]   Kamala could not go on Joe Rogan because they knew that it would be so embarrassing and
[00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:10.020]   that she would get so embarrassed that it would lose her votes.
[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:14.960]   His doom loop, you know, observation from, I don't know, eight weeks ago, you had that
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.680]   Saks was exactly correct.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.740]   The more she spoke, the more she started going down.
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:24.960]   She was leading Trump at one point on Polly market in some of these places.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:30.180]   And she absolutely proved that she could not communicate well.
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:35.860]   And so and I just want to just circle back to the point about inflation.
[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:38.940]   Here's the McDonald's price increases that I was mentioning before.
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:42.540]   End of 2019, you could buy a McChicken for a buck twenty nine.
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:45.920]   And in mid 2024, it was three dollars and eighty nine cents.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:52.200]   The majority of Americans wind up going to Taco Bell, McDonald's every week, some cases
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.760]   multiple times a week.
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:32:02.760]   You cannot discount exactly how profound this cost of eating food and buying groceries had
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:03.760]   on this election.
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.680]   It is the number one issue, I think, this election.
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:10.640]   We can talk in our bubble about it, but this is what I mean, inflation.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.960]   This is what I mean by a return to normalcy.
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.980]   These are normal people problems.
[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:17.360]   How much does it cost to put food on the table?
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:20.360]   How much does it cost to drive from point A to point B?
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:24.980]   I want to send my kid to a school where they go and they learn the ABCs and the one two
[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:29.400]   threes because they're going to have to graduate and compete with India and China.
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:32.360]   I don't want to worry about indoctrination and all this other stuff.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.360]   Absolutely.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:37.360]   Oh, look, I did predict the doom loop for Kamala Harris two months ago because she is
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:41.900]   just not good at interviews or being off the cuff or being unscripted.
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:42.900]   Not good is generous.
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:43.900]   Yes.
[00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:45.680]   Saxtra Damas was right about that.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:46.680]   Absolutely.
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.600]   However, and I would say the biggest problem in her campaign is that she would neither
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:55.720]   defend the Biden Harris record nor say what she would do differently.
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.320]   The question you have to ask is why?
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:02.720]   And I think it's because she was in a really tough position that her own party put her
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:08.080]   in, which is they said, you can't criticize Joe Biden because he's the sitting president.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:13.760]   But at the same time, you can't defend him either because he's so unpopular.
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.060]   Well, what made him unpopular?
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.800]   Democratic Party policies.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:21.720]   They should have, frankly, looking back, they should have just let Joe Biden defend his
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.280]   own record.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:28.720]   The old man must have been in the White House gnashing his teeth, saying, please put me
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:29.720]   in the game.
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.120]   Let me defend my own record.
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.940]   He at least believed in it.
[00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:36.440]   The Democrats wouldn't defend their own record because it was so bad.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:40.760]   You have to put some blame for that, not just on Kamala, but on the entire party.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:41.760]   That's my only point.
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:47.480]   Well, Saxtra, it's so obvious that that technique they use to defeat Trump in 2020, after those
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:51.200]   chaotic four years, was, hey, do you want normalcy?
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.200]   And then they had-
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:53.200]   What technique was that?
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.200]   15 million votes?
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.200]   Wait, what's that?
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:58.080]   I didn't hear the joke.
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:02.760]   I said what tactic was that, 15 million extra votes?
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.760]   Please don't start with the conspiracy theories.
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:09.600]   We're really going to say that this has to be a conspiracy theory now?
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:12.960]   I mean, who's the chart from?
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.880]   Who's the chart from?
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:15.880]   What's the provenance of the chart?
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:21.280]   Just so you know, the Y-axis starts at 50 million, so don't be a little too crazy.
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.280]   Hold on.
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:25.040]   Before we go down this rabbit hole, let me just finish my point, then you guys can go
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.800]   to Conspiracy Corner and say the election was stolen.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:33.440]   The point I'm making here is, obviously, Biden ran a very successful campaign against Trump
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:38.560]   based on vibes and based on his creating chaos in the country, in most people's mind, and
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:40.580]   this return to normalcy.
[00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.840]   So that did work for them previously.
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:47.080]   It just didn't work this time because they had to defend their record on the border.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:50.040]   They needed to defend their record on the economy, and Saxtra's exactly right.
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.080]   They didn't touch that.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:55.960]   And how do you not talk about their own record?
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:00.920]   And their record had some good bright spots to it, record low unemployment, record high
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:05.660]   stock market, and we tamed inflation, and they could have had a really great discussion
[00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:10.020]   about inflation and just said, "Hey, listen, both of the last two terms, there was a lot
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:15.480]   of spending, and so inflation manifested during the last four years, and hey, we tamed it.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.480]   So here we are.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.360]   We still have record low unemployment.
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:21.880]   We still have a record high stock market, and we tamed inflation.
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:22.880]   Things are going to get better."
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.480]   But she couldn't even communicate that.
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:28.280]   I can communicate that better than the presidential candidate.
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.280]   Come on.
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.280]   She could have easily done that.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.800]   Freiberg, let me just go back to your point about the money.
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:37.680]   It is true that the Democrats had roughly three times as much money as the Republicans
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:38.680]   did.
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:41.400]   The Democrats had something like a billion dollars for this campaign, the Republicans
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.400]   had 300 and something.
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.400]   For the presidential campaign.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.600]   For the presidential campaign, exactly.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:48.120]   The Republicans obviously still won in a landslide.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:52.680]   That excludes the super PACs, which had additional funding that were going towards supporting
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:53.680]   the nominee as well.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.520]   My point is just the Democrats had a massive advantage on the money side.
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:03.840]   They also, I think, had a massive advantage on what you would call the legacy media side.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:08.760]   I don't know how you put a value, a dollar value on what the legacy media has done, not
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:12.560]   just in this election cycle, but for the last eight or nine years.
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:18.120]   They have basically called Donald Trump a Nazi, a fascist, a traitor.
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.760]   Did it work?
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:20.760]   Or did it blow up in their faces?
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:21.760]   Hold on.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:22.760]   I'm about to get to that.
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:23.760]   Did it blow up in their faces?
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.160]   They called him an agent of Putin.
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:26.440]   They called him an insurrectionist.
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:27.800]   They called him a convicted felon.
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.520]   They called him a dictator.
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:34.240]   They've been yelling that at the top of their lungs now for at least four years.
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.280]   The country didn't believe it.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.420]   I would just say that the legacy media spell is broken.
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.040]   Their credibility has been destroyed.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:47.600]   And I think that the repudiation of the legacy media is one of the most important results
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:48.960]   of this election.
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:53.800]   It just shows that the Democrats had, I don't know how you valued, a trillion-dollar propaganda
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:57.920]   machine on their side, and Trump was still able to win.
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:02.960]   And you have to, at the end of the day, say that that's the result not just of alternative
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.760]   media gaining steam and free speech on X.
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:08.760]   I think those were absolutely necessary enablers.
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:14.560]   It's also the fact that Trump has a trillion-dollar personality and is a tremendously gifted communicator
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.600]   and politician in his own unique way.
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.600]   Genius.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:22.040]   But finally, you have to say that the issues are on Trump's side.
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.200]   Americans want the border to be sealed.
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:28.240]   They see that the spending and the bureaucracy in Washington are out of control.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:31.360]   They do not want woke cancel culture anymore.
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:35.600]   They see America getting over-involved in foreign wars.
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:40.080]   They want the spending to be brought back home where it benefits them.
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.760]   These are the key points of the Trump agenda.
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:48.040]   And at the end of the day, whatever you want to say about Trump, he ran a campaign based
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:49.200]   on issues.
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.160]   He talked about issues.
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.800]   What did Kamala Harris run her campaign on?
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:54.800]   Vibes.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:55.800]   Vibes.
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:56.800]   Celebrity endorsements.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:57.800]   Name-calling.
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:58.800]   Works last time.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.800]   Debunked hoaxes.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:03.280]   I just want to go around the horn real quick and ask each of you guys, once again, I'm
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.320]   going to ask you one more question after this.
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:06.440]   What mattered most?
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:10.240]   Was it the policy sacks, as you're proclaiming, is what a lot of people voted on?
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.580]   Was it the issues with the candidate, the individual?
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:14.640]   Or was it the media or the campaign tactics?
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:17.580]   Of those three, what mattered most, do you think, in terms of moving votes?
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:18.580]   What moved the most votes?
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:21.480]   Listen, I don't think you can separate the man from the message or the messenger from
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.480]   the message.
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.480]   Okay.
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:28.840]   Listen, if you had a conventional Republican out there, I don't think that they could have
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:34.380]   overcome the trillion-dollar propaganda machine of the legacy media.
[00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:41.100]   That being said, I think if Donald Trump had been campaigning with Mitt Romney's message
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:44.380]   or Mitch McConnell's message, I don't think he would have gone anywhere.
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:46.980]   I don't even think he would have been the Republican nominee.
[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:52.820]   You have to say that Trump, since 2016, has tapped into something very deep in the American
[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:53.820]   electorate.
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:56.380]   And, you know, this is something we can get into.
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:39:00.540]   But I think that if you look back now over the last 10 years, it's clear that he's the
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:03.100]   transformational figure in American politics.
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.300]   It's not Barack Obama, with all due respect.
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:06.300]   It's Trump.
[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:07.300]   J. Cal, your turn.
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:11.060]   The policies, the individual, or the campaign tactics?
[00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:16.340]   It's very clearly this had to do, you know, primarily with Kamala.
[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:18.940]   It is the candidate and how she was selected.
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:22.140]   Yeah, I mean, obviously, if you had the same track record...
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:24.540]   It's interesting for you to say that as a Dem, right, because I think that may have
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:25.540]   chased a lot of people.
[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:26.540]   I'm a moderate.
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:27.540]   I'm not a Dem, by the way.
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:29.860]   I voted Republican one-third of the time.
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:31.180]   Maybe even a little bit more recently.
[00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:32.780]   But two-thirds, two-thirds, you voted Dem.
[00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:33.940]   So you were open to that.
[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:34.940]   And she...
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:35.940]   I'm a left-leaning moderate.
[00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:37.100]   I mean, I've been very clear about that.
[00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:38.420]   My record's been very clear about that.
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:43.700]   It is clear that it was her, because I will say, if you had put up Friedberg, and I think
[00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:47.780]   it's great that you're forcing us to pick one of the three, and it's a hard thing to
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:51.820]   do, but if you had picked Dean Phillips and Shapiro, I think they would have beat Trump
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:52.820]   very easily.
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:55.940]   Or, because remember, Trump was phenomenally unpopular.
[00:39:55.940 --> 00:40:01.460]   And I think the big question that's going to come out of this is how did Elon do getting
[00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:06.060]   young men, and how did Joe Rogan and podcasts like ours do at getting young men to come
[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:07.060]   out and vote?
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:08.220]   That's something we haven't talked about yet.
[00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:13.380]   And I feel like that could be the one thing that comes out of this election over the coming
[00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:20.540]   years that we look at that'll be the sustainable change, is that young men are now voting,
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:25.940]   and they want to vote for something very different than white women or old people.
[00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:29.100]   And Chamath, what is your read on what mattered most?
[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:30.500]   Do you have one of those three?
[00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:31.500]   How would you weight?
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:37.060]   If you had to rank them, I think the policies of the Democratic Party are fundamentally
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:38.060]   broken.
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:42.060]   They've become the exact opposite of where they were even 20 years ago.
[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:47.660]   So the Democrats used to be the protector of free speech.
[00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:50.280]   Now they are pro-censorship.
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:52.300]   The Republicans are free speech.
[00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:55.700]   The Democrats used to be all about anti-war.
[00:40:55.700 --> 00:41:02.180]   Now they are more likely to get mangled into all of these foreign misadventures in partnership
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:06.940]   with the military-industrial complex, whereas the Republicans have been a bulwark to war.
[00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:08.380]   And they embrace the Cheney's.
[00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:09.380]   Ultimate proof of that.
[00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:10.380]   Oh my gosh.
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:13.480]   I mean, that was the scariest and oddest turn of events.
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:17.580]   So I think that what happened is the policies, they just lost their way.
[00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:21.960]   Now the question is, was it purposeful or was it by accident?
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:28.140]   And I think that belies the bigger question, which is just the people in charge of the
[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:33.940]   Democratic Party, I think to Sachs's point, do they even have a sense of that they have
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:38.820]   to change or are they just so now fundamentally out of touch and they just believe what they
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:43.560]   believe so ferociously, they're going to have to go through maybe three or four or five
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:46.860]   more elections of just getting totally trounced in order to learn the lesson.
[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:51.960]   Okay, I'll wear my McLaughlin hat and say Chamath, right answer.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:59.160]   Now my next question back to you Chamath is, I've had a lot of conversations in the last
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:04.200]   few days with good friends, with people I'm close with, with family and so on.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:05.200]   Hold on, Freeberg.
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:07.600]   What do you think before you ask the next question?
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:11.240]   I think policy matters, but here's the stumbling block.
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:16.640]   If you talk to anyone that did not vote for Trump and voted for Kamala Harris, that is
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:23.980]   a, you know, kind of reasonable people or what, you know, I don't want to kind of classify
[00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:28.040]   people, but people that you would normally have decent long form conversations with,
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:33.620]   and you start talking about specific policy issues with them, the conversation keeps coming
[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:38.680]   back to Trump, the person in my experience, people can't see past a person who is a quote
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:43.580]   convicted felon, as they claim, who is taking away women's rights, who is a bully who is
[00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:44.580]   mean.
[00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:48.580]   Who else is influenced by his past behavior and things he said and the way he's said things
[00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:50.000]   and done things on Twitter.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.420]   We can, we can proclaim that there was a lot of misrepresentation about Trump in the, in
[00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:57.780]   the legacy media, but there were a lot of tweets that Trump put out that were off-putting
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:59.300]   to a lot of people.
[00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:04.580]   So I want you, Chamath, to speak to the many individuals out there who are good people
[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:09.520]   who feel disenfranchised, who are not like the funny people you can make fun of on libs
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:13.820]   of TikTok or what have you, but just everyday normal people that said, I really don't trust
[00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:14.820]   the guy.
[00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:17.900]   I really don't believe that this is a good person.
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:20.580]   And I think that the policies make more sense.
[00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:24.120]   I agree with a lot of the policy issues, but frankly, the guy doesn't seem like the right
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:25.300]   guy for me.
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:26.460]   How do you kind of break through?
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:27.460]   Is that possible?
[00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:33.100]   And can you speak to that person to help them kind of see past the individual to the policies
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:38.540]   and have trust and faith that this individual can actually shepherd this nation forward?
[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:48.700]   There are so many very powerful examples of how the media colluded with the Democratic
[00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:56.860]   Party to fundamentally lie about things that actually happened when it relates to Donald
[00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:58.620]   Trump.
[00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:04.740]   One of the most simple and powerful was the lie about Charlottesville.
[00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:10.300]   When I processed Charlottesville, I'm probably one of those people, David, that you talk
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:11.300]   about.
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:21.340]   I was just so scared and angry and I took at face value what the media said that Donald
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:24.020]   Trump said.
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:30.820]   And then I was really angry at Donald Trump until I saw the footage and saw that it was
[00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:35.020]   just a complete lie.
[00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:39.900]   And that is just an incredible shirking of responsibility that the media has undertaken.
[00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:46.420]   The deviousness, the dishonesty, it's really bad.
[00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:48.580]   And that's where I said, "I have to stop.
[00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:56.100]   As a grown up rational man, as the head of my family, I need to re-underwrite where I'm
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:57.100]   coming from."
[00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:05.280]   Well, head of my family with Nat, when she lets me be, but anyways, I can feel her, I
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:16.800]   can feel that one line, "Keep that line in, Nick, I am the head of my family."
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:17.800]   Okay.
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:18.800]   Anyways, guys, sorry.
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:19.800]   Let's get, let's get back up.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:20.800]   Okay.
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:24.960]   Go back, go back, go back, go back.
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:31.640]   The thing is, I started to re-underwrite and I do that every day in my day job.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.320]   I'm running a company.
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:35.720]   Is 80/90 going well or not well?
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.680]   It depends on the conditions on the ground.
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.920]   When things are going well, I need to do more of those things.
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:42.560]   When things are not going well, I need to re-underwrite.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:45.120]   Is it something that I'm in control of?
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.460]   Is it something that I've missed?
[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:47.460]   How do I change it?
[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:49.000]   How do I get my team to be better?
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.200]   I live it every day.
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.360]   In investing, it's the same thing.
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:57.080]   There was periods where I was on top of the world and everything was working.
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:01.000]   Then there were waves where things were not working, but I still had to show up and do
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.160]   my job well.
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:08.360]   As it's turning out, in those darkest hours was when I probably have made some of my absolute
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:10.640]   best new investments.
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:15.160]   That would not have happened if I did not keep my feet on the ground and constantly
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:18.960]   re-underwrite and try to challenge my biases.
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:23.620]   There are so many examples that have happened to Trump that when you actually unpack them,
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:26.900]   there was a concerted effort to lie.
[00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:33.280]   That is why it's important for folks to be able to suspend that judgment.
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:39.160]   The second thing I would say is then you saw four years of the man in office.
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:48.000]   If you actually separate the interpretation by the media who frankly just hate him with
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.800]   what he actually did, you take a step back and you're like, "Man, these accomplishments
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.200]   were incredible."
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:57.680]   For example, let's look at what happened with the Abraham Accords.
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:04.880]   We have never been closer to substantial and sustained peace in the Middle East in any
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:10.520]   era of government under any president than we were when Jared Kushner on behalf of Donald
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:13.920]   Trump negotiated those agreements.
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:18.120]   Look how far we have slipped since then.
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:26.320]   All of that happened as a result of the incoming government wanting to undo what was so logically
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:29.360]   right in the first place.
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:31.040]   Part of that was to feed a media cycle.
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:35.440]   Again, I just go back to David, all of these normal people, and I know a lot of them as
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:36.440]   well.
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:37.440]   >>Corey: Speak to them, yeah.
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.440]   >>Corey: I mean, yeah.
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:42.880]   >>Corey: You guys need to just take a step back and take a beat and just think about
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.320]   something for a second.
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:51.240]   How do so many normal, high-functioning, well-intended people switch sides?
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:52.240]   How did that happen?
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:55.660]   >>Corey: Now, J. Cal, let me ask you the flip side of the coin.
[00:47:55.660 --> 00:48:02.460]   You have expressed publicly, recently, even on a podcast yesterday, with Sachs in vigorous
[00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:09.280]   debate on this show many times, reservations about Trump and the character of Trump.
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:14.200]   How do you feel ... You obviously align with the policies that he's highlighted and indicated.
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:15.200]   You've said so.
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:16.200]   >>Corey: Absolutely, yeah.
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:19.760]   >>Corey: Do you see past the person, or do you still have a strong degree of reservation
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:20.760]   about the individual?
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:25.320]   Do you see that playing out in your cohort, friends, family, what have you, that there's
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.760]   strong reservation because of the character?
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:28.760]   >>Corey: Yeah.
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:30.120]   It's a great question.
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:33.360]   I think the thing we have to do now is come together as a country.
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:34.560]   He's the president.
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:39.960]   It's great that it was not a debatable election and we're not going to have riots at the Capitol
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:42.600]   and people beating up police officers.
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:48.160]   Now it's time to actually look at what Trump said, and then we will grade him on what he
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:50.640]   actually gets done.
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:49:00.040]   If he is able to hang out with the cohort of Elon and Chamath and Sachs and J.D. Vance,
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:01.600]   I feel a lot better about it.
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:06.680]   Now there's a lot of people speculating he will turn on Chamath, he will turn on Sachs,
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:10.640]   he will turn on Elon, and that relationship will end in the next year or two.
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:11.800]   That's what I'm looking at.
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:16.040]   Will Trump actually do the things he says he's going to do?
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:17.480]   And what did he say he was going to do?
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:20.200]   Well, he's not going to have a national abortion ban.
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:24.000]   He's not going to kick people out who get college degrees here.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.240]   Remember he said on the show he's going to staple the green guard to it.
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:30.960]   But then there's other, and he said he's going to end the Ukraine, the war in Ukraine on
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:32.080]   day one.
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:37.680]   So let's make a list of all the things he promised, and like anybody else, let's judge
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:40.100]   him based on what he gets done.
[00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:44.880]   Now some of the things he promised, like the mass deportation of 15 million people, I think
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:48.600]   a lot of people even on this podcast probably don't agree with.
[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:53.520]   I don't think anybody here wants to see 15 million people who came here to have a better
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:58.800]   life and who are working hard and who are productive members of our society literally
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.400]   get dragged out of here.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:05.640]   The 500,000 that are criminals or a million, sure, nobody wants to see them get a free
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:06.880]   pass here.
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:12.360]   But there's going to be some of the items on his agenda that are going to be very uncomfortable
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.480]   to see executed, and some of them would be amazing and miracles.
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:20.620]   If he comes in and all of a sudden Ukraine war is settled, fantastic.
[00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:27.560]   If he starts dragging a million people every two or three months out of the country, that
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:33.360]   could be absolutely disastrous and incredibly hard to watch happen in America.
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:36.140]   So we've got to judge him based on his actions.
[00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:37.780]   Let's give him the support he needs.
[00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:42.900]   And I really hope, the thing that gives me hope is the fact that Sachs, Chamath, Elon,
[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:44.820]   and J.D. Vance are by his side.
[00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:48.900]   So I'm going to move on to the rest of the election, the other races.
[00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:51.800]   So the presidency, we've talked about.
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:54.000]   Let's talk about the House and the Senate, Sachs.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:00.840]   In the House, there's 37 races that have yet to be called, but it looks like the Republicans
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:04.060]   need about 12 more to be called to have a majority.
[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:05.060]   It seems very likely.
[00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:09.360]   I mean, according to Polly Market, it's 99% that the Republicans will have the majority
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:10.360]   in the House.
[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:16.120]   The Republicans have control of the Senate, and Trump is in the White House.
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:23.620]   What are the top policy items that the Republicans will pursue with this degree of legislative
[00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:25.440]   and executive control?
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:27.300]   What's number one, two, three on the list?
[00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:28.300]   What's top priority?
[00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:33.780]   And how are they kind of getting together to figure out what and how to execute those
[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:37.580]   items in the weeks and months after January 20th?
[00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:42.140]   Well, so first of all, I think the Senate majority matters a lot in terms of Trump getting
[00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:44.620]   the appointments that he wants.
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:49.360]   Because if he was just at 51, let's call it, it would be quite hard.
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:57.260]   Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski tend to be very, very moderate Republicans and would
[00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:00.780]   oppose, I think, a lot of conservative appointments.
[00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:05.860]   Trump's already at 53 senators, and there's two more that are still up for grabs and waiting
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:06.860]   to be counted.
[00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:09.660]   So you might get to 54 in the next week or so.
[00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:11.800]   It just means he's gonna have a freer range on appointments.
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:15.060]   I think that'd be really good for Bobby Kennedy.
[00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:20.780]   I think it might be harder to get Bobby Kennedy confirmed for a major cabinet post with 51,
[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:23.220]   with 53, 54, I think we get there.
[00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:26.060]   I think that's a really great thing for the country.
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:29.820]   There's other appointments in a similar vein that I think would be easier for Trump to
[00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:30.820]   get through.
[00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:36.180]   In terms of the rest of the agenda, I mean, Trump clearly does wanna end the war in Ukraine.
[00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:37.620]   Is he gonna be able to do it on day one?
[00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:38.620]   No.
[00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:43.980]   I don't think that's realistic because, frankly, the Ukrainians are not willing to make the
[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:44.980]   concessions yet.
[00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:47.540]   They're not in a place where they're willing to make a deal.
[00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:52.180]   I still think that what Trump was saying during the campaign, if you look at it as expression
[00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:56.880]   of his motivations and where his sentiments are coming from, they were good sentiments.
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:00.340]   But if he can't solve it on day one because Ukrainians don't wanna make a deal, I can't
[00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:03.580]   really fault him for that, but I think he'll try.
[00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:09.580]   I think that on Doge, there's clearly a strong desire of many in the Republican Party and
[00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:15.540]   Elon and the people that Elon brought with him for major government reform.
[00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:18.060]   Much more efficiency, much less spending.
[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:22.580]   I think that we have to get as much of that passed as possible in the first, certainly
[00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:23.580]   the first year.
[00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:28.660]   - There's a necessity for legislative action to get all the cuts in federal spending that
[00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:29.660]   they're looking to cut.
[00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:30.660]   Is that right, Zach?
[00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:33.260]   I mean, if Elon's objective is cutting a trillion dollars...
[00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:36.620]   - There might be some things you can just do through executive orders, and they should
[00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:40.540]   do as much as they can, but I think you do need some congressional action as well.
[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:46.060]   This is an area where it's just gonna be really hard because spending is a bipartisan problem,
[00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:53.620]   and it's gonna be really hard to jam through the type of deep reform that we really should
[00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:54.940]   have at the federal level.
[00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:59.000]   But I think that now there's a shot because Trump does have majorities in the House and
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.460]   Senate that he can at least get something through, so at least we have a shot at getting
[00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:04.460]   something done there.
[00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:07.620]   Are we gonna get two trillion in cuts like Elon wants?
[00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:08.620]   I would love that.
[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:12.820]   I doubt you're gonna be able to pass that through Congress, but do you start with that
[00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:17.380]   number and then work your way down to a number that you can get both parties to support?
[00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:18.740]   Maybe that's possible, hopefully.
[00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:20.780]   - I would've started with three then.
[00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:24.780]   I mean, that's just my tactic, but whatever.
[00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:31.020]   But I think reforming the bureaucracy is just such a huge theme coming out of this election,
[00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:35.340]   and we just have to figure out how to get that done, and we have the mandate.
[00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:36.340]   That's Trump's mandate.
[00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:41.260]   - And the federal government is such a large sprawling, it is the largest organization
[00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:47.740]   on earth except for maybe the CCP, and in that sense, you really have to have leverage
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:53.540]   in leadership to be able to realize that degree of action at that scale, so the cabinet positions
[00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:56.220]   matter a lot to realize that agenda.
[00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:57.700]   Is that fair to say, Chamath?
[00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:04.700]   And maybe we can talk a little bit about who are the folks in the orbit of Donald Trump
[00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:09.380]   and the transition team that are being considered for different cabinet posts?
[00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:16.140]   And as an advisor, or let's call you a theoretical advisor to the transition team, what are the
[00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:17.960]   kind of key posts that matter to you?
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:21.460]   How would you kind of advise them who to look for that could really realize the outcome
[00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:24.300]   that the mandate is dictating?
[00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:30.580]   - Well, I have no influence on this process, so I'm just totally spitballing, but people
[00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:38.580]   who I think are excellent, I'm gonna put Bobby Kennedy right at the top of the list.
[00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:45.320]   I think that Bobby has an opportunity to allow the transparency of information that will
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:53.000]   allow folks to keep doing what we've done or to change course in a way that right now
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.900]   I think is a little bit more difficult than it needs to be.
[00:55:56.900 --> 00:56:00.880]   I think Vivek Ramaswamy is indefatigable.
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:08.200]   I think he's a, if you remember back to the Republican primaries, there was only one person
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:10.280]   that did not attack Donald Trump, and it was Vivek.
[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:16.120]   I think he believed in what Donald Trump was doing and was willing to sort of embrace and
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:17.840]   extend this idea.
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:19.440]   So I think he'd be a really good proxy.
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:23.000]   I don't know what role that looks like, but I just think that he would be exceptional.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.520]   - Maybe amazing.
[00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:27.640]   There's some rumors that he's gonna run for governor of Ohio, but he'd be amazing in the
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:28.640]   federal government.
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:29.640]   Tulsi Gabbard.
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:30.640]   We gotta get Tulsi in there.
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:31.640]   - Tulsi Gabbard, yeah.
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:36.520]   Yeah, just to go through the list, I think Tulsi Gabbard is so awesome.
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:37.520]   - For what role?
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:38.520]   What would you put her in?
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:45.720]   - The rumor is veteran affairs, but hopefully it's at least that.
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:46.720]   - That's a cabinet position, right?
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:47.720]   Just for those who...
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:48.720]   - Yeah.
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:51.200]   You know, there's another race that's going on that's really below the surface but is
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:55.360]   extremely important, and that is the new Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell.
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:57.360]   Mitch McConnell says he's stepping aside.
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:58.360]   There's two major candidates.
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:56:59.920]   - It's John Thune versus Mike Lee, yeah.
[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:06.300]   - Well, it's John Thune versus Cornyn from Texas, and Mike Lee has been sort of agitating.
[00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:09.020]   It's not clear that Mike Lee will throw his hat in the ring.
[00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:11.660]   If he did, I would be all in favor of it.
[00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:16.500]   If Mike Lee, who is from Utah, doesn't, we should really go with whoever he recommends.
[00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:22.340]   I really trust that Mike Lee will represent the MAGA agenda, whereas quite frankly, the
[00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:25.740]   other candidates will be a continuation of Mitch.
[00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:28.860]   And this is Trump's moment to weigh in on that.
[00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:31.220]   He's basking in the glow right now.
[00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:33.860]   He is in the winner's circle.
[00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:37.740]   He can get anything through the Republican caucus.
[00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:42.060]   And I think that he could weigh in right now in the Senate Majority race and make sure
[00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:44.220]   the right person gets it.
[00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:48.360]   If you get a continuation of Mitch McConnell, you will not get real reform through the Senate.
[00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:50.100]   Look at what happened during Trump won.
[00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:53.820]   Mitch McConnell was one of Trump's biggest opponents.
[00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:57.660]   So there would be alternatives, but I think Trump would have to step in and act.
[00:57:57.660 --> 00:58:00.500]   There's some talk about Rick Scott from Florida being a candidate.
[00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:03.580]   I think he'd be very good if he's still in the race.
[00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:06.940]   Or just go right over the top and go with a Mike Lee.
[00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:10.340]   This is your moment to basically put in a loyalist.
[00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:14.740]   And then the big cabinet positions that are left, I think defense, probably somebody like
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:21.900]   Rick Grinnell, who's already worked for Trump and was the DNI right at the end, I think.
[00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:28.580]   And then in Treasury, it's, you know, I think people say it's between Scott Besant and John
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:29.580]   Paulson.
[00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:31.060]   I'm not so sure.
[00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:32.060]   I don't know.
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:33.060]   I don't remember.
[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:34.060]   I think it's like probably Haskell.
[00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:37.460]   But then, you know, I saw like you saw Jerome Powell, Jerome Powell this morning said he
[00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:40.620]   would not step aside if asked to resign by Donald Trump.
[00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:42.140]   No, he's got two more years.
[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:43.580]   So he's got until 26.
[00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:44.580]   He's got until mid 26.
[00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:47.500]   So, you know, I mean, the room, I don't want to say too much, but I think this is pretty
[00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:48.500]   much out there.
[00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:50.420]   I think we're now one state, not defense.
[00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:52.420]   I think that it's not to say he's going to get it.
[00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:53.420]   I don't know.
[00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:55.940]   But that's been out there for a long time.
[00:58:55.940 --> 00:59:00.900]   I think that what a lot of people in let's call it the MAGA movement, the America First
[00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:09.340]   movement are going to be looking at very closely is do neocons worm their way into this administration.
[00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:10.900]   Look at what happened during Trump one.
[00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:15.560]   He ran in opposition to forever wars, I think was a major part of his appeal.
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:18.060]   It's what allowed him to shatter the Bush dynasty.
[00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:22.300]   It's what I think really hurt Kamala in terms of having the Chinese embrace her.
[00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:28.140]   So it's a major part of his, I'd say, not just appeal, but also his legacy that he will
[00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:29.640]   not continue forever wars.
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:36.620]   But the problem is that the blob keeps infiltrating Trump administration, or they did, they infiltrated
[00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:42.860]   Trump one by putting in John Bolton and Esper and all these guys who frankly betrayed Trump.
[00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:46.900]   So I think a lot of people are looking closely at will neocons be able to worm their way
[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:47.900]   into this administration.
[00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:51.840]   And if they do, it's a very, it would be very, very sad, I think.
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:56.840]   The difference this time around, which is so incredible, is that you're now seeing on
[00:59:56.840 --> 01:00:02.660]   X people asking all the neocons to be named and shamed, and they're creating these lists
[01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:04.320]   so that they can't worm their way in.
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:09.760]   It's the most incredible thing I've ever seen, where have you espoused those views in the
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:10.760]   past?
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:17.340]   If so, the likelihood that somebody will raise an alarm bell now so that you can't get near
[01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:21.320]   this administration, I've never seen anything like that before, actually.
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:22.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:23.320]   And you know what?
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:25.760]   Here's the great danger is you look at the last few months, okay?
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:26.960]   Who was there for Trump?
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.600]   It was people like Elon.
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:34.720]   It was basically all of us who worked, and look, I'm a very minor, minor figure, but
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:37.880]   I did my little part and there were a lot of other people on the ground doing their
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:38.880]   thing.
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:39.880]   But where is Elon today?
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:41.840]   Elon had to fly home for a Tesla board meeting.
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.520]   He's got real companies to run.
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.760]   And who all of a sudden shows up in Mar-a-Lago?
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.160]   The swamp creatures.
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.560]   They were nowhere to be found for the last three months.
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:53.800]   Now the swamp creatures come crawling out, and they're gonna be swarming Mar-a-Lago and
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:56.160]   trying to worm their way into the administration.
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:01.760]   And that's the issue is we gotta keep, you know, this is where I hope that all the MAGA
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:06.160]   influencers stay frosty and stay involved.
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:11.840]   We have to consolidate this victory and get reform type people in the administration,
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:14.920]   not just the usual type people from Washington.
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:15.920]   Would you serve if asked?
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:16.920]   Would you consider it?
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:17.920]   No.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:21.120]   I mean, look, I've already said before I'm the key man at Kraft, I can't do that.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:24.520]   But, you know, look, I would do something part-time, meaning if it wasn't a full-time
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:29.560]   job, if I didn't have to leave my current job, if it was just serving on some advisory
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:33.740]   committee or something that was compatible with my current job, I would do that.
[01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:34.740]   That's a no-brainer.
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:35.740]   I would love to.
[01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:36.740]   What about you, Chris?
[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:37.740]   Absolutely.
[01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:41.360]   Not full-time because I'm running a company, but if there was the opportunity to help basically-
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:44.280]   Just put me on the DOJ committee, Sax, if you wouldn't mind.
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:48.200]   I just want to go like line item by line item in one afternoon, and I'm out of there.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.200]   Like I'm just gonna go in-
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:53.560]   Elon did say this today, but he said the A-team are running companies.
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:55.100]   We're all running companies.
[01:01:55.100 --> 01:02:01.320]   But if asked to serve, especially in a part-time capacity where you don't have to divest everything
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:05.180]   you own and you can actually just go and call bullsh*t and actually just make sure good
[01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:09.360]   decisions get made, it would be an honor to serve in that capacity.
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:11.280]   I think everybody should have given a chance.
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:13.080]   I want to say one thing just to build on Sax.
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:14.080]   Oh, sorry.
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.080]   Yeah.
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:16.080]   And then I want to ask you one more question, Chamath.
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:17.080]   Go ahead.
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:22.560]   I want to give a shout out to Elon in one very specific way.
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:27.880]   You've heard all these stories where he gets obsessed about something and then he focuses
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:35.960]   on it at the sake of everything else and strips it down and gets to first principles, rebuilds
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:38.740]   it back up, and it works.
[01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:45.420]   As far as I can tell, basically when he decided that this election was going to come down
[01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:55.920]   to Pennsylvania on one hand and young men on the other, he just kept doing that one
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:00.400]   thing over and over and over again.
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:04.480]   Every time you turned on X, he was doing a rally.
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:05.480]   Crazy.
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:08.960]   He was speaking to the residents of Pennsylvania and/or-
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:09.960]   Yeah.
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:10.960]   He spent like two weeks there.
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:13.580]   getting them out.
[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:21.020]   And then his PAC built an infrastructure that rivaled the democratic infrastructure in terms
[01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:23.060]   of get out the vote and transportation-
[01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:24.060]   With less money.
[01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:27.100]   With a lot less money and only in a month or two.
[01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:28.100]   It is incredible.
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:31.340]   Well, and then the sweepstakes was also a really good idea.
[01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:32.740]   It's really incredible.
[01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:33.740]   It's really, really incredible.
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:36.380]   And there was a lot of controversy around the sweepstakes idea.
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:39.940]   I don't know why that was so controversial because if you think about-
[01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:44.260]   It was the media trying to make an issue that was a nothing burger a burger.
[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:45.260]   Yeah.
[01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:46.260]   And so, I think this is where-
[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:50.580]   It was dismissed on its face because if any person spent eight seconds understanding the
[01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:54.060]   law, the judge dismissed it within an hour.
[01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:59.140]   So, if we look at that million dollar sweepstakes to sign up for his PAC, if you think about
[01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:04.680]   how people normally get people to sign up, they're paying a dollar a click, probably
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:09.540]   $50 a click, whatever it is, using giving money to ABC or giving money to Facebook.
[01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:11.500]   And he just said, "Hey, I'll just do a sweepstakes.
[01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:16.220]   Sign up for this and then I have you in the database and then I can market it to you."
[01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:19.820]   There's no difference between giving away a million dollar sweepstakes or buying a bunch
[01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:21.660]   of ads and paying by click.
[01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:26.780]   And for everybody to frame that as he's buying votes when it was so clear he wasn't, I think
[01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:31.180]   that's the kind of media manipulation people are getting savvy to and does not work anymore.
[01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:32.180]   It was very clear.
[01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:34.620]   It was just a sweepstakes to sign up for his PAC.
[01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:38.500]   It's no different than paying $10 a click to Facebook.
[01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:43.180]   When the legal infrastructure of America dismisses a case on its face within 60 minutes of it
[01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:45.660]   being heard, it means it is a farce.
[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:46.660]   Yeah.
[01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:53.580]   I mean, look, I think what Elon showed is that a smart person can come in who basically,
[01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:58.140]   like you said, can go into demon mode, has a startup or innovation mentality, is willing
[01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:03.380]   to spend money but wants to do it smartly, but is really hardcore, can come in and beat
[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:05.820]   the supposed professionals of their own game.
[01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:09.980]   I think one of the big stories that's going to come out, there's already some tea being
[01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:15.620]   spilt within Democratic circles about Jen O'Malley Dillon, who was the campaign manager
[01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:18.740]   that Kamala Harris inherited from Biden.
[01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:20.660]   She had a billion dollars to spend.
[01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:21.660]   A billion dollars.
[01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:24.260]   The campaign still ended $20 million in debt.
[01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:25.260]   In debt.
[01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:26.260]   And this at least has been reported.
[01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:27.260]   Where'd the money go?
[01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:28.260]   So, well, I'll tell you.
[01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:31.260]   The money went to expensive consultants.
[01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:33.580]   They did overly elaborate staged events.
[01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:36.420]   They did these like fake concerts, celebrity cameos.
[01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:40.700]   Supposedly they paid Beyonce $10 million and they didn't even get a song out of it and
[01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:41.700]   that ended up pissing people off.
[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:42.700]   She got paid?
[01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:43.700]   They were paying celebrities?
[01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:44.700]   I don't know.
[01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:45.700]   I don't know if that's true.
[01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:48.540]   I just read it in a tweet, so I can't say for sure, but that's what I read.
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:49.540]   Yeah.
[01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:50.540]   But who knows?
[01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:51.540]   It sounds suspect.
[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:58.100]   The point is, they spent a lot of money on the consultants and, you know, the events.
[01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:00.940]   And Elon went after the Amish, you know?
[01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:02.420]   That's like a lot smarter.
[01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:06.420]   The person on the Democratic side where I feel the most disappointment after all of
[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:10.780]   this is Barack Obama.
[01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:17.980]   I think he, in the period when he was elected, to me was just transcended.
[01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:25.940]   And I thought that this is a person that really was immune to getting assimilated into the
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:26.940]   board.
[01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:30.620]   And I don't know why I thought that, but I did think that.
[01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:37.500]   And I was just so saddened to see the tone and the rhetoric from Barack Obama during
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:39.380]   this last home stretch.
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:42.940]   It, I think, was reputationally very damaging to him.
[01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:45.420]   What did he say that offended you?
[01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:46.420]   It was less about it.
[01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:47.420]   It didn't offend me.
[01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:48.420]   I was just observing.
[01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:49.420]   Or disappointed.
[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:55.020]   The, when the rhetoric was, you know, trying to propagate these lies, the very fine people
[01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:58.220]   hoax, all of these things, I just thought he's so much smarter than this.
[01:06:58.220 --> 01:06:59.500]   The abortion ban.
[01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:00.500]   The abortion ban.
[01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:02.100]   He knows that these things are not true.
[01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:05.540]   Why is he saying objective lies?
[01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:10.900]   I don't really judge politicians for doing it in general, but I never considered him
[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:11.900]   a politician.
[01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:16.300]   I sort of considered him here, just like this echelon above.
[01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:20.140]   And I was, I was really disappointed that he chose to go down that path.
[01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:22.220]   Yeah, well, I could definitely add to that.
[01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:27.460]   I mean, look, I think Obama's whole mystique was that he transcended politics and he tried
[01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:32.580]   to maintain that position of being above the fray and let the grubby business of politics
[01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:33.780]   be beneath him.
[01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:38.420]   And even during the whole coup against Biden, I mean, they say that Obama signed off.
[01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:44.140]   He was basically in favor of the switcheroo to Harris, but he was the last person to endorse
[01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:45.140]   it.
[01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:48.220]   He was never to be seen as doing the dirty work that was left to Nancy Pelosi.
[01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:54.480]   But there's no question that the switcheroo, I think, was backed by Obama.
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:58.100]   And then he did everything he could to problem Harris, including using the very fine people
[01:07:58.100 --> 01:07:59.700]   hoax telling these lies.
[01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:03.900]   And I agree, Chamath, I think that he has diminished himself.
[01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:06.220]   He's brought himself now down to the level of politics.
[01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:08.340]   Down to the level of an average politician.
[01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:09.340]   Right.
[01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:12.660]   I think probably you're disappointed because you had such a high benchmark for him.
[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:17.260]   But we were just talking about Trump saying he would end the war on day one.
[01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:20.980]   He said that he's going to deport 15 million people.
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:23.100]   And you know, all these politicians lie.
[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:29.820]   So I think my closing statement on all of this is y'all were a key part in putting Trump
[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:32.420]   in, obviously.
[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:37.400]   And if he starts behaving in the way he behaved during his first term, the darker things he
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:42.620]   did, I hope that y'all will call him on it and publicly call him on it and that he will
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:44.980]   steer towards, you know, his better angels.
[01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:49.500]   And that's my hope for America and my hope for all of you who helped put him in office
[01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:51.900]   and played a very significant role in getting him here.
[01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:56.260]   When he does something crazy, if he does try to drag 15 million people out of the country,
[01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:58.260]   is that OK with you, Sax?
[01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:01.900]   Well, you said that he would start with a million people, 500,000 to a million who are
[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:03.020]   clear criminals.
[01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:04.020]   He should do that.
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:05.020]   I hope he does that.
[01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:06.020]   Well, that's what J.D. Vance said and we all agree on that.
[01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:07.020]   Yeah.
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:08.020]   J.D. said that the way you deport...
[01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:09.020]   What about the other 14?
[01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:11.740]   He said that the way that you do deportations is the same way you eat an elephant.
[01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:12.740]   You do it one bite at a time.
[01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:13.740]   A sandwich.
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:14.740]   You eat a sandwich.
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:17.340]   So the way you eat an elephant is you do it one bite at a time.
[01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:20.540]   Let's start with the biggest criminals, the biggest people who shouldn't be here, and
[01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:22.540]   then let's see what happens after that.
[01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:23.540]   And look...
[01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:26.980]   If he went after the other 14 million, would you be in support of that?
[01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:27.980]   We haven't gotten there yet.
[01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:30.940]   The point is you take the first bite of the sandwich, then you talk about the second bite.
[01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:34.900]   But there was a line from the 2016 election about Trump that I think was attributed to
[01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:38.940]   Peter Thiel, which is very important, which is that Trump should be taken seriously but
[01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:41.220]   not literally.
[01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:45.580]   Because when he expresses a policy or a point of view, he sells it.
[01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:49.900]   So when he says, "I'm going to end the Ukraine war on day one," does that mean he's literally
[01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:50.900]   going to do it on day one?
[01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:51.900]   No.
[01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:54.740]   What it means is he's going to try really hard to end the Ukraine war.
[01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:59.500]   If he does it on day 365 of his presidency instead of day one, I'm not going to come
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:00.500]   out and say, "He lied.
[01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:01.500]   He didn't do what he said."
[01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:02.500]   No.
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:03.500]   I'm going to say, "He got the job done.
[01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:04.940]   He did what he said he was going to do."
[01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:08.260]   So I think it's very important to judge him in that way.
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:12.660]   When he says, "I'm going to deport 15 million people," do I expect him to do all 15 million?
[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:13.660]   Not necessarily.
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:18.420]   But if he closes the border, builds the wall, seals it so it's no longer a problem, and
[01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:22.900]   deports 500,000 to a million hardcore criminals out of this country, I'm going to say that
[01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:24.540]   was a massive success.
[01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:25.540]   And you know what's going to happen?
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:29.180]   The legacy media is going to say, "Well, he lied because he didn't deport the other 14.2
[01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:30.180]   million."
[01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:31.180]   Come on.
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:35.220]   Let's understand the difference between campaigning and governing.
[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:39.780]   I agree with all that, and I do think if he does try to do the 14 million, that's the
[01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:41.060]   thing I have concerns about.
[01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:42.060]   Got it.
[01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:43.060]   Okay.
[01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:44.060]   Friedberg, over to you.
[01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:45.060]   So let's talk about the cabinet positions.
[01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:49.540]   Chamath, a guy like RFK Jr. has never held an executive position before.
[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:55.220]   You and others on this panel, Sachs, J-Cal, myself, we've all kind of managed large groups
[01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:56.220]   of people.
[01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:59.280]   We've all been in positions of being a CEO of a business.
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:02.820]   You talk a lot about bringing in the outsiders, and the Trump campaign talks a lot about bringing
[01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:07.700]   in these outsiders, Sachs begrudgingly highlights the swamp creatures emerging to ask for those
[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:12.980]   slots in those positions because they are lifelong politicians and bureaucrats.
[01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:16.940]   How do we have trust and faith, or do you think that that's the whole point, is that
[01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:20.780]   you have folks that don't have the experience to run these organizations, that don't have
[01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:24.700]   the insights on who actually works there, on how they operate, and them coming in is
[01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:28.900]   going to provide enough of a fresh perspective and f**k things up enough that that's exactly
[01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:30.260]   the point.
[01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:35.260]   And talk a little bit about bringing in outsiders, but outsiders that can be effective in transforming
[01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:40.780]   these government agencies, not just blowing them up, or is the goal to blow them up?
[01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:45.380]   No, again, I would just temper and tone down that rhetoric.
[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:47.100]   Nobody's blowing up anything.
[01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:52.920]   But I think step one is going to be a level of transparency so that doing the obvious
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:55.020]   becomes obvious.
[01:11:55.020 --> 01:12:00.100]   And I think that if you look back over 40 or 50 years, what has happened is that secretaries
[01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:04.740]   and political appointments have gone from, "Get the best person in the job because they
[01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:08.460]   know it," to, "Here's political payola," if you will.
[01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:12.780]   And I think the pendulum has swung to too far of an extreme.
[01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:17.620]   That's why the swamp people are able to maintain control, because the person above them who's
[01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:21.820]   appointed doesn't fundamentally know the inner workings of the organization.
[01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:26.940]   I suspect what you're going to see is a radical push to transparency.
[01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:30.580]   And I think that when you combine transparency, and Sachs called for this, a version of the
[01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:34.820]   Twitter files for the government, I do think you're going to see that.
[01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:41.180]   But if you combine that push to transparency with a handful of topics, by the way, we introduced
[01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:45.860]   a long time ago this idea of zero-based budgeting into the lexicon and language of these political
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:51.540]   candidates that they used all the way through to the finish line, I do believe the Republicans
[01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:53.440]   earnestly mean it.
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:56.400]   And so I think when you put these two things together, Freeberg, I think what you will
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:02.540]   have is all of this laid bare, and then I think it'll start a debate on what to do.
[01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:08.400]   And I think the decisions about what to do will be so blindingly obvious.
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:13.160]   The low-hanging fruit will save this country once we pluck it.
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:18.440]   Can I just say a word about, I think it's so important for Bobby Kennedy to be confirmed
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:21.640]   in whatever cabinet position that he's going to get.
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:25.560]   Number one, you know, we look back at the campaign now and it seems obvious that Trump
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:26.560]   was going to win it.
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:31.280]   But at the time that Bobby Kennedy came on board, that was a major factor in shifting
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:33.480]   momentum towards Trump.
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:34.600]   So that's number one.
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:40.080]   Number two, we need to keep Bobby Kennedy's coalition as part of our movement.
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:42.880]   It's not just about what he did in this last election.
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:47.360]   It's keeping all of those people, those young people and those former Democrats on side
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:50.160]   and part of the Republican Party and the MAGA movement.
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:55.720]   And number three, he's genuinely going to reform that huge part of the bureaucracy.
[01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:56.760]   And that's extremely important.
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:59.800]   And we need outsiders to come in and shake things up.
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:01.880]   He's right about the regulatory capture.
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:06.440]   He's right about the marriage of state power and corporate greed.
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:10.320]   Let's have someone go in there who's got fresh eyes but also understands how the bureaucracy
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:13.520]   works because he's litigated and shake things up.
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:18.400]   If you look at what Bobby posted to Instagram, Nick, I don't know if you can find it, but
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:24.440]   it was pretty telling on this dimension of the first inning is going to be about absolute
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:29.920]   radical transparency and sharing with the American people everything that's been under
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:30.920]   the covers.
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:34.200]   By the way, it's not just on that dimension, right?
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:36.400]   We're going to see the Epstein files.
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:38.040]   We're going to see the Diddy lists.
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:39.320]   We're going to see the JFK file.
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:44.160]   I know that these things are sort of fringe conspiracy theory type things for some people.
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:49.840]   But the point is from pillar to post, that first phase of this radical truth seeking
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:54.760]   transparency is an incredible disinfectant that you can build from.
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:58.440]   And he told the FDA, I think something to the effect of pack your bags and keep your
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:14:59.440]   records.
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:04.360]   Now let's take the hyperbolic part of it out, but it's the keep your records part that should
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:08.040]   be valuable because we deserve to have answers.
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:14.160]   Now when you think at the same time that you have inventions like AI that can crunch every
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:18.640]   single piece of data under the sun and tell you the absolute truth, imagine when you put
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:24.800]   transparency and the government sharing incredible amounts of information with the compute power
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:30.160]   that the Googles and the Facebooks and the open a eyes of the world are creating.
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:34.920]   You'll know these answers to all of these questions, vaccines, are they good or bad?
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:35.920]   When?
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:36.920]   How?
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:37.920]   Are they good or bad?
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:38.920]   When?
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:39.920]   How?
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:40.920]   All of these drugs that have been approved.
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:41.920]   Why?
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:42.920]   All of these drugs that have not been approved.
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:43.920]   Why?
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:46.040]   You're going to start to see some really interesting things.
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:49.720]   Has there been research on the impacts of food on physiology?
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:50.720]   Were they suppressed?
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:51.720]   Were they not suppressed?
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:56.520]   So I think phase one is get it all out into the open.
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:57.520]   -Totally.
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:01.860]   And what I said, just what Chamath referred to is, yeah, I said we should do a Twitter
[01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:04.120]   files for the whole federal government.
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:10.200]   Because what I meant by that is remember before Elon bought Twitter, they told us for years
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:15.400]   that the idea that Twitter was shadow baiting conservatives and engaging in censorship was
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:17.200]   a conspiracy theory.
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:21.340]   Then Elon opened up the Twitter files and we saw that it was all true.
[01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:24.720]   And moreover, that the government was engaged in censorship.
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:27.880]   They had been working hand in glove with the trust and safety department.
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:28.880]   -And the FBI had logins.
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:30.360]   They could just go in themselves.
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:31.360]   I mean, it's crazy.
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:35.360]   -And the FBI had their own tool called Teleport, which would allow them to transmit secret
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:39.120]   instructions to the trust and safety team at Twitter, and they were censoring based
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:40.760]   on those instructions.
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:41.760]   That's completely unacceptable.
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:43.260]   Twitter management lied about it.
[01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:44.520]   The government lied about it.
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:46.840]   We only found out through the Twitter files.
[01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:49.400]   Let's do a Twitter files for the federal government.
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:51.040]   What do you think we're going to find out?
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.240]   What do you think we would find out about COVID?
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:55.000]   What do you think really happened there?
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.040]   If Bobby Kennedy can do that, the lies they told us.
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:03.720]   -The incompleteness of the actual clinical validation studies, the authorizations and
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:06.200]   the waivers that were secured.
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:08.960]   How good or how brittle or how fragile was that data?
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:14.440]   By the way, I think what it'll also do, Freeberg, is if it looks like this data is actually
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:17.800]   of extreme high quality, you know what that does?
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:21.840]   It reestablishes trust in that institution, which is also a win.
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:23.320]   So this whole thing is a win-win.
[01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:27.960]   -Well, and let's not forget the FOIA leader.
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:34.560]   They were literally being taught how to route around, Fauci's team, how to route around
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:37.140]   subpoenas and people looking for information.
[01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:39.220]   I mean, there's a lot to uncover here.
[01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:40.720]   I'm 100% here for it.
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:41.720]   Yeah.
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:45.440]   -So just to be clear, there's a law in the United States called the Freedom of Information
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:46.440]   Act.
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:51.800]   The FOIA is kind of a common term, and it gives the power and authority to individual
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:56.520]   citizens and third-party agencies to have a check and balance on the federal government
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:18:00.480]   that they can go in, they can request actual data, actual files.
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:06.800]   And it is all necessarily available to the public at any time, except for classified
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:07.800]   information.
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:08.800]   -Okay.
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:10.480]   Well, the federal government now over-classifies everything.
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:13.180]   We have something like, what, like a billion classified documents?
[01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:14.880]   They literally classify everything.
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:19.880]   -So through the FOIA process, third-party lawyers and nonprofits have made requests
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:23.300]   to federal agencies to get access to this sort of information.
[01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:24.300]   And I've done it.
[01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:27.880]   I don't know if you guys have ever used FOIA powers for information from the federal government.
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:32.680]   I had to do FOIA requests 10 years ago to get weather data, or 15 years ago, for my
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:33.680]   startup Climate.
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:36.440]   It was the only way we were able to get access to a bunch of weather data was through FOIA
[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:37.440]   requests.
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:41.200]   And then we were able to use that data in our services, because it is public data.
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:43.680]   The taxpayers pay for it, so we had a right to it.
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:49.320]   Similarly, you can make FOIA requests of emails and interagency communications and so on.
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:54.280]   But, Sax, I think it seems, and J. Cal, to your point about the FOIA lady, there may,
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:59.320]   over time, have been some degree of corruption of the FOIA process in all of these agencies,
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:03.360]   which has made it more difficult for individuals and third parties to have the appropriate
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:07.640]   checks and balances on the data in these agencies, because of the way they've kind of obfuscated
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:09.520]   access, slowed down the process.
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:12.720]   Sometimes it takes months for them to respond to you, and it's become quite difficult.
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:16.880]   So the FOIA, the intention of the Freedom of Information Act may have been hindered
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:18.520]   by the bureaucracy.
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:19.520]   This will not be through FOIA.
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:21.160]   Let me make one other suggestion.
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:26.240]   We need a massive declassification effort of the federal government.
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:30.340]   Maybe this is the way to actually implement the Twitter Files strategy.
[01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:34.000]   The problem is we have a massive over-classification problem.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.920]   Billions of documents have been classified at the federal government.
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:37.920]   Why?
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:40.800]   Because those bureaucracies know that they can kind of do whatever they want and kind
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:44.720]   of work in peace without having to disclose what they're really doing if they just mark
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:47.360]   classified on a document.
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:50.760]   Someone needs to go through that and start massively declassifying.
[01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:54.720]   If they do that, then there'll be a lot more documents available to FOIA requests.
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:56.320]   So that right there would be a huge help.
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:59.280]   And then, like you said, the FOIA process could be tightened up.
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:00.280]   It could be a lot faster.
[01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:02.360]   It could be a lot easier.
[01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:05.720]   And they should not be able to circumvent it by doing the kind of stuff that J-Cal referred
[01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:11.840]   to during COVID, where they were like deliberately misspelling words so that they wouldn't show
[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:12.840]   up.
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:15.160]   Yeah, they were putting asterisks in, you know, hacker speak in order to avoid this.
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:20.840]   And they were also told, a bunch of people who are in three-letter agencies, just by
[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:27.280]   default put this at the highest level of security not to be declassified.
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:30.840]   So they unnecessarily put everything in classified.
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:37.040]   And so now every document, every email is marked at the highest level of classification,
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.840]   which means there's no discerning it.
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:42.320]   And if you were to blame an FBI agent, if they told you, hey, just put everything on
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:46.720]   classified so it doesn't get out, okay, that seems like a pretty good way to cover your
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:47.840]   ass.
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:48.840]   And that's got to change.
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:49.840]   Yeah.
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:51.760]   Well, a lot to come in the weeks ahead.
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:55.120]   I'm sure we will do more updates as the cabinet positions or the nominees get announced.
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:56.120]   Where do you sit, Brian?
[01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:57.120]   You're a man of science.
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:59.480]   I know you have some differences with RFK.
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:00.480]   Do you want to see him?
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:03.960]   I have very deep trepidation about RFK having oversight.
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:09.640]   I think the authority might be limited with respect to the legislative authority that's
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:12.120]   vested by the Congress, which is the one piece.
[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:17.080]   Look, I mean, as you guys know, there's a lot that RFK brings up that I very that resonates
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:18.080]   with me.
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:19.160]   I'm not a black and white guy.
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:21.760]   So there are things that he says that make a lot of sense.
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:25.840]   There are things I've pointed out, particularly around microplastics in the environment, particularly
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:29.560]   around chemistry that we use in our food and our systems of food and production.
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:35.160]   And I believe very strongly that we have real issues that have, you know, compounding effects
[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:36.160]   on our health.
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:39.200]   So let me not be too flippant about that.
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:42.680]   I'm not a all vaccines are always good all the time person.
[01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:45.560]   I think that every one of them needs to be studied on the merits and the risks.
[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:48.440]   I think fluoride is an interesting conversation to have.
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:49.440]   What are the merits?
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:50.440]   What are the risks?
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:54.280]   And why is it a federal why is there a federal authority over fluoride and water, which,
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:55.280]   by the way, there isn't.
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:59.240]   It's it's all local municipalities get to decide on a nuanced basis, then net net.
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:00.240]   Where do you wind up, Freeberg?
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:01.240]   Net net.
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:02.240]   Where do you wind up?
[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:04.400]   I will say that there are a number of things that RFK have said that that caused me a lot
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:08.760]   of trouble that I'm very troubled by, because I think that he has said things that are factually
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:13.960]   wrong and I want him to be open to debate and open to review of objective truth.
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:14.960]   And that's it.
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:15.960]   And that's it.
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:22.240]   And as long as you like him as a disinfectant, as a rabble rouser, as to shake up the system
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:24.920]   or net net, do you think it's too risky to let him in?
[01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:27.840]   Generally, I think all these systems should be challenged 100 percent.
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:29.520]   So you want to send him in?
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:31.640]   You say you want him to be open to debate.
[01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:37.560]   I personally never seen a candidate for office has been more open to discourse debate interviews
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:39.000]   than Bobby Kennedy's done.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.000]   Everything he's done on the show twice.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000]   I'm not classifying him.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000]   Otherwise, I'm not.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:48.640]   You know, who is not open to debate and discourse and transparency is a bureaucracy.
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:49.640]   That's the problem.
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:52.480]   If you want government reform, you have to get into the bureaucracy.
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:54.280]   You need outsiders to come in.
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:56.000]   You make it transparent.
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.000]   You got to declassify.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.280]   That's what you got to do.
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:05.320]   One of the most important aspects of science, not the recently legacy media or jokingly
[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:11.120]   definition of quote quote science, but science is meant to be a process of skepticism, interrogation
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:15.160]   and the search for objective truth, which means that you should be constantly questioning
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:17.040]   whether you are right or wrong.
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:21.040]   And I do think that that is a necessary part of the process of science.
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:23.480]   Science is not meant to be a dictatorial regime.
[01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:29.040]   And so I think that resetting the framework for how we operate some of the agencies and
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:34.000]   authorities that are supposed to be rooted in science, to have the necessary process
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:41.040]   of skepticism, review and transparency into that, I think will reassert faith and reassert
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:44.120]   trust by the public in how these agencies are operating.
[01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:45.440]   And I hope that that happens.
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:46.440]   I really do.
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:50.280]   Because I do think there are very good people in all these agencies who do very good work.
[01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:53.400]   And there's a lot of very important advances that have come out of the United States of
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:57.400]   America and have gone through processes through the federal government that have actually
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:00.440]   done really great things for Americans and for humanity.
[01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:04.480]   And so I don't want us to dismiss things as being whimsical bureaucracies that don't have
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:05.720]   any rooting in science.
[01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:08.800]   But I do think that it's important to have this degree of skepticism and process and
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:09.800]   have transparency.
[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:10.800]   So that's all.
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:11.800]   Well,
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:16.720]   I'd like you to show me in the Constitution, where the bureaucracy or the administrative
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:19.040]   state is a branch of the government.
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:24.640]   I see in the Constitution, that we are supposed to be ruled by an executive branch, a legislative
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:27.540]   branch, and a judicial branch.
[01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:29.720]   I do not see an administrative branch.
[01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:34.840]   That has sprung into existence over the last several decades.
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:36.440]   And it rules us.
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:38.880]   There's roughly 3 million people who work for the federal government.
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:43.960]   Of those, the president basically appoints 3,000, and it takes forever to get them through.
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:48.000]   So we have roughly 3 million people who don't report to anyone.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.880]   Nominally, they're supposed to report to the executive branch, but the president can't
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:52.880]   fire him.
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:57.320]   We talked about on a previous show, if Elon had gone into Twitter and he hadn't been allowed
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:01.320]   to fire anyone, do you think he could have restored free speech to Twitter?
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:02.320]   Of course not.
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:04.760]   They just would have kept doing whatever they wanted to do.
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:08.000]   And that is the big problem in the federal government right now, is we are ruled by a
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:13.040]   fourth branch of government that is not in the Constitution, that doesn't report to anybody.
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:15.380]   It is not subject to elections.
[01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:18.220]   We can't vote them out, and we can't fire them.
[01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:23.300]   And they have been in the forefront of trying to stop Trump and the larger reform movement
[01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:24.780]   that he represents.
[01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:29.740]   Ever since Trump got elected in 2016, remember, it was members of the administrative states,
[01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:32.740]   specifically the security state, who said, "Don't worry, we're gonna be the insurance
[01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:34.700]   policy against Trump."
[01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:39.580]   And they have done everything possible through the Russiagate hoax, through lawfare, through
[01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:44.980]   the whole Steele dossier hoax, to basically try and stop Trump and the reform movement
[01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:45.980]   that he represents.
[01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:50.340]   And the big question of Trump's second term will be whether he can finally subdue this
[01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:54.900]   bureaucracy and bring it under Democratic control, under the control of the executive
[01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:59.460]   branch as the American people want, and as I think the Constitution intended.
[01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:02.940]   Right now, we are run by an unelected branch of government that has to stop.
[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:08.460]   And what Trump represents is not dictatorship, but democracy, the triumph of democracy over
[01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:09.460]   this bureaucracy.
[01:26:09.460 --> 01:26:19.140]   And a big important moment for this movement, this return to the fundamentals of what was
[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:24.780]   vested in the Constitution, is the Chevron Doctrine case at the Supreme Court earlier
[01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:25.960]   this year.
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:31.320]   It reversed the authority for agencies to create their own rules and regulations that
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:33.900]   they can then enforce on private enterprise.
[01:26:33.900 --> 01:26:41.420]   And if that case carries through and is allowed to be used to support the efforts to deregulate
[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:46.820]   or to de-agency what you call kind of the bureaucracy, I think it enables a lot of the
[01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:49.180]   change that folks are looking for.
[01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:54.500]   Why should, for example, some commission be sprung out of, you know, some assembly being
[01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:57.940]   created, and then that commission gets to create their own rules and their own regulations
[01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:02.700]   that effectively are law, that prevent private citizens and enterprises from being able to
[01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:04.140]   operate and make decisions.
[01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:09.260]   And I think that was a very important moment for this movement, was the Supreme Court case
[01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:10.740]   on the Chevron Doctrine earlier this year.
[01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:12.820]   I don't know if you agree with me on this, Sax, but it seems like it's gonna be...
[01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:13.820]   - 100%.
[01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:14.820]   No, I totally agree.
[01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:16.660]   I think that was an absolute precursor, which is, it was insane.
[01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:21.980]   I mean, again, you had a Supreme Court ruling that effectively made the administrative state
[01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:26.300]   the highest law on the land, even though there's no constitutional basis for it.
[01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:28.860]   So, yeah, repealing Chevron was definitely half of it.
[01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:31.140]   And I think the other half of it is gonna be whether...
[01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:32.780]   - Lawmakers have to pass laws.
[01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:35.580]   You can't have individual commissions pass laws.
[01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:36.580]   That's the whole point.
[01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:42.980]   - We need bills passed by the Republican Congress that Trump can sign, but we also need, I think,
[01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:47.060]   cabinet-level appointments who will start to subdue the bureaucracy, bring them under
[01:27:47.060 --> 01:27:48.740]   control, find out what they're doing.
[01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:53.620]   Just give us transparency around what they're doing, Twitter-file this thing, so then we
[01:27:53.620 --> 01:27:54.820]   can reform it.
[01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:59.220]   - I think that we're gonna look back on this era, and I think it's gonna last about 20
[01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:04.540]   years or so, at least, which I call a return to originalism.
[01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:11.780]   We are returning to the founding principles of this startup called America, and I think
[01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:13.500]   it's incredible.
[01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:14.700]   I think Sachs is right.
[01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:20.940]   There's this unbelievable living document that created this incredible experiment.
[01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:23.860]   We veered way far away from it.
[01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:32.220]   It's taken us a lot of courage to get back to that place where now you can actually let
[01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:38.380]   that guiding document govern a highly meritocratic country.
[01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:44.340]   So it's gonna be a lot of hard work, but my gosh, it's just an incredible moment and opportunity.
[01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:46.980]   Everybody should just take a breath and remember that.
[01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:51.500]   - I'd just like to do a quick survey of some of the local and state elections and get some
[01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:52.500]   reactions.
[01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:55.100]   I want to talk a little bit about what's going on in San Francisco and California.
[01:28:55.100 --> 01:28:57.660]   I'll just hit on it.
[01:28:57.660 --> 01:29:02.220]   My friend Daniel Lurie, it looks like he's gonna be the mayor of San Francisco, beating
[01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:05.580]   out the incumbent mayor, London Breed.
[01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:13.820]   Daniel ran on a moderate platform and has an intention of fixing a lot of the operations
[01:29:13.820 --> 01:29:18.060]   and inefficiencies in the San Francisco government, which has seen a ballooning in budget.
[01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:21.660]   San Francisco has the highest budget per capita of any city in the United States, I think
[01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:27.900]   50% higher than New York, with a lower functioning kind of set of municipal services.
[01:29:27.900 --> 01:29:29.680]   And there's a lot of opportunity for improvement there.
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:34.100]   This is the first time, really important stat, first time an outsider has been elected mayor
[01:29:34.100 --> 01:29:37.180]   in San Francisco since 1911.
[01:29:37.180 --> 01:29:44.260]   Every mayor elected since 1911 in San Francisco was an existing government employee or government
[01:29:44.260 --> 01:29:45.500]   civil servant.
[01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:49.660]   So just like what we saw in the federal elections, we are seeing an outsider being placed in
[01:29:49.660 --> 01:29:50.660]   mayoral office in San Francisco.
[01:29:50.660 --> 01:29:54.140]   >>Corey Berg, I wished Lurie a hearty congratulations.
[01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:57.020]   Nick, can you show him the tweet?
[01:29:57.020 --> 01:30:00.860]   >>Your city has become a dangerous, dirty dumpster fire for bad ideas from libs.
[01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:05.220]   I hope you do the obvious and be on the side of cops, justice, clean streets, and meritocracy.
[01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:07.060]   That's your message to the incoming mayor.
[01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:11.740]   >>Well, yeah, I mean, he has been a major proponent.
[01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:14.500]   >>You were gonna run for mayor once, J. Cal?
[01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:15.980]   >>I was lobbied.
[01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:16.980]   I was approached.
[01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:24.980]   And I was given a lot of support, seven figures of support to go do it.
[01:30:24.980 --> 01:30:28.860]   It's a very hard job because the supervisors actually run the city.
[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:32.580]   And a lot of the supervisors, like -- >>They got booted, too, no?
[01:30:32.580 --> 01:30:33.580]   Did they get booted?
[01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:34.580]   >>Yeah, a couple of them got booted.
[01:30:34.580 --> 01:30:35.580]   Dean Preston got booted.
[01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:36.580]   Dopey Dean.
[01:30:36.580 --> 01:30:37.580]   >>Dopey Dean.
[01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:38.580]   >>And Aaron Pesky.
[01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:39.580]   >>Dopey Dean.
[01:30:39.580 --> 01:30:40.580]   >>That was bad.
[01:30:40.580 --> 01:30:42.580]   >>So the board of supervisors has also shifted moderate.
[01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:45.340]   The mayor is now gonna be a moderate outsider.
[01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:48.420]   And there's a real opportunity to rebuild and reform San Francisco.
[01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:50.780]   It's a place that I've called home for 25 years.
[01:30:50.780 --> 01:30:51.780]   It's a place where I operate my business.
[01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:52.780]   >>It's a good start.
[01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:56.020]   >>And it feels like a lot of the citizens of what has historically been --
[01:30:56.020 --> 01:30:57.020]   >>I refuse to go to San Francisco.
[01:30:57.020 --> 01:30:58.020]   >>You don't have to.
[01:30:58.020 --> 01:30:59.020]   >>I still live there.
[01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:00.020]   >>I'll zoom.
[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:01.020]   I'll zoom.
[01:31:01.020 --> 01:31:02.020]   >>Hold on.
[01:31:02.020 --> 01:31:03.780]   I still live there, and I do think that it was a big election in terms of improving things
[01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:04.780]   in San Francisco.
[01:31:04.780 --> 01:31:05.980]   So congrats to Daniel Lurie.
[01:31:05.980 --> 01:31:07.860]   He's a friend of mine, as well.
[01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:10.020]   Go down to L.A., another big race.
[01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:13.020]   We booted Gascogne, who was the Soros DA.
[01:31:13.020 --> 01:31:14.020]   >>Finally.
[01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:17.900]   >>Ruined San Francisco, and then failed his way up to L.A., was ruining L.A.
[01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:23.020]   And Nathan Hockman, who's moderate, beat him by something like 20 points.
[01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:29.220]   And then, like I mentioned, we got Prop 36 passed in California by about 70%, which reversed
[01:31:29.220 --> 01:31:34.180]   some of the excesses of Prop 47, which was the proposition a decade ago.
[01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:39.460]   That was passed by then-Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom and then-Attorney General Kamala
[01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:44.180]   Harris to, de facto, legalize shoplifting.
[01:31:44.180 --> 01:31:50.540]   So the people of California have had enough of these policies that, frankly, enable crime,
[01:31:50.540 --> 01:31:54.300]   enable homelessness, enable drug use, and they want a correction.
[01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:59.540]   Look, even wokes and blue-state liberals don't want their cars broken into.
[01:31:59.540 --> 01:32:01.540]   I mean, it's really -- >>Shocking.
[01:32:01.540 --> 01:32:03.060]   >>It's really simple.
[01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:07.820]   >>I mean, the crazy thing in Los Angeles with Gascogne was a number of people who I know
[01:32:07.820 --> 01:32:13.340]   live there, now know people in Santa Monica, in Brentwood, in Bel-Air, where we lived for
[01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:17.700]   so many years, Sax, have home invasions have started again.
[01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:20.540]   I mean, that is like a real breaking point for people.
[01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:21.540]   >>It's scary.
[01:32:21.540 --> 01:32:22.540]   It's real scary.
[01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:23.980]   >>It's scary to have your home broken into by a gang.
[01:32:23.980 --> 01:32:24.980]   >>Right.
[01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:31.660]   And, you know, one final point on this is that while the people of California resoundingly,
[01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:37.100]   again, over 70% supported Prop 36, there was one prominent figure who was opposed to it,
[01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:38.100]   which was Gavin Newsom.
[01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:42.260]   He said, when he saw early polling, "I don't know what state I'm living in."
[01:32:42.260 --> 01:32:47.300]   So, you know, look, the state we're living in, Gavin, is the one that you created.
[01:32:47.300 --> 01:32:48.860]   You're the one who gave us these policies.
[01:32:48.860 --> 01:32:50.460]   You're the one who gave us Prop 47.
[01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:52.180]   You're the one who gave us zero bail.
[01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:56.140]   You're the one who allowed the Democratic Party in California to be taken over by Soros
[01:32:56.140 --> 01:32:57.140]   DAs.
[01:32:57.140 --> 01:32:58.860]   You've never resisted these policies.
[01:32:58.860 --> 01:33:00.060]   Now you have a choice.
[01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:02.180]   You can see where the people are at.
[01:33:02.180 --> 01:33:04.900]   Over 70% of California wants a change.
[01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:11.540]   I'd say, on the rest of the country, if it's 70% California, 90% of the United States must,
[01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:13.860]   you know, as opposed to these soft on crime policies.
[01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:17.980]   If you ever have aspirations to be anything more than governor of California, you better
[01:33:17.980 --> 01:33:19.820]   get on the right side of this issue.
[01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:23.620]   >>Sachs, David Sachs, should be the governor of California.
[01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:24.620]   >>Let's do it.
[01:33:24.620 --> 01:33:27.100]   >>No, I'm 100% serious.
[01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:30.860]   It's the fifth largest economy in the world.
[01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:31.860]   >>Let's do it.
[01:33:31.860 --> 01:33:39.060]   >>This is marked today as the day that I have decided that I'm going to convince David to
[01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:40.060]   be the governor of California.
[01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:41.060]   >>I know it is.
[01:33:41.060 --> 01:33:43.700]   >>Great campaign manager, press secretary for him.
[01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:44.700]   >>Hype man.
[01:33:44.700 --> 01:33:46.380]   >>I will say, I'll make a point on this.
[01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:49.060]   >>I'm just going to say that David Sachs would be an incredible governor of California.
[01:33:49.060 --> 01:33:50.060]   >>I'm not a candidate.
[01:33:50.060 --> 01:33:51.060]   I'm not a candidate.
[01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:52.060]   It's just a rumor.
[01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:53.060]   >>I understand.
[01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:54.060]   I understand, blah, blah, blah.
[01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:55.060]   >>Let's start the rumor right now.
[01:33:55.060 --> 01:33:56.060]   He's lying.
[01:33:56.060 --> 01:33:57.060]   He said it to me privately.
[01:33:57.060 --> 01:33:58.060]   >>There's no rumor.
[01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:01.500]   I'm just telling you right now that within two years, I will have convinced him to do
[01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:02.500]   it.
[01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:03.500]   It'll be the perfect time.
[01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:06.220]   Gavin Newsom has been terrible for the state.
[01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:11.540]   We have seen trillions of dollars of market cap exit the state in terms of corporations
[01:34:11.540 --> 01:34:13.060]   that have left.
[01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:16.740]   We have gone from record surpluses to record deficits.
[01:34:16.740 --> 01:34:20.440]   We have an education system that is failing millions of kids.
[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:22.420]   What is going on here?
[01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:25.060]   We have taxes that are through the roof.
[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:31.140]   And when you spend more and more and more to get less and less and less, and it takes
[01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:35.580]   more and more out of everybody's pocket, what is the answer?
[01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:39.700]   The answer is you have to fundamentally change everything that's happening from first principles.
[01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:47.140]   >>Well, I will say one more point about, I will call it balance in the force.
[01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:52.620]   When a party is captured and moves too far in one direction, people leave the party and
[01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:54.700]   they vote for the other party.
[01:34:54.700 --> 01:35:00.380]   And then in order to attract people back to the party, they tack to the center.
[01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:04.500]   My big prediction over the next few years is you will see a more centrist Democratic
[01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:06.300]   party as they try and...
[01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:07.300]   >>I'll take the other side.
[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:09.700]   >>And they try and attract their troops back.
[01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:11.180]   >>I'll take the other side.
[01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:12.740]   >>So one more topic before we wrap, guys.
[01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:14.060]   >>I'll see Sachs in Sacramento.
[01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:15.060]   See Sachs in Sacramento.
[01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:16.060]   >>Not gonna happen.
[01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:17.060]   Not gonna happen.
[01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:20.780]   >>Guys, before we wrap, there's one other topic that came up in every conversation I
[01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:25.300]   had with everyone about Trump that was a female, which was abortion.
[01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:29.140]   And it was, and look, I don't want to rehash again that it was misrepresented what Trump's
[01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:32.420]   position is, but abortion has become a very sensitive topic.
[01:35:32.420 --> 01:35:38.060]   A woman's right to do what she wants to do with her body when she wants to do it is something
[01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:44.060]   that most women feel they are very deeply endowed with, and that should be an unalienable
[01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:48.100]   right, particularly in the United States of America, and that even sending this back to
[01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:53.460]   states and states voting on it creates a significant emotional response that drives folks to one
[01:35:53.460 --> 01:35:54.700]   party or the other.
[01:35:54.700 --> 01:35:59.620]   In Florida, voters rejected an abortion extension to 24 weeks.
[01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:04.320]   Florida previously had a 15-week abortion ban, but the current six-week ban took effect
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:05.320]   in May.
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:10.700]   So the amendment that was being proposed on the ballot this week would have codified abortion
[01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:16.340]   procedures up to 24 weeks in the state constitution, but it needed 60 percent of the votes to pass,
[01:36:16.340 --> 01:36:18.660]   but it only got 57 percent.
[01:36:18.660 --> 01:36:22.780]   So it looks like a loss for pro-choice advocates.
[01:36:22.780 --> 01:36:27.380]   Sax, what is going to happen now that these abortion laws are being voted on, these amendments
[01:36:27.380 --> 01:36:32.660]   to state constitutions are being voted on, how is this going to reshape American politics,
[01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:36.420]   and how are the parties going to shift in the years ahead, given how important and how
[01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:41.900]   sensitive this topic has become after the decision of the Supreme Court recently?
[01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:47.700]   Look, I think that what you're seeing in the last election that we just had is the beginning
[01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:49.940]   of the end of the salience of this issue.
[01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:54.740]   I mean, abortion has been an issue that has deeply fragmented America for 50 years.
[01:36:54.740 --> 01:37:00.460]   I mean, the pro-choice versus pro-life movements have been a staple of American politics, talking
[01:37:00.460 --> 01:37:01.460]   past each other.
[01:37:01.460 --> 01:37:04.020]   They were never able to get to any sort of compromise.
[01:37:04.020 --> 01:37:07.540]   With the repeal of Roe v. Wade, with the Dobbs decision, the issue has now been thrown back
[01:37:07.540 --> 01:37:11.140]   to the states, and every state is working it out for themselves.
[01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:16.460]   And in most states, what's happening is it's either the pro-choice totally wins or they
[01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:18.780]   compromise on some number of weeks.
[01:37:18.780 --> 01:37:22.340]   I think that in Florida, going for 24 weeks might have been a little bit too many.
[01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:25.380]   If they had tried to go back to 15, you know, they probably could have gotten there.
[01:37:25.380 --> 01:37:28.200]   They probably could have gotten from 57 to 60.
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:31.820]   But that's what the debate's going to be about now, is just basically in red states, it's
[01:37:31.820 --> 01:37:34.340]   just going to be about agreeing on a certain number of weeks.
[01:37:34.340 --> 01:37:37.420]   Blue states are pretty much going to be pro-choice.
[01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:40.500]   And you can see that the federal level, no one wants to touch this anymore.
[01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:45.060]   J. Cal, you raised the point during the election cycle, during the campaign, that Dobbs would
[01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:50.580]   be crushing for Trump, and that women were going to turn out in droves for Harris on
[01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:51.780]   the base of this issue.
[01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:53.580]   That simply did not happen.
[01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:58.260]   If you look at voter turnout, Trump increased his share of the women's vote.
[01:37:58.260 --> 01:38:00.020]   He did lose college-educated women.
[01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:03.660]   So that subset of, call it more progressive, yeah, sorry, college-educated.
[01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:06.420]   But the older women too, I think, came out, yeah.
[01:38:06.420 --> 01:38:09.160]   But if you look at women as a whole, he won more of their votes.
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:11.900]   So how did Trump inoculate himself on this issue?
[01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:12.900]   He made it really clear.
[01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:15.380]   He was not in favor of a national ban.
[01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:19.300]   He said that he favored the exceptions, and that it was now up to the states.
[01:38:19.300 --> 01:38:24.100]   He basically assured the country, the women of the country, that, again, that abortion
[01:38:24.100 --> 01:38:26.980]   would not be banned, and that was now a local issue.
[01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:31.220]   And I think the voters of the country, including women, accepted that, and it is now a state
[01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:32.220]   issue.
[01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:33.220]   So-
[01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:34.220]   So Maryland, Missouri-
[01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:35.220]   I think it's gone.
[01:38:35.220 --> 01:38:36.220]   Yeah.
[01:38:36.220 --> 01:38:39.940]   Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, Montana, Colorado, Arizona, all voted to codify the right to
[01:38:39.940 --> 01:38:42.180]   abortion and remove abortion bans.
[01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:46.300]   On the other hand, Nebraska voted for a ban on abortions after the first trimester, and
[01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:49.680]   South Dakota voted against a right to abortion.
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:54.540]   So South Dakota prohibits all abortions except when necessary to save the woman's life.
[01:38:54.540 --> 01:38:58.900]   You're gonna end up, listen, even in deep red states like Ohio, the pro-choice forces
[01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:01.220]   have won these referenda.
[01:39:01.220 --> 01:39:06.140]   It's just a handful of cases, like a very small number, where the pro-life have gotten
[01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:07.140]   their way.
[01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:11.700]   Again, I think we're at the tail end of this being a salient issue in American politics.
[01:39:11.700 --> 01:39:17.020]   I think Trump has ended it as a federal issue, and it's now going state by state.
[01:39:17.020 --> 01:39:19.420]   And in most of those states, the pro-choice forces are winning.
[01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:24.220]   I think this issue is over, and I think it's over because Republicans know not to touch
[01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:25.220]   this.
[01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:28.340]   Jay Kal, you've said it's one of the most important issues of the day several times
[01:39:28.340 --> 01:39:29.340]   in the past.
[01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:32.300]   You said women were gonna vote in droves for Kamala because of the perception that Trump
[01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:34.260]   was trying to pass a federal abortion ban.
[01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:40.740]   I think a lot of them did, clearly, but not enough to swing the election, and it's going
[01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:41.740]   to be...
[01:39:41.740 --> 01:39:42.740]   Do you think it's gonna be...
[01:39:42.740 --> 01:39:43.940]   I mean, to the question, is Sachs right?
[01:39:43.940 --> 01:39:49.380]   Is this gonna stop being an issue, and it's now codified in state law, or is this gonna
[01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:50.380]   continue to be a lynchpin in American law?
[01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:51.380]   I think it's gonna...
[01:39:51.380 --> 01:39:53.580]   There will be states where women will not be able to get an abortion, sadly, and they
[01:39:53.580 --> 01:39:55.940]   will not be able to make that decision for themselves.
[01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:56.940]   That's my personal belief.
[01:39:56.940 --> 01:39:58.220]   They should be able to make the decision for themselves.
[01:39:58.220 --> 01:40:00.220]   I'd like to stay out of it.
[01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:03.620]   But Sachs is largely right that if you don't...
[01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:08.260]   If I'm reading it correctly, think about it, if you're a state and you ban abortion, who's
[01:40:08.260 --> 01:40:09.260]   gonna wanna live there?
[01:40:09.260 --> 01:40:12.420]   You're gonna have a lot of people leaving, and that's been an issue here in Texas.
[01:40:12.420 --> 01:40:16.580]   A lot of companies are having a hard time with not only getting women to move here to
[01:40:16.580 --> 01:40:23.460]   work at specific companies in Texas, but men are well or not are citing it as a concern.
[01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:27.540]   So it's going to make it really untenable for an economy in the United States.
[01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:32.260]   You're saying men don't wanna work for Tesla or SpaceX because of abortions?
[01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:37.000]   I have heard many stories about people not wanting to come work at companies in Texas
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.100]   because of this law, yes.
[01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:40.360]   I have heard that from employers.
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:45.060]   I'm not talking about any of Elon's companies, I don't speak for him, obviously.
[01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:47.460]   But this has been an issue for companies in Texas.
[01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:48.460]   Okay.
[01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:52.900]   Guys, this has been a fantastic follow-up to this week's election.
[01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:57.300]   I know some people are bitterly disappointed, frustrated, angry, and sad about the future
[01:40:57.300 --> 01:41:01.000]   of America, and others are deeply optimistic and excited.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:04.200]   And I think at the end of the day, it's all gonna be okay.
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:08.740]   And I really do hope that everyone can kind of have constructive conversations about the
[01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:10.460]   future we'd all like to build together.
[01:41:10.460 --> 01:41:12.700]   Like we do here.
[01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:14.980]   And I really appreciate the friendship with you guys.
[01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:18.780]   I wanna say congratulations to Sachs and Chamath for putting yourselves out there as early
[01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:21.860]   as you did in campaigning and promoting Donald Trump.
[01:41:21.860 --> 01:41:26.780]   I think you guys had a very influential role in moving people.
[01:41:26.780 --> 01:41:29.660]   For the effort you made and the outcome, congratulations.
[01:41:29.660 --> 01:41:30.660]   More than...
[01:41:30.660 --> 01:41:32.560]   Listen, I'll say what I said again.
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:33.940]   He's a good human being.
[01:41:33.940 --> 01:41:36.620]   I would encourage you to get to know him.
[01:41:36.620 --> 01:41:37.620]   Yeah.
[01:41:37.620 --> 01:41:38.620]   Just that.
[01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:39.620]   Take a piece, folks.
[01:41:39.620 --> 01:41:43.180]   Well, look, if he wants to invite me tomorrow to have a veggie burger and fries, I'm there.
[01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:44.180]   I will hang out.
[01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:45.180]   Yeah.
[01:41:45.180 --> 01:41:46.180]   What?
[01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:47.180]   No veggie burgers?
[01:41:47.180 --> 01:41:48.180]   What are you talking about?
[01:41:48.180 --> 01:41:49.180]   Yeah.
[01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:50.180]   See you before you go.
[01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:51.180]   It's my best advice.
[01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:52.180]   Oh, yeah.
[01:41:52.180 --> 01:41:53.180]   I forgot.
[01:41:53.180 --> 01:41:54.180]   We're gonna ban veggie burgers.
[01:41:54.180 --> 01:41:55.180]   They ban fake meat in Florida.
[01:41:55.180 --> 01:41:56.180]   I already texted Bobby to ban anything with soy lecithin.
[01:41:56.180 --> 01:41:57.180]   Yeah, I know.
[01:41:57.180 --> 01:41:58.180]   I know.
[01:41:58.180 --> 01:41:59.180]   Carganine and xanthan gum.
[01:41:59.180 --> 01:42:00.180]   All of your...
[01:42:00.180 --> 01:42:01.180]   All that stuff is verboten.
[01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:02.180]   But don't worry.
[01:42:02.180 --> 01:42:03.180]   Bears on the menu.
[01:42:03.180 --> 01:42:07.300]   Vegans better learn to find natural sources of protein, because the unnatural sources...
[01:42:07.300 --> 01:42:11.660]   The free market Republicans have decided it's time to go in and ban the market for fake
[01:42:11.660 --> 01:42:14.340]   meat, because, my God, we can't introduce fake meat.
[01:42:14.340 --> 01:42:16.060]   We have to tell you what to eat and what to do.
[01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:18.980]   Well, not unless xanthan gum continues to dysregulate your physiology.
[01:42:18.980 --> 01:42:19.980]   Xanthan.
[01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:20.980]   Xanthan gum.
[01:42:20.980 --> 01:42:23.980]   Stop using your moderator privileges to push your agenda, Free Bird.
[01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:24.980]   Take care, guys.
[01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:25.980]   I love you.
[01:42:25.980 --> 01:42:26.980]   I love you, guys.
[01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:27.980]   Bye-bye.
[01:42:27.980 --> 01:42:28.980]   Bye-bye.
[01:42:28.980 --> 01:42:29.980]   Love you, guys.
[01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:30.980]   Bye-bye.
[01:42:30.980 --> 01:42:31.980]   We'll let your winners ride.
[01:42:31.980 --> 01:42:33.980]   Rain Man David Sachs.
[01:42:33.980 --> 01:42:35.980]   I'm going all in.
[01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:39.980]   And it said we open sourced it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it.
[01:42:39.980 --> 01:42:40.980]   Love you, Weston.
[01:42:40.980 --> 01:42:42.980]   The queen of quinoa.
[01:42:42.980 --> 01:42:43.980]   I'm going all in.
[01:42:43.980 --> 01:42:46.980]   What your winners like? What your winners like?
[01:42:46.980 --> 01:42:48.980]   I'm a great teacher.
[01:42:48.980 --> 01:42:50.980]   Besties are gone.
[01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:54.980]   That's my dog taking a notice in your driveway, Sachs.
[01:42:54.980 --> 01:42:57.980]   Oh, man.
[01:42:57.980 --> 01:42:59.980]   My avatar will meet me at Woodson.
[01:42:59.980 --> 01:43:03.980]   We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy 'cause they're all just useless.
[01:43:03.980 --> 01:43:07.980]   It's like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.
[01:43:07.980 --> 01:43:09.980]   Wet the beat.
[01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:12.980]   Wet your beat.
[01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:13.980]   We need to get merch.
[01:43:13.980 --> 01:43:14.980]   Besties are back.
[01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:16.980]   I'm going all in.
[01:43:16.980 --> 01:43:24.980]   I'm going all in.
[01:43:24.980 --> 01:43:27.040]   you
