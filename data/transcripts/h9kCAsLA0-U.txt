[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.480]   - Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.760]   We get a lot of really good questions via email,
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.100]   and many of them are from international listeners
[00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.280]   like this one, a heavy question.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.600]   Hello, Pastor John, I am Nate from Manila, Philippines,
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.080]   and I've struggled with this one question my entire life.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.400]   My best friend passed away because of meningitis
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.600]   when we were 12 years old, and since then,
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.600]   I've been doubting how much God keeps his promises.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.000]   He was a pastor's kid, he grew up in the church,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.440]   he loved God, and he honored his parents very much.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.840]   If Ephesians 6, verses two and three tells us
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.040]   of the commandment with the promise of long life,
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.640]   why does it seem like God didn't keep it for my best friend?
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.360]   - I really empathize with Nate,
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.680]   and it's not hard to see how he and his friend
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.760]   would take from Ephesians 6, two and three,
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.760]   the meaning that God promises to each individual child
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.520]   who honors his parents a long life.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.520]   On the face of it, seems to say that,
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.280]   here's what it says, "Honor your father and mother.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.880]   "This is the first commandment with promise,"
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.720]   referring back to Exodus 20, verse 12,
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.600]   "This is the first commandment with promise
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.320]   "in the 10 commandments, that it may go well with you,
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.240]   "and that you may live long in the land."
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.000]   This is why parents and pastors should teach
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.520]   a full-blown biblical doctrine of suffering and death,
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.600]   not just later in life, but to children as well.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.600]   When children die or lose a parent or a sibling or a friend,
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.960]   they need a solid foundation of teaching
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.140]   in order to understand what's happening to them.
[00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.140]   It's so important that we look very carefully here now
[00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.640]   at the wording of Ephesians
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.080]   and at the Old Testament context in Exodus 20, 12,
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.200]   and at the wider context of Paul
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.160]   and other things he says about long life
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.480]   and death and suffering.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.520]   It's so important for us.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.500]   It's so important for our children.
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.280]   So here's some observations.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.960]   For example, Jesus was the most obedient son
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.140]   to his earthly parents and his heavenly Father
[00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.320]   that ever existed.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.780]   There never has been a more obedient son
[00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.780]   or one who honored his Father in heaven and on earth more.
[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.580]   And yet, Jesus died as a young man.
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.080]   He did not live long on the land,
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.180]   and he tells his followers
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.580]   that they're going to experience similar kinds of suffering.
[00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.460]   He doesn't say, "Oh, I did this,
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.040]   "but it will never happen to any of you
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.420]   "if you're good enough like I was good enough."
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.740]   He never talks like that.
[00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.580]   In fact, throughout the New Testament,
[00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.700]   obedience to God, honoring God,
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.920]   and keeping his commandments is correlated
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.980]   with risk and danger and death,
[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.700]   not with security and comfort.
[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.620]   So we need to teach our children like Paul did
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.020]   in his Discipleship 101 in Acts 14.
[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.620]   "Through many tribulations,
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.720]   "you must enter the kingdom,
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.520]   "and some of those tribulations involve some of you
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.940]   "they will kill," Jesus said.
[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.500]   And then one thinks of the great promise
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.820]   in Romans 8:28 and 32,
[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.740]   that all things will work together for your good,
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.580]   and all things will be provided for you,
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.580]   only to be followed in verse 36, four verses later,
[00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.940]   by, "For your sake we are being killed all day long."
[00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.700]   And it doesn't mean only 70-year-olds.
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.900]   We are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.300]   So when we read Ephesians 6:3,
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.260]   "That it may go well with you,"
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.980]   it sounds very much like Romans 8:28,
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.780]   "For those who love God."
[00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.000]   So Romans 8:28 says, "If you love God,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.260]   "everything will work together for your good."
[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.620]   Ephesians 6:3 says, "If you honor your parents,
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.820]   "it will go well with you."
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.820]   And going well with you in Romans 8:35
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.740]   means you might be killed for Jesus' sake.
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.980]   That's what going well with you may include.
[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.980]   So if we have been trained to see these patterns,
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.300]   if children have been shown this,
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.660]   we won't be as likely to give Ephesians 6:3 a meaning
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.660]   Paul surely did not intend for it to have.
[00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.420]   In the Old Testament, this promise
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:05.220]   was made to the people of Israel as a whole
[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.460]   that they would endure from generation to generation
[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.460]   in the land of promise if they were the kind of people
[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.660]   who kept the law and honored their parents.
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.960]   It's not a promise to each individual Israelite
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.060]   who honors his parents
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.060]   that he'll live out his full three score in 10.
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.820]   Can read it, "You will remain in the land,"
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.500]   meaning you, the people of Israel,
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.860]   won't be swept away into Babylon
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.140]   if you're law-keeping people.
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.260]   And they weren't, and so they were swept away.
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.620]   And so my sense is that when Paul quoted
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.900]   this Old Testament promise,
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.740]   he didn't mean for it to promise a certain long life
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.420]   for every boy and girl who honors his or her parents.
[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.420]   And we should then ask, "Well, what does it mean then?"
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.420]   When he says, "And that you may live long in the land."
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.180]   If we do apply that to our children
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.380]   or if we take it to ourselves as children,
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.700]   what might it mean?
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.440]   And here's my suggestion.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.100]   If you put the two halves together,
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.200]   it will go well with you and you will live long.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.920]   I would suggest in view of all we've seen
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.780]   is that it means it will go well with you
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.780]   and you will live as long as it going well with you implies.
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.580]   In other words, it will go well with you,
[00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.620]   defines you will live long, not the other way around.
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:40.140]   Living long doesn't define how it will go well with you.
[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.540]   Going well with you defines how long you will live.
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.740]   And that is exactly the way I think
[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.740]   we should say it to a child who is dying
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.980]   or who has lost a friend or a parent
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.740]   that in fact we don't speak glibly
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.820]   or say it without tears, but we do say,
[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.860]   "You know, in God's mind and God's good heart,
[00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.400]   "it is going well.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.860]   "It's going to go well with you."
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.180]   We may choose not to say that at all
[00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.900]   in the moment of greatest pain.
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.220]   I'm not saying that we should be pastorally insensitive
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.580]   at all, I'm saying people sooner or later
[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.320]   and better sooner before suffering
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.780]   and later perhaps during suffering.
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:34.820]   Sooner or later, something must be said
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.180]   to the parents who've lost a child
[00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.940]   or the sibling who lost the brother or sister
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.940]   or like we have here, a friend who was snatched away.
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.180]   If God takes a child, He gives and He takes,
[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.540]   He gives and He takes, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.420]   If God takes a child, in the most ultimate sense,
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:02.420]   it has gone well with them and that's what He promised.
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:07.140]   It will go well for you and you will live long
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.460]   as long as it's good for you on this earth
[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.040]   and then forever in heaven.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.060]   - Amen, thank you for those sobering realities, Pastor John,
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.500]   to a very heavy question and thank you, Nate,
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.780]   for sending that in.

[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.160]   that are heavy like this one.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.500]   We're now gonna break for the weekend

[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.220]   of the Old Testament, specifically the book of Numbers?
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.180]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.340]   I'll see you on Monday.
