[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.600]   - I'm not sure if you're familiar with Andrew Yang.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.440]   - Yes, I am.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.040]   - So there's a candidate for president of the United States
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.120]   whose platform, Andrew Yang, is based in part
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.840]   around job loss due to automation,
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.240]   and also in addition, the need perhaps
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.600]   of universal basic income to support jobs
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.280]   that are folks who lose their job due to automation.
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.680]   So what are your thoughts about his concerns,
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.060]   him as a candidate, his ideas in general?
[00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.380]   - I think his thinking is generally in the right direction,
[00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.400]   but his approach as a presidential candidate
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.960]   may be a little bit ahead of the time.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.160]   I think the displacements will happen,
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.800]   but will they happen soon enough
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.480]   for people to agree to vote for him?
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.760]   The unemployment numbers are not very high yet,
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.580]   and I think he and I have the same challenge.
[00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.540]   If I want to theoretically convince people this is an issue
[00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.880]   and he wants to become the president,
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.520]   people have to see how can this be the case
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.680]   when unemployment numbers are low?
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.320]   So that is the challenge.
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.320]   I do agree with him on the displacement issue.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.040]   I think the main issue is retraining.
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.240]   So people need to be incented
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.200]   not by just giving a monthly $2,000 check or $1,000 check
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.880]   and do whatever they want,
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.680]   because they don't have the know-how
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.680]   to know what to retrain to go into what type of a job,
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.380]   and guidance is needed.
[00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.440]   And retraining is needed because historically
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.880]   in technology revolutions,
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.360]   when routine jobs were displaced, new routine jobs came up.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.800]   But with AI and automation,
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.400]   the whole point is replacing all routine jobs eventually,
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.480]   and AI will create jobs, but it won't create routine jobs,
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.680]   because if it creates routine jobs,
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.720]   why wouldn't AI just do it?
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.200]   So therefore, the people who are losing the jobs
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.120]   are losing routine jobs.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.520]   The jobs that are becoming available are non-routine jobs.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.140]   So the social stipend needs to be put in place
[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.880]   is for the routine workers who lost their jobs
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.960]   to be retrained, and then take on a job
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.720]   that will last for that person's lifetime.
