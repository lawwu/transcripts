[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   Unconditional election.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.840]   Isn't this just a dry doctrine for eggheads to discuss and debate?
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.300]   No, it's not.
[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.740]   We all need this doctrine, unconditional election.
[00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.480]   And that's why unconditional election is a theme we've studied a dozen times on the
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.200]   podcast over the years.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.040]   It's this precious fact that God's choice of one person and not others is not based
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.520]   on any good deeds or any bad deeds in the persons themselves.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.840]   Let me say that again.
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.200]   God's choice of one person and not others is not based on any good deeds or any bad
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.640]   deeds in the persons themselves.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.440]   God chooses his children unconditionally.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.600]   That's unconditional election.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.120]   But what practical value does such a doctrine hold for my life?
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.640]   That's Chase's question today.
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.680]   Shadran, hello and thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.680]   My question is this.
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.920]   Can you tell me why believing in unconditional election matters?
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.320]   Isn't this doctrine nitpicking and divisive more than edifying?
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.880]   Yes, it matters.
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.920]   No, it is not nitpicking.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.060]   Yes, it could be divisive, but that's not the fault of the doctrine.
[00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.960]   It's the fault of the human heart.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.080]   And yes, it is edifying.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:34.480]   So let me give 10 reasons to answer Chase's question, "Does it matter?"
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:41.000]   What we mean by unconditional election, you could use the word "selection" if election
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:53.840]   has political sounds to you, is God's free, gracious choice before creation of who it
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:03.760]   is that he will give faith and repentance to and thus pardon their sin, adopt them into
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:15.520]   his everlasting family, an election or a selection not based on anything, not anything in us,
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:23.840]   not foreseen faith, not good works, not parentage, not national origin or race or ethnicity,
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.760]   not religious ritual like baptism or the Lord's Supper.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:37.960]   God's selection is unconditional based only on his all-wise good pleasure or, as Ephesians
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.280]   says, the counsel of his will.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:51.600]   So just like you can pack an atom bomb into a very small missile, let me pack 10 reasons
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.360]   that unconditional election matters into 10 minutes.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.240]   Number one, it matters because it's true.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.560]   It's what the Bible teaches.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.120]   Romans 9, 11, "Though Jacob and Esau were not yet born and had done nothing either good
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.760]   or bad," they admit no conditions, "in order that God's purpose of election might stand
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.760]   unconditionally."
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.480]   I added that word, but that's implied.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.920]   Not because of works, but because of God who calls, Rebecca was told, "The older will
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.680]   serve the younger."
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:33.920]   Ephesians 1, verse 4, God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.360]   Jesus said, "All that the Father gives me will come to me.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.720]   Yours they were, and you gave them to me."
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.960]   John 6, John 17, "They were the Father's, and he gave them to Jesus."
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:55.340]   Number two, it matters because the aim of unconditional election is that we are destined
[00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.960]   for eternal joy and praise of the glory of the grace of God.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.480]   That's our destiny.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.320]   Grace is the very meaning of unconditional election.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:14.080]   God's free, gracious choice, not our qualifications.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:25.040]   The whole design of election is to get joy for our souls and praise for God's grace.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.880]   Ephesians 1, verse 6, "He chose us in him before the foundation of the world unto the
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.880]   praise of the glory of his grace."
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.760]   That's the whole design of unconditional election.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.080]   Grace, grace, glorious grace will be praised forever.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.680]   Number three, it matters because it humbles our proud hearts.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.640]   1 Corinthians 1:27, "God chose what is foolish in the world.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.760]   God chose what is weak in the world.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:04.480]   God chose what is low and despised in the world so that no human being might boast in
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.360]   the presence of God."
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.440]   God gets praise.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.720]   We get humbled by unconditional election.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.580]   Number four, it matters because it makes clear that our faith is a gift of God, a gift of
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.480]   grace that follows election rather than grounding it.
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:29.820]   Acts 13, 48, "The Gentiles began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord.
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.260]   And as many as were appointed," that is chosen, elected, "as many as were appointed
[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.360]   to eternal life, believed."
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.480]   They believed because they were appointed.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:47.360]   No one can boast that he originated his own believing and so won his election.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.360]   No.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:55.400]   As many as were chosen, as many as were chosen, appointed, elected, believed.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.700]   They believed.
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.800]   Faith is a gift rooted in the eternal, unconditional election of God.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:08.060]   Number five, it matters because it secures the reality that no one can successfully bring
[00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.240]   any charge against us.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.320]   Romans 8, 31, "What then shall we say to these things?
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.800]   If God is for us, who can be against us?
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:23.520]   He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.040]   him graciously give us all things?
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.000]   Who shall bring any charge against God's elect?"
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.360]   Let me say that again.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.720]   Who shall bring any charge against God's elect?
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.240]   And the answer is nobody.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.160]   God's chosen are secure from all accusation.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:52.280]   Number six, it matters because it is the deepest ground of our own compassion for other people.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:07:00.040]   Paul calls for compassion from Christians like this in Colossians 3, 12, "Put on then
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:09.380]   as God's chosen ones, elect ones, holy and loved, compassionate hearts."
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:17.800]   Precisely because we are aware of being freely, graciously, undeservedly chosen, owing to
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:24.560]   nothing in ourselves are we moved to treat others the way we've been treated.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:33.840]   Number seven, despair at being unsavable is torpedoed by the doctrine of unconditional
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:34.840]   election.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:43.240]   If a person says to me in my office as a pastor, "Pastor, I'm just too evil to be saved.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.160]   God could never, never set his favor on me.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.940]   You don't know what I've done.
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.280]   What I have done is all so terrible."
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:59.480]   To that person, we can say, "God did not choose anybody because of what they had done
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.360]   or not done."
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:09.080]   Your history of sin is absolutely irrelevant for the question whether you can be one of
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.200]   God's chosen ones.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.440]   God's choice was unconditional, absolutely.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.560]   The only question is, will you believe?
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:26.180]   If you will believe, you will be saved and you will confirm your election before the
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.920]   foundation of the world.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:36.160]   Number eight, unconditional election matters because it puts an end to racism among God's
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.880]   people when they grasp what it means.
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:44.180]   Racism is rooted in a sense of ethnic or racial superiority.
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:51.720]   God ignores all such conditions and chooses his people from every ethnicity and unconditionally
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.320]   he chooses them.
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:59.680]   Peter wrote, "You are a chosen race, a holy nation."
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.120]   Christianity is a new race of people.
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:08.520]   No others, no other races, no other ethnicities are the basis of belonging.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:14.280]   He ransomed people from every tribe, every tongue, every people, every nation.
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:21.780]   He stops the mouth of all ethnic boasting by choosing unconditionally.
[00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:28.040]   Number nine, it matters because we can know we are chosen with all the blessings that
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.040]   implies.
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:37.080]   1 Thessalonians 1.4, "We know, brothers, we know, brothers loved by God, that he has
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:42.920]   chosen you, because our gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power and in
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.800]   the Holy Spirit and with full conviction."
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:52.600]   And number 10, finally, it matters because God shapes all of history for the sake of
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.120]   his elect.
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:01.280]   To make sure that we come safely home into his presence, he controls the world.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:08.040]   Jesus said about the end of history, and I think it applies to all of history in principle,
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:16.160]   he said this, "If those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved,
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:22.240]   but for the sake of his elect, those days will be cut short."
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.880]   Matthew 24.22.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:30.880]   So Chase, in answer to your question, yes, it matters.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.520]   It matters a lot.
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:41.600]   And the church would be stronger if pastors fed their people on this rich food for our
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.600]   faith.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.600]   Amen.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.760]   Yes, it's meant to strengthen the saints.
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:46.760]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.360]   And speaking of God choosing the foolish, God gets the praise.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.360]   We get humbled by unconditional election.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.360]   Amen.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.240]   But why does he choose the foolish when he could get a lot more done in this world if
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.080]   he saved the brilliant and the innovative and the famous?
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:05.560]   Remember, that was APJ 1965, two weeks back.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.840]   It's related to this one.
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:13.080]   If you missed that, you can go back and find it in your podcast feed, APJ 1965, on why
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.040]   God uses the foolish in this world.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.360]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for joining us today.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:27.480]   If you want to ask Pastor John, email your question to us at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.480]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
