[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:09.800]   - Hi, I'm Abner Chow, one of the translators
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.880]   of the Legacy Standard Bible.
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.540]   And I have with me here today, Dr. Joe Zakevich.
[00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.960]   Zakevich, Zakevich?
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.560]   'Cause there's a lot of different ways to say it, huh Joe?
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.980]   - There are a variety of ways to say it.
[00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.320]   We say it Zakevich.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.400]   Some people in our family say Zakevich, my mom,
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.160]   but everybody else says Zakevich for the most part.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.160]   - But it's all the same name.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.640]   - It's the same name, it's the same last name.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.360]   - And I guess that's pretty good, a way to illustrate
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.840]   what we're gonna be talking about right now,
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.740]   which is the issue of Yahweh.
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.880]   And that is a major change in the Legacy Standard Bible.
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.660]   People have a lot of questions about it,
[00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.800]   and they're very understandable questions.
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.880]   And they usually fall into kind of three categories.
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.260]   One is, should we even translate
[00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.560]   the Tetragrammaton as Yahweh?
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.200]   Is that okay?
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.360]   Another question is, okay, if that is permissible,
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.560]   how should we say it?
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.520]   And how do we know that's the right way?
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.880]   And the final and third question people have is,
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.900]   well, so what?
[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.960]   Well, what's the big deal?
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.200]   Why does this matter?
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.080]   What's the purpose behind it?
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.520]   So kind of in getting this conversation started,
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.720]   let me begin by kind of tackling that first question
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.720]   of should we even translate the Tetragrammaton as Yahweh?
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.480]   Is that permissible?
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.420]   And sometimes people ask the question kind of like this.
[00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.600]   They say, "Well, Paul in the New Testament,
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.320]   "he translated it as Lord, Kurios.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.360]   "And if it was good enough for the Apostle Paul--"
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.200]   - It's good enough for me.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.960]   - It's good enough for me, exactly.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.440]   And we understand that argument.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.040]   And I think one thing we really want to establish
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.880]   is that there is nothing wrong at all
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.520]   of translating the Tetragrammaton as Lord.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.560]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.420]   To say otherwise would be to condemn the New Testament,
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.040]   and we definitely don't want to do that.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.640]   - Right, the New Testament is inspired.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.120]   - That's right, so it's inerrant.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.800]   - Those translations are inspired,
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.920]   and therefore they are accurate.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.920]   - Absolutely, and so we don't want to say that.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.600]   But there's a difference between saying
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.060]   something is without error, it's not wrong,
[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.600]   and it's mandated across everything.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.960]   And that's where we need to make some observations.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.440]   Like in the New Testament itself, Revelation 19,
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.760]   three times there is hallelujah.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.080]   And there we hear the name Yahweh, hallelujah.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.400]   We hear it repeated three times.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.480]   So the New Testament doesn't bar
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.960]   the use of the name of God as Yahweh.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.840]   And on top of that, the early church
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.280]   didn't think of it that way either.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.840]   We have Theodorette or Clement of Alexandria and others
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.360]   who talk about the use of the name Yahweh
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.900]   in amongst their people.
[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.820]   And we even have copies of Greek translations
[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.160]   of the Old Testament, both Jewish and Christian,
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.480]   that preserve the name Yahweh
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.000]   and reflect that in those documents.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.840]   And so all that to say is that the idea in history
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.600]   was never that this is the only way to translate,
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.520]   Lord is the only way to translate the Tetragrammaton.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.600]   Now people in history, they can be wrong, we get that.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.080]   But this shows us that there might be another possibility.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.220]   And we can look at this from the angle
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.320]   of kind of consistency and translation philosophy.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.160]   When we have something in the New Testament,
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.240]   like a change of name, a different enunciation of it,
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.680]   we don't read that back onto the Old Testament.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.920]   We don't change, for example, Joshua to Jesus
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.320]   because that's how it's pronounced or said
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.200]   in the New Testament.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.960]   And we don't change Messiah or anointed one
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.360]   in the Old Testament to Christ
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.240]   because that's how the New Testament words it.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.080]   We translate the Old Testament as the Old Testament.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.800]   We translate the New Testament as the New Testament.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.040]   And likewise, when New Testament quotes the Old Testament,
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.220]   sometimes they change the wording slightly of the quote
[00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.060]   from the Old Testament.
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.240]   - They're making an interpretation
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.160]   and they're trying to focus on something within that quote.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.000]   - That's right.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.880]   - So they make that adjustment.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.640]   - Right, and that brings out a nuance,
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.080]   that brings out a detail of the Old Testament text
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.480]   that was always there.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.680]   And that's why it's so important to leave the Old Testament
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.360]   as the Old Testament and the New Testament
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.120]   as the New Testament so we can compare and contrast
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.380]   and see that nuance brought out.
[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.840]   And I would say that I think that's what's going on
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.940]   with Yahweh, that when we see it in the Old Testament
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.940]   and then we see this deliberate shift in the New Testament
[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.960]   to say, Lord, there's a purpose behind that,
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.340]   there's a theological reason behind that,
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.620]   there's a theological significance to that,
[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.600]   and it makes a very profound and repeated point.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.000]   And if people are wondering what the point is,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.920]   I would just say, well, that's like question three.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.840]   - Right, it's coming.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.720]   - It's coming, yeah.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.720]   But for now, what we would say is there's a lot of benefit
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.080]   to even translating the Old Testament as the Old Testament
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.840]   and the New Testament as the New Testament.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.900]   It is not wrong, it's permissible,
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.160]   and there are some even benefits.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.080]   'Cause it puts us, and this gets back to the window concept,
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.000]   into the shoes and the feet and the eyes
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.200]   of the original biblical readers
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.860]   as they would encounter these issues,
[00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.520]   and that gives opportunity for theology.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.560]   So having said that, okay, maybe it is permissible,
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.240]   maybe it's okay, we're allowed to do it,
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.480]   it could even be beneficial, how then should we say it?
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.040]   Well, Joe, walk us through this.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.160]   - Right, that's the big question.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.840]   So understanding the task, I think, before is that
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.300]   as translators, it is one of our tasks
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.080]   to make sure that we preserve the Old Testament
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.640]   the way it is and then preserve the New Testament
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.840]   the way it is, then we face the question,
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.480]   well, then how do we read it, how do we pronounce it?
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.440]   We need to start with the Bible itself,
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.000]   where it appears and where it's introduced,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.760]   and that's in Exodus chapter three, verses 14 and 15,
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.240]   and then it continues on into the Old Testament
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.140]   in later passages.
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.680]   But when God introduces himself,
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.800]   Moses says to him, if the Israelites do not believe me,
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.480]   and they will ask me, who has sent you, what is his name?
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.240]   Then what should I say to the people?
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.240]   And God introduces himself by saying,
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.880]   first he gives a clause, he says, I am who I am,
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.400]   or you can translate it as, I will be whoever I will be,
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.840]   and then in verse 15, this is in verse 14,
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.340]   but then in verse 15, he uses the name
[00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.800]   that we're translating as Yahweh.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.620]   And the starting point is that verse,
[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.200]   and what those two verses make clear for us
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.800]   is that we're dealing with the verb, the to be verb,
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.280]   or he is, he was, he will be verb,
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.680]   and that's pretty much decided by the text itself.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.040]   So we know that the name of God, Yahweh,
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.360]   is connected to that verb.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.000]   - Say the verb in Hebrew for us.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.240]   - In Hebrew, the verb would be haya.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.240]   - Yeah, and you can even hear the connection
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.240]   between those two there.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.680]   - That's right, yeah, haya or Yahweh,
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.000]   you can hear that it's the same root verb.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.240]   Now, so that's the starting point,
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.420]   and we cling to that as one of our anchors,
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.960]   but then we go on and we ask, okay,
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.480]   so how do we know that Yahweh
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.120]   is the right way of pronouncing it?
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.520]   And scholars have done lots of study on this over the years,
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.000]   and the details of this word,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.560]   the way that the letters appear,
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.160]   and in Hebrew, the letters would be yod-hay-vav-hay
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.920]   for the name Yahweh, and then in English,
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.720]   we sometimes say it as y-h-w-h, or it's written that way,
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.200]   and it's very important where these letters appear
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.880]   and which letters appear.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.560]   And so as scholars make the linguistic
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.040]   and the grammatical study,
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.320]   they see that the first letter is Y.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.760]   Well, that tells us that this is a verbal form
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.200]   which is identified by scholars and in grammar as yig-tol,
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.320]   it's a third person, and it's very important
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.000]   for letting us know how to start pronouncing that word,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.560]   as yah, and then the word itself ends with a H,
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.320]   in Hebrew, hay, and that's a typical ending for a verb
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.760]   in a specific category, which is called a three-hay
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:53.080]   or a lamed-hay verb, and it ends as a eh sound.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.440]   And so from that type of a study,
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.880]   the scholars have concluded that the most accurate way
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.440]   would be to render that word,
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.000]   to read that word, the name of God, as Yahweh.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.640]   And even in the 19th century,
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.280]   Gesenius, a very well-known and renowned scholar,
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.000]   did this study, and he confirmed
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.760]   that this would be the most accurate way
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.120]   of pronouncing the word.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.840]   But you also mentioned a number of other evidences
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.600]   in history, so some of the Christian resources
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.640]   and some of the other texts, they attempt
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.800]   or they record the way that they would have heard
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.320]   and the way they would have pronounced it as well,
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.600]   and you mentioned Theodoret and a few other guys,
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:35.600]   Origen, Hosea, Yahweh, or Clementine of Alexandria.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.480]   So we have those evidences that point to the fact
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.800]   that Yahweh would be the most accurate way
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:42.880]   of pronouncing it.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.320]   - Yeah, and I think it's people who have done
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.240]   their homework, both philologically, linguistically,
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.920]   attested in history, that gives anchor to all of this,
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.080]   but sometimes people wonder, well, what about Jehovah?
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.120]   I mean, we sing the song, or at least,
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.280]   they used to sing the song, Jehovah-Jireh,
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.400]   and we hear that kind of phrase.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.120]   Tell us about that, too.
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.720]   - Yeah, Jehovah, somebody actually mentioned
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.160]   to me this past week, reminded me that Jehovah
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.120]   appears in, I guess, the old version
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.360]   of the King James Version, in Exodus 6, I believe.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.480]   - And that even just shows that what we're doing
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.760]   in the Legacy Standard Bible isn't necessarily
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.840]   revolutionary in the sense of doing something
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.400]   totally different that's never been done before.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.720]   In fact, sometimes we're just going back to our roots
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.640]   in a sense of the King James.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.280]   - Right, yeah, and we're refining it,
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.080]   and we're trying to make sure that it's accurate
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.960]   both historically and grammatically and true to the text.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:40.000]   - So, with regard to Jehovah, we do believe
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.440]   that it's an incorrect way of pronouncing it,
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.640]   but what that is, is it's a misreading
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:51.640]   of the vowels that appear on the letters Y-H-W-H,
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.120]   on the word Yahweh.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.160]   It's simply a misreading of it, and what happens
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.240]   is that on the word Yahweh, there are two sets
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.640]   of vowels in the Bible, and those vowels tell us,
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:08.400]   or they tell the readers how to pronounce the word Yahweh,
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.880]   but those vowels do not belong to the word Yahweh.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.280]   They are actually vowels from a different title.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.360]   One is from the word Adonai, which means Lord,
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.800]   and the other one is from the word Elohim, which means God.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.960]   And so, the intent here was that when somebody
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.400]   would be reading the Bible, and they would get
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.080]   to the holy name, they believed it to be too holy
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.920]   to be pronounced, and so they put those vowels
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.120]   on that word in order to indicate to the reader,
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.000]   say Adonai instead of Yahweh.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.400]   Say Elohim instead of Yahweh,
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.920]   so that you don't say the holy name.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.360]   Well, some of the translators, whether it was by accident
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.880]   or whether they thought that this was accurate,
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.120]   they came to the word in the Hebrew text,
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.920]   and instead of saying those proper words,
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.680]   Adonai or Elohim, Lord or God, they said,
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.760]   we're just going to read those vowels with the word Yahweh.
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:05.840]   And when they did that,
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.600]   they came up with the rendering Jehovah.
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.560]   Now, the problem with that is that those vowels
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.400]   do not belong to the word Yahweh.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.240]   - Yeah, and there's even a conflict
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.680]   because there's two sets of vowels.
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.600]   So, even Jehovah doesn't represent the other set
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.640]   of one of the two sets of the vowels
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.920]   that are actually present in the Hebrew manuscripts.
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:24.760]   - That's exactly right.
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.560]   It would be something like Jehovah would be one option,
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.280]   and Jehovah would be another option,
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.120]   and the vowels are entirely different.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.520]   So, that creates a conflict,
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.960]   but that shows that these vowels do not belong
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.960]   to the word Yahweh, to the name Yahweh.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.800]   And for that reason,
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.040]   we believe that it's an incorrect reading
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.160]   of the text as well.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.160]   - That is so helpful.
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.120]   Thanks for taking the time to explain that and so clearly.
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.920]   And I think the only thing I would add
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.400]   is just like with the name, Zakevich, Zakavich, and the like,
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.840]   even from the Old Testament to the New Testament,
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:58.880]   we see that different names are enunciated different ways.
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.920]   And the New Testament isn't bothered by that.
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.800]   The scriptures are not bothered by that.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.080]   And so, we recognize that in language,
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.600]   sometimes you have to adjust the enunciation
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.880]   given the limitations of an alphabet.
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.440]   And so, the Lord knows, Yahweh knows,
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.000]   our heart to worship Him and say His name,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.360]   but the reason He gave us His name
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.560]   is so that we would intimately commune with Him personally
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.200]   and distinguish Him from everyone else.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.600]   And in light of that,
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.320]   I think this brings us to our third question.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.600]   We've said, should we say this name?
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.480]   Should we use this name in scripture?
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.760]   And we saw from the New Testament itself, yes.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.360]   And the Old Testament, yes.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.960]   And even in church history, yes.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.280]   And even in English tradition, yes, it's there,
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.880]   Tyndale and early King James and everything.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.280]   And so, there is this buildup
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.600]   of just recovering what was in the past.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.040]   And on top of that, we said, hey, we can have confidence
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.840]   from scholarship and from history
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.560]   that this is the right way to say it.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.120]   But now people are saying, well, so what?
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.640]   What does that help us with?
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.360]   Joe, help us to think through that too.
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.320]   - Yeah, well, I think it makes a great deal of difference.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.920]   And I think it really refines
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.080]   and it deepens our reading of the scriptures
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.480]   and our study of the scriptures.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.680]   And again, we wanna start where it starts.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:12.680]   When God said to Moses, this is my name, He said His name.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:17.040]   And if we say Lord, we're not saying Yahweh's name,
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.720]   God's name, we're saying a title, Lord.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.640]   And so, when we have Yahweh in the text,
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:27.240]   we actually read and we hear His name.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.040]   And that spreads throughout the scriptures.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.120]   I mean, the word Yahweh appears some 6,800 times
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.280]   or something like this.
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.080]   Right, and so you go from reading Lord
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.720]   to reading Yahweh 6,800 times.
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.680]   That really changes the way that you read the Bible.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.240]   Now, there are various other benefits to doing this.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:51.240]   You see the name Yahweh and you see the personal nature
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.000]   of God and the way that He interacts with His people.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   And the context in which He introduces His name
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.360]   is the covenant that He was about to make with His people.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.200]   And so, every time you see Yahweh,
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.080]   you're thinking about the covenant
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.440]   that God made with His people.
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.280]   And then you stretch that throughout the scriptures
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.280]   and you get to the end of the Old Testament,
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.960]   you get to Zechariah, chapter 13, verse nine.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.800]   It says that the people will one day
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.400]   call on the name of God
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.840]   and they will call on His name, Yahweh.
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.760]   And He will say, this is my people.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.520]   And they will say, Yahweh is my God.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.200]   Right, so it makes the relationship between Israel and God
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.160]   a much more personal relationship.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.800]   And for us, it makes the experience much more readable.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.880]   - Yeah, and even with that phrase, I love it in Zechariah.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.960]   Yahweh is my God.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.320]   That distinguishes God, the one true God,
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.840]   and it defines Him as this is the God of the Bible.
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.840]   Not just a generic God that you could stick with Buddha
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.760]   or Allah or other kind of gods that our society has
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.160]   or other religions have, but this is Yahweh.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.480]   This is the God of the Bible.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.920]   This is the God of Israel.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.440]   This is the New Testament's God.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.480]   This is that God.
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.480]   And we're defining and distinguishing Him.
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.400]   And it also distinguishes other titles for God.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.760]   We were talking about this earlier.
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:11.600]   Talk to us about that.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.920]   - Yeah, that's really interesting.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.280]   And that's really helpful.
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.800]   So typically, the translation would have been Lord
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.840]   instead of Yahweh.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.160]   But when you bring in Yahweh into the text,
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.640]   you have a clear distinction between when Yahweh is used
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:25.880]   and when Lord is used.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.360]   And that really helps us understand the Bible,
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.840]   the reading of the Bible immediately.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.160]   I mean, you think about Psalm 110.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.160]   The Lord says to my Lord.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.600]   That's how I memorized it.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.560]   But now my question is, well, is it Lord or is it Yahweh?
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.400]   Is it both Yahweh's or is it both Lord's, the title Lord?
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.560]   Well, in the Hebrew, it is Yahweh says to my Lord.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.560]   And once you introduce Yahweh into the text,
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.680]   it becomes abundantly clear, I should say,
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:55.080]   that Yahweh is speaking to my Lord,
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.760]   who happens to be the Messiah, the master of David.
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:01.560]   And in that statement, you begin to realize that,
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.760]   okay, so what is the function
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.480]   or what is the significance of Lord?
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.360]   That He's the master of David.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.160]   And then what is the function and the meaning of Yahweh?
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.320]   Well, that's His personal and His covenant name.
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.000]   And then you can take another example.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.520]   Genesis chapter 19, verse 24, I believe it is.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.560]   And there, this is the story of Sodom and Gomorrah,
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.000]   and God is about to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:26.920]   And you get to the point
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.560]   where God is destroying Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.320]   And then it says in verse 24
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:37.200]   that the Lord rained fire and brimstone
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.320]   from the Lord in heaven.
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.680]   Well, the question is, okay, once again,
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:44.200]   is it Lord, is it two Lords, is it two Yahweh's?
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.440]   Which one is it?
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.800]   And in this case, it actually happens
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.480]   to be two mentions of Yahweh, two references to Yahweh.
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.920]   So it says, "Yahweh rained fire and brimstone from Yahweh."
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.480]   And this is theologically significant.
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.480]   And it immediately jumps off the page
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.680]   because you're thinking two references to Yahweh,
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.040]   what does that mean?
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.280]   Right, and then this has implications
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.400]   for the two persons of the Godhead,
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.520]   which has implications then going forward
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.320]   and into the New Testament of who God is
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.240]   and how complex God is.
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.040]   - Yeah, and speaking of that, when we think then,
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.040]   okay, in the Old Testament, you have Yahweh.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.320]   And then in the New Testament, you have Lord.
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.000]   There is, like we were talking about earlier,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.520]   this deliberateness to translate it to Lord.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.840]   And it's not just convention.
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:28.080]   We know that Jesus is Lord because he's the Messiah,
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.920]   because he is the Chosen One and the King of Kings.
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.600]   He's even above Caesar, who was called Lord,
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:37.000]   say, in the end of Acts 25.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.200]   And so we know that he is the Lord.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.000]   And at the same time, though,
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.720]   and we know it's not just due to convention
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.880]   because the New Testament juxtaposes,
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.240]   it puts the Old Testament references
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.640]   that it deliberately translates as Lord
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.520]   very close to the title that Jesus is Lord.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.240]   We know they're making a connection, a correlation,
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.480]   that yes, Jesus is Lord.
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.520]   He is King of Kings and Lord of Lords,
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.600]   but that is because he is Yahweh himself.
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:10.520]   And the shift in translating Yahweh to Lord
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.840]   is to point everyone to Yahweh revealed,
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.360]   Yahweh incarnate.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.160]   This is not just a God.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:21.440]   This is not just a deity or a demigod or a derivative God.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.000]   This is Yahweh.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.440]   Jesus is Lord.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.000]   Lord is Yahweh.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   And the New Testament is deliberately making that point.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.040]   - And with that, a passage like Genesis 19.24
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.120]   with two references to Yahweh begins to make sense.
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.920]   This is two persons of the Godhead.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:38.760]   - That's right.
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.320]   And it all just connects together then.
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.280]   And it kind of reminds me of what children
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.600]   are supposed to do at Passover.
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.120]   They're supposed to ask their parents,
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.480]   "Why are we doing this?"
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:51.240]   And with the shift from Old Testament to New Testament,
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.120]   the New Testament's deliberateness,
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.480]   yet still retaining the name Yahweh like in Revelation 19,
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.480]   but its deliberateness to translate it as Lord,
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.280]   people should be asking, "Why do they do that?"
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.520]   And we should be equipping them to say,
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:08.400]   "Because Jesus is Yahweh and Jesus is Lord
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.600]   "and the New Testament wants that absolutely correlated
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.260]   "and clear and connected."
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.760]   And it then provides a repeated theological emphasis
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:17.600]   and point.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.720]   It's really great.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.720]   - It's fascinating.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:24.080]   And there's another element in respect to the name Yahweh,
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.840]   and that's the shorter form of Yahweh, right?
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:27.680]   Yah.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.320]   It's far less frequent.
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.160]   It's very rare.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.560]   - We hear it in Revelation 19, though.
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.400]   Hallelujah. - That's right.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.240]   - Yah. - It appears there.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.280]   And the word hallelujah, I mean, Psalm 150,
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.920]   it ends with that.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.020]   I think it begins with that as well.
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.840]   But the short form of Yahweh appears about 50 times
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:44.840]   or something like this.
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:48.480]   And if Yahweh is the personal name of God,
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.280]   I think it's fair to say that Yah
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:53.120]   would be the intimate expression of the name of God.
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:53.940]   - That's helpful.
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.560]   - And you look where the reference to Yah appears,
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.280]   and it appears in those passages
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.640]   where there's this passionate and emotional expression
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.440]   of gratitude and love and worship of God.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.200]   The first time it appears is in Exodus 15.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.420]   And it appears in the song where Moses
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.360]   and the Israelites sing to Yah.
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.760]   And they sing about the strength of Yah.
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.120]   Now, the significance there
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.900]   is that they just came out of Egypt.
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.320]   They just crossed the sea.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.720]   They thought they were going to die
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.600]   and they were gonna be killed by the Egyptians.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.400]   Then this massive miracle happens
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.360]   where God splits the sea they crossed,
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:33.200]   and their response is praise Yah,
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.800]   just from the abundance of their soul
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.000]   and the abundance of their heart.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.320]   And then Yah continues to appear in the Psalms
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:43.720]   where it's very passionate expressions of worship of God.
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.080]   And maybe another example is in Isaiah 38
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:49.480]   where Hezekiah is about to die.
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.280]   He gets sick, he's about to die.
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:54.920]   And God gives him an extra 15 years of life.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:59.920]   And so he writes a poetic worship song or a praise.
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.520]   And there he begins with praising Yah.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.840]   He uses Yahweh in that song as well,
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.840]   but he begins with praising Yah.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.720]   And so that would be the intimate reference
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.440]   and appeal to Yahweh.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.480]   - Well, this is really helpful.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.680]   So what we see is in translating the Old Testament
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.260]   as the Old Testament, it's not just permissible.
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.280]   It's not just that we know how to pronounce it.
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:26.440]   It's not, there are some really practical advantages to it.
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.600]   It captures God's distinctiveness.
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.360]   It distinguishes other titles for God.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.280]   It even captures the emotion of the Old Testament
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:37.400]   in worship with that shortened form, particularly of Yah.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.080]   There are so many great benefits.
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.040]   And praise Yahweh.
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:41.880]   - Yeah, amen to that.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.920]   - Hallelujah for that.
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.840]   - It's appropriate to say hallelujah
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.840]   because it's coming from the depth of your soul
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.440]   and you're worshiping Yahweh in an intimate way.
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.760]   - Well, thank you for spending the time with us
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.300]   to bring clarity to these things.
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.880]   And our prayer is just that this would be really edifying
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.040]   to you all and helpful and clarifying as well
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.900]   as you think about worshiping and communicating
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.860]   with our personal God, Yahweh.
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.020]   (silence)
[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:19.020]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
