[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   Oaxaca and San Cristobal de las Casas are two of the most beautiful mountain towns where
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.760]   indigenous pre-Columbian culture is most intact.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.720]   The beauty of Oaxaca is the fact that it has this really strong pre-Columbian indigenous
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.280]   cultural roots that are still living on strongly to this day.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:26.680]   And you've got people, these are Mixtec and Zapotec people that are still speaking their
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.560]   native languages, and these are artisans, and these are farmers, and they're people
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.440]   that are producing mezcal, they're producing handicrafts, they're farming the land, they're
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.560]   living very much traditional lifestyles that have gone on for centuries.
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.680]   And the indigenous roots, the pre-Columbian culture lives on so strongly that it influences
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.920]   everything about it.
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:55.560]   And really it's hard to find such a pure evolution and a real organic evolution of the indigenous
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.040]   culture into contemporary life.
