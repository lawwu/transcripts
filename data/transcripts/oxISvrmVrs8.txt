[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.600]   - Welcome back.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.680]   Today's topic is a sensitive one.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.800]   So just a heads up on that.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.880]   We get a lot of questions from a lot of listeners
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.080]   on a very wide range of life situations, obviously.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.560]   And many of these questions come to us
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.160]   from pretty broken places.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.680]   And I think that's true today.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.520]   We addressed an email from a woman,
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.560]   a female by birth, born with two X chromosomes.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.440]   She's written in anonymously to ask this.
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.960]   Pastor John, hi.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.760]   I find myself at a stage in my life
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.280]   when I'm seriously considering
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.040]   removing my female body parts,
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.000]   namely my breasts and my uterus,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.260]   because I no longer want to be a woman.
[00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.160]   Women are perceived as weak vessels
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.260]   whose only purpose is to have children.
[00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.380]   Even the scripture supports that ideology, she writes.
[00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.180]   As a modern woman, quote unquote,
[00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.880]   I have no desire to have children or get married,
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.720]   but to have a successful career
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.320]   to help support less fortunate people
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.500]   and animals live better lives.
[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.580]   My question is this,
[00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.240]   would doing this to my body be sinful?
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.020]   Yes, it will be sinful.
[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.220]   And it will probably be dreadfully destructive
[00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.980]   to you as a person.
[00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.300]   And I want to give you six reasons
[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.220]   in response to what you've said.
[00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.220]   So I hope you'll be willing to listen to me
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.800]   'cause this is not gonna be easy for you to hear.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.780]   I hope you have the courage to listen it out.
[00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.780]   Number one, no, neither the Bible nor the church
[00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.160]   has ever said or hinted
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.900]   that woman's only purpose is to have children.
[00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.980]   Nor is this the view of the vast majority
[00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.760]   of human beings in the world.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.900]   The very fact that you would say this
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.260]   shows how conflicted you are
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.000]   because you know that's not true.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.500]   You know it's not true.
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.980]   You know that in the gospels,
[00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.180]   women followed Jesus and served him in many ways,
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.220]   Luke 8, one to three.
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.980]   You know that Paul refers to numerous women
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.820]   who labored side by side with him in the gospel.
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.820]   You know that love between a man and a woman in marriage
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.820]   is vastly deeper and richer than only baby making.
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.440]   You know that in history,
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.580]   the prayers and the service of women
[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.420]   have turned the tide for good in communities again and again.
[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.020]   You know that today women work in hundreds of vocations
[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.460]   and most of them do it gladly as women,
[00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.420]   not in spite of being women.
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.000]   You know these things.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.900]   And yet you still say
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.460]   women are perceived as having
[00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.440]   only the purpose of childbearing.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.480]   I wonder why that is.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.480]   Why do you say that?
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.000]   What it sounds like is that you're not thinking clearly.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.340]   You're not speaking and thinking clearly.
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.100]   You're speaking and thinking carelessly.
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.820]   And that is not a good place
[00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.960]   from which to make a massive decision
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.660]   like the one you are contemplating.
[00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.960]   It would be folly.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.980]   Second, yes, woman is the weaker vessel,
[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.180]   as Peter says, and as everybody knows.
[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.580]   That's why there's a woman's NBA,
[00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.540]   women's college volleyball, women's gymnastics,
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.720]   women's track and field, women's soccer,
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.480]   women's Tour de France.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.080]   God made men stronger.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.920]   And there are reasons for this.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.700]   And he really is wise.
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.020]   He really is very good in making such decisions.
[00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.700]   If you don't trust him with the way he made the world,
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.760]   then that's one of the main reasons
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.340]   that what you are about to do is sin.
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.220]   You're not acting in faith,
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.700]   but anger and resentment at the way God made you.
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.300]   You are evidently not trusting God's wisdom, but denying it.
[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.840]   That's not a safe place
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.840]   from which to make this massive decision.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.860]   But there's a sad thing as well besides this point.
[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.020]   When you're done mutilating yourself,
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.640]   you're still going to be part of the weaker sex.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.860]   You can make your chest flat.
[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.020]   That won't make you strong.
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.380]   You can pump testosterone into your body
[00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.400]   and grow more hair and make your voice lower,
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.740]   but you'll still be a woman.
[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.620]   You'll be weaker than 90% of the men your age.
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.900]   In fact, you will be weaker than you were before.
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.860]   Not stronger, because pretense is weakness.
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.220]   Living a life, trying to be what you are not,
[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.800]   is a life of weakness.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:28.140]   Third, you say, "As a modern woman,
[00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.100]   I have no desire to have children or get married."
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.460]   I have two questions for you.
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.660]   Is your desire your God?
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.500]   It sounds like it.
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.640]   Are you humbly asking the true and living God,
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.500]   "God, what are your desires?
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.220]   What is your will for me?"
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.860]   Or does that matter to you?
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.820]   Is your desire final?
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:04.480]   If it is, that's another evidence of sin
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.700]   behind your thinking.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.560]   Second question, what if your desire changes
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.120]   in five or 10 years?
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.200]   "Oh, how I wish I knew your name."
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.880]   So I could say with all earnestness,
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.880]   "Seriously, Chelsea, seriously, think about this.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:33.760]   Surely you have lived long enough to know
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.000]   that what you desire today
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.800]   may not be what you desire tomorrow.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.200]   You know this.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.080]   In one moment, you can destroy a whole life
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.960]   of possibilities that you may desperately desire someday.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.820]   If you blow me off here and think you can predict
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.360]   your desires 10 years from now, you are delusional.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.200]   You know it.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.680]   Wake up, be realistic.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.560]   You do not know what your desires will be in 10 years.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.420]   Don't cut off those possibilities."
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:18.140]   Number four, if you want to serve the less fortunate,
[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:22.620]   do you want to do it for Christ's sake?
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.800]   Do you want to do it for His glory?
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.640]   If not, it's idolatry.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.000]   If you do, then why wouldn't you consult with Him
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.760]   for how you can glorify Him through your body,
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.000]   the way He made you?
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.920]   I mean, if His glory matters to you in serving the poor,
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.820]   wouldn't it matter in how to be a woman?
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:56.960]   Number five, if you really love people
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.800]   and care about the disadvantaged,
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.040]   God cares about that as much as you do.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.800]   He loves that, which is why millions of competent,
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.660]   caring, persevering, Christ-exalting women,
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.720]   women are leading the vanguard
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:21.560]   in many such ministries of compassion and justice.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:26.400]   Why in the world would you think
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:31.160]   that you will be a better lover of needy people
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.080]   as a fake man than a real woman?
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.600]   You know that's inconsistent.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.160]   If you really want to give your life
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:46.160]   for the sake of others who are less advantaged, praise God.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.320]   That's what He wants for you.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.380]   He wants it more than you do,
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.620]   and He made you perfectly suited
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.700]   for His calling on you to do it.
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:03.460]   Breasts and uterus and hormones and monthly cycle
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.700]   and brain structures, all of it gloriously suited
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.300]   for what He's calling you to do.
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.940]   He's not stupid.
[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.400]   He doesn't make mistakes.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.660]   Your recreation of you
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.180]   will not be a better lover of the poor
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.100]   than God's creation of you.
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:30.900]   Number six, God made us male and female,
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:36.660]   and we are male and female all the way down.
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:41.300]   The glory of womanhood is not something as superficial
[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.500]   as breasts and uterus.
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:49.140]   It is marked in every cell of your body,
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:53.820]   every dimension of your soul, every part of your brain.
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:58.860]   You can't even begin to undo
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.000]   the pervasive mystery of your womanhood.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.100]   Your womanhood is like yeast in the dough,
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:12.820]   like the color in the paint of your life,
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:17.820]   like the aroma in the flower that you are,
[00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.040]   like the melody in the song.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.700]   Dear friend whose name I wish I knew,
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.940]   you are a female wonder of God's handiwork,
[00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.920]   and no amount of chipping away at it
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.860]   will make it cease to be a God-designed masterpiece.
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:42.820]   So I conclude, yes, it will be a sin,
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:49.480]   a tragedy, and almost certainly tragically regretted
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:56.740]   if you have yourself mutilated to try to be what you are not
[00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.920]   and what God did not make you to be.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.380]   And I plead with you, don't do that.
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:09.200]   Surrender to Him and His will and His wisdom
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.040]   and His love and His Son, Jesus,
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:17.120]   and you will find an amazing life of purpose
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.440]   as He created you to be.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.060]   - Yeah, thank you, Pastor John, for that bold word,
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.920]   a necessary word, much appreciated.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.000]   And thank you for joining us today.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.840]   Ask a question of your own,
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.920]   even very sensitive questions that you want to,
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.840]   send us anonymously, we respect that.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.800]   Send us your questions at askpastorjohn.com.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.480]   We're gonna take a break from controversies next time,
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.680]   and we do so to talk about book reading.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.800]   Back in 1981, Pastor John,
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.360]   you wrote an amazing sentence about sentences.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.840]   You said, quote, "What I have learned
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.380]   "from about 20 years of serious reading is this,
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:56.760]   "sentences change my life, not books."
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.060]   Sentences change my life, not books, I love it.
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.640]   We're gonna look at that point next time.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.560]   I'm your host Tony Rehnke,
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.360]   and we'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.200]   See you then.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:10.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:20.360]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
