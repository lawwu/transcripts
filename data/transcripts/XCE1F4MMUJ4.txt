[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500]   I always say to people, "Listen, when you set up security questions and answers, lie
[00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.700]   like a superhero.
[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.900]   Clark Kent is not going to tell people he's Superman.
[00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.340]   Bruce Wayne doesn't run around saying, 'Hey, I'm Batman.'"
[00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.540]   So if your mother's maiden name is Smith, tell people it's Jones.
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.060]   If you went to Ridgefield High School, tell them you went to Southwick.
[00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.180]   The key thing is consistency.
[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.200]   It's not as if you're doing an interview to get a security clearance for national security.
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.600]   All you're trying to do is create something that will be a benchmark.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.060]   So it's not about veracity.
[00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.560]   It's just about consistency.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.800]   Sometimes I just have strings of numbers.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.360]   I use one password and I generate a random string of characters.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.040]   So it's like, "What's your favorite book?"
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.920]   It might be gobbledygook to me.
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.640]   It's just a bunch of numbers and symbols and letters, but it certainly isn't something
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.000]   anyone would guess.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.560]   And the same goes for the high school I went to or my dog's name or things that you might
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.080]   actually be able to find out online.
