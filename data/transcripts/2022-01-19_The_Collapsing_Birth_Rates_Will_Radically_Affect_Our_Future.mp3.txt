[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Today I wanna share with you a little bit about
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   a subject that is going to influence your life, my life,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   your economy, my economy, and many global trends
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   over the coming decades.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   I do not know specifically how you can apply
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   today's discussion to your investment portfolio
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   or to your personal financial decisions.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   All I know is that this is going to be a factor
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   in many trends through which we live.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   It's going to affect economics.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   It's going to affect politics.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   It's going to be affecting your and my life significantly.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   And I thought it's worthy of a little bit of discussion
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   to make sure that this is on your radar screen
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   as something that you should be paying attention to
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   in the coming years.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   The topic is population decline.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   I have mentioned this many times in passing.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   In fact, it was last week I mentioned it
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   in answering a question from somebody.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   And I noticed yesterday that Elon Musk
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   was tweeting about this again.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   He's covered this before,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   but I thought it was worth paying attention to.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Here are Musk's tweets.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   "We should be much more worried about population collapse.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   UN projections are utter nonsense.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Just multiply last year's births by life expectancy.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Given downward trend in birth rate,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   that is best case unless reversed.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   If there aren't enough people for Earth,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   then there definitely won't be enough for Mars."
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Sad face.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Then he links to an article from NPR,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   an article from BBC.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Another interesting tweet.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Somebody talks to him about Japan,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   and he responds with this.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   "Last year, Japan had about 800,000 births,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   and life expectancy is 85 years."
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Impressively high.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   "Implying future population of only 68 million,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   dropping almost half from current population
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   of 126 million."
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   That's a lot of ghost towns and cities.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Let me talk with a little bit of background information.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   By covering these two articles,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   which are, that Musk linked to,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   which are from the middle of last year,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   and then give you some more headlines
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   that are starting to come out about the calendar year 2021.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   From May 5, 2021, NPR article, headline,
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   "US birth rate fell by 4% in 2020,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   hitting another record low."
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Quote, "The number of babies born in the US
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   dropped by 4% in 2020 compared with the previous year.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   According to a new federal report released Wednesday,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   the general fertility rate was 55.8 births per 1,000 women,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   ages 15 to 44, reaching yet another record low
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   according to the provisional data.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   This is the sixth consecutive year
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   that the number of births has declined
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   after an increase in 2014,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   down an average of 2% per year
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   and the lowest number of births since 1979,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   the National Center for Health Statistics said.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   The US total fertility rate,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   which estimates how many babies
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   a hypothetical group of 1,000 women
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   would have during their life,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   based on data from a given year,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   remains far below replacement,
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   meaning there wouldn't be enough babies born
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   for a generation to exactly replace itself.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   The rate has generally been below replacement since 1971
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   and has consistently been below replacement since 2007,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   according to the agency,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   which is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   The statistical replacement rate
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   is 2,100 births per 1,000 women,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   but in 2020, the US total fertility rate
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   fell to 1,637.5 births per 1,000 women.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   One year earlier, it was just over 1,700 births.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Just over 3.6 million babies were born in the US last year,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   according to the agency.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Demographically, the number of births
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   fell across all ethnicities and origins,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   according to the report,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   which relied on US Census Bureau population estimates
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   that were derived in July.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   The provisional number of births declined 4%
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   for both white and black women,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   3% for Hispanic women,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   6% for American Indian and Alaska Native women,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   and 8% for Asian American women.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   The birth rate didn't go up in any age group
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   and fell in most of them.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   One of the largest declines was in teenagers,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   where the birth rate fell by 8%
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   to 15.3 births per 1,000 females.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   The birth rate for women between 20 and 24 years old
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   fell by 6%.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   It goes on.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   I just want to skip some of the more detailed
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   and talk about this in the context.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Remember, this is from last May.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   News of the continued fall in birth rates
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   comes as the US is coping with losing
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   nearly 580,000 people to the COVID-19 pandemic.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   The National Center for Health Statistics report on births
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   did not focus separately on the coronavirus,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   but it previously found a drop in the number of mothers
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   who accessed high-quality prenatal care in 2020
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   compared to 2019.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Let's go on to the BBC News article.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   This was published 15 July 2020.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Headline, "Fertility Rate Jaw-Dropping
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   "Global Crash in Children Being Born."
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Falling fertility rates mean nearly every country
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   could have shrinking populations
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   by the end of the century.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   And 23 nations, including Spain and Japan,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   are expected to see their populations halve by 2100.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Countries will also age dramatically,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   with as many people turning 80 as there are being born.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   What's going on?
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   The fertility rate, the average number of children
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   a woman gives birth to, is falling.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   If the number falls below approximately 2.1,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   then the size of the population starts to fall.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   In 1950, women were having an average of 4.7 children
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   in their lifetime.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Researchers at the University of Washington's
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   showed the global fertility rate nearly halved
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   to 2.4 in 2017.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   And their study, published in The Lancet,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   projects it will fall below 1.7 by 2100.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   As a result, the researchers expect the number of people
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   on the planet to peak at 9.7 billion around 2064,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   before falling down to 8.8 billion
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   by the end of the century.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   That's a pretty big thing.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Most of the world is transitioning into
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   natural population decline,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   researcher professor Christopher Murray told the BBC.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   I think it's extraordinarily hard to think this through
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   and recognize how big a thing this is.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   It's extraordinary.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   We'll have to reorganize society.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Why are fertility rates falling?
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   It has nothing to do with sperm counts
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   or the usual things that come to mind
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   when discussing fertility.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Instead, it is being driven by more women in education
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   and work, as well as greater access to contraception,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   leading to women choosing to have fewer children.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   In many ways, falling fertility rates are a success story.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Remember, I'm quoting from the BBC.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Which countries will be the most affected?
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Japan's population is projected to fall
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   from a peak of 128 million in 2017
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   to less than 53 million by the end of the century.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Italy is expected to see an equally dramatic population crash
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   from 61 million to 28 million over the same time frame.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   They are two of 23 countries,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   which also include Spain, Portugal, Thailand, and South Korea,
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   expected to see their population more than half.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   That is jaw-dropping,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   professor Christopher Murray told me.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   China, currently the most populous nation in the world,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   is expected to peak at 1.4 billion
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   in four years' time before nearly halving
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   to 732 million by 2100.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   India will take its place.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   The UK is predicted to peak at 75 million in 2063
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   and fall to 71 million by 2100.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   However, this will be a truly global issue,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   with 183 out of 195 countries
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   having a fertility rate below the replacement level.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Why is this a problem?
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   You might think this is great for the environment.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   A smaller population would reduce carbon emissions
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   as well as deforestation for farmland.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   That would be true except for the inverted age structure,
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   more old people than young people,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   and all the uniformly negative consequences
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   of an inverted age structure, says professor Murray.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   The study projects the number of under fives
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   will fall from 681 million in 2017 to 401 million in 2100.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   The number of over 80-year-olds
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   will soar from 141 million in 2017
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   to 866 million in 2100.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Professor Murray adds,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   "It will create enormous social change.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   "It makes me worried because I have an eight-year-old daughter
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   "and I wonder what the world will be like.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   "Who pays tax in a massively aged world?
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   "Who pays for health care for the elderly?
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   "Who looks after the elderly?
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   "Will people still be able to retire from work?
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   "We need a soft landing," argues Professor Murray.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Are there any solutions?
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Countries, including the UK,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   have used migration to boost their population
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   and compensate for falling fertility rates.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   However, this stops being the answer
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   once nearly every country's population is shrinking.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   "We will go from the period where it's a choice
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   "to open borders or not to frank competition for migrants
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   "as there won't be enough," argues Professor Murray.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Some countries have tried policies
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   such as enhanced maternity and paternity leave,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   free child care, financial incentives,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   and extra employment rights,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   but there is no clear answer.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Sweden has dragged its fertility rate up from 1.7 to 1.9,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   but other countries that have put significant effort
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   into tackling the baby bust have struggled.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Singapore still has a fertility rate of around 1.3.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Professor Murray says, "I find people laugh it off.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   "They can't imagine it could be true.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   "They think women will just decide to have more kids.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   "If you can't find a solution,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   "then eventually this species disappears,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   "but that's a few centuries away."
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   The researchers warn against undoing the progress
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   on women's education and access to contraception.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   Professor Stein-Emil Vosset said,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   "Responding to population decline is likely to become
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   "an overriding policy concern in many nations,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   "but must not compromise efforts
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   "to enhance women's reproductive health
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   "or progress on women's rights."
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   What about Africa?
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   The population of sub-Saharan Africa
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   is expected to treble in size
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   to more than 3 billion people by 2100.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   And the study says Nigeria will become
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   the world's second biggest country
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   with a population of 791 million.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   Professor Murray says, "We will have many more people
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   "of African descent in many more countries
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   "as we go through this.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   "Global recognition of the challenges around racism
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   "are going to be all the more critical
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   "if there are large numbers of people of African descent
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   "in many countries."
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   So I'll skip the last couple of...
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Actually, why not?
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Why is 2.1 the fertility rate threshold?
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   You might think the number should be 2.0.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Two parents have two children,
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   so the population stays the same size.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   But even with the best healthcare,
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   not all children survive to adulthood.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Also, babies are ever so slightly more likely to be male.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   It means the replacement figure is 2.1
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   in developed countries.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Nations with higher childhood mortality
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   also need a higher fertility rate.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   What did the experts say?
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Professor Ibrahim Aboubakar, University College London, said,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   "If these predictions are even half accurate,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   "migration will become a necessity for all nations
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   "and not an option.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   "To be successful, we need a fundamental rethink
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   "of global politics.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   "The distribution of working-age populations
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   "will be crucial to whether humanity prospers or withers."
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Now, before I provide my commentary,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   I want to read to you just a couple of headlines.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   I went to news.google.com,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   and I searched "birth rate."
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   And here are some of the articles that came up.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   "China's birth rate drops for a fifth straight year
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   "to record low."
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   That was CNN from two days ago.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   National Wales, the National Wales newspaper.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Quote, "Birth"-- headline,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   "Birth rate continues to decline across Wales."
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Vox.com, "The Great Population Growth Slowdown."
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   The Citizen, December 29,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   "India's fertility rate drops,
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   "women more conscious than men."
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Hindustan Times from 14 days ago,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   "Birth rates in 10 Chinese provinces
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   "fell below 1% in 2020," report.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Business Insider has this headline,
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   "The pandemic baby bust is a lot smaller than expected."
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   And if you read that headline and dig into it,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   what it means is that somebody had predicted
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   that there would be 300,000 missing babies
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   due to the pandemic.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   I guess the Brookings Institute--
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   the Brookings Institute previously forecasted
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   300,000 to 500,000 fewer babies born
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   because of the pandemic.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Well, in fact, there were 60,000 fewer babies born
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   because of the pandemic.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   So there is a baby bust,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   but it's smaller than that one institution predicted.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   So one of these silly nonsense stories.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   All right, now if I add in 2021,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   birth rate 2021, here are the headlines.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   I'll skip the citation.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Reuters, "China's birth rate drops to record low in 2021."
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Inquirer, "China's birth rate drops to record low in 2021."
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   Kaiser Health News, "US death rates up,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   "birth rates hit record lows."
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Blame COVID, of course.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   SILive.com, "US coronavirus baby bust is here,
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   "research shows."
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   So what does that mean?
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   China Daily, "Birth rate falling below 1%,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   "an early warning."
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   And then we continue on.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   And then if you add in other clarifying things,
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   like birth rate, US birth rate 2021,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   you see that across all of it,
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   there is a significant decline in birth rates.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   And so we're still waiting for all the data from 2021,
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   but there is a significant decline in birth rates.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   So what's going on here?
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   What we see is quite simply,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   people are having fewer children.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   And if you want to see this in your own life,
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   here is a mental experiment that you can do.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Remember that in order for a population to be stable
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   due to birth rates, not growing, not declining,
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   every single woman in a population
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   must have 2.1 children.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   In order for a population to be stable,
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   every single woman in that population
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   must have 2.1 children on average.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   That's what's necessary for stability.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   Not growth, but stability.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   Now do a little mental experiment.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Look around you.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   Look around you at your job.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Look around you with your friends.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Look around you at your church.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Look around you at your neighborhood.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   And start counting the percentage of women that you know
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   who have or are likely to have 2.1 children
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   in their lifetime.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Now if you're 21 years old,
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   this may not yet be apparent to you
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   because you might look around and say,
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   "Well, maybe a lot of my friends will have 2.1 children."
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   But when you start to reach 30, 35, 40,
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   and you start to look around,
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   all of a sudden the trends become massively more clear.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   You see that very, very few of your female friends
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   or very, very few of the women that you observe
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   have 2.1 children or more.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   There are a lot that have zero.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   And if a woman has a child at all,
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   it's quite common that she may have one
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   or perhaps two children.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   My wife and I, we have four children.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Like Elon, we're trying to do our best to lead by example
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   and not contribute to population decline.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   We're trying to grow our family tree.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   And yet, even though we have four children,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   which is not that much more than 2.1,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   most people consider us to have a large family.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Most people consider us to have a large family.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   And I know almost nobody who has more than four children.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   I have a few friends who have more.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   I'm the youngest of seven myself.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   I have, let's see, one friend, they have six.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   I have another friend who has five.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   But very rarely do most people that I know
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   have more than four children.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   And when you think about how many of those of us
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   with four children are balancing off people
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   who have zero or one or two,
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   then you start to see the trend.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   You could just see it with your own eyes.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   This leads to population decline.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   But it doesn't just lead to a declining population
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   in an abstract sense.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   What it leads to is a disruption
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   and a transformation of society.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   Let me talk about what some of those transformations
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   and changes are and how they affect people.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Number one, it leads to a graying of the population.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   You have lots of older people.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   This can lead to all kinds of difficult things.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   For example, what you see is that in many nations,
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   because there are so many old people,
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   old people hold a lot of political power.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   And thus they get to vote and express that power
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   by sheer virtue of their population.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   But this leads to a lot of frustration
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   amongst younger people.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   You'll talk to many younger voters.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   You see this play out in politics.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   You'll have a young, who would be, I guess,
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   would be a good example.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   You have this young, very popular, fiery,
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   public young politician.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   And yet some of her most ambitious projects
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   and some of her most ambitious initiatives
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   are continually stymied by old, gray fellow representatives
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   who are representing a significant portion
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   of the United States.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   This happens on a global basis.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   So you can have political frustration that happens.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   Because if people are supposed to vote
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   in favor of their interests,
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   what you wind up with is a system
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   that more and more favors older people
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   voting for themselves.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   This is especially difficult because many of the legacy systems
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   under which we live were built under the assumption
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   that there would be continual population growth.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   A good example is simply the ratio
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   with the Social Security system of the United States
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   is looking at the ratio of covered workers
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   to the number of beneficiaries.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   In 1940, the first year that Social Security
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   was founded in the United States,
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   there were 35 million, 35.3 million workers
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   versus 222 million, sorry,
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   there were 222,000 beneficiaries
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   and there were 35 million workers
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   for a ratio of 159 workers for every beneficiary.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Also remember, of course,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   that the average life expectancy
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   when Social Security was founded was much, much lower.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   By 1945, that number had dropped dramatically
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   to a ratio of 41.9 workers per beneficiary.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   1950 dropped to 16.5, 1955 8.6,
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   1960 5.1 workers for every retiree,
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   1965 4.0, 1970 3.7, 1980 3.2,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   1990 3.4, remember you had this high degree
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   of stability due to the baby boom
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   that happened after World War II
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   and then we've been slowly dropping more or less.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   It has been stable from about 1990
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   through about 2005, 2007 it was 3.3,
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   2008 3.2, 2009 3, 2010 2.9,
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   2011 2.9, 2012 2.9, 2013 2.8.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   And remember where we are in terms of the baby boomers retiring.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   You've got this massive golf ball
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   that's been moving through the snake
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   and every day more and more baby boomers retire,
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   more and more start to take.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   And here's what's happening also.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   It's standard financial advice
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   that a retiree waits until age 70 to take Social Security.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   So you see these numbers played out there.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   So politically this affects a nation.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   Economically it affects a nation.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   This is one of the reasons why the danger
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   is so significant for the collapse of globally
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   all of the systems that are the entitlement programs
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   that are built to protect aged workers.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   So Security, Medicare, Medicaid in the US
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   and various countries options as well.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   When you have a society in which there are many workers
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   supporting a few retirees,
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   then that can be stable.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Most of us have this desire to want to support other people
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   and want to support the aged and those who are poor, etc.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   But when you have a very few number of workers,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   the burden gets very, very heavy.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   And this is exacerbated by the personal circumstances
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   of those workers.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Let me just use an example.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   I like to use my own personal example.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   I'm the youngest of seven.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   One of my sisters died when a teenager.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   And so my parents have six surviving children.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   At this point in time, all of my grandparents have died.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   And so my parents have among their six children
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   a significant number of children
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   who can support them in their old age,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   help them, care for them, pay for them if they need it, etc.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   They can support them.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   If my parents needed care,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   then our ability to share the burden of that care,
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   I mean daily physical care of them in their home,
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   caring for their daily necessities,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   the ability to share in that would be quite low.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   This is especially true given the fact
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   that there are a significant number of grandchildren as well.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   My parents currently have 15 grandchildren.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   And so when you think about the age of those grandchildren,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   that if my parents needed care in their 80s, in their 90s,
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   in their 100s, etc.,
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   then there should be a significant number of children
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   and a significant number of teenage and young adult grandchildren
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   that would be available to care for them
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   because their family tree is growing.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   Now if you take that and you compare that
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   with what many people face who don't have children,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   it becomes much more difficult.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   And this is very, very significantly the case in many Asian societies.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   You might have a married couple,
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   a married couple that has chosen or either chosen by will
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   or chosen through circumstance not to have children.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   And then their parents start to age.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   And if their parents are alive,
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   instead there are--excuse me--
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   both parents have had a single child.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   That individual child has married another person of an individual child.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   And so it's not--and then they've chosen not to have children.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   It's not uncommon to then have two people
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   who are caring for four aging parents with no help.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   That's a tremendous, a huge burden.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   It's an absolutely massive burden
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   to have two people caring for four parents.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   And so if you compare a declining population of, again,
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   only child, only child who gets together, married,
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   don't have children, and then have four parents to care for,
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   as compared to an expanding population of what I described in my own family,
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   you can see the difference in terms of the social weight that happens.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   If you've never cared for an aging parent, let me tell you,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   it disrupts everything in your life.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   It's a tremendous, tremendous challenge and a burden.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   It's obviously an honor, but it's a tremendous burden.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   And so this has a major effect on society.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   This more importantly has an effect on many, many institutions.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   If you think about all the institutions that are fueled by young people,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   all of those institutions start to slowly collapse.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   You see declining attendance at schools,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   declining attendance at colleges, et cetera.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   And so this creates major disruptions in the workforce.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   You see major challenges in jobs that are traditionally entry-level.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   You can't get enough workers because there are not enough young people to go into that.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   And this leads to more and more disruptions in society.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   Now, I'm not a catastrophist.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   I think that humanity, as always happens, will adapt and adjust, will change to it.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   But if you understand this issue, you can see the conflicts being played out,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   and you can understand where many things are likely to go.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   I'll give you an example.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   Immigration.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   The reason that a country like the United States has continued to be strong population-wise
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   and experience overall a growing population is due to immigration.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   Immigration has been a major influence.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   And so if you understand where these trends are going, though,
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   you understand that the anti-immigration political factions are destined and doomed to failure.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   They cannot succeed.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   So this is where you have large numbers of people in the United States
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   who oppose all kinds of immigration and especially oppose illegal immigration,
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   but oppose all kinds of immigration.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   Those systems are doomed to failure.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   One of the things that I personally feel is absolutely certain is that in the coming decades,
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   every single attractive economy around the world will have to rework its immigration system
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   to seek very vigorously to attract immigrants to it.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   So places like the United States that currently have very difficult and impossible sometimes immigration systems
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   will have to transform all of their systems because they must attract immigrants
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   in order to keep the system going in some way.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   But that's not a universally good thing.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   It's not a universally good thing because this brings tension to society.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   Immigration brings societal strife and factions
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   because you start to get immigrants that often cluster together.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   This creates communities.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   And if the immigrants aren't successfully assimilated into the current population,
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   then that political strife is only exacerbated.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   You have us versus them, a significant level of trust.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   Why are those people speaking Spanish? Maybe they're talking about me.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   Why are those people speaking Arabic?
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   And it creates just deep, low levels of trust.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   Human beings fundamentally have a problem, a very, very hard time trusting people
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   who don't look like them, who don't dress like them,
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   who don't share the same cultural traditions, the same cultural values, etc.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   And absent some kind of unifying religion, meaning something that can cross those boundaries
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   of skin color and language, etc., with universal principles that are applicable to all
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   and unify diverse groups, without that, you wind up with a fractured society,
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   with a low-trust society.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   And this is very, very dangerous because it can lead to tension, to strife, etc.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   And so you see this in many parts of the world.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   I think very prominently you see this right now in Europe, many parts of Europe,
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   where Europe's demographics have been utterly transformed by immigration,
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   and yet there's been major challenges to figure out how do we help these immigrants
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   to assimilate into the culture.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   And as the culture has become weak and not standing for something,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   then what happens is whoever has the strongest principles winds up winning.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   And so you see a society in a time of transition, like you see right now all around Europe.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   But this is not only limited to Europe.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   This is going to happen systematically on a global basis,
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   because this population collapse is a global phenomenon.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   It's more pronounced in certain areas than in others, but it is a global phenomenon.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   In addition to broad-scale economic trends, social trends,
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   one thing that genuinely concerns me personally is the potential for a decline in innovation,
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   decline in creative thinking, etc.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   Human beings are the single most valuable resource that we have.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   The single most important thing that exists in the world is human beings.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   The human brain, the human intellect, the human creativity, the human spirit.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   Human beings, people are your resource.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   If you think about this with regard to disaster planning, it's a good example, right?
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Imagine there's some horrible doomsday thing that happens.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   The gray cloud of death goes up and there's nuclear war that sets off.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   Well, if you think about it and you think about where would you rather be,
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   how would you live a richer lifestyle?
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   Let me give you two opposing foils.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   On the one hand, you can be a lone survivalist, right?
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   You and your buddy or you and your spouse are out in the woods
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   and you got your bug-out backpacks and you got your tents
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   and you're going to live off the fat of the land out in the woods by yourselves.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Or on the other hand, you've got a community of, say, 500 people
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   that all speak the same language both literally and metaphorically.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   They understand how each other thinks.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   They share a common culture, a common heritage.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   They're comfortable with one another.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   They love one another, et cetera.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   And they live together in a small community.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   If you could join either of those groups, which would you join?
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   You'd be a fool to want to go be with the two guys out in the woods.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   You would be destined to live in absolute poverty,
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   scratching a living out of nothing out in the woods.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   And there's a very good chance that all three of you would wind up dead.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   But at any rate, the chance of all three of you surviving would be minuscule.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   Whereas if you could go and you could join a society of, say, 500 people
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   that could work together, those 500 people, if they share a common sense of community,
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   common values, a common understanding of ethics, just a sense of commonality,
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   if you could join that community, you would live very well no matter what the disaster is.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   Because even if resources seem scarce--this is always the classic thing, right?
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   Two guys out in the woods, you're like, "Well, there's deer everywhere
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   and there's moose everywhere."
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Those resources might be there, but those resources are very difficult to get.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   And even if you're Daniel Boone and there's deer all around,
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   you're still just barely eking out an existence.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   Whereas if those 500 people, they may be faced with scarce resources,
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   but the amount of human ingenuity and shared knowledge and creativity
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   among that group of 500 people would be so, so high
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   that give it a couple of years, and even if there were a time of difficulty
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   and you had 20% of them die off with a short-term famine,
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   there would be so much raw labor, there's so much ingenuity and creativity
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   and shared knowledge and historical knowledge that they would be eating well
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   in the community and would have the potential to flourish.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   Now, those are simple examples. There's no guarantee, right?
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   There have been communities of people that have turned their backs on each other
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   and murdered one another, obviously.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   But the point is that human beings are a resource,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   and when you have a declining resource like human beings,
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   you have a declining population, massive amounts of progress in the world
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   can get wiped out. You can wind up with a so-called dark age, right?
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   Where knowledge is not growing and where humans are not expanding
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   and sharing with one another. That's the great danger.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   Human beings are always your ultimate resource.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   And the more human beings there are, the better and the easier
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   it will systematically solve the problems that the world is, the world has.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   However, when we have fewer human beings, we have less intellect,
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   fewer geniuses, less support, less labor, everything starts to get more difficult.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Now, these trends will not be as stark as I described in a group of 500 people,
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   obviously not. Throughout your lifetime, you'll be able to find a place
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   that you're comfortable and you'll be able to work it out.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   But these things will affect your life in many ways.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   They're going to affect your wealth. They're going to affect so many things.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   And we don't know, I don't know, any more than we know that these predictions are accurate.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   You're making a prediction of something that's 78 years in the future.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   How do we know for sure what's going to happen? We don't, right?
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   Could there be some kind of widespread appreciation of the dangers of population decline
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   and people start having lots of babies again? Maybe, right?
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   I'm optimistic. I hope that that's the case.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   I frequently find myself encouraging people, "Have children."
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   But you see why people don't. It's obvious why people don't.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   Let me talk for a moment about that so you can understand.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   We've gone through a very, very significant cultural transformation,
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   a series of them, which makes it extremely difficult for parents to have children,
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   even when they want to.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   Not setting aside, let me first deal with the medical reality of children.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   There is a major problem that seems to exist in many of our circles
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   of people facing significant levels of infertility.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Some of this is just simply-- I'm not sure the word to use.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   It just is, right? It's not a matter of choices.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   For example, the testosterone levels of my generation of men,
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   our testosterone levels collectively are half of the collective testosterone levels of our fathers.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   This is a major, major challenge.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   It's devastating, and the reasons are not fully understood.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   But if you're a man, one of the things that you need to do in 2022 is get your testosterone checked.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   You need to work with a doctor and review the numbers
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   and figure out how you can increase your testosterone if necessary
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   because these low levels of testosterone are very, very bad,
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   and it's horrible for our sons as well.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   If you have boys, you need to study the topic of testosterone
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   and help your boys to make-- and make sure that your boys have high levels of testosterone
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   through proper dietary changes, through all the exercise,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   all the things that can be done,
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   through making sure they have an environment that's not potentially contributing to the decline of testosterone,
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   but it's a major, major significant issue.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   The levels of infertility are significant.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   I haven't dug deep into the data on this, and I'm speaking just from some observation,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   but it's astounding when I personally think about the number of my friends who struggle with infertility,
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   and these are often just happy, normal couples that you would think, like,
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   "There should be no struggle here,"
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   and some of it is probably environmental.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   For example, one of the major trends that has happened is marriage--
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   the average age of marriage and the average age of conception and childbirth
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   has been pushed far, far later than the biologically normal age.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   The biologically normal age at which a woman can give birth is teenage years, right?
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   Post-puberty, teenage years.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   And throughout history, it was very common that a woman would have children
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   starting in her teenage years all the way through for many, many years beyond that,
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   but in today's environment, that is not common.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   And I think all of us are glad to see teen pregnancy rates down.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   There's no question about that as long as they're down for ethically right reasons
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   rather than for immoral reasons.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   But that puts a big difference, right?
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   So it's very, very common if the normal age of marriage is something like 26 right now,
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   it's very, very common that a woman might first start trying to have children
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   at around the age of 30--late 20s, 30, early 30s.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   But her fertility is massively lower at the age of 30 than it is at the age of 18
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   or the age of 20.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   And then the ease of childbirth is massively lower,
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   meaning it's not as easy to have children.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   And so I have many friends, right?
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   They had very difficult first childbirth and they don't want any more children.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   And you go through your circles and you just see then other levels of infertility,
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   whether it's--whatever the cause is, right?
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   I'm no expert on it, but whatever the cause is,
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   there are a significant number of couples in my personal friend circle
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   who you would think would be able to have a couple of children,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   and yet they struggle.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   But biological factors are only one component.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   I think a much more important component are sociological factors.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   Our societies, the modern societies in which we live,
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   are not friendly, generally speaking, to parents, to having children.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   They're not friendly to children.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   And there are many, many levels of this.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   At its core, you see a dramatic financialification
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   or a professionalization of life.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   It's considered quite--what's the right word?--just not appropriate
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   to encourage someone to plan ahead and say, "I want to have children."
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   Very rarely do we ever tell an 8-year-old man,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   "Well, how many children would you like to have?"
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   Very rarely would it ever be considered appropriate to ask a 13-year-old girl,
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   "How many children would you like to have?"
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   Generally speaking, we push our children to professional capacities.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   And what happens is this becomes an even more significant kind of--
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   it's a trend that picks up steam.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   It's a flywheel.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   The more we do it, the more it becomes.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   My wife and I value children.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   We value families.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   I have three boys and one girl.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   And so I think carefully about how do I encourage them?
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   But what happens is we no longer live in a world
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   in which I can exclusively encourage my boys and my girls
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   to simply focus on, "Hey, have babies."
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   My daughter would perhaps be the most vulnerable here
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   because to think that she would live in a society
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   where she would be valued for being a mother,
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   that's just not the societies that any of us live in.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   Even if we're part of subcultures in which children are more valued
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   than the general culture, that's a significant risk.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   And so basically we all continually prepare our boys and our girls
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   for a professional life.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   We spend years sending them to school, right?
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   12 years of elementary, middle school, high school,
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   years of college education.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   None of that education is related to family.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   None of that education is related to children.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   None of that education is related to anything except making money,
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   except being a fundamental part of the economic world.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   And so then our children feel the necessity to properly respond.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   They feel the necessity to push back and say,
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   "Yes, okay, I was taught to make money, so I need to make money."
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   My parents invested all this money.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   They spent tens of thousands of dollars to educate me
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   so that I could be professionally productive.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   And so it's my job to be professionally productive.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   And even those for whom that's not that big of a deal
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   would feel a restraint in today's world about saying,
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   "I want to have children."
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   When I was thinking about--
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   I've known forever that I wanted to have children,
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   but I didn't go around before being married and ask a woman,
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   I was like, "Well, how many children do you want to have?"
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   That's verboten, right? That's taboo.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   We don't talk like that.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   If a woman went around saying, "I just want to have a lot of babies,"
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   that would be tremendous--
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   she would be a social outcast for that.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   And then it becomes a continuing self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   The more we financialize, the more we professionalize
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   the training of our children,
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   and the fewer children our children themselves are around,
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   then what happens is we create a world
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   in which they're not really comfortable with children.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   And since there's not a need to have children--
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   meaning you can have all the sex you want without children
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   in the modern age of birth control, abortion, etc.--
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   there's no biological need to have children.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   And you can function pretty well in society without children.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   There's no longer any stigma for not having children.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   There's no stigma for being single.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   There's no stigma for being a couple that doesn't have children.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   Then what happens is it becomes more and more of it.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   And so in the circles of people that I talk to,
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   it's very common that I speak to people
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   who have no ambition to have children--
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   just not important to them.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   Obviously, I don't think anyone should be forced to have children.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   But these trends are continuing, is my point.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   They're continuing.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   And again, they're self-fulfilling.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   Many people who don't want to have children,
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   they often just didn't have a great childhood.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   And they're not around happy families.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   They're not around other families with children.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   And all they hear is negative jokes about children.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   If you want to drive Joshua Sheets crazy,
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   just come and open your mouth around me
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   and say something mean to children.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   Our society is riddled with this and it drives me nuts.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   I talk about the terrible twos and all this nonsense.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   Don't get out of here with that.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   Do not speak down about children.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   Children are the future of our civilization.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   And they deserve to be honored, not discriminated against,
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   not made fun of.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   If you're one who makes fun of millennials
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   or makes fun of stupid teenagers and kids these days,
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   you're the problem.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   It's your discrimination that is causing people to stop.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   Don't make fun of people.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   Build people up.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   And if you see weaknesses, don't make fun of them.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   Get in and help.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   Because you sure don't make people want to have babies
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   when you talk down about them, when you insult them.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   There are other trends, though, that cause people to--
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   cause our society to be unfriendly to children.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   As a parent who's actively living this,
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   I'll tell you that society is unfriendly to children
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   because there's not much of a village that exists
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   at this point in time, especially speaking broadly.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   There's a classic thing that has become--
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   it's in some circles quite in vogue to joke about--
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   people say it takes a village to raise a child.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   And there's an expression, I think, of where that does go too far,
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   meaning that I believe personally in the sovereignty
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   of the nuclear family unit.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   My wife and I don't look to other people for their approval
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   about what we do with our children.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   They're our children.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   I don't look to anybody for permission.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   I don't ask any permission.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   I don't look for other people to control anything.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   But there's a reality in which it does very much take a village
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   to raise a child.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   And what we find is with the intense, again,
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   professionalization of society,
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   there's not a lot of support that parents get.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   There's not a lot of support.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   And so it's very, very difficult to raise children in the modern context
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   because you pretty much wind up doing it all yourself.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   And the society in general has become so unfriendly to children--
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   and I'm not saying that people are unfriendly.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   Most people are nice to children.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   But what I mean is the society has become unfriendly to children
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   such that if you're raising children, you find yourself continually burdened.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   You continually have to do it yourself.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   Let me give you an example.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   Recently we rented a house in Orlando, Florida.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   We were there for about a month and a half.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   And we were in this beautiful golf community.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   And it was nice.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   Beautiful Airbnb, beautiful golf community,
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   nice house, beautiful neighborhood, et cetera.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   The amount of pressure--
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   every person that we spoke to in that community was so nice.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   Retirees, beautiful people.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   They were kind.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   Everyone was lovely.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   And they made so many nice compliments about our children.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   But the entire structure of the neighborhood
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   and everything about it was unfriendly to children.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   It was just completely unsuitable to their needs.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   For example, we begin with the house.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   The house, meaning--let me not go with the interior of the house.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   That would be too pedantic.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   But on an exterior basis, there's no yard.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   There's a nicely landscaped front bit,
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   and then there's a back bit that opens up onto a golf course.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   And so the children, of course, can't play on the golf course.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   There is a river there right behind the house, a canal.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   So you have to be careful of that.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   And all the other houses are just set so close.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   And so I let the children go play in the street.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   The street was safe enough.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   And again, all the people were wonderful.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   But it was one of the worst environments possible to have children in.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   It was awful because my boys go down the street,
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   and they ride their scooters down,
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   and they start digging in somebody's yard,
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   and they have to go out--no, don't dig in that.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   They go and dig in someone's trash pile and find some treasures there.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   And they're just being children.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   And yet the social opprobrium for messing up the beauty of the neighborhood
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   would be so significant that I'm on pins and needles all the time
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   trying to make sure that we're good neighbors.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   Now, you could say, "Well, Joshua, clearly a golf community
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   is not necessarily the right move, right?
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   This is a retiree community full of gray-haired people
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   enjoying their last years of leisure."
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   And that's true.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   The problem is where do you go where there is actually a great community for children?
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   Communities are very rarely structured well for it.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   There are some.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   You can find sometimes a few neighborhoods.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   But even if you're fortunate enough to go and engage in one of those neighborhoods,
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   you can't really just let your kids go and play.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   And even if you want to--I'm very much in favor of the ideals of free-range parenting,
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   letting my children go and do,
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   and I think that it's silly that people are more concerned about--
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   it's silly that people are concerned about safety for their children.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   Our children are far safer than they ever were 50 years ago, 100 years ago.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   But what happens is you live in a society in which other people don't get it.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   I'll give you an example.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   When we were in that same neighborhood, I went and let the children go and play.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   And they let them go play in the canal.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   The children could all swim and keep an eye on them.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   But I told them where their boundaries were, which were pretty wide.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   But they had--I can't remember if it was seven or eight houses down.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   There was a big tree.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   I said, "You can go as far as this tree.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   You can go as far as this other landmark down here.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   These are your boundaries."
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   Well, then one morning, here comes the guy from five houses down, hurrying down.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   "I saw your children out playing.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   I just need to make sure they had a home and whatnot."
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   And, of course, he was very kind, and you appreciate that.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   I hope you hear me clearly.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   I'm trying to articulate.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   If you don't talk with parents about these issues,
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   these are some of the things that are happening,
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   and I just want you to be aware of them.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   So the guy was wonderful, right?
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   He was concerned about children.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   He was looking out for their safety, and he wanted to make sure that they were okay,
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   which was great.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   He didn't do anything wrong.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   But this is an example of what exists everywhere.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   As a parent, you can't just let your children go play outside.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   You can't let your children go to the park, because then everyone's asking,
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   "Where are your parents?
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   Where are your parents?"
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   And so what happens is parents have to be on all the time,
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   and there's no suitable place for them to be,
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   even in a neighborhood that's friendly to the children.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   You think about the classic idea about the 1950s.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   "Oh, my friends and I went out to go and play.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   We went out and played sandlot baseball every afternoon after school."
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   Well, number one, you go into a neighborhood,
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   even the most friendly neighborhoods and the most family-friendly towns,
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   the places where there are children and there's virtually no children.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   The streets are barren, so there's no place for your children to play.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   There's no one for your children to play with.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   And then you wind up--and then you put the children--
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   so there's no one for them to play with,
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   and there's very few places that they can play.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   And then when they do play, all the neighbors around are so concerned
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   about the safety of the children that it gets pretty intense.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   And so you've got to be seen sitting out and watching them, et cetera.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   I hope this doesn't sound like complaining.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   I guess I'm just trying to articulate that the whole concept
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   of society being friendly for children is not.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   Now, take that into where most people live, which is in a city.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   Have children, what happens? You need a bigger place.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   And it's even more difficult to have children in an apartment
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   where you've got to go down and buzz yourself in and out of the doorman
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   or whatever that kind of lifestyle is.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   So what happens? Well, where do your children find friends?
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   Well, it's always school.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   Well, the things that happen with school is school becomes this all-consuming thing,
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   and you wind up carting your children around, being taxi driver here, there, et cetera,
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   structured play times, structured this.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   And so as the number of children grows, then the constraints just become harder and harder.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   And now if I've got three children in baseball, then I've got to drive my kids everywhere.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   And they can't ride the bus, and they're not supposed to take Uber by themselves.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   And so it's just, as you see, it becomes a lot.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   And so what do people need? We need a community.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   And traditionally you could find this in a local area.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   You could find a village. I'm reading my children the book by--what's her name?--Estes,
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   "The Moffat Children." And it's so beautiful.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   It's a beautifully written story about the Moffats.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   And here you see this expression.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   And I don't think it's an idealization.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   I think it was a society that really was in the United States many years ago.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   But you see this sense of people knowing each other.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   And here's this little girl, Jane Moffat, playing in the street up and down.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   And everyone knows it's Jane Moffat.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   They know all the children. They know everybody.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   But in our modern societies, we don't.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   And everything is so separated, at least in the U.S., I'll say.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   In many places it's the same.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   That this is--it makes it hard.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   And so your neighbors--you have a hard time trusting your neighbors
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   because we don't know our neighbors because we sit inside and sit in the air conditioning,
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   sit in the heating, and watch football on TV
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   instead of actually going and playing football in the yards.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   And so it becomes more difficult.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   And I think this is one of the things that contributes significantly.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   When you have parents that want children, that value children,
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   every additional child that you have becomes this intense, difficult price.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   You're going to pay the price because it's tough.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   That's not even getting into the infrastructure, etc.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   So what are--what am I saying?
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   I guess I'm just trying to articulate that I get it.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   I get why people don't have children.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   I get why people don't have children at all.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   I get why people don't get married.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   I get why people don't have lots of children.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   And yet this contributes to this significantly declining birth rate.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   Now I don't worry about--I don't think these problems are insoluble.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   I've worked hard to solve many of these problems for myself and for my family.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   I have some solutions to some of them,
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   but a lot of times they're not easy solutions,
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   nor are they universally accepted or acceptable solutions.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   For example, I find a lot of the community that my family needs,
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   we find that in subcultures.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   I have religious subcultures of which I'm a part.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   I have ideological subcultures, homeschool groups, etc.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   People who are religious tend to have a lot of children,
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   or at least more than average.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   People who are homeschoolers tend to have more children,
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   at least more than average.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   And so what happens is because you find communities of people
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   that share the same problems,
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   then you can put together a community to handle those things.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   You can find neighborhoods, find properties, find things that work for you,
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   and you can create a solution.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   But on the whole, these kinds of subcultures are fringe.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   They're fringe groups.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   They're not mainstream at all.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   They're not easily findable.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   They're fringe groups.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   And so you've got to be aware of the fact that this is what's happening in society.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   Let me pivot now and talk about some pieces of advice.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   And I'm going to give this fairly broadly.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   Let's begin with just some general advice.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   Number one, make sure that your personal financial goal
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   is not to be dependent on systems of society.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   Because as I see it right now,
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   the graying population will hold the levers of control
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   in most democratically controlled societies because of their sheer numbers.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   But at some point in time, young people are going to rebel.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   And you see this happening with the movement to drop out.
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   You see this happening in many ways.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   But I think that there are some long-range trends.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   The systems that were designed for the world of the 1940s no longer work.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   They don't work.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   They're not going to work.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   They're going to continue to collapse over the coming decades.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   And it's as simple as that.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   It's certain that they're going to collapse.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   Now, there will be a time in which I think they can be patched together.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   Remember, immigration is how most countries are trying to solve this,
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   trying to hold up the welfare state based upon immigration.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   That works as long as there are significant numbers of fecund societies
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   that are creating lots of young people that are willing to go abroad.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   But as these mainstream--if this trend continues,
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   those societies themselves will not have as many people available to immigrate.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   And so immigration can keep some of the leaders ahead.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   Immigration can keep the United States going.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   Canada is desperately trying to keep going with immigration.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   Immigration can fuel some of the growth in the U.K. and Western Europe, etc.,
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   for a time.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   But there will come a point in time in which immigrants will be less attracted.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   I think this is already happening in the United States.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   I think that so much--I think the demand for immigration to the United States
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   has been dramatically hurt.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   I can't prove that. I don't have any data at my fingertips.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   But I think that just anecdotally, I don't think that on a global basis,
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   highly skilled, highly knowledgeable people are trying to immigrate
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   to a place like the United States as significantly as they once were.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   There are still lots of low-skilled workers that are trying to immigrate to the U.S.,
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   but there aren't a lot of smart, intelligent people because it doesn't have to be.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   We live in a global world, and the opportunities in the United States
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   are not as stark as they once were in terms of their superiority to many places
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   in the rest of the world.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   So this is going to impact society, but you can't be financially dependent on that.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   If you don't have children, and you don't have the state,
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   you need to think about what are you going to have.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   What many people have done is they've substituted the concept of children
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   to take care of me as I age, to provide company for me as I age, etc.,
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   and they've substituted that with the state.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   So if you don't have either of those things, what are you going to have?
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   You're going to need a group. You're going to need some friends.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   You're going to need a group of people committed to caring for one another.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   Ideally, this should obviously be found in your local church.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   It may be found in a local community.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   You might join some form of intentional community.
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   You might get together with your buddies and do something and figure it out.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   But how are you actually going to be cared for if you don't have children
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   and the systems of care that exist in the state continually decline
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   and the things that you don't want to be associated with?
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   Think about that carefully.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   In terms of long-term trends, recognize this is going to be at the background
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   of so many long-term trends, so many political trends,
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   and you seem to be aware of it.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   It's back there in the fabric.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   If you look at this issue and then you look at the world,
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   many of the conflicts that you see are going to be largely inevitable,
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   and they're rather predictable.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   What about in your personal life?
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   I think that personally you should consider if you want to have children.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   If you do, I think it's very much in your best interest to not goof off about it.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   I wouldn't change any other way.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   I think that one of the craziest things that people do is,
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   even with all of the headwinds that I discussed,
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   even the things that are difficult,
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   I don't understand why people don't have more children,
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   especially just successful--let me rephrase.
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   I shouldn't say I don't understand it.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   I do understand it.
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   There are costs to it, but I think the benefits far outweigh the costs.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   I haven't personally met--I've read a few on Reddit, right?
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   But I haven't personally met somebody who's ever regretted having more
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   than a few children.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   I've met a good number of people who had one or two children
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   and said, "I should have had more."
[00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   I think if you recognize that human beings are the basic focus of life
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   and they can be an incredibly rewarding part--
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   and it's what people look at, right?
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   Look at what 80-year-olds care about in their life,
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   and then begin with the end in mind.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   Then do the work in your 20s and your 30s, etc.,
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   to, number one, not only have the plan of having children,
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   but make sure that you have the resources to do it.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   Make sure that you have the resources to solve your problems.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   Develop yourself and train your children to develop themselves
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   so that instead of goofing off, they're prepared to support a family,
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   and they have the training necessary, the education necessary,
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   the skills necessary to earn enough money necessary.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   I would have a very hard time supporting my family in an adequate way
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   if I did not earn a significant amount of money.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   But because I've developed myself and my businesses,
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   then I can do it in comfort, and I can solve a lot of those problems
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   that I described that face you, and money goes a long way towards that.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   So pay attention to that.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   If you have children, recognize that your children are going to be seen as a resource,
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   and so train them for that.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   This might be in a negative sense, right?
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   This is one of the reasons I left the United States.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   There's a crazy, ridiculous, upside-down world that a government
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   that's borrowing money like crazy thinks it can tax everyone,
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   and that government is stealing money from my children,
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   thinking that somehow my children are going to pay it back.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   Well, I think it's dumb for my children to be forced to pay for the money
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   that their great-grandparents stole.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   That's silly.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   Now, I don't think they're going to pay.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   I think that a default is likely, but I wanted to make sure they had an off-ramp.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   I don't want them to think that the United States government sees them as a cash cow
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   and it can just steal their lives, and so I've got to make sure
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   that they're not beholden to any one particular government that sees them that way.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   So that would be kind of the negative view.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   But in the positive view, just recognize that the world is going to be desperate
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000]   for your children.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   The world is going to be desperate for thoughtful, well-educated, disciplined individuals,
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:10.000]   because as the number of competitors declines,
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   then the opportunities open up much more significantly
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   for those who are really skilled and ready for it.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   And so I don't have any sense of uncertainty or crisis about it.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   I think it's just going to be a tremendous opportunity.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   Society will go through major changes.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   That's what happens.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   You go through changes, and there can be massive demographic changes,
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   but change always results in opportunity.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   Sometimes it takes time to figure out where that opportunity is,
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   but change results in opportunity.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   And if you're having children, your children are going to be such a valuable resource,
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   especially your children, right?
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   Not common, ordinary, everyday children, but your children are going to be
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   such a valuable resource that their future is going to be extremely bright.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   I think finally--there are more things I could say,
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   but I think finally what I would say is that if you have children,
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   you will have more of an opportunity to direct the future than those who choose not to.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   The future belongs to the fecund.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   And those who have children and who do--you have the opportunity to mold the future
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   every single day.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   And it's such a powerful responsibility, yes, but it's such a powerful opportunity.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   There's nowhere that you have more opportunity for influence than in your own home.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   So no matter what the difficulties you face are,
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.000]   press forward and influence your children in the proper direction.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   And those who grow, those populations who grow,
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   those are the ones who are going to control the future.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   It's true on--in every level.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   I wish I had a better kind of bang-up thing to close on.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   My conclusion is simply pay attention to the data.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   I don't know what you can do with it today,
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   but this subject is going to be at the backdrop of many major societal changes
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   over the coming decades.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   So pay attention.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   When you see the headlines, you don't need to do much more than read the headlines,
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   but pay attention to the headlines because this is going to be a transformative influence
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   and trend in our lives over the coming decades.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   Are you ready to make your next pro basketball, football, hockey, concert,
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   or live event unforgettable?
