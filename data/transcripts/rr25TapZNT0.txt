[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220]   I should like to call your attention this evening to two of the verses that we read
[00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.880]   at the beginning, namely two verses that are to be found in the Gospel according to St.
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:22.220]   John, chapter 18, verses 36 and 37, verses 36 and 37 in the 18th chapter of the Gospel
[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:32.940]   according to St. John. Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom
[00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.060]   were of this world, then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the
[00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:47.880]   Jews. But now is my kingdom not from hence." Pilate therefore said unto him, "Art thou
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:56.540]   a king then?" Jesus answered, "Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born,
[00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:03.820]   and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth.
[00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:12.780]   Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice." Now I call your attention to this
[00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.000]   incident which took place, you remember, just towards the end of our blessed Lord and Savior's
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.360]   earthly life and course, just before the cross, this incident in which we find him face to
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.280]   face with the Roman governor Pilate. I call your attention to it because it does seem
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:44.200]   to me to show us very clearly the whole tragedy of men and of this world as the result of
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.480]   sin. Now it is an incident, of course, that is full of interest from every conceivable
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.320]   standpoint. It is one of the great dramatic incidents of all history. It has often been
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:05.040]   written about. Painters have often tried to portray it and to catch what they imagine
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.320]   were the expressions on the face of our blessed Lord and on the face of Pilate. It is one
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.960]   of those great historic occasions, one of those great clashes, as it were, which have
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:23.520]   so profoundly affected the whole story of the human race. But I suggest to you that
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.660]   the real importance of this incident is to be found in this very respect to which I am
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:38.800]   adverting this evening, namely, that it does focus attention upon the whole tragedy of
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:47.600]   men and the whole tragedy of the world in which we live as the result of sin. Now here
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:58.640]   is the position. Here is the Son of God in the world, who has come down from heaven into
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:07.800]   this world of time. He came down because of the world's troubles, because the world was
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:16.400]   then as it is now, a place of troubles and trials and problems and tribulations, a place
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.280]   of sin and unhappiness and wretchedness. He came into it because it was like that. He
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:32.440]   says so quite definitely, many times over. But he did not come merely to visit it and
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.360]   merely to speak in it and merely to give a certain amount of instruction. He says quite
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:47.640]   definitely that he came into it in order to solve its problems, to bring salvation. The
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:55.200]   Son of Man has come, he says many times, to seek and to save that which is lost. He is
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.680]   the bringer of salvation. That is his whole object in coming into the world at all. He
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:08.800]   is not, I say, some kind of ethereal visitor who comes as a great spectacle into the world.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:17.040]   No, he has come with this defined, well-defined object and purpose, namely of coming to us
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.680]   in all our predicament and in all our troubles and trials in order to raise us up out of
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:31.080]   it and to deliver us and to set us free. And yet, you see, what happened to him when he
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:39.680]   was in the world with that object and intention was the kind of thing that we find in this
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:49.440]   text that we are looking at this evening. The human race to which he came, instead of
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.000]   thanking God that he had come, instead of sitting at his feet and drinking in his message
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   and accepting it, and yielding and submitting themselves to him that he might deliver them
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:11.360]   and lead them out of it all, instead of that, the record of the four Gospels is a constant
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:21.640]   record of people being stumbled by him, questioning him, arguing with him, trying to trip him
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:30.480]   and trap him in his conversation, plotting against him, throwing stones at him, saying
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:38.080]   bitter and harsh things about him, spitting in his face, and eventually conspiring against
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:46.360]   him, and arresting him, putting him on trial, buffeting him and mocking him. And here, as
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:52.600]   we are reminded, when an opportunity was given to them to allow him to be set at liberty,
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:06:00.360]   choosing deliberately Barabbas, a robber in his place, and trying out with malignity not
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:13.440]   this man, but Barabbas, away with him, crucify him. Now there, I say, surely, the whole problem,
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:20.680]   the whole tragedy of mankind is portrayed for us in the picture and epitomized in the
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:29.160]   speech and the language that is used with respect to it. Now, I say I am calling attention
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:40.360]   to it because it is less still the truth and still the picture. It is because it is such
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:48.460]   a perfect portrayal of what is happening at this very moment. We need not waste any time
[00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:54.760]   in describing the state and the condition of the world again. Surely, we are all painfully
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:02.720]   aware of that. The world is in trouble. The world is in an agony. The world is suffering
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:14.680]   and suffering acutely. And here still is this message from the Son of God. There he is still,
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:24.040]   as it were, offering the same things, putting before us the same proposals. And still his
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:32.360]   fate is the same, to be either ignored or to be misunderstood, to be ridiculed by the
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:43.400]   men, to be blasphemed and cursed. Now, surely, this is something which insists upon our most
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:49.080]   careful attention. Let us then look at these people who were his own contemporaries when
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:54.800]   he was here in the flesh, and who, I say, so perfectly represent the average modern
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.280]   men, the majority of people in the world tonight, who are not interested in Christianity and
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:06.200]   who reject it. Now, let us analyse these people and see if we can discover why it was that
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:12.640]   they treated him as they did. Why was it that they rejected him? Because as we analyse them,
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.440]   we shall incidentally be analysing the modern men in the modern world who does the same
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:25.840]   thing. Well, now, the explanation is here, perfectly clearly on the surface. They treated
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:36.160]   our Lord like this simply because they really did not listen to him. They heard his words,
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:41.160]   but they didn't listen. Now, there's all the difference in the world between hearing
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:48.400]   a man speaking and rarely listening to what he's saying. That can be proved very simply
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:57.600]   like this. Seated in the congregation are a number of people. One person speaks. To
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:03.280]   one, that speech is the word of life; to the other, it's rubbish and nonsense. They were
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:09.240]   both hearing the same words, you see. But there's obviously a difference in the listening,
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:14.960]   isn't there? "Take heed how we hear," says our Lord on one occasion. He warns people
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:20.080]   to be careful about listening. Now, that, I say, was the trouble with his contemporaries,
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:25.400]   especially the Jews, the religious authorities of his own day, and this man Pilate, the Roman
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:32.120]   governor with them. They really didn't listen to him. And they didn't listen to him for
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:40.960]   this reason, that they had got their own ideas and preconceived notions as to what was needed,
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:47.000]   what was wanted. More, the Jews had got very clear and definite ideas of their own as to
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.680]   what the Messiah was going to be like and what he was going to do when he came. And
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:57.680]   the whole trouble was this, that our Lord didn't conform to their ideas. He didn't
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:05.080]   fit into their pattern. He didn't tally with their anticipations. And because he didn't
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:10.080]   do that, they really never listened to him at all. They were impatient with him from
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:17.120]   the very beginning. They were full of these criticisms. And in the end, I say, they turned
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.640]   against him and finally rejected him and crucified him.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:31.880]   Now, that I want to try to show you this evening is still the essence of the trouble. It's
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:37.560]   so baffling that one can scarcely believe it. It's almost impossible to credit it,
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:43.040]   and yet it is a fact that though we've got this open Bible before us, there is as much
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:48.480]   confusion tonight as to what Christianity really is, as there was when our Lord was
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:56.600]   here in the days of his flesh. And it is because of this confusion and muddle as to what Christianity
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:03.280]   is offering to do, what it claims it can do, that men and women in our present crisis and
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:11.840]   predicament are not really availing themselves of it, and in various ways are rejecting it.
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:17.680]   You see, we all seem to start with these prejudices. We think we know what Christianity is, and
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:24.360]   we think we know what it says and what it claims to do. And thus, mankind tonight is
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:31.340]   in this state of muddle and confusion with respect to the exact content of the Christian
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:37.120]   message. There's no excuse for it. There was no excuse for these people. Do you remember
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:44.800]   how our Lord put it on that occasion? When he was questioned by the high priest, our
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.640]   Lord said, "Do you remember the high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples and of his
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:57.840]   teaching? And Jesus answered him, 'I speak openly to the world. I ever taught in the
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:05.280]   synagogue and in the temple. Whither the Jews always resort, and in secret I have said nothing.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:11.160]   Why askest thou me? Ask them which heard me what I have said unto them. Behold, they know
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:17.760]   what I said.'" And it was an unanswerable argument. He'd never concealed anything at
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:22.640]   all. He had spoken in the synagogues. He had spoken in the temple. He'd started his ministry
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:27.080]   in a synagogue in his hometown of Nazareth. You remember when he read that 61st chapter
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:32.280]   of Isaiah and said, "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears." Nothing could have
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:37.560]   been plainer. Yet they didn't see it, and he'd gone on like that in public constantly.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:43.240]   He hadn't said it secretly. One was forming a secret society with absolute openness and
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:52.660]   publicity. There he spoke and he taught, and these people had heard. So I say there was
[00:12:52.660 --> 00:13:00.440]   no excuse for them. And you and I have these records. If Christianity were some kind of
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:05.920]   oral tradition only, then we could understand people being in some confusion about it. We
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:10.320]   would have said, "Ah well, of course the oral tradition went wrong at some point or another.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:21.160]   It divided up into various branches." But we have these records written by his own followers,
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:28.320]   written by these apostles, or else the knowledge and the information was given by them. With
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:33.400]   all the authority of those who knew him best, of the early church, filled with the Holy
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:41.120]   Spirit, we have the record. And yet I say there is this appalling confusion, and that
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:47.880]   is the cause of all the trouble. Well now then, how does this confusion arise? Let me
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:54.520]   divide it up for you as it's put in these two verses that we are looking at together.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:14:01.840]   The first thing that they stumbled over was about his personal. They simply could not
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:10.560]   understand this truth about him as a king. You notice how Pilate keeps on tripping up
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:17.720]   over this, and keeps on putting this same sort of question. Pilate says unto him, "Art
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:25.080]   thou then a king? I don't follow you. You seem to be talking about a kingdom," he says.
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:30.920]   And he'd already said to him, "Art thou then the king of the Jews?" He couldn't follow
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:38.760]   all this, and was very muddled and confused about it all. Now why was that? Why was it
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:44.200]   that they were all so confused about him when he represented himself as a king, and when
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:49.600]   he kept on talking about his kingdom, and the citizens of his kingdom, and the purposes
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:57.440]   and the future of his kingdom? Why all this muddle? Well now, here is the answer. The
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:07.720]   trouble was, you see, that his form of kingship was in such complete contrast to all their
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:16.600]   ideas about kings and about kingship. And the result was, you read the Gospels, and
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.560]   you keep your eye on this, and you'll find it most interesting. You think at times, "Ah,
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:24.080]   they're on the verge of seeing the truth. At last they seem to be following," and then
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:30.000]   they're absolutely muddled again. Why? Well, because he seemed to them to be contradicting
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.840]   himself. He was claiming a thing at one moment, and then he seemed to be taking it back at
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:39.760]   the next. He was saying one thing, but he seemed to be the opposite. Now let me show
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:47.680]   you some of these things which appear to be contradictions to the natural men, and which
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:55.240]   therefore make it difficult for him to see that the Lord Jesus Christ is the King of
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:03.840]   Glory. I start with this for this good reason. If we are not clear about the person of the
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:10.840]   Lord Jesus Christ, we can never know his salvation. You know, there are people who think that
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:15.760]   he was only a man, and that he was a sort of political agitator, or a great moral or
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:21.720]   political reformer. That's their idea, that he just happened to have an unusual intellectual
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:28.240]   ability and an unusual insight into the affairs of men. He was an outstanding political or
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:33.960]   philosophical or aesthetic genius. Just a man, they think, who has put this marvellous
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:39.000]   teaching, and if only everybody accepted it and followed it, the world would be perfect.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:45.680]   That's their notion of him. Well, let me say this at once. If that's your idea of
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:52.960]   his person, not only have you not got the ideas that are given in the four Gospels,
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:17:00.880]   but you'll never know his salvation. We must be absolutely right about the person.
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:05.800]   May I commend you, therefore, my dear friends, during these coming weeks, as we are in this
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:11.680]   season of Advent and going forward to Christmas, read your Gospels again. Go through them.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:16.920]   Look at the person. Look at it, what happened there. Is it just a man, or is it something
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:22.560]   infinitely more? Is this the biggest event in the whole of history, this incarnation
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:28.320]   of the Son of God? Now then, let me show you these two aspects of him, as it were, that
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:35.240]   utterly confused these people, because they'd never really seen through the veil of flesh
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:42.100]   to the glory that lay hidden. Take the very terms that he uses here. Here he is answering
[00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:56.400]   Pilate and he says, "To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world."
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:08.640]   Now there it is, you see, in a phrase. He starts by saying, "To this end was I born."
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:15.560]   Very well, you say, that's a man. A man may very well say about his mission in this
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:20.600]   world and all the work that he does, "I believe that I was born to do this or that."
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:25.280]   That's how men speak. And here is one who speaks as if he were but a man. "To this
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:33.320]   end was I born." Ah, very well, says someone. He was a man after all, you see, and only
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:39.800]   a man. Born? In Bethlehem? Born like everybody else. No difference between him. He's just
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:45.240]   this outstanding genius that's been thrown up, as it were, inexplicably. Ah, but wait
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.160]   a minute. You haven't listened to all he says. Listen to him. "To this end was I
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:53.800]   born." And then the moment you're on the verge of saying, "Ah, he was a man after
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:19:06.120]   all," he goes on and says, "And for this cause came I into the world." Does anybody
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:14.120]   else speak like that? Do you speak about your coming into this world? Have you a right to
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:18.400]   speak in that way? Of course you haven't, and that's why we never do it. Here is
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:22.680]   the one who says, "I was born, but I came into the world." What's it mean? He's
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:28.120]   come from another world. He's a visitor. He's indicating the Incarnation. "I'm
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:37.680]   a man. I'm more than a man. I'm God." He has come into the world. The Word was made
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:45.760]   flesh and dwelt amongst us. He is in the world, but he's not of the world. At the very
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:50.840]   beginning he is unique and he's alone. He stands apart. That's the thing these people
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:56.520]   never grasp. They thought he was only a man. They heard him talking about being born. They
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:01.960]   didn't listen to him when he said, "Came I into this world."
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:11.320]   But come, let's look at another aspect. He talks about being a king. He claims it quite
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:16.360]   definitely. You remember that Pilate therefore said unto him, "Art thou then a king?"
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:22.920]   Jesus answered, "Thou sayest that I am a king," which you might very well translate
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:31.900]   if you like in our modern idiom like this. "You've said it. You've said it, and you've
[00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:37.000]   said the truth." That's what he meant. That was the idiom of the time to convey
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.560]   what we convey by our idiom today. He is agreeing that he is a king, and he immediately talks
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:50.620]   about his kingdom. And Pilate doesn't mistake this.
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:55.560]   But you see, here was the problem for Pilate and for all these Jews. Here is one who calls
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:07.400]   himself a king, and yet he's a carpenter. Born in a lowly manner, living a very lowly
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:13.640]   and a very ordinary life, working with his hands. "That's not kingship," they said.
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:21.080]   Who is this man? He calls himself a king, and yet he's an artisan, an ordinary workman.
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:26.240]   They were baffled and bewildered by this, and they were constantly questioning him.
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:30.680]   They just looked at what they saw. They didn't see what was hidden, as it were, what he was
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:38.040]   always suggesting to them. Confusion at that point. Then let me go on to another.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:45.720]   He talks and he teaches with authority. He speaks about truth. He says that he's come
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:51.480]   into the world that he should bear witness unto the truth, and that everyone that is
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:59.880]   of the truth "heareth my voice." Here he is speaking as an authoritative teacher.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:06.240]   And yet, you see, he wasn't a Pharisee. He'd never been to the schools of the Pharisees.
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:11.800]   He'd never had any training as a teacher. They said, "How hath this man learning, never
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:17.400]   having learned?" This man who claims that as a king he speaks with authority, well,
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:23.400]   where does his authority come from? Where does he derive it? He doesn't conform to our
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:29.640]   ideas of a teacher. He's contradicting himself. He says he's something. He proves he isn't.
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:42.740]   Then let me give another. He talks so much about his reign and about his kingdom. A great
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:48.360]   deal of his teaching you'll find recorded in these four Gospels is about his kingdom.
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:54.200]   Parables of the kingdom, the Sermon on the Mount about the laws of his kingdom, always
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:59.280]   talking about his kingdom, the kingdom that's going to come, and so on. Well, here he is.
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:05.200]   He talks in a big way, they said, about his reign and about his kingdom. And yet he's
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:11.400]   got no land. He's no lands. He's no territory. They said, "We've never heard of a king without
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:16.360]   a territory. There's never been such as a king without a kind of domain or dominion."
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:23.280]   Here is a man who stands up and says, "I am a king. I have a kingdom." And yet you read
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:32.240]   of him on one occasion something like this. "Then went every man unto his own house. And
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:40.440]   Jesus went to the Mount of Olives." He never owned even a house in this world, not a flat,
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:46.000]   not a room, nothing. "The Son of Man hath not whereon to lay his head," he says. He
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.240]   never owned a shack, nothing at all. And yet he says he's a king. Here are the contradictions.
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:59.360]   They said, "Who is this? How can this be kingship? No territory and domain, not even
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:09.600]   a place whereon to lay his head, which he can call his own." And then I say once more,
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:16.000]   he talks about this reign of his and about this ruling of his. And yet when they came
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.320]   to look round, they said, "Well, where are the citizens of this great kingdom of his?"
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:25.480]   Men like Pilate would have said, "I serve my master, the emperor of Rome, and he's
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:31.600]   got a great empire, and he's got these teeming masses of people in all these various lands,
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:36.440]   all recognizing his supreme authority, all making their obeisance. That's our idea
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:46.120]   of kingship, where men with a great host of citizens scattered throughout the lands. And
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:52.360]   here is one who calls himself a king, and he seems to be gathering around him just a
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:58.440]   handful of very common people, none of the great and mighty and noble. The common people
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:04.000]   heard him gladly, just the rabble, as it were, publicans and sinners, harlots, people like
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.640]   that. Here's a king, one who talks so big, but there's his citizens, there are his
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:16.120]   citizens, that's his sort of kingdom." And then for me to end this particular point,
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:20.880]   but you see I'm making a hurried survey of the whole of the Gospels, take this last
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:29.760]   one. As a king he talks about his power, and he talks a great deal about his power, and
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:34.240]   he seemed to have it because he could work miracles. He could even stop a storm at sea
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:42.560]   and silence the wind, and reduce the billows to a calm. Power! And yet here he is standing
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:49.880]   before Pilate as a helpless prisoner, who was arrested in a garden without the slightest
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:56.460]   difficulty, and who in a few hours is to be nailed on a cross, and who dies in apparent
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:04.760]   utter weakness and helplessness. Now there, you see, is the whole picture. He just didn't
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:11.040]   fit into their ideas of kingship. They said, "We know something about kings, we've seen
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:15.400]   them, we've read our history books. We know something about kingship. You say that you
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:21.640]   are king? How can you be a king and yet be what you are?" They were baffled and bewildered.
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:32.120]   They never understood his person. And as I have said, the same confusion still persists.
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:40.040]   The whole trouble in the world tonight is just this, that the world doesn't say in the
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:49.440]   children's hymn, "I love to hear the story which angel vices tell." How once the King
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:57.640]   of Glory came down on earth to dwell. They have not realized it. They haven't seen it.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:01.240]   They're thinking of him in other terms. They're putting him into their categories. He's just
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:05.600]   one of the philosophers. And so you hear them speaking constantly about Plato, Socrates,
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:11.040]   Jesus, and the rest. Or they put him amongst the prophets. They talk about Moses and Elijah
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:16.440]   and Isaiah, Jeremiah and Jesus. They put him as a man and they leave him there. And so
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:27.600]   they never hear his message. They never see the deity that is veiled in the flesh. They
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.640]   are baffled by the superficial apparent contradictions.
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:37.320]   But come, let me hurry on to my second point, which is this. They never seem to be able
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:43.640]   to understand what his kingdom was not. Now I've got to put the negative because he puts
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:52.440]   it himself. Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not of this world." And then to make sure
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:58.720]   that they've got it, that he's got it this time, he says it again. "But now, is my kingdom
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:06.000]   not from hence, not from the world."
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:13.280]   Now this again is of vital importance. Because there are a number of people in the modern
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:19.040]   world who are perfectly right on the first point I've been making, but who seem to go
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:24.160]   tragically wrong about this one. And you see, if we go wrong about him and his teaching
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:30.360]   at any point, we shall never know his salvation. We've got to accept him as he is, and in his
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:36.800]   entirety. So we must be perfectly clear about the character, the nature of his kingdom.
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:40.480]   And therefore we must first realize what it is not.
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:49.080]   Let me put it very simply and plainly. I confess I find myself in somewhat of a difficulty
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:56.280]   as I proceed to this second point. I don't apologize for saying what I'm going to say,
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:03.640]   but I do bitterly regret that I've got to say it. Some of the confusion about this point
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:11.040]   is caused by the church herself, by the teaching of certain people who are in prominent positions
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:18.380]   in the Christian church, and who are muddling and confusing mankind today, and standing
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:24.920]   between them and the Son of God and his salvation. And that is why I'm calling your attention
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:37.120]   to these things. His kingdom, he says, is not like earthly kingdoms. In what way? Well,
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:47.040]   first of all in this way. It is not a visible kingdom. It isn't an external kingdom. He
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:52.840]   said himself, "The kingdom of God cometh not with observation." An earthly kingdom you
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:57.520]   can see, the kingdom of Great Britain, for instance. It's visible, it's obvious, it has
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:03.040]   its limits, it can be defined. We know all about it. It can be seen, it cometh with observation.
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:08.960]   It can be observed and examined. He says his kingdom isn't like that. It's quite different.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:13.200]   Now you see, that's where they went wrong. They would persist in estimating what he said
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:18.320]   in terms of their visible external kingdoms, and because his didn't correspond, they said
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:30.680]   this is no kingdom. In the same way, his kingdom, he says, is not great in an earthly sense.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:36.680]   There is no pomp and show with respect to it. Now, he put this very plainly on one occasion,
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:41.600]   so I'm going to read you the verses in which it's recorded. In the twentieth chapter of
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:48.800]   the Gospel according to St. Matthew, verses 25 to 28, listen to this. He'd said this to
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:55.720]   them, and he said it many times, and he emphasized it. "Jesus called them his own disciples who
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:31:03.600]   were muddled at this point. He called them unto him and said, 'You know that the princes
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:12.080]   of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:18.960]   upon them. But it shall not be so among you, but whosoever will be great among you, let
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:25.960]   him be your minister. And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be as your servant,
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:34.240]   even as the Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister and to give his life
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:41.200]   a ransom for many.'" You see, there's the trouble. Now they said we are accustomed to kingdoms
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:46.760]   of this sort. There is the great prince on his throne, and everybody's dancing attention.
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:52.240]   He remains there. They bring him everything. He does nothing. Everything is done for him.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:59.680]   They minister unto him. But he says, "You know, my kingdom isn't like that, and I myself
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:07.800]   have not come to be ministered unto, but to minister and to give my life a ransom for
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:14.200]   many." And just before he went to the cross, behold him, the king of glory, the everlasting
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:20.920]   king. He took a towel, and he washed their feet, and he wiped them with the towel. Is
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:27.160]   this a kingdom? It's all wrong, they said. This is baffling. It's bewildering. You see,
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:33.400]   they hadn't listened to what he'd said. "My kingdom is not of this world. It doesn't belong
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:41.080]   to the same category. You must drop your own old thinking. This is new in every sense."
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:46.600]   And again, you see, we can put it like this, that because it's different, he has no armies.
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:52.640]   He has no great officials. He hasn't a great hierarchy of officers, and there's no great
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:33:01.400]   pomp and show and ceremony. Alas, my friends, the Church herself has forgotten that, hasn't
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:08.240]   she? And she has become so much like the earthly kingdoms, with her great pomp and show, and
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:15.800]   her dressing up, and all her ceremonial, and all her hierarchies. It's not in the New Testament,
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:21.680]   but alas, it's come into the Church, the very confusion against which he warned people,
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:29.200]   and here warns Pilate. And so, he puts it quite simply. He says, "You know, if my kingdom
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:35.240]   were an earthly kingdom, I shouldn't be arrested as I am now, and the high priest wouldn't
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:39.720]   have sent me to you. I'd have had soldiers, and they would have protected me and defended
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:45.080]   me against the Jews, and the Jews would never have been allowed to arrest me. But," he says,
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:49.440]   "my kingdom is not like these other kingdoms. It doesn't look like them. It's not like them
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:56.720]   in any respect. Indeed, it isn't like them like this." And this is my second point here.
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:05.840]   His kingdom is unlike earthly kingdoms, in that it is not concerned about the kind of
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:13.080]   thing that earthly kingdoms are concerned about. Now then, here is the very essence
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:23.520]   of the modern difficulty. The Jews always wanted our Lord to deliver them from the Roman
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:30.280]   Empire. Before our Lord came into this world, the Roman Empire had conquered Palestine and
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:35.080]   the Jews. That was why Pilate was there. He was the representative of the Roman Emperor
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:39.680]   and the Roman power. Now then, the Jews, of course, didn't like that. They'd got a nationalistic
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:45.040]   spirit, and they thought that when the great Messiah came, he would come as a great warrior,
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:49.880]   he'd form a great army, he'd lead them against the Romans, and with his power he'd conquer
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:55.400]   the Romans, he'd dismiss them from the country, he'd set up the Jews, he'd elevate them to
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:35:01.400]   the highest position, and indeed he might end as a great world conqueror. And when Jesus
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:06.120]   began to preach and to say that he was the Messiah and the King, and that he'd come to
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:11.440]   found a kingdom, they said, "Well now then, when are you going to do this?" Their ideas
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:15.480]   were political and they were military, and they were always waiting for him to speak
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:21.920]   in that way, but he wouldn't do it. Do you remember how we are told in the sixth chapter
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:26.760]   of this Gospel, according to St. John, that on one occasion they tried to take him by
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:36.240]   force to make him a king, and he fled away from them up on top of the mountain? Do you
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:41.800]   remember how often they tried to get him to speak about these things? Do you remember
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:46.320]   how one afternoon the Herodians and others came to him and they pulled a coin out of
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:55.280]   their pockets, and they said, "Now we've got a question to put to you. Is it lawful to
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:36:02.080]   pay tribute unto Caesar or not?" Very clever question. They wanted him to commit himself
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:08.400]   on the political issue, and the whole relationship of the Jews to Rome. And do you remember,
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:12.900]   he saw it and he wasn't to be drawn. He said, "Let me see that coin," and he put it in his
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:18.720]   hand and he said, "Whose is this image and superscription?" They said, "Caesar's." "Very
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:23.120]   well," he said, and he didn't begin to deliver a political oration and say, "It's a shame
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:26.960]   that we've ever been conquered." By the time we rose up and delivered ourselves out of
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:31.000]   this, he didn't suddenly turn politician. No, no, this is what he said. "Whose is this
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:37.440]   image and superscription?" They said, "Caesar's." "Very well," he said, "render unto Caesar
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:44.780]   the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's, whose image is
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:49.960]   on you. You're interested in the coin. What about yourself? I'm concerned about you, not
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:58.880]   coins, but souls, men. Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:08.000]   things that are God's." Even John the Baptist seems to have been stumbled at this point.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   He sent his two disciples to ask his famous question, "Art thou he that should come or
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:19.560]   do we look for another?" "I thought you were he," says John, as it were, "but I'm beginning
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:23.560]   to doubt it. You're spending your time up there in Galilee with just a handful of common
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:28.680]   people and preaching your sermons and doing your miracles. When are you coming to Jerusalem?
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:40.320]   When are you going to do the big thing?" But our Lord, my friends, never spoke politics.
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:52.040]   Never touched them. Never had anything to say about the contemporary political situation.
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:56.920]   As he put it to his father and mother on that occasion when they went back, having thought
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:00.280]   that he was with them on the journey, but they went back and they found him in the temple,
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:05.640]   he said, "Wist ye not that I must be about my father's business? Wist ye not that I must
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:11.120]   be about the things of my father? Read your four Gospels. Try to see him dealing with
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:16.480]   contemporary political or social events. He never touches them. Neither did his apostles.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:22.160]   Go through the book of Acts. Read the epistles. You don't find it there. It isn't there."
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:26.080]   And if he were here tonight, he would not be talking about sewers. He would not be talking
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:30.920]   about the problem in South Africa. He would not be dealing with these political questions.
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:35.280]   And yet we are being told that Christianity comes right into politics and that the tragedy
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:40.520]   of the world is that the Church isn't preaching politics and not interfering with these things
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:49.600]   directly. It's a lie, I say. It's a travesty of the New Testament Gospel.
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:57.520]   But wait a minute, says someone. Didn't your Old Testament prophets deal with these matters?
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:03.080]   And the answer is, of course they did. And I say, of course they did for this reason.
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:09.180]   Not that they were politicians, but that the children of Israel were the Church at that
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:17.840]   time. The nation of Israel was a theocracy. She was the Church. She was God's people.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:21.940]   So they speak to them as God's people. They don't speak to them as they'd speak to any
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:26.560]   other nation. They were not interested in those other nations. They are speaking to
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:35.120]   God about his own people. And the business of Christianity is still to do the same thing.
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:40.320]   In the first instance, the Christian Gospel has got nothing to say to men except that
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:47.360]   they are lost and damned and that they need salvation. Very well, that brings me to my
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:56.120]   last point, which I'll put in this positive form. As they never seem to be able to understand
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:40:04.080]   what his kingdom was not about, so they failed equally to realize what his kingdom was about.
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:10.200]   And here he puts it quite plainly. What is it? It's this. His kingdom is an unseen kingdom.
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:16.680]   It's a spiritual kingdom. It is not of this world. It's something that exists in the hearts
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:22.400]   of men and in the minds of men and in the souls of men. What are the citizens of his
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:29.240]   kingdom like? Here he puts it at the end of verse 37. "Everyone that is of the truth
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:39.640]   heareth my voice." That's his kingdom. That's the realm of his interest. The citizens of
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:46.240]   his kingdom are not those who belong to nations as such. They are those who, having heard
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:53.800]   his word, have recognized it as the word of God, the word of salvation, the word of deliverance.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:41:00.120]   They've believed it. They've submitted themselves unto it. They've gone after him. His kingdom
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:06.960]   is a kingdom of truth. "To this end," he says, "was I born, and for this cause came
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:13.960]   I into the world, that I should witness unto the truth." What is the truth? Is this it?
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:19.080]   That if only Great Britain disarmed today and never fought in another battle, that the
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:23.200]   world would suddenly stop fighting, there'd never be another war, and everything would
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:27.560]   be absolutely perfect. Do you know there are people who are preaching that that is the
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:34.360]   gospel? That all we've got to do is to disarm and to let people come and shoot us and shoot
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:39.800]   anybody and do anything they like to anybody. And when people see our action, they'll say,
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:44.840]   "Isn't this marvelous? Isn't it wonderful?" And they'll destroy all their chariots, their
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:54.600]   cannons, and all their tanks, and all their bombs. And where do you find that in the gospels?
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:42:00.160]   Where do you find that anywhere in the Bible? My dear friends, that isn't the truth. Our
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:07.440]   Lord spoke about, "This is truth." It isn't my opinion. It's what he said. Listen. He
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:20.640]   said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father but by me."
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:29.320]   That's the truth. The truth, you see, is about the Father, and about man who's estranged
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:34.400]   from the Father, and about the only way in which man can get back to the Father. That's
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:40.960]   what he talks about. Now, I am challenging you. I am putting it to you as reasonable,
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:50.760]   intelligent people. Go through the four gospels, I say again. And you will find that that is
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:59.440]   what our Lord was always talking about. He didn't say a single word about the political
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:03.960]   issue of the Roman Empire having conquered. Never a word. But this is the sort of thing
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:17.480]   he said. "What shall it profit a man though he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?"
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:23.900]   Which I am entitled to interpret like this. What are you better off if you've got rid
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:34.800]   of the Roman Empire and still die in sin and lose your soul? Is the absence of physical
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:43.400]   warfare the summum bonum? Is the banished physical war the greatest conceivable thing
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:51.640]   in life and in the world? My dear friend, it isn't. Even if the nations of the world
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:58.000]   decided to destroy all their armaments and there was never another war, the real problem
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:06.360]   of men would still remain. To start with, you'll never get that. That's not my opinion
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:13.120]   again. That's our Lord who said there will be wars and rumors of wars. While there is
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:17.720]   sin in a single human breast, there will be warfare. While there is one nation that is
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:26.160]   governed by this, and all nations are governed by that, there will be wars. But I say that
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:31.560]   even if they could decide to put an end to all these things, would the problem be solved?
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:36.320]   Would all be well? Would it be paradise simply because there isn't another war and we don't
[00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:45.000]   have to spend millions on armaments? Of course it wouldn't. You'd still have drunkenness.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.160]   You'd still have immorality. You'd still have theft and robbery. You'd still have
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:57.240]   unfaithfulness, unchastity, adultery, separation, divorce, selfishness, misery, and all the
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:04.520]   rest of it. The problem would remain. Men speak as if physical war is the only problem
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:09.280]   and that the one message of the gospel is just to put an end to that. Our Lord, I say,
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:18.040]   never dealt with it. But he did deal with this other matter and he always dealt with
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:26.600]   it. How can a man be right with God? "I am come, the Son of Man is come, to seek and
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:31.640]   to save that which is lost. I have come to bear witness," he says, "unto the truth."
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:37.400]   And this is the question. How can a man come to the Father? "For," he says, "all are
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:42.040]   estranged from the Father." That's the truth he came to preach. That the Pharisees
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:46.200]   who thought they were perfect, because they fasted twice in the week and gave a tenth
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:50.440]   of their goods to the poor. He said, "You're not, you're sinners. God sees your hearts."
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:57.520]   He convicted men of sin. That's the truth he came to speak about. And of course the
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:05.040]   world doesn't want that and it doesn't like it. And it was because he talked about
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:09.080]   truth of that character that the Pharisees hated and plotted against him and finally
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:15.800]   crucified him. And it is because he speaks about that tonight that men and women won't
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:20.920]   listen to him. If I were your denouncing capitalist or denouncing war and so on, we could sit
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:25.120]   back comfortably. But my dear friend, that's not the truth. The truth is the truth about
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:35.120]   you and the truth to you. That whether there will be a third world war or not, you and
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:43.880]   I have got to die. And you can't evade it and you can't divide it. And after death
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:49.920]   you'll stand before God in the judgment. That's the question. That's the thing the
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:55.680]   Lord Jesus Christ spoke about. You and I are in this position. Whether there's a
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:47:01.160]   war, whether there isn't a war. And how can I stand before him? Because there when
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:06.200]   I stand there, I shall be told whether I'm going to heaven or to hell. And I decide it
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:17.400]   here and now. That's the truth. It's this sin that is in us all that causes the wars
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:23.760]   and all the other problems. And the thing our Lord came to speak about was that and
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:30.360]   how it can be dealt with, how it can be removed, how can we be forgiven, how can we be reconciled
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:39.640]   to God, how can we go to heaven? Those are the questions and he's answered them.
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:45.720]   To this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I might bear witness
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:54.840]   unto the truth. And the truth is that God so loved the world in its folly and blindness
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:48:01.400]   and darkness and shame that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:08.920]   should not perish but have everlasting life. Here's the truth, that he died for your sins.
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:13.680]   He'll reconcile you to God. He'll make you a citizen of his kingdom. He'll prepare
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:20.800]   you for the glory that is coming. That's the truth. And while men are talking about
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:25.800]   politics, they're not talking about that. And while they're criticizing governments,
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:30.280]   I'm not taking any view. I'm not interested primarily as a preacher of the gospel. But
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:34.480]   while they are, and while they're sending their deputations, they're not preaching
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:44.720]   the gospel. And men are dying in sin and they're denying their Lord and Master. That's the
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:54.080]   character of his kingdom. But you know, towards the end, he did speak in a wider and in a
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:49:06.400]   larger sense. He says that while he was here on earth, his kingdom did not come with observation.
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:16.000]   It was a secret, unseen, spiritual kingdom. But let us never forget that he went on to
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:28.520]   say this, that a day is coming when his kingdom also shall come with observation. There is
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:33.640]   a day coming when he'll come again into this world, no longer as the babe, no longer
[00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:39.080]   as the carpenter, no longer with a towel in his hands, washing the feet of his disciples,
[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:47.680]   but riding the clouds of heaven, surrounded by the holy angels. And the archangel will
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:58.600]   announce his coming. That will be a proclamation. And he will come to judge the world in righteousness
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:07.800]   and all its peoples, to conquer all his enemies and all evil and sin, and cast it into the
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:17.080]   lake of perdition, and set up his own glorious and eternal kingdom. Yes, it will be visible,
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:23.000]   a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness. You and I who belong to him
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   as citizens of his kingdom, we shall see him. We'll see a new world, this old world with
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:36.400]   sin taken out of it, glorified, perfected. And you and I with glorified bodies shall
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:51.600]   be with him in it, and shall spend our eternity in his holy presence. Then there will be peace.
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:57.240]   There will never be any war after that. There will be wars until then, my dear friend, let
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:05.040]   me warn you. There will be wars and rumors of wars until he comes back. That's why I
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:10.760]   don't waste my time in preaching politics to you. I would be standing between you and
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:16.680]   this message that is vital to your soul. And I wouldn't affect the course of politics
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:21.680]   or of history to the slightest extent, any more than these others do, who are always
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:33.720]   preaching politics, as if pacifism was the one message of the gospel. His kingdom is
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:47.920]   not of this world. But when he comes back to reign and to rule, his kingdom will be
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:58.040]   in this world. And the angel will sound the message abroad, "Behold, the kingdoms of
[00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:12.000]   the world have become the kingdom of our God, and of his Christ." What was your idea of
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:18.720]   him, my friend? What was your idea of his kingdom? Are you one of the people who says,
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:22.080]   "I'm not a believer in Christianity. If there were anything in it, it would have
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:26.200]   put an end to war long ago. It's been going for nearly 2,000 years, but look at the state
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:30.360]   of the world. Where is your Christianity? Is that your kingdom? I'm not interested."
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:36.200]   Was that your view? If so, you see, you are in the same position as Pilate and these foolish
[00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:41.440]   Pharisees and religious leaders of the Jews. You haven't listened to what he says. You're
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:45.080]   wrong about him. You're wrong about what his kingdom isn't. You've never understood
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:56.680]   what his kingdom is. But surely you cannot remain in that ignorance any longer. Have
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:53:04.040]   you believed him? Have you entered into this spiritual kingdom? Listen to his truth tonight,
[00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:11.160]   the truth about yourself as a sinner before God, the truth about himself, that he alone
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:17.600]   can save you, having borne your sins in his own body and thereby having reconciled you
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:27.600]   to God. And if you believe it, you'll at once surrender yourself and your life to him.
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:39.880]   And you'll fall at his feet and you'll say, "My Lord, my King, my God." Amen.
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:44.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones. All of
