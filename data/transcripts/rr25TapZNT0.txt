[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240]   I should like to call your attention this evening to two of the verses that we read
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.920]   at the beginning, namely two verses that are to be found in the Gospel according to St.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.560]   John, chapter 18, verses 36 and 37.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:24.920]   Verses 36 and 37 in the 18th chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.860]   Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not of this world.
[00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:38.760]   If my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.200]   to the Jews.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.120]   But now is my kingdom not from hence."
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.640]   Pilate therefore said unto him, "Art thou a king then?"
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.780]   Jesus answered, "Thou sayest that I am a king.
[00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.800]   To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.840]   witness unto the truth.
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.440]   Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice."
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.320]   Now I call your attention to this incident which took place, you remember, just towards
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.960]   the end of our blessed Lord and Savior's earthly life and course, just before the cross.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.160]   This incident in which we find him face to face with the Roman governor, Pilate.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:39.280]   I call your attention to it because it does seem to me to show us very clearly the whole
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.280]   tragedy of men and of this world as the result of sin.
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.880]   Now it is an incident, of course, that is full of interest from every conceivable standpoint.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.160]   It is one of the great dramatic incidents of all history.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.160]   It has often been written about.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.920]   Painters have often tried to portray it and to catch what they imagine were the expressions
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.680]   on the face of our blessed Lord and on the face of Pilate.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:16.520]   It is one of those great historic occasions, one of those great clashes, as it were, which
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.800]   has so profoundly affected the whole story of the human race.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:28.760]   But I suggest to you that the real importance of this incident is to be found in this very
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:37.120]   respect to which I am adverting this evening, namely, that it does focus attention upon
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:45.440]   the whole tragedy of men and the whole tragedy of the world in which we live as the result
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.440]   of sin.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.000]   Now here is the position.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:01.720]   Here is the Son of God in the world, who has come down from heaven into this world of time.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:10.440]   He came down because of the world's troubles, because the world was then as it is now, a
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:18.280]   place of troubles and trials and problems and tribulations, a place of sin and unhappiness
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.080]   and wretchedness.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.280]   He came into it because it was like that.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.360]   He says so quite definitely, many times over.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:34.920]   But he did not come merely to visit it, and merely to speak in it, and merely to give
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.480]   a certain amount of instruction.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:44.840]   He says quite definitely that he came into it in order to solve its problems, to bring
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.840]   salvation.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:54.880]   The Son of Man has come, he says many times, to seek and to save that which is lost.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.480]   He is the bringer of salvation.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.640]   That is his whole object in coming into the world at all.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:08.720]   He is not, I say, some kind of ethereal visitor who comes as a great spectacle into the world.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:17.000]   No, he has come with this defined, well-defined object and purpose, namely of coming to us
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.680]   in all our predicament and in all our troubles and trials in order to raise us up out of
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.520]   it and to deliver us and to set us free.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:36.880]   And yet, you see, what happened to him when he was in the world with that object and intention
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:44.680]   was the kind of thing that we find in this text that we are looking at this evening.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:53.760]   The human race to which he came, instead of thanking God that he'd come, instead of sitting
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.920]   at his feet and drinking in his message and accepting it and yielding and submitting themselves
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:07.400]   to him that he might deliver them and lead them out of it all, instead of that, the record
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:16.880]   of the four Gospels is a constant record of people being stumbled by him, questioning
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:25.640]   him, arguing with him, trying to trip him and trap him in his conversation, plotting
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:33.440]   against him, throwing stones at him, saying bitter and harsh things about him, spitting
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:42.880]   in his face, and eventually conspiring against him, and arresting him, putting him on trial,
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.760]   buffeting him and mocking him.
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:51.320]   And here, as we are reminded, when an opportunity was given to them to allow him to be set at
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:06:00.360]   liberty, choosing deliberately Barabbas, a robber in his place, and trying out with malignity,
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:08.120]   not this man, but Barabbas, away with him, crucify him.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:17.160]   Now there I say, surely, the whole problem, the whole tragedy of mankind is portrayed
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:23.840]   for us in the picture and epitomized in the speech and the language that is used with
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.040]   respect to it.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:36.880]   No, I say I am calling attention to it because it is unless still the truth and still the
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.120]   picture.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:46.200]   It is because it is such a perfect portrait of what is happening at this very moment.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:52.240]   We needn't waste any time in describing the state and the condition of the world again.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.280]   Surely, we are all painfully aware of that.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.360]   The world is in trouble.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.440]   The world is in an agony.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.520]   The world is suffering and suffering acutely.
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:13.560]   And here still is this message from the Son of God.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:23.280]   There he is still, as it were, offering the same things, putting before us the same proposals.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:31.760]   And still his fate is the same, to be either ignored or to be misunderstood, to be ridiculed
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.880]   by the men, to be blasphemed and cursed.
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:45.960]   Now surely this is something which insists upon our most careful attention.
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.800]   Let us then look at these people who were his own contemporaries when he was here in
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:56.320]   the flesh and who I say so perfectly represent the average modern man, the majority of people
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.520]   in the world tonight who are not interested in Christianity and who reject it.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:06.640]   Now let us analyse these people and see if we can discover why it was that they treated
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.520]   him as they did.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.040]   Why was it that they rejected him?
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:16.440]   Because as we analyse them, we shall incidentally be analysing the modern man in the modern
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.080]   world who does the same thing.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:25.200]   Well no, the explanation is here perfectly clearly on the surface.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:34.920]   They treated our Lord like this simply because they really did not listen to him.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.600]   They heard his words but they did not listen.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:43.000]   Now there is all the difference in the world between hearing a man speaking and rarely
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.200]   listening to what he is saying.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.000]   That can be proved very simply like this.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.360]   Seated in the congregation are a number of people.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.620]   One person speaks.
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:03.160]   To one that speech is the word of life, to the other it is rubbish and nonsense.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.400]   They were both hearing the same words you see.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.480]   But there is obviously a difference in the listening isn't there?
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.160]   Take heed how he hears, says our Lord on one occasion.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.360]   He warns people to be careful about listening.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:22.560]   Now that I say was the trouble with his contemporaries, especially the Jews, the religious authorities
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.440]   of his own day, and this man Pilate the Roman governor with them.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.960]   They really did not listen to him.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.960]   And they did not listen to him for this reason.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:42.320]   That they had got their own ideas and preconceived notions as to what was needed, what was wanted,
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:47.880]   more, the Jews had got very clear and definite ideas of their own as to what the Messiah
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.640]   was going to be like and what he was going to do when he came.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:57.320]   And the whole trouble was this, that our Lord did not conform to their ideas.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.360]   He did not fit into their pattern.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.520]   He did not tally with their anticipations.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:08.660]   And because he did not do that, they really never listened to him at all.
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.680]   They were impatient with him from the very beginning.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.360]   They were full of these criticisms.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:20.160]   And in the end, I say, they turned against him and finally rejected him and crucified
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.320]   him.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:31.600]   Now that I want to try to show you this evening is still the essence of the trouble.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.960]   It's so baffling that one can scarcely believe it.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:40.560]   It's almost impossible to credit it, and yet it is a fact that though we've got this open
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:46.880]   Bible before us, there is as much confusion tonight as to what Christianity really is
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.960]   as there was when our Lord was here in the days of his flesh.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:58.120]   And it is because of this confusion and muddle as to what Christianity is offering to do,
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:04.760]   what it claims it can do, that men and women in our present crisis and predicament are
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:11.880]   not rarely availing themselves of it and in various ways are rejecting it.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.480]   You see, we all seem to start with these prejudices.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:20.040]   We think we know what Christianity is, and we think we know what it says and what it
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.760]   claims to do.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:29.020]   And thus, mankind tonight is in this state of muddle and confusion with respect to the
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:32.400]   exact content of the Christian message.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.760]   There was no excuse for it.
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.360]   There was no excuse for these people.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:41.000]   Do you remember how our Lord put it on that occasion?
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.560]   When he was questioned by the high priest, our Lord said, do you remember the high priest
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.040]   then asked Jesus of his disciples and of his teaching?
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:56.880]   And Jesus answered him, "I speak openly to the world.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.480]   I ever taught in the synagogue and in the temple.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:05.280]   Whither the Jews always resort, and in secret I have said nothing.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.160]   Why askest thou me?
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.200]   Ask them which heard me what I have said unto them.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.800]   Behold, they know what I said."
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.200]   And it was an unanswerable argument.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.280]   He'd never concealed anything at all.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.100]   He had spoken in the synagogues.
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.640]   He had spoken in the temple.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.320]   He'd started his ministry in a synagogue in his hometown of Nazareth.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:30.080]   Do you remember when he read that 61st chapter of Isaiah and said, "This day is this scripture
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.080]   fulfilled in your ears"?
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.080]   Nothing could have been plainer.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.560]   Yet they didn't see it.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.600]   And he'd gone on like that in public constantly.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.720]   He hadn't said it secretly.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:44.160]   One was forming a secret society with absolute openness and publicity.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:51.840]   There he spoke and he taught, and these people had heard.
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.440]   So I say there was no excuse for them.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.960]   And you and I have these records.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.800]   If Christianity were some kind of oral tradition only, then we could understand people being
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.960]   in some confusion about it.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:09.440]   We would have said, "Ah, well, of course, the oral tradition went wrong at some point
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.440]   or another.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.160]   It divided up into various branches."
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:24.200]   But we have these records written by his own followers, written by these apostles, or else
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.320]   the knowledge and the information was given by them.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:33.160]   With all the authority of those who knew him best, of the early church, filled with the
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.440]   Holy Spirit, we have the record.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:43.320]   And yet I say there is this appalling confusion, and that is the cause of all the trouble.
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:47.280]   Well now then, how does this confusion arise?
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:54.520]   Let me divide it up for you as it's put in these two verses that we are looking at together.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:14:00.360]   The first thing that they stumbled over was about his personal.
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:08.440]   They simply could not understand this truth about him as a king.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:13.640]   You notice how Pilate keeps on tripping up over this and keeps on putting this same sort
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.640]   of question.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:19.880]   Pilate says unto him, "Art thou then a king?"
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.480]   "I don't follow you.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.080]   You seem to be talking about a kingdom," he says.
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:30.160]   And he'd already said to him, "Art thou then the king of the Jews?"
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:35.320]   He couldn't follow all this, and was very muddled and confused about it all.
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.200]   Now why was that?
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.920]   Why was it that they were all so confused about him when he represented himself as a
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:48.840]   king and when he kept on talking about his kingdom and the citizens of his kingdom and
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:52.040]   the purposes and the future of his kingdom?
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.040]   Why all this muddle?
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:57.400]   Well now, here is the answer.
