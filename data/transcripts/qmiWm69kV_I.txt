[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.160]   - Podcast listener Nathan writes in to ask about prayer.
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.120]   Pastor John, I'd like to see 2016 become a revival
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.720]   in my prayer life.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.320]   I want to be honest when I tell people I pray for them.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.320]   I read through many theologies of prayer,
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.320]   but I would love to hear any practical tips
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.400]   or methods for praying for others,
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.840]   specifically for a spouse, for children,
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.200]   for the lost, for leadership,
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.100]   for friends, for the infirm, et cetera.
[00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.400]   Do you have any suggestions to help refresh my prayer life?
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.120]   - It may seem too obvious to be mentioned,
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.120]   but in my experience, there's real motivating power
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.600]   to see my obvious duties stated with simple clarity
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.140]   in the very words of scripture themselves,
[00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.200]   instead of just kind of vaguely knowing that I have a duty
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.360]   to actually see what the Bible says.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.360]   So let's start there to help Nathan and ourselves,
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.240]   'cause all of us share his desire probably.
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.240]   The Bible commends what Nathan is longing for,
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.780]   namely regular prayer for other people specifically.
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.600]   It does so with explicit commands
[00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.700]   and by numerous examples.
[00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.060]   For example, the command James 5:16,
[00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.540]   "Confess your sins to one another
[00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.580]   and pray for one another that you may be healed."
[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.480]   So Nathan should take heart that his desire
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.480]   is exactly in line with what God wants him to do.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.780]   Pray, pray for other people, pray for one another.
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.940]   The one another in that text implies
[00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.300]   that the people you're connected with
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.660]   are people you should pray for,
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.780]   not only, but for sure, pray for them.
[00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.380]   And to do so is to please God.
[00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.140]   It's what he tells us to do, to do it pleases him.
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.100]   And that should just give us a warm, sweet, comforted sense
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.360]   that when we get on our knees and intercede for somebody,
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.680]   God is smiling upon us
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.320]   because we're doing what he said to do.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.120]   And then there's the examples of Scripture,
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.360]   not just the commands that tell us what to do,
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.060]   but the examples of Scripture where, for example,
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.780]   Paul is praying for his kinsmen, Romans 10, 1,
[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.800]   "Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for them
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.240]   is that they may be saved."
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.200]   Wow, I can't tell you how many times
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.120]   that text has encouraged me to see Paul
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.320]   earnestly interceding with his father
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.680]   for the people he loves to be saved.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.620]   So just to hear those words in Scripture
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.240]   can be very encouraging and motivating,
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.380]   powering for us to press on.
[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.940]   He's praying for unbelievers there,
[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.760]   but he also prays for believers in Ephesians 1,
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.280]   and Ephesians 3, and Colossians 1, and Philippians 1,
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.440]   those great prayers of Paul.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.800]   Wow, I would just encourage Nathan and all of us,
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.800]   meditate long and pray through the prayers of Paul.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.060]   The Philippians 1 goes like this, Philippians 1, 9,
[00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.940]   "It is my prayer that your love may abound more and more
[00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.000]   with knowledge and all discernment
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.280]   so that you may prove what is excellent
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.760]   and be pure and blameless for the day of Christ."
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.120]   I have found these prayers of Paul incredibly valuable,
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.120]   both in inspiring me to pray for others this way,
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.280]   but showing me, modeling for me how to do it.
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.240]   And that's what I would encourage us to do,
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.860]   just make those prayers so much a part of us
[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.860]   that we can't help but pray this way for other people.
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.240]   And then there are Paul's invitations
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.560]   to us to pray for him,
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.160]   I mean, to the readers of his letters, to pray for him.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.880]   2 Thessalonians 3, "Brethren, pray for us
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.640]   that the word of the Lord may speed on in triumph."
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.560]   And Romans 15, 30, "I appeal to you, brethren,
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.080]   by the Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit,
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.080]   strive together with me in your prayers to God on my behalf
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.200]   so that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea,
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.400]   that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable."
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.280]   I mean, for me to hear the greatest man who ever existed,
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.600]   I think, short of Jesus,
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.360]   to have him ask for prayer this way is so life-giving,
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.720]   so warm, it just makes me wanna get on my knees
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.120]   and do that for somebody,
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.960]   because Paul, if he needed it, good night.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.760]   Everybody we know needs prayer like that.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.760]   So I think that's about the most motivating thing
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.520]   I could say, that God tells us to pray,
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.880]   and then he gives lots of examples for how to do it,
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.680]   and he loves to see us do it,
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.360]   which is why probably Revelation 5, 8 describes
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.320]   the prayers in the golden bowls in the hands of the elders
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.440]   as incense before God.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.780]   I mean, what does incense before God do?
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.880]   Well, it just fills his room with pleasant fragrance.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.480]   That's what it does.
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.560]   And what a beautiful image to get out on your knees with
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.160]   and say, "I am right now going to light
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.640]   a sweet-smelling lamp or candle,
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.920]   and it's gonna fill the room of heaven
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.920]   with a fragrance this afternoon or this morning
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.400]   that God is gonna be pleased by."
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.320]   Well, that's the most important thing I could say,
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.280]   but that's not what Nathan asked for.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.860]   He asked for tips.
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.000]   He asked for suggestions.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.840]   So here they go.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.800]   I'm just gonna bang away.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.740]   And really, these don't have biblical authority
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.840]   because these are just kind of growing out
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.240]   of Piper's experience,
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.320]   and that's what saints should do for each other.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.560]   We should just share what we've discovered.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.520]   So number one, use a list.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.200]   Break it up in categories.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.840]   We're talking about people now, all right?
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.000]   You probably, over time, are gonna know more people,
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.880]   have more people ask you to pray,
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.380]   have your circles of relationships grow
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.600]   so that one list is hopeless, right?
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.320]   You gotta break it up into pieces, various groups.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.320]   And I find that creating a notebook in Evernote on my iPad,
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.160]   I've got a notebook called Prayer,
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.440]   and under Prayer, I have these different kind of groupings,
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.920]   and you can add people to various lists,
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.360]   and then you can decide on when you're gonna pray
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.200]   for those people.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.200]   So use lists.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:15.160]   Number two, think and pray in concentric circles
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.300]   with the closest relationships near the center,
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.160]   and then moving out to the more anonymous prayers
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.840]   for groups and ministries and nations.
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.800]   So for example, in my Evernote folder,
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.520]   I move from my immediate family at home,
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.920]   that's three of us, well, actually two now,
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.320]   that Talitha's in college, but used to be three,
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.120]   out from there to the children and the grandchildren
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.400]   who live away, and then out from there
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.200]   to the ministries I'm associated with
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.960]   and the people in Bethlehem Baptist Church
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.280]   and Desiring God Ministries and Bethlehem College
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.800]   and Seminary, a whole slew of people
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.120]   that I pray for there, and then I move out
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.080]   to the church planters that I know
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.500]   and the Treasure and Christ Together Fellowship,
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.080]   and then I move out to ministries
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.080]   like Together for the Gospel and TGC and TLI
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.160]   and a lot of friends there that are on my list,
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.040]   and then I move out to my neighborhood
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.120]   and a few people I've written down in the neighborhood
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.280]   and sometimes just in my jogging evangelism
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.960]   that I do in good weather, and I'll meet people
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.940]   and they'll tell me their name
[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.600]   and I ask them what I can pray for,
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.520]   and that goes on one of my lists.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.760]   So concentric circles is one way I handle
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.000]   the diversity of those lists.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.440]   Third, pray the Word of God over these people.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.680]   This will keep your prayers
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.360]   from being merely repetitive, right?
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:46.360]   Read the Word of God first, meditate on it, pray in it,
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:51.040]   and then pray what God shows you from the Word
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.560]   for the people that are appointed to be prayed for that day.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.560]   Fourth, periodically assess your prayers for them
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.840]   by comparing what you pray
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.780]   with what the New Testament prays.
[00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:08.520]   I gathered in one place, and I think this is available.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.360]   - Yeah, I'll find the link.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.520]   - We could check, Tony, and make it available.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.240]   I think it's available at Desiring God.
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.600]   I gathered into one place all of the things
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.320]   that are prayed for in the New Testament.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.160]   It's a list about, I don't know,
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.960]   it's about 40 different kinds of prayers,
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.360]   and I use that list not every day,
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.120]   but periodically I just run through it and say,
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.240]   okay, am I neglecting anything important
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.520]   that the New Testament prayed for?
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:36.520]   Number five, mingle general prayers with specific prayers.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.640]   A lot of people are skittish about general prayers.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.120]   I love general prayers,
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.600]   like, "Hallowed be thy name all over the world."
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.280]   That's a big general prayer.
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.300]   Both specific prayers are important.
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.920]   So a specific prayer might be,
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.440]   "Grant that Bill would find a job this week.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.680]   "He's been out of work, Lord, help him find a job."
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.580]   That's specific.
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.560]   You can just bang, you can see the answer to that
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.720]   immediately.
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.120]   General prayer would be,
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.740]   "Lord, cause Bill to love you more
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.520]   "and to treasure you above all."
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.700]   Well, that's a lot harder to detect, right?
[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.200]   But so crucial that you pray for.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.680]   Number six, I've only got seven.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:20.440]   Number six, be quiet over the people
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.800]   and see if God brings things to mind
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.400]   that people might need today,
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.860]   and then pray those things
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.240]   if God brings anything specific to mind.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:36.400]   And lastly, I would say, look for answers,
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.180]   take note of them,
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.660]   keep some kind of record, maybe in your journal
[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:44.740]   or in another folder of answers.
[00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:48.920]   And what keeps it all fresh and authentic
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.140]   is the way it all flows from the Word
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.520]   and goes back to the Word, the Scriptures.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.440]   And I can't stress enough
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.440]   that we don't wanna become rote,
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.600]   we don't wanna become mechanical and repetitive.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.280]   And the best way to do that
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.840]   is let the Word be fresh daily
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.840]   and let the Word make your prayers for people fresh daily.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.120]   Yeah, such good counsel.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.040]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.920]   And when it comes to praying God's Word,
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.580]   I'll add the link to the podcast transcript.
[00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.640]   And this is probably a good time to remind you
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.160]   that we do release transcripts of the audio recordings
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.720]   as we release them.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.320]   And you can find those at our online home
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:34.000]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.560]   And when it comes to praying the Bible,
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.640]   see Don Carson's book,
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.640]   "A Call to Spiritual Reformation,
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.920]   "Priorities from Paul and His Prayers,"
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.300]   really excellent book.
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.800]   And Don Whitney has a new book titled, "Praying the Bible."
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.400]   Both of those books are really helpful
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.440]   in taking the words of Scripture
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.600]   to help orient our own prayers to God.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.080]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke,
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.680]   and we will return tomorrow.
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.520]   See you then.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.100]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.680]   (upbeat music)
