[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200]   Alright, speaking of books, the first episode we've recorded in the studio together since
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.960]   July ended.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.400]   So let's go over the books I read in July 2022.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.120]   As long time listeners know, I aim to read 5 books a month.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.100]   So I will do these in order.
[00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:33.480]   The first book I read in July was From Zero to Maker by David Lang.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.560]   I was in a DIY maker mood in June.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:45.620]   I think I had read, if I'm remembering right, Adam Savage's The Mythbusters memoir about
[00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.620]   being a maker or whatever.
[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.620]   So I was in that mindset.
[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.460]   I read this book and it was about someone who left his office job or got fired from
[00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.880]   his office job, got really into being the DIY maker community and started a company
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.620]   about building DIY underwater ROV robots.
[00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:11.020]   And it was a book he wrote for Make Magazine's publishing imprint about how to become a maker.
[00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.460]   So I think it was a really interesting premise.
[00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.380]   The book didn't come together because it was partially memoir.
[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:27.580]   That's kind of interesting, his story, but partially like, let me give you resources
[00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.580]   on being a maker.
[00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.740]   And so that mixed together, I think kind of let the steam out of the engine a little bit.
[00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.740]   But it was interesting.
[00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.300]   Some interesting case studies in there.
[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:45.180]   All right, the next book I read was The Monster's Bones by David Randall.
[00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.220]   This is one of the big nonfiction releases I think of this summer.
[00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:55.300]   So it's a nonfiction book about the start of the American History Museum in New York
[00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:02.500]   and in particular the fight to get the first major dinosaur bone exhibits, like the complete
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.500]   dinosaur bones, in your museum.
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.260]   And getting the first tyrannosaur, I believe, is what really helped the American Museum
[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.300]   of History in New York really take off.
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.740]   And it focuses on this really interesting character, actual name, Barnum Brown.
[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:29.340]   This Kansas farm boy who is not from the sort of elite educated bastions that the big bone
[00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.340]   hunters were from, the Copes, the Osbournes, but he became like the world's best dinosaur
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.340]   bone hunter.
[00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.500]   He was just very good at it.
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.140]   So it really follows his story.
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.860]   He found the first like large, he found the first tyrannosaur and a couple other major
[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.340]   first and he just was a natural born bone hunter.
[00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.860]   And it sort of follows him and the story of all these museums trying to hunt down these
[00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:52.860]   bones.
[00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.860]   It was pretty good.
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.180]   Good book.
[00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.940]   Then I read, I don't know, yeah, I don't know what fool gave this book to me, but I read
[00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.300]   a man for all markets about Edward Thorpe.
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.700]   This came from Jesse, who thought I would like it.
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.700]   I did.
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.340]   Edward Thorpe's an interesting guy.
[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.820]   So it's the memoir of Edward Thorpe.
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:19.780]   He was a mathematics professor who then left academia, start basically like a quantitative
[00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.220]   hedge fund, but also like a lot of interesting things.
[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.060]   I mean, here's, here's the right way to summarize this guy.
[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.660]   He's still alive, but he's in his like upper eighties right now.
[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.660]   Right.
[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:37.260]   There's a period in this book where he's in Reno with Claude Shannon and a minute, one
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.980]   of the first miniaturized computers to ever be built that they're using to time the roulette
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.580]   wheel and make money with a gambling, gambling system.
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.500]   It's like an interesting guy.
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.860]   Like he's just interested in he wrote a book called beat the dealer famously in the sixties
[00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.260]   where it's the first time someone had really used a computing power to actually run through
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.260]   and calculate the win probabilities of different strategies against blackjack.
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.580]   And he figured out if you do the right type of what's the optimal strategy without card
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.460]   counting the dealer, she'll have an advantage.
[00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.140]   And then with card counting, what the optimal strategies are.
[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.340]   He ran this all punch card programs through computers and figured out like, yeah, you
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.020]   could, you could have an edge on the casino with these systems.
[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.020]   Right.
[00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.700]   So that's another thing he got into.
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.860]   Then he realized at some point that wall street was like a much more interesting casino and
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.580]   they couldn't kick you out just because they didn't like you were winning too much.
[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.020]   And so then he went there and he made a lot of money in wall street.
[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.700]   They were, he was early to sort of hedging strategies.
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.780]   He figured out early a, a version of basically the black souls derivative pricing formula,
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.660]   which one black and shows a Nobel prize.
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.560]   He didn't prove that his formula was right.
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.780]   That mathematics is very hard.
[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.540]   That's kind of what they want, that microeconomics Nobel prize for, but he sort of figured out
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.540]   the formula.
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.180]   Like, I think this more or less is correct.
[00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.140]   And so it made a lot of money trading.
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.760]   So interesting guy.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.340]   He was unfair twice in like the last several months.
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.340]   So that's where you found him, right?
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.340]   Was Paris.
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.340]   Yeah.
[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.340]   Yeah.
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.740]   So I listened to him and like, when I first started listening to the first episode, he
[00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.260]   was just like talking about working out and I was like, Oh, this guy's kind of cool.
[00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.900]   And then I found out he was like 88 years old and I was like this guy's.
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.720]   So then I started looking into him more.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.580]   So what do you think about this, Jesse?
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.580]   Like one thing I came away with is like the writing between the lines in this book is
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.500]   I don't know if he's frustrated about this.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.780]   He's obviously like a brilliant guy, but there's, there's all these areas where he was sort
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.400]   of early to something.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.980]   This comes up again and again in the book, he was early to something that eventually
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:46.020]   became major, like one, someone, a Nobel prize, innovated a whole field or whatever.
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.560]   And he would always get to the point where, okay, I more or less know what's going on
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.320]   here and then moves on.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.680]   And then someone would come in later and sort of do the work more thoroughly and become
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.680]   very famous.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.760]   And then someone will come in here.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.960]   So like he had these kinds of breakthroughs in economics, but never really pushed them
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.980]   through other people did and became world famous economist, had these breakthroughs
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:14.400]   and how to run hedge funds, made himself, you know, millions of dollars, but he's defensive
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.840]   about, he was never a billion dollar hedge fund.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.760]   He was never one of the big guys, like the guys who swung in and like leveraged up and
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.760]   pushed these ideas and, and, and made the huge money.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.760]   So it's like an interesting.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:33.840]   The one thing that happened to his fund was there was a little bit of trouble with that
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.100]   guy in New Jersey.
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.560]   So they had to close it down.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.320]   So I think if that didn't happen, who knows what, but also he'd never seemed interested
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.920]   in world conquering.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.600]   I think he wanted to hang out with his family and his wife and he wanted to work out and
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.600]   do interesting stuff.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.600]   Like, it's kind of like a deep life.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.600]   That's what I'm thinking.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.560]   So I think he's like a great, he's an interesting case study for different models of the deep
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.560]   life.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.360]   And like, I think he's someone that was definitely thinking I've got this asset, which is this
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.360]   high octane brain.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:07.000]   Cause he's just like wanders into these areas and does like good work.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   And he said, okay, I have two options here.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   I could go all in with this brain on something.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.360]   I think for him it could be essentially like make a run for a Nobel type thing or whatever,
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.960]   like getting an endowed chair at U Chicago or something like really like being a big
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.440]   guy in economics.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:30.160]   Or he could have gone all in and be like, I want to be, you know, I want billion plus
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.160]   net worth.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.760]   Like both of those things were probably on the table for him.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.440]   And he said, instead, what I'm going to do is I'm going to take advantage of this brain,
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.600]   which means I can, I can come in and out of a lot of things, like make enough money to
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:45.200]   be comfortable, explore, do interesting things, have control over my time.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.800]   And that's the route he went.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.840]   And I think you're right to put out the deep life, because if you're looking at the buckets
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.000]   of the deep life and trying to think through, how am I going to service all of these buckets?
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.720]   It's not a bad strategy if you're super smart.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:01.600]   It's like, how can I use this to, to really have a lot of autonomy?
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.480]   Don't worry about money, but also be able to, he got really into working out, surfing,
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.480]   like all these different things.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.880]   I can come in and out of opportunities.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.840]   I can shut things down, do nothing for a few years.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.040]   They got really into charitable giving.
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.600]   I think initially when he was first, you know, after he got his doctorate, he was, because
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.680]   he mentions in the book, he didn't have a ton of money.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.400]   So then he made some money off the publishing the book.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.040]   And then I think once he started making it, he started making it pretty decent.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.680]   And then he realized he was probably set, you know?
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.680]   Yeah.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.680]   And definitely the stock stuff too.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.680]   Yeah.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.040]   And the stock stuff made him millions.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.400]   But in the period of time where he was like looking at where to go.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.200]   Like he was a good professor, not a great professor.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.320]   Like everything there was this, everything he did was competitive fields where he was
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.480]   good, not great, but he moved through a lot of the fields.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.960]   Like he wasn't at a top economics department, but actually was doing cool applied math work,
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.040]   but then left.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:58.600]   He wasn't one of the big, you know, hedge fund guys.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.360]   It's New York when buying a hundred million dollar, whatever.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.440]   But he did well in the hedge funds.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.600]   He like did well in the gambling.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.720]   So I like it.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.520]   I know why you recommended it.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.920]   And I think it's like, he's not just interesting, but it's a nice case study of being incredibly
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.640]   intentional about, I have this asset let's build.
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.160]   I think he built a really interesting life.
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.160]   Yeah.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.560]   He has a lot of like good practical advice too.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:26.760]   Like on his interview with Tim, just about, he's even talking about just like personal
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.320]   investments, like risk-taking, I guess, a human stuff like that.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.320]   Yeah.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.440]   So yeah, definitely listen to the interviews as well.
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.440]   All right.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:40.160]   So then I also, I listened to this one actually, Dilettante by Dana Brown.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.160]   That's a memoir.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:49.000]   It's, it's, it's like the devil wears Prada, but written by the assistant to Graydon Carter
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   at Vanity Fair.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.040]   It's like a male devil's wear product.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.040]   It was okay.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:01.720]   Like, so Dana Brown, at least the way he tells the story is that he was bartending in the
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.880]   village, not really going anywhere.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:13.080]   And for various random reasons, ends up an assistant to the, the new sort of hotshot
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:19.120]   splashy head of Vanity Fair in the nineties when magazine publishing was like the powerful
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.120]   thing in media.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.320]   And he kind of works his way up and he ended up a deputy editor at Vanity Fair.
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.720]   So it's kind of interesting to hear the stories.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.360]   I mean, I think the issue, it was good.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.360]   I think it was interesting.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:34.360]   You get an insight into what Condé Nast, Condé Nast was like in the nineties when
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:39.280]   it was the most, one of the most powerful because magazines were so profitable pre-internet,
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.160]   but right pre-internet and to be at one of their flagship publications, this, the, the,
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.680]   the money, the expense accounts, the, and so it was kind of cool to get into that world.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.920]   Dana Brown stories like kind of interesting.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.240]   Implicit he doesn't really make this very, he's not really clear about it, but it's kind
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.360]   of obvious that he got hired in part because this guy has like model, good looks.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.960]   Like he was a model and like, I think he was like a very attractive guy and it was part
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.320]   of the, the, the scene they wanted to paint.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.800]   And then he was just incredibly hardworking and sort of, sort of worked his way up, but
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.040]   it's not what he was doing is not that interesting.
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.720]   So the stories he was trying to spin, it's like, yeah, it's just a hard job.
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.880]   Like you gotta go to the, you have to go to all these events and work the door at the
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.960]   Oscar party and, and run stuff around town.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:24.120]   And I think that the interesting thing to me was just hearing about all that was going
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.560]   on with magazine publishing.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:35.280]   You know, I have to do, I have to do a lot of Conde Nast online trainings because, because
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.520]   I'm a contributor at the New Yorker.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.560]   I have a newyorker.com email address, which I don't use, but I have a newyorker.com email
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:46.720]   address and they're owned by Conde Nast and they just have these rules, a giant company.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.920]   So they just have these rules, like everyone who has a newyorker.com email address has
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.760]   to do all these like cybersecurity training.
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:58.160]   So I do like a non-trivial number of like watching the videos about how not to get catfished.
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:03.240]   And it's like my only intersection with corporate life.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.200]   I know university life is its own thing, but that's its own little weird system.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:11.880]   My only intersection with, you know, big company, corporate, the it department needs you to
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:15.480]   do trainings is that newyorker.com email address.
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:20.140]   So, and because I don't use the address, I don't get the message.
[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:25.120]   So what happens is I don't realize that there's these like increasingly urgent series of messages.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.120]   It's like you're over, you have to do your training.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.240]   You don't like, why everyone has to do this?
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.600]   Like this is a problem getting yelled at because it gets escalated up.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.200]   I think it gets escalated up.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.880]   Until it finally gets pretty high.
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.960]   And then eventually at some point someone will just, who knows me will email me directly
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.960]   to like my actual address.
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.000]   Like you got to do these trainings, you got to do these trainings.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.240]   Like we're getting yelled at by the ghost of Cy Hirst.
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.040]   You know, anyways, it's funny.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.480]   So that's, that's my dose of, of corporateness.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.960]   All right.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.120]   The last book I read, this was just random.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:13:01.160]   Uh, and I'll give you the backstory, the four agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.160]   I read this book.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.160]   Do you know this book?
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.040]   Somebody was talking about it.
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.800]   Is either you or Rogan talks about it.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:13.880]   So this is like, as of this week, it came on 1997.
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:18.920]   I just checked before we recorded number four on Amazon charts.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:23.360]   Maybe holiday gifted it to Rogan when he went on the show recently, he gave him a bunch
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.360]   of books at the end.
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.960]   I didn't get to the end of Ryan's interview.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.800]   He gave him like 12 books.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.680]   I think this might've been one of them.
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:31.960]   Well, he owns a bookstore.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.200]   So, so anyways, I was just curious.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:41.160]   I was like, this, why is this book from the nineties, you know, decades later, like top
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.160]   four, top five of like everything's selling on Amazon.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.160]   So I went and read it.
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.440]   I don't know that I got an answer from reading it.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.120]   It's short.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:54.160]   It's for the four agreements, like four like agreements you should make with yourself.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:14:02.280]   And they're like good life advice, you know, like be honest and don't care about what other
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.280]   people think.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.280]   It's like four things like that.
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.160]   Just like standard advice.
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.400]   Number four came out in 1997.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.600]   There's like some interesting this to it.
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.240]   Like, so the guy is claiming like, there's this whole claim up front that this is, this
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:21.240]   is wisdom from like the Olmecs is sort of a lost ancient central American civilization.
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.280]   And then he's like, I've, it's been passed through oral tradition.
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.480]   I've kind of captured it.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:32.360]   He sets that up early on, but then the rest of the book is just standard, you know, self-help
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.640]   like you should be honest.
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.400]   It's here's why, like, it's, you don't want to get caught.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:39.840]   Like it's not like throughout he's like really pulling from an exotic wisdom tradition or
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:40.840]   whatever.
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.080]   So I don't know what it's just somehow this hit it's good advice.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.080]   I don't know.
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.480]   I have heard Rogan talk about is like my whole life is built on it.
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:51.080]   And maybe that's why, maybe that's why it's number four, because I guess it's that guy
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.000]   was saying you should read this.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Probably.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   So, so I don't know, but here's my quiz.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   All right.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   So then I looked up because I was looking this up.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:08.160]   So I wrote down the top five as of this moment, the top five books this week on Amazon charts.
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.160]   Are you looking at it right now?
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.160]   I'm looking at it.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.160]   I was going to quiz you.
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:15.320]   I was going to quiz you because to be on the Amazon charts, it's not like momentarily.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.520]   Are you number one?
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:21.240]   It's like the volume of books sold this week, number one volume, which it could be different
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:27.520]   than because, uh, different books will trade places in the number one spot just because,
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.560]   you know, oh, in the last hour or something happened.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.400]   Now I'm temporarily number one and then I disappear and someone else gets it, but the
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:36.280]   Amazon charts, but yeah, so top five, you see it right there.
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.080]   Number one, atomic habits.
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.080]   That book just kills it, huh?
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.080]   Just kills it.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.440]   Just absolutely, absolutely kills it.
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.080]   Has he written any other ones yet?
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.640]   No, he was working on one.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.440]   He told me, he told me about what he was working on.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:57.880]   This was like a little while ago and the one year anniversary of atomic habits.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:04.080]   I did a interview with him or he interviewed me for a, like he was doing a bunch of videos
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.280]   to celebrate the one year anniversary.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.480]   And then afterwards he was telling me about what he was working on.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.480]   I don't remember the idea.
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.600]   All I remember was thinking the moment like, oh, that's good.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.600]   So he's got a good one waiting, but why would you rush it?
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.640]   Number one on Amazon charts.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.560]   I mean, you're like, look, I don't know if this is the conversation he's happening, but
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.480]   I'll tell him the comp, I'll tell you the conversation his publisher is probably having
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.980]   with them.
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:26.980]   This is working.
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.480]   Like, why do you want to cannibalize sales from yourself?
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:35.520]   If you're literally the number one selling book on Amazon right now, let that play out,
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.520]   you know, because think about it.
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:42.200]   If clear came out with a followup book, you, it wouldn't just be, okay, now we have all
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.600]   of those sales plus all the atomic habits.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.000]   It would probably cannibalize like you say, oh, I'm not going to get atomic habits.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.200]   I'll get this new one or whatever.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:52.600]   So I'm sure they're saying, what would you do if you were in that position?
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.160]   I'd let it, I'd let that, don't you really like writing?
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.160]   That's true.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.160]   I don't know.
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.160]   I don't know.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.160]   I feel like you would.
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.160]   I think it's a, I think it's a really weird position to be in.
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.880]   It's like not a bad position because you get a lot of money and, but it's a weird position.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.160]   If a book takes off like that, it's like if you're the actor who really likes acting and
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.040]   then in the nineties, like at the height of that, and you just have like a huge surprise
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.400]   blockbuster it's the, uh, like what it really changes things.
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.080]   I guess you could just write more articles.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.080]   Yeah.
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.080]   I think it would be complicated.
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:25.320]   Like if, if, if I had like an atomic habit style hit, it really complicates things.
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.320]   Well, it's funny.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:30.280]   Cause I listened to like a lot of, I rehashed a lot of things like doing the YouTube channel
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.280]   and stuff.
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:35.640]   So I hear what you say like four different times and you always talk about how like writing
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.560]   is like the top priority.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.120]   So it's all I'm doing right now.
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.120]   And it's like summertime, just got an, I'm writing, writing, writing.
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.120]   What would you do in the mornings?
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.120]   Row?
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:49.040]   Just be like a beast on the rowing machine.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.160]   Any arms and a huge back?
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.520]   Uh, I don't know.
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:53.520]   That's a good question.
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.520]   That's a good question.
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:18:00.360]   I don't, I mean, I don't know, uh, James clear well, but it's not like he was a book, right?
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.240]   He was, he had his own thing going on and then he wrote a book.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.060]   So I don't know if it's not like his main thing is book writing.
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:08.080]   So it's probably a different, different equation.
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.360]   No, I think that's right.
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:14.080]   I think Mark Manson had this issue too, after subtle art and he, and he want to go do other
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:18.240]   things and they're like, we have to maximize blah, blah, blah.
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.240]   And he was like, screw you.
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.000]   He's like, I want to write.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.600]   I think he's a guy who just wants to write.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.640]   And at some point it was like, I'm just going to write.
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.160]   All right.
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.160]   Number two is the body keeps score.
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.040]   I think Oprah's involved in that, right?
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.700]   So that's like the least surprising.
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:35.700]   Number three is Lisa price.
[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.480]   The body keeps score.
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.480]   Julie writers.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:44.360]   She was telling me about, it's about trauma and from like a scientific standpoint, like,
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.760]   you know, the science of trauma and how it affects people.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.120]   And I, and I know Oprah's heavily involved in it somehow.
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.620]   So of course, number two, it makes sense.
[00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:52.120]   Number three, green lights, Matt McConaughey.
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.600]   It makes sense.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.600]   Right.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:58.120]   I mean, he's like an interesting, famous guy.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.680]   There's this, it's a weird book.
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:00.680]   I don't know.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.680]   It's kind of weird.
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.680]   Right.
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.680]   But there's Matthew McConaughey stories in it.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.920]   And there's like wisdom that either sounds really wise or kind of weird, but that's a
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:07.920]   weird juxtaposition.
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:13.400]   There's like this interesting, famous guy writing something that's just not just a standard
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.040]   like celebrity memoir.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:19.200]   Then four agreements is number four and a rich dad, poor dad's number five.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:23.520]   Or said poor dad is don't have a salary.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.000]   You should have assets to generate money.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.040]   There you go.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.980]   (upbeat music)
