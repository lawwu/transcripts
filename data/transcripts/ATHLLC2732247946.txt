[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.920]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.600]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:44.040]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.240]   your life, money and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.640]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you on my journey to find
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.520]   All The Hacks.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.840]   Before we jump into this episode, I just want to say thank you to everyone
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.560]   listening. This past week, we were nominated for a Plutus Award for Best New
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.080]   Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.240]   And it's amazing to get that kind of validation for the show.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.480]   To everyone that voted for us, thank you so much.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.880]   And if you haven't already left a rating or review in the podcast app, now would be
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.160]   the perfect time to do so because I have a feeling there'll be a big part of how
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.080]   they choose the winners.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.600]   OK, with that out of the way, I want to jump into today's episode because it's
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.760]   going to be fantastic.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.720]   I'm joined today by Dr. Daria Rose, and we're going to talk all about food and the
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.920]   science behind healthy lifestyles, including what foods to eat more of, how to
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.800]   cook them so they taste better, how you can actually lose weight without giving up
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.520]   everything you love, and plenty of hacks for everything along the way.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.760]   Daria got her degree in molecular and cell biology from UC Berkeley and her PhD in
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.240]   neuroscience from UCSF.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.960]   She's the author of Foodist, Using Real Food and Real Science to Lose Weight
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.560]   Without Dieting, and the creator of the award-winning blog Summer Tomato, a site
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.640]   that Time magazine called one of the 50 best websites.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.120]   Finally, she's the host of the incredible new podcast, The Daria Rose Show.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.560]   So without further ado, I hope you enjoy my conversation with Dr.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.360]   Daria Rose.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.040]   Daria, thanks for being here.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.280]   It is my pleasure.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.960]   Thanks for having me.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.040]   Yeah, so I just want to jump in and get your take on what do most people get wrong
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.840]   when they think about food and dieting?
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.200]   Well, I think there's a general misunderstanding that diets somehow work.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.040]   And this is an understandable thing to be confused about because it really depends
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.760]   on the timeline.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.360]   So for the short term, you can get pretty much any diet to work, right?
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.400]   You can do vegan, you can do paleo.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.320]   I mean, if you're paying attention and you start something new and you're
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.480]   motivated, like it's pretty easy to lose weight for a few months.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.240]   The issue, though, is that in the long term, 95% of diets fail.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.520]   And I'm not just throwing that number out there.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.120]   That's the actual number, like the long term success rate is low.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.880]   And in fact, having a history of dieting is a predictor of weight gain.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.520]   So in fact, dieting is a better way to gain weight than to lose weight.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:19.360]   I mean, decades of data that show this, the best data set of people that we know
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.200]   that have lost weight and keeped it off is the National Weight Control Registry,
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.920]   I believe it's called.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.720]   And there is a group of people that have succeeded.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.920]   And it's just a small number.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.840]   That's why they're studied so thoroughly.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.600]   Wow.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.800]   And when I say long term, I mean like three years.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.960]   Like if you're saying has worked for like three years, you're in the top 5%.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.640]   Wow.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.400]   And so just to get a little bit of your background, how did this become an
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.360]   interest of yours?
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.480]   How did you become so knowledgeable and passionate about food and everything?
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.960]   Well, I grew up, I might date myself here, but I grew up in, in Southern
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.560]   California when Baywatch was really popular.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.080]   And my mother was into all the things.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.680]   She did the full Orange County mom business.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.080]   And so I just grew up around it.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.640]   I thought that's what just what women did to be normal.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.200]   And it's tragic.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.360]   I know a lot of women and girls who grew up that way, but you know, it's, it's
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.960]   horrible, it's a horrible way to live.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.640]   It's you're constantly depriving yourself.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.080]   You're constantly unhappy.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.440]   You're never satisfied with the food you eat or how you look, which are two big
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.320]   factors in life.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.080]   I mean, those are two things that have a lot of impact on your quality of life.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.040]   And the other side of my life.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.560]   So that was always just kind of going on in the background of existence.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.960]   And then when I got to college, I realized I really loved biology and I
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.280]   really love neuroscience.
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.600]   And I actually developed the skills and training to be able to read scientific
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.920]   papers.
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.200]   And actually it helps to even be on the university campus and have access to the
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.800]   scientific papers because they're not generally accessible to the general
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.120]   public.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.000]   And it's hard.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.640]   It's a lot of many years of training to be able to actually read those papers.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.520]   And that was when I realized that I didn't have to rely on like a glossy
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.960]   magazines and diet books to figure out how to do this.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:05.920]   I could do it on my own.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.920]   And so I just I literally spent an entire year just reading papers about how to
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.520]   be healthy and keep your weight in a good place.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.360]   And it just ended up being astounding to me what I learned.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.960]   And I totally changed my life.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.760]   And then I felt like I had to tell everybody about it.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.720]   What were a few of those astounding things that you picked up along the way?
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.480]   Well, the big one was the dieting thing.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.760]   It's like I knew that, like I knew that the diets didn't work for very long, but
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.120]   I don't know.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.840]   For some reason, it's I kept trying, like doing the same thing over and over
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.640]   again, being crazy.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.920]   And so that was a big one.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.320]   Like the research is overwhelmingly convincing on that.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.600]   There's no room for debate.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.000]   I was literally doing the wrong thing.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.520]   And the other thing I dug deep into the research of because I got frustrated.
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.480]   I was like, OK, it sounds like it's impossible to lose weight.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.960]   But the the other question I had was, well, what about people who never have
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.560]   this problem, who are always healthy and always spend their entire lives?
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.280]   What do they do?
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.960]   And it turns out what they do is not doesn't seem very special if you just
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:06.720]   look from the outside.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:14.200]   But on the inside, what they do is they have dozens of little habits that just
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.400]   sort of keep them in check, whether that's they walk a lot or they cook at
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.360]   home or everybody can have different ones.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.480]   They don't it doesn't have to look the same for everybody.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.400]   But healthy people tend to have a suite of habits that they use to sort of keep
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.240]   themselves in check.
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.520]   And it's really that simple.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.400]   And it's very confusing.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.600]   I was expecting to find something like, oh, you can't eat carbs or, oh, you need
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.680]   to fast for a certain number of hours a day.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.560]   Or I thought there was going to be some trick, because when you read a lot of
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.520]   diet books, you're kind of prone to thinking there's going to be some special
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.400]   trick, but it's not.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.000]   It's very boring if they cook vegetables and eat them.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.320]   And what do you think causes people to believe that these diets will work if
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.840]   there's all this data that shows they won't?
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.480]   A lot of marketing money is in this industry.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:04.680]   I mean, it's a multi-billion dollar industry and there's a lot of money to be
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.000]   made by making people feel bad and about themselves.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.280]   And a certain vision of beauty is projected in the world and people are
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.920]   desperate to get that.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:19.120]   And then the other big thing is, like I said earlier, all diets can kind of work
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:19.880]   for a little while.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:25.520]   So it gives you this false sense of, oh, if I just keep doing that, it'll the
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.480]   problem's me, right?
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.360]   Like I just failed.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.960]   Like I, if I just kept doing this thing, it would work.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:36.960]   And that's just, that just goes against everything about the human mind and how
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.600]   it works and how your body works.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:43.840]   So you think you're failing by not sticking to the diet, but in the reality
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.520]   is nobody can really do that.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.080]   Nobody can torture themselves indefinitely and expect to magically like come out the
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:50.840]   other side happy.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.600]   That's just not how the human brain works.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.040]   And it's kind of remarkable when you think about it.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:57.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.800]   And so is the reason that any diet ends up failing just that people don't have, I
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.160]   guess, the willpower to keep it up or why does it fail?
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.760]   So that's part of it.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:12.040]   It's usually what'll happen is people will find shortcuts.
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:16.080]   They're like, well, I can't eat carbs, but, oh, but all these like low carb energy
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.440]   bars are fantastic.
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:22.120]   They'll start like finding ways to sort of actually eat a bunch of processed food
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:22.760]   that isn't good.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.280]   So you start being really good and like only eating chicken thighs and broccoli
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.840]   and salmon, but then it sort of morphs into something less good.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:35.600]   But also sometimes even people that are able to mostly stick to it, your body
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.480]   compensates.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:43.040]   So you can't really do the same thing and expect it to keep working.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:48.680]   You have to change your life around it and you have to kind of go the other
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:49.160]   direction.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.560]   Yeah.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.320]   And so, you know, you read all these research papers, you learned all this,
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.600]   ultimately you wrote a book.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:59.120]   What kind of was the desire to make that move in your life?
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:04.160]   Well, before that, I was running a website called Summer Tomatoes, basically
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.640]   my blog, and I was writing articles and I just really wanted to put everything
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.240]   that I'd learned together over a decade of doing this work.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:19.080]   And what I really wanted to convey with Foodist, my book, was if you are a
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.640]   dieter and this is something you've struggled with for your entire life,
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:28.520]   this is a way you can go from that to being what I call a foodist, which is
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:35.240]   somebody who uses food to make their lives better and happier and healthier,
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.280]   which is sort of the opposite of a dieter.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:42.920]   A dieter is like a food is their enemy, like you're constantly trying to prevent
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:43.880]   yourself from doing things.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.080]   Like for me, food was the biggest source of anxiety and struggle in my life
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.200]   before I made this change.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.640]   And now it's like my favorite thing in the world.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.240]   You can ask anybody, you can ask you.
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:56.760]   I know I've been fortunate to eat meals with you and food around you is always
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:57.480]   wonderful.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:02.360]   So I want to dig into this whole idea of being able to find a different way, have
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.520]   a different relationship with food that can be way more, I guess, enjoyable than
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.240]   restrictive.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.080]   Is there a foundation for doing that?
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.240]   Yeah, there's a few.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.800]   So, I mean, on the just practical level of what to eat, that's sort of the first
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:23.040]   step. And my piece of advice there is to get away from processed foods as much as
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:28.080]   possible and have most of your food be about real intact, whole foods that you
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.960]   would find like in a garden or in the produce section of the grocery store or
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.440]   in the butcher section of the grocery store.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.160]   Real food ingredients, basic ingredients versus packaged things.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.080]   That's step one.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.640]   And obviously, like we all have moments where we're out and we need to like do
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.080]   convenience things or it's a holiday or you're at the movies with your kids for
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.160]   the first time in two years and you want to just have some stupid M&M's like
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:49.680]   that's fine.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.480]   But I'm just talking like the bulk of your day, your breakfast, lunch, dinner,
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.920]   five days a week type of thing should be focused on real food.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:03.120]   And then there is a whole psychology around interacting with that real food
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:08.400]   and making yourself want it more than you want the processed stuff.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.560]   And there's an art and a science to that as well.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.760]   Yeah, I mean, let's start with so is it it's just packaged foods, but are there
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.600]   other things about this kind of real food concept to dig into about what they
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.640]   are, how to pick them, things that are important?
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:26.520]   But generally, you want to just start with raw ingredients.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:31.200]   And I it takes it's a skill to be able to cook, right?
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.160]   And that's intimidating for a lot of people.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.880]   But real ingredients are kind of pretty good.
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.840]   Like you just take some broccoli, as long as it's like a decent kind of
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.360]   broccoli, like you found it somewhere and doesn't smell like mildew or
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.600]   something, which sadly, a lot of broccoli at grocery stores does smell like
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:50.120]   mildew. But if you find a decent piece of broccoli and you heat it up in a pan
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.440]   with some olive oil and some salt and some garlic, it's gonna taste pretty
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.160]   good if you just kind of don't make a lot of errors.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:02.040]   So I would generally recommend people start their eat more vegetables.
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.640]   I think one of the biggest mistakes people make is when they're trying to get
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.480]   healthy, they think they need to eat less of things.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.280]   I encourage people don't start there.
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:13.280]   Start with adding adding these foods to whatever else you're doing until it
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.160]   becomes more natural.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.280]   Then you can add more or then you can start thinking about what to remove.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.920]   But start by adding most people just don't even know how to eat vegetables
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.120]   or have like never they're like they've lost this practice.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.120]   And so it's something that people need to learn.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.360]   And what do you say to those people?
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:29.840]   I've certainly I remember one time we had a tenant in our house and we were
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.720]   like, you know what, we should get to know Scott, let's go out to dinner.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.160]   And he was like, Yeah, I don't eat vegetables.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:33.720]   I was like, what?
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.280]   You don't eat any vegetables.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:40.320]   And and I feel like I had nothing to say other than like, just pure shock.
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.640]   But I feel like if you were at that table, and you met this person who's
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.440]   like, yeah, I just I've never eaten vegetables.
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.160]   I never liked them.
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.560]   What would you tell that person to kind of open their eyes up to what
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.480]   vegetables could be?
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.840]   Well, that's a fantastic question.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.920]   I've done this with with more people than I can count.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:01.720]   You the main thing I want to do is feed them because my deep held belief is
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.280]   that people don't like vegetables because they haven't had good ones.
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:10.040]   Or the texture or something is just so outside of the realm of experience
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.040]   that it feels weird.
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:18.360]   And I and I 100% believe that you you can learn to like foods you don't
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.680]   like I grew up a typical California kid.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:25.680]   I you know, I ate some vegetables, but I didn't like wouldn't say I loved
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.040]   vegetables.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:31.720]   I definitely hated spinach, Brussels sprouts, lima beans, all sorts of
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:31.920]   things.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.240]   I just had this cilantro.
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.360]   I just eggplants.
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.080]   I hated them.
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.280]   I hated them beats.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:41.320]   And when I changed my approach to food, I started shopping at different
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:41.640]   places.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.520]   So I really realized that I really like the food at the farmer's market
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.160]   because it's in season, it's cheaper, and it tastes better.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.080]   And because it's grown by people who really care about these giant
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.160]   industrial farms.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:55.680]   And one of the things that was most profound to me was that when you buy
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:59.800]   food in season, when you buy food that somebody cares about, it tastes
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:00.400]   different.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.280]   You don't really know what that tastes like if you've never had it before,
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.240]   and you need to try again.
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.920]   And it didn't always work the first time.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.240]   Sometimes I'd try cucumbers and I'm like, No, these are still not good.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:13.640]   But eventually, I figured out a way to like everything I can honestly say
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.600]   that I like all vegetables right now are all foods in general.
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.680]   I mean, I'll and I'll definitely try or eat anything.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:22.880]   I would never just like categorically say I don't like something because I
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.560]   know that's just that's just my perception of it.
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.880]   I can say I have never enjoyed this, but I'm open to the fact that it's
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:29.480]   possible.
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:33.480]   Yeah. And one thing that you said that I thought was interesting was go to
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.440]   the farmer's market seven season that makes sense.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.720]   And you said it's also cheaper.
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.760]   And there's a theme to this show about saving.
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.600]   And I think there's a perception and I would say I even have it sometimes that
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:47.160]   going to the farmer's market is like so boutique II all these little shops like
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.800]   is it going to be really expensive?
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.640]   Is that not the case?
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.760]   Yeah, actually.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.080]   And so there's a big exception.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.240]   And that exception is fruit.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.720]   Fruit at the farmer's market is really expensive.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.760]   But most people, since they're kind of vegetable rookies, they go there and
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:07.720]   they mainly see the fruit and they'll see these like four dollar a pound
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.160]   peaches. And yeah, that's expensive.
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.360]   But you buy one of those peaches and you eat one of those peaches and you're
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.120]   like, holy shit, this is the best peach I've ever had in my life.
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.240]   I can see why this is four dollars a pound.
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:21.120]   But right next door, there's the kale and you can get two bunches for a
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:26.400]   dollar. That'll feed a lot of people for like one or two meals.
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:32.320]   And and so my experience is the vegetables are actually quite comparable
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:37.480]   in terms of price. Ripe fruit is very delicate and heavy and it's a lot
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.160]   harder to ship. That's why the stuff at the grocery store isn't good.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.680]   It's bred to be hard and firm and like withstand a lot of travel and being
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.200]   banged up. And it's just it's different.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.560]   So, yes, if you go there and all you want to buy is fruit, you're going to be
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.040]   like, whoa, this is expensive.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.840]   But for the most part, I think if you go to the farmer's market knowing I
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:58.040]   should be shopping for vegetables, you'll find incredibly good deals.
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:02.600]   And when I was a grad student in SF, I was like literally living in SF on
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.920]   less than thirty thousand dollars a year.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:09.640]   And I would I shopped there exclusively.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.800]   I mean, I didn't eat a lot of meat.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.040]   That's another thing that's expensive.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.960]   But I got great food, really great food.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:21.440]   Yeah. And so, OK, so in season, organic food in season, cheaper.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:25.280]   Great. When you said knowing how to cook it, are there are there tips on how to
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.600]   cook these fresh foods that make it easier for someone who maybe isn't used to
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.680]   cooking from scratch?
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:36.480]   Yeah. So there's a ton of little tricks I taught myself really to cook.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:41.600]   And that makes it really fun because you do you learn these little tricks that.
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.360]   You're like, oh, if I would have just known this before, I would have liked
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.520]   stuff so much sooner.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:51.160]   So like one example, like a mistake that I see people often use, they'll put
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.480]   food in a pan before it's hot and like that's just like you don't want to do
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:59.240]   that. You want to heat the pan first, then put oil in it and then put the food.
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:02.280]   So when it sizzles, when it gets there, so you can get that crisp in there.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:06.120]   Also, people often put way too much in the pan and it gets overcrowded.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:10.160]   So instead of browning and making something crispy and yummy, it'll steam it
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.480]   and make it soggy. And that'll really like kill the texture and sometimes even
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.600]   kill some of the flavor because it'll get overcooked but never really brown.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.720]   And that's no good.
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.800]   It sounds like you could fix that with just a bigger pan.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.960]   Yeah, a bigger pan or cooking in batches.
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:30.480]   Yeah, exactly. People often don't use enough salt, which is so ironic because
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.600]   people think salt is bad for you.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:36.440]   But if you're cooking at home, it's you're using literally like seventy five
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.520]   percent less salt.
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:41.640]   Even if you like go to town salting your food, it's like really hard to oversalt
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:46.240]   your own food. So if something doesn't quite taste right, try a little more salt
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.960]   sometimes. I mean, and don't and don't do the whole batch, like take one little
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.920]   piece off and test it if you're and taste it.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.280]   And if you're if it tastes better than you're on the right track.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:58.480]   Honestly, I really recommend Samin Nosrat's book, Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat.
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.760]   I think for like a priming and cooking skills, you can't beat that book because
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.400]   sometimes you just need a little bit of acid.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.320]   You know, sometimes you just need a little fat in there to fix it.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.720]   And that can really take food that you are not very excited about and make it
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.840]   amazing. And you're like, wow, I didn't even think I had this in me.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.800]   I never wanted to be a cook, but now I can cook.
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.680]   Yeah. And it's surprising.
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.960]   I mean, I know I've learned this both from you and others that a plate of fresh
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:25.760]   vegetables from the farmer's market just easily cooked in without much work can be
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:30.560]   delicious. Like we often go to the farmer's market, make some rice, make some
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.360]   fresh veggies, mix them together.
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.160]   Salt. There's not a lot of ingredients.
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.960]   It's not that hard. And it's fantastic.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.920]   And so I was blown away.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:38.760]   Two dollars.
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:43.200]   Rice is not an expensive thing, but rice is a carb.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.480]   Is that OK? Do you feel like carbs are like fresh rice?
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.880]   It's good quality rice.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.000]   Absolutely. So I'm OK.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.040]   So one of the most important things you can do psychologically is never call any
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:59.480]   food good or bad. OK, every food has value in some way.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.120]   Some foods, even a Twinkie.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:08.360]   Yes, in the right setting, the Twinkie has value because maybe it has nostalgia or
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.600]   maybe it's a special moment.
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.320]   I don't I don't know what you're I mean, I don't think you should eat Twinkies for
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.360]   breakfast every day, but I don't even like Twinkies.
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.160]   I just think of them as like the quintessential worst food.
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:22.440]   I mean, in some ways, it's one of the least healthy things you can put in your
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.440]   body. My point is that that health isn't the only reason we eat.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.000]   And again, there's like the psychology that goes on.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   If you tell yourself a food is forbidden, you are just setting up a whole dichotomy
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.920]   that will set you up for failure because all of a sudden it becomes a reward.
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:41.400]   Right. If you tell yourself something's forbidden, suddenly you can earn it if
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.440]   you're good enough. Right.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.680]   And that can make you want it more.
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.240]   So it undermines.
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:53.600]   So I discourage anyone from thinking carbs or meat or fat is bad.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.200]   Like that's not true.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.720]   You can make a more healthful choice or you can make a choice for a different
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:02.840]   reason, like pleasure or something social or a bonding experience.
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:04.200]   There's a lot of good reasons to eat.
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.600]   Yes, I would love and encourage you to choose health a lot.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:11.440]   And on average, you kind of like think about like the 80/20 principle, like get
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.880]   the base, your basic meals, right?
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.360]   Like the weekdays, they're always kind of the same.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.400]   You're all going to work breakfast, lunch, dinner and weekdays, nail those.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:23.520]   And then you can have some pancakes on the weekend and you're already, you're
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.440]   winning, you already won.
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:30.760]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size and the cracks start to
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:35.440]   emerge. Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.400]   manual processes and there's no one source of truth.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.400]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers.
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.600]   Thirty seven thousand, twenty five, one.
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.040]   Thirty seven thousand.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:49.520]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.920]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.

[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:59.000]   I wish I could say that I'm eating a fully balanced diet every day, but the reality is
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.320]   that I am definitely not.
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:05.320]   So I love having an easy way to get my daily nutritional insurance, which is why I
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:09.560]   kickstart my day with Athletic Greens, and I am excited to be partnering with them for
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:10.280]   this episode.
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:14.640]   I started taking it because I wanted to see what all the hype was about, and I've kept
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.720]   it in my daily routine for months.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.680]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water, add a few ice cubes.
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:25.000]   It tastes so good when it's cold, and I head to my office feeling focused and
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.520]   energized for the day, which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:33.720]   I also love that it's made from 75 high quality vitamins, minerals and superfoods
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.160]   and contains less than one gram of sugar.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.320]   It also has no GMOs, nasty chemicals or artificial anything.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:45.160]   To make giving it a try easy, Athletic Greens is going to give you a free one year
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:50.320]   supply of immune supporting vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:50.920]   purchase.
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:56.280]   All you have to do is visit allthehacks.com/athleticgreens.
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:02.600]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens to take ownership over your health and
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.280]   pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:10.000]   And for people who are thinking about this as an alternative to a diet, maybe you've
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.920]   been a little unhealthy the last year and a half.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:17.000]   A lot of us have just been at home, maybe not getting as much exercise, being as
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.760]   healthy and feel like, I know I do, like maybe I could lose a little weight.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:24.840]   Is this an approach to that or is this just a new lifestyle?
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:28.840]   Or what would you say to someone who's like, I probably need to lose 10 or 15
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:29.560]   pounds right now?
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.840]   It's a really good question.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.520]   So I would encourage you to just try to focus more on vegetables.
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:38.400]   I mean, it's funny, you can even eat a pretty rich salad, but if you're eating a
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:43.440]   salad, you're going to, I find no matter what, I like find myself losing weight if
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.120]   I just focus on eating more vegetables.
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.720]   But, you know, it's just one of those things.
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.680]   It's like, OK, if you've gained a little weight because of COVID or whatever, and
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:53.960]   you notice you've maybe been eating a little more ice cream or whatever, I would
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:58.520]   say don't, yes, like so an obvious thing you can do is eat less ice cream, right?
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:02.120]   Like that's an obvious thing or pizza or whatever your little indulgence is.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:06.920]   But and I don't want you to say you can't have it, but just try to be more mindful
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:07.880]   of how often you're doing it.
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.920]   If you if it's come to the point where you're doing it two or three times a week,
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.880]   like cut down to one, like so it's not zero.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.480]   And maybe it's even every other week.
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.040]   I don't know.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.280]   Like and then watch your body and listen to your body.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.240]   Like I there's no right answer here.
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.200]   And maybe for you, like you're like, no way in hell I'm giving up my ice cream.
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.080]   But like, I don't really need that toast.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:31.840]   So you you pick what matters to you, and be mindful of both quality and quantity.
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.240]   And just kind of keep tabs on those things.
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:38.360]   I mean, if you're just if you just sit down at any meal and kind of eat whatever's in
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.720]   front of you, it's going to be really hard.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:43.160]   But you do have to sort of think and plan like, how am I going to because you want to
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:46.000]   eat enough healthy food that you feel good to when you have energy and you're not
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:46.400]   tired.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:50.080]   So you sort of have to think about your life and think about what you're doing and how
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:54.040]   much energy you need and what your weight goals are and what your health goals are
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.080]   and, and taper.
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:58.840]   I think the biggest one of the biggest things people do is they go they go like, all in
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:25:59.920]   on one thing crazy.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.720]   And I just I don't think that's a recipe for long term success.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:07.400]   Yeah, we've been very happy with meal planning and kind of mapping out.
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.480]   Okay, these are the things we're going to do this week.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.920]   Let's buy the groceries that make this possible.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:16.920]   And we end up not bringing home as many things that like, like, it's almost hard to
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.680]   fall into a bad situation if you don't have it in your house.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.640]   And if you've made a plan, but if five o'clock rolls around, and you're like, Oh, my
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.880]   gosh, what is the plan for dinner?
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.400]   We haven't prepared anything.
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:30.960]   I feel like I would just fall into a panic mode where I might take out Thai food, of
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:31.480]   course.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.160]   Yeah, of course.
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:33.880]   That's delicious.
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:37.880]   But yeah, what about when you're out and about and you're ordering carry out or at a
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.080]   restaurant? Is it just a disaster?
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.760]   Are there ways to make it better?
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:42.800]   Yeah, great question.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:47.760]   So yeah, if I find myself at sort of a mid range restaurant where I think the food's
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:53.000]   going to be all right, like nothing that I is particularly special, but I need to get
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.680]   some food in my body, I will definitely be super careful to make sure I order a lot of
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:01.240]   vegetables. So even if it means ordering a little extra and spending an extra like six
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.400]   bucks on the appetizer, that's a lot of vegetables.
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.840]   I always do that. I make sure I eat it.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.920]   And then I try to be mindful of what I'm ordering.
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:13.080]   I avoid words like glazed, crispy, because it's really easy to get tricked into eating
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:17.520]   like 2000 calories in one meal at a restaurant like that if you're not careful.
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:22.400]   And if it's not an amazing place that you're like, this is a once in a lifetime thing.
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:28.000]   I've been saving up for this for three months, you know, that's not really worth it to
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.960]   have something really bad for you.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.920]   So I try to make meals like that as healthy as I can.
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:37.640]   My trick is I find that if I'm at a restaurant, I'm looking at the menu, I end up on
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:41.040]   like the thing that's probably glazed and crispy.
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:45.520]   But I'll look at the menu at home, like maybe right after I had breakfast and I'm not
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.880]   even hungry. And I'm like, you know what?
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.960]   When I go to this restaurant, I'm going to order this chicken salad.
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:53.280]   Right. And I'll decide what I want before I go.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.160]   And it makes it so easy.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.960]   I get there and I'm like, I don't even need to look at the menu.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.080]   I know what I'm going to order.
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.360]   I don't need to get distracted.
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.080]   And I kind of plan that in advance.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.760]   It sounds a little ridiculous.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:06.000]   Maybe a couple of drinks in, I might change my mind if it's one of those dinners.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.920]   But that's been really helpful for me.
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.840]   I think that's brilliant, actually.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.800]   And the more you can plan in advance and make decisions before you get hungry, the more
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.360]   you're going to win. Because nobody who's hungry makes a good decision.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.280]   And I assume that's also true at the grocery store.
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:25.400]   Absolutely. Like you said, as long as you can keep the bad stuff out of your house, you're
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.320]   way, way, way, way less likely to eat it.
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:28.560]   And look at me. I just said bad.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.720]   It's really hard to strain yourself out of the same.
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:35.480]   But yeah, keep things in your house that are healthy and that you want to say that you
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.480]   ate and it'll be a lot easier.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:41.680]   Yeah. The last time I hung out with you in person, I noticed that after dinner you had
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:44.200]   this really great dark chocolate.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:49.520]   And it had me thinking, gosh, sometimes after dinner, I just want something sweet to
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.520]   finish the meal.
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:55.800]   And I was like, man, if I just had that, that would that would substitute any other
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.280]   thing. But instead, our au pair loves Oreos.
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.960]   And I was like, instead, I have no dark chocolate.
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.760]   I just have a box of Oreos and both would have been fine.
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.280]   But I only had one of them.
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:10.800]   And so I made the wrong decision or I made the only decision.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.080]   But it sounds like you analyzed it and you figured out why.
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.880]   So you have the opportunity next time to make the right decision.
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:21.080]   Yeah. Yeah. Are there other things for people who have that sweet tooth, which I would
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:26.640]   say I fall into a trap of less self-control around a batch of freshly baked cookies
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.320]   or walking by or in a donut store?
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:34.880]   Like what are ways to either kind of get over that desire or sweet tooth?
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:39.480]   Let's start there. And then I'm also curious if there are things that kind of fill that
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.200]   void that are better choices.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:47.960]   Yeah. So what one thing that I found to be very true is the less you eat it, the more
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:53.200]   you crave it. So I used to consider myself a sweet tooth and I always had to have
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.160]   something up to do, especially if I had a lot of garlic, for some reason, five garlic
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.400]   breath. Even if I brush my teeth, I kind of just like want some sugar.
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.840]   But that has just faded and faded and faded over time.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.720]   And it's a lot less desirable to me now, which is fantastic.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.680]   So that's one thing to consider.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:10.000]   The other thing is that there's dark chocolate is fantastic.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:13.680]   I like sometimes it's it's kind of calorie rich, but it's not I wouldn't say it's bad
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.880]   for you. But I like dark chocolate with a scoop of peanut butter on it.
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.960]   And that's good. But I'm also I have like so I'm a weirdo.
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:23.320]   Like I said, I don't like that much sugar these days, but I do.
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:28.120]   One of my biggest indulgences that I'm a little bit embarrassed about is I pay a sort
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:32.320]   of ridiculous amount of money to get fruit shipped from California to my house in
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.080]   Oregon because it's so good.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.320]   It is just so freaking good.
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:42.680]   These these Pluots, they're called Flavor King Pluots and these peaches from Frog Hollow
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:49.040]   Farm. I buy them and get so excited to eat one after dinner because they're so delicious
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.960]   and they smell so good and they're just like worth every penny.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:55.240]   They're so good. Yeah, one time my my parents used to live on the East Coast and they
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:31:00.200]   came out to visit and we went to a farmer's market in Oakland and my mom's like, what
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:04.680]   is a Pluot? Like a Pluot, I would say, at least growing up, I'd never heard of a
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:08.840]   Pluot. And up until that farmer's market, I hadn't even ever heard of one either.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.120]   And we tried it. We're like, oh, my gosh, this is amazing.
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:14.640]   Obviously, me living in California, my sister living in California, we're really big
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:19.600]   drivers. But I think 20 percent of her desire to move to California was the fresh fruit
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.240]   and like Pluot specifically.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:26.840]   So I think I think you would you would enjoy time together enjoying fresh fruit here.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:31.800]   You talked about the group of people that actually were able to to keep weight down
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.040]   and naturally and they had a lot of habits.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:40.160]   Are there habits that you think people can adopt to start to make this easier, both
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:43.400]   eating healthy and just kind of living a more intentional lifestyle?
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:47.560]   There's a good question. So there's two big pieces.
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:50.240]   One is around movement and one is around food.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.520]   Right. So with movement.
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:59.160]   I there's this thing of formal exercise is fantastic, like if you enjoy it, that's
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.480]   great. And I do think people should do it.
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:05.160]   I think that no matter what your health status, everybody should do a little bit of
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:09.240]   cardio a few times a week and do some strength training just for aging.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:13.920]   I mean, you're just not going to get a better bang for your buck for staying alive and
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.200]   and mobile into into old age.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:19.600]   And and it is like an amazing it like it helps you sleep.
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.240]   Amazing sort of source of endorphins.
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:29.240]   But. The amount of energy that you can use just doing normal daily life stuff, people
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:30.480]   massively underrate that.
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:34.840]   So people tend to have habits of like taking the elevator, sitting on a bench when
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:38.120]   waiting for something like I would just encourage people to start looking at those as
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.080]   opportunities to move and be active.
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:44.600]   And so I almost never sit if I'm waiting at a doctor's office, like I'm the one
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:49.040]   standing. Well, it's much easier now with covid because I'm like, oh, I'm going to get
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.200]   a disease if I sit there. So I'm not going to touch anything.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.760]   But maybe we all have a little bit more of these habits now.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:57.520]   But just just try to be thoughtful about just try to be active and get your kids
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:59.520]   involved to get whatever like well, it's like recruitment.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.520]   People actually like moving.
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.080]   People forget that they're moving.
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.120]   Actually, it feels really good before you go to the next one.
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:08.960]   With regard to covid, I feel like video meetings have taken over and now there's
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.800]   constantly meetings that could be phone calls, probably were phone calls in 2019.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.480]   And now they're all video meetings.
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:19.880]   And as much as I enjoy getting to connect with people's faces on a screen, I feel like
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:24.800]   I've lost a lot of the ability to take a walking call or a walking in-person meeting.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.680]   And so I've been pushing back.
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.240]   Someone's like, oh, here's the video call.
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:32.320]   And I'm like, actually, let's do this as a phone call and go on a walk.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:37.360]   And it's been hard during covid because everyone wants to meet on Zoom or Skype or
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:40.560]   something. And so I'd say if you don't feel like you get enough time to do that
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:44.360]   anymore, just push back, say, hey, we don't need to do this on a video call.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.640]   Let's do a phone call or just most of these have ability to dial in.
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:50.640]   I'll just dial in and say, hey, you don't need to turn your video on.
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:51.600]   I'm just here on the phone.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.760]   Totally. Yeah, Kevin's been doing that, too.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:54.880]   My husband is smart.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:34:00.000]   So movement and and so on the food front, like I said, the first thing I recommend to
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.080]   people is eat more, eat more vegetables.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.040]   Like it's so much easier than a don't don't don't don't.
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:10.720]   I mean, if you don't know how to cook, it's one of the the number one skills you can
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:15.760]   develop in life. And I would say start small and pick pick a meal.
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:16.960]   Maybe breakfast is easy.
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.440]   Maybe start with breakfast or figure out ways to cook.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:24.280]   I say having a schedule around the grocery store is really important to like working
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:27.800]   that into figuring out when that's going to happen, what it's going to look like.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:32.800]   I'll rearrange my whole week to make sure that the produce I get is good because like
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.840]   I was saying earlier, I want to love what I eat.
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.280]   And even if it's just my Tuesday night dinner.
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:44.400]   And so I will go out of my way to make sure that the salad mix I get is delightful or
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:48.080]   that the the carrots I'm going to cook for my kids are sweet and tasty.
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.320]   So they actually want to eat them.
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.800]   So it's not something that we have to fight over.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:51.680]   It's something they love.
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:59.720]   And so for me, I spend a little extra time, energy and money on finding the best foods
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:03.360]   and make sure that like that's not a negotiable on my day.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:08.520]   Like everybody knows like I can't take meetings on Tuesdays in the afternoon because I am
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:12.800]   grocery shopping. So there's just things like that are really helpful.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:18.000]   And I'd say finally, when you are thinking about removing things like again, try not to
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:24.440]   build into that your self-talk, anything about moralizing food as good or bad and try to
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:31.560]   acknowledge what your body wants when it wants something a little sweet or wants to have
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:35.000]   some of your like mom's famous chocolate chip cookies or whatever.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.480]   Like those things have value.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.600]   Don't feel bad about it.
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:41.480]   Just kind of be more aware and know that you can't do that every day, but that you're not
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:44.040]   like bad for doing it or that it's OK to like it.
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.720]   It's OK to love cookies.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.160]   Yeah, I am. I am OK that I love cookies.
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:54.960]   And one thing you mentioned about learning to cook, I was doing some research before
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:36:00.040]   this. Am I right that you have a course for learning to cook?
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:04.680]   I do. So this is something that comes up a lot and it's hard to cook.
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:09.720]   And I the reason I think it's hard to cook is because cooking isn't one skill.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.400]   It's a set of like eight skills.
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.400]   There's knife skills.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.000]   There's flavor pairing skills.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.520]   There's heat learning skills.
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:20.600]   And I taught myself and I know it wasn't that hard.
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:23.440]   And I had so many people telling me it was too hard and like it's not that hard.
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:25.120]   And so I just put this program together.
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:30.080]   It's a 30 day program to teach people to cook without recipes, because when I started
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:34.520]   interviewing people about why they don't cook, they would just give me these stories
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:38.800]   about how they go to the grocery store with a list trying to make all these recipes.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:42.600]   They get home. But, you know, they only used half an onion and like two carrots out of
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.520]   the entire bunch. And they make the food.
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.040]   And because they don't really know how to cook, maybe they didn't quite season it
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.600]   right. Or maybe they cut the carrot chunks too big.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.720]   And so it didn't quite turn out as well as they want.
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:55.000]   So they have all this food because they made a batch for like six people.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   It's not that good. Nobody wants to eat it.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.040]   There's a bunch of leftovers in the fridge that go bad.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:02.000]   Then the rest of their groceries that they didn't use in the recipes go bad.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.920]   And they're like miserable. They're like, why did I do this?
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.200]   I spent all this time, all this money.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:08.320]   It didn't turn out good. And it's a waste.
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.080]   And they just end up getting pizza anyway.
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:14.520]   So I realized after talking to the people who do cook and the people who don't cook
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:18.080]   is the biggest difference was how much they rely on recipes as like a day to day
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:22.520]   cooking thing. It's like, yeah, almost everybody will use a recipe for a bigger,
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.200]   more elaborate meal.
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:28.240]   But people who cook a lot can throw stuff together with whatever's in their fridge.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.680]   And I wanted to teach people that skill because that's how I cook.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:32.760]   And I just that's the first thing I do if I'm like, what's for dinner?
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.880]   And I don't know. I look in my fridge and see what's there.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:38.480]   It's like and I like I can start being the conductor of the orchestra of how this is
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.000]   all going to come together in my belly later.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:43.600]   Yeah. And so is that do you think that's something easy to learn?
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.800]   It sounds hard. I think you can learn it in 30 days.
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.200]   OK, it's called Foodist Kitchen, by the way.
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.440]   OK, awesome. Foodistkitchen.com.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:57.560]   Yeah. What do you think about habits that people feel like are kind of ingrained
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:02.720]   from childhood? So one thing that I feel like I regret and maybe I'm
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:08.440]   overemphasizing it is that I grew up in a clean plate club household and I feel like
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:12.840]   it's been really hard, if not, you know, almost impossible to break the habit of
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.000]   always eat everything that's in front of you.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.560]   I assume that's a pretty bad habit.
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:22.960]   Any any reactions or thoughts on on people who kind of grew up in that household and
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:25.520]   have that kind of ingrained in their style of eating?
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:30.320]   Well, I will 100 percent say that habits that you develop like under the age of 10
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:35.040]   are really, really hard to break because they're they're pretty ingrained in who you
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:39.560]   are and your identity. So I don't blame you for that being challenging.
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:42.760]   I would say, I mean, there's a couple of ways you can solve this, right?
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.920]   One is get smaller plates.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:53.480]   Another one is you could start a mindful eating practice.
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:57.640]   So when you're eating to finish your plate, you're on autopilot, right?
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:01.360]   You're telling me that the cue to stop eating is that your plate's empty.
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:05.640]   So that just means you're not you're not focused on other goals.
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:10.800]   One thing you can do is you can train yourself to really focus on the food in your
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:11.920]   mouth and the bite you're taking.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:15.520]   And I mean, the way I do this is I practice.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:16.840]   It was so, so hard.
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:22.000]   This is the single hardest food habit I developed, but I knew I needed it because I
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.120]   would eat really fast. I grew up with two brothers, so we didn't it wasn't like
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:28.600]   necessarily a clean plate thing, but it was just like we all just like ate like
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.240]   maniacs and like it's amazing we didn't choke or something.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:37.200]   But so and my husband eats really fast and I'm like triggered by his eating fast.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.800]   I have to like be like, dude, slow down.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.040]   You're like making me nervous.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:44.680]   But now I have learned to do this slowly.
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:50.880]   And the way I did it was I. Trained myself with one meal a day and I would just go
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:55.240]   through and just like do one meal when I was basically eating with my eyes closed,
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:58.800]   not entirely closed, but when the food's in my mouth, my eyes closed, no devices, no
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:01.360]   computers, no sounds and just focus on my food.
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:05.720]   And once you develop that skill, then it it gets easier to transfer it to something
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:07.320]   like a dinner out with friends.
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:11.560]   You just start naturally stopping eating when you're full, but it's a lot of
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:12.920]   practice. It's hard work.
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:18.680]   So I am quite comfortable right now, which is actually true almost every day, and
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:19.840]   that's thanks to Viore.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:22.760]   And I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:25.920]   They make performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:30.160]   Everything is designed to work out in, but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.920]   And it's so freaking comfortable.
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:33.720]   You will want to wear it all the time.
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:37.080]   Seriously, I am pretty sure it's more comfortable than whatever you're wearing
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:40.800]   right now, unless you're wearing Viore, in which case you already know what I mean.
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:42.640]   And it's not just for men.
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:45.440]   My wife is as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.080]   My favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:51.880]   I think I have three pairs and they are probably the most comfortable pants I've
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:56.000]   ever owned. Their products can be used for just about any activity, whether it's
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.040]   running, training or yoga.
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:01.920]   They're also great for lounging, running around town, or their Metapants can even
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.440]   work for a night out.
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:06.480]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness.
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:10.960]   And for all the Hacks listeners, they are offering 20% off your first purchase, as

[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:35.080]   versatile clothing on the planet.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:39.480]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy is actually so good
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:42.920]   for you and nothing showcases that better than Pu-Erh tea.
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:47.080]   It has so many health benefits and I think one of the best and easiest ways to consume
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:49.800]   it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:56.120]   Peak's Pu-Erh teas are all cold-extracted using only wild-harvested leaves from 250-year-old
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:42:00.440]   tea trees rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:05.600]   Then everything is triple-toxin screened for pesticides, heavy minerals, and toxic mold
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.680]   commonly found in plants.
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:13.120]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero-prep because they're all in pre-measured quantities
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:18.200]   that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds and are so travel-friendly.
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:22.720]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the green Pu-Erh
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:27.480]   for mental clarity and energy and the black Pu-Erh, which helps kickstart digestion and
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:32.560]   metabolism with a rich, earthy flavor that is so good and probably one of my favorite
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:33.880]   things to drink.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:37.480]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research-backed benefits of
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:42.380]   polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more, and then be happy that
[00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:46.960]   Pu-Erh is more concentrated in polyphenols than all other teas in the world.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:51.320]   But you don't even have to take my word or do any research because Peak offers free US
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:54.560]   shipping, free returns, and a money-backed guarantee.
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:43:00.160]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver with 12 tea samples
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:04.080]   at my link at allthehacks.com/peak.
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:06.200]   That's P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:13.080]   So check them out today at allthehacks.com/peak, P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:16.920]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:19.680]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:31.340]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:36.400]   So the premise is kind of really focus on the food, get to understand it.
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:40.320]   Is it that it will slow you down and that will make you realize you're full or how does
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:41.640]   that work in your brain?
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:42.640]   Both.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:47.680]   I mean, one of the biggest things you'd be surprised to hear, people don't chew.
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:52.760]   So when you're a fast eater and you're getting to the bottom of your plate, my guess is you're
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:56.000]   chewing food probably like 20% as much as you should.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.400]   So that 100%, you will not feel as full as quickly.
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:04.400]   And you will also probably get more stomach aches if you chew more.
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:08.560]   And basically, it takes you out of the autopilot so you can actually start making decisions
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:14.040]   about what you want to eat and when you want to stop that's conscious instead of unconscious.
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:18.040]   I have a course for that too, by the way.
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:20.400]   A course on learning to mindful eat?
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:21.400]   Mindful eating.
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.400]   Yeah, it's free.
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.400]   It's called Mindful Meal Challenge.
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:30.040]   And it's a five-day free program that takes you through how to tackle that one meal.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.560]   And there's like sort of five different things you can try.
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:33.760]   And I love that.
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:34.760]   I love that program.
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:36.480]   And I'm very proud of that one.
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:42.880]   So I'm coming back to some of the kind of habits and ways to get going.
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:48.360]   And I know you've talked in the past and thought a lot about habits, habit creation, rewards.
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:52.920]   Are there things that someone who's trying to really incorporate more vegetables, trying
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:57.080]   to eat more real foods and kind of be more intentional about what they're eating, are
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:02.040]   there ways to make that easier to become a habit and part of your new lifestyle?
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:08.040]   Well, I mean, the easiest thing to do is work with your brain instead of against it.
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:12.000]   So we kind of touched on this a little bit earlier when we were talking about moralizing
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.480]   food choices.
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:18.680]   But when it comes to motivation, especially for things like health, where it's just day
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:22.680]   to day for the rest of your life, it's not like if you have to just study for a final
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:26.720]   or something or like prep for a podcast, you use willpower, you force yourself to work,
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:28.200]   you hit your goal and you're done.
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:31.560]   But this is a very different type of activity.
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:35.960]   And the most important thing for activities like that in habits that you want to build
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:38.120]   is that your motivation needs to be intrinsic.
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:43.020]   So you need to truly enjoy what you're doing for the sake of itself.
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:47.920]   So I absolutely encourage people not to think of rewards as being outside the food.
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.960]   Like if I cook myself dinner, then I can eat dessert.
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:56.080]   That's an extrinsic motivation, and it can actually undermine your intrinsic motivation.
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:46:00.600]   There's a lot of science here, but just try to believe me on this one, that when you tell
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:04.640]   yourself you have to do things for a prize, it makes the thing you're doing less and less
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:07.240]   enjoyable for a lot of reasons.
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:12.000]   And so for food, that's why I'm constantly harping on seasonality, farmers markets, cooking
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   for yourself.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.040]   Because one of the things that happens when you can cook for yourself is you can actually
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:16.800]   make food that you like to eat.
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.120]   And that's huge.
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:21.840]   Because if you like to eat something more, like I like my food cooking more than the
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:25.820]   vast majority of restaurants in probably any city I've lived in.
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:26.820]   And that's amazing.
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:32.680]   I didn't start out as some amazing chef, but I know what I like to eat and now I'm pretty
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:33.960]   good at it.
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:38.960]   And I think that you really can't underestimate how much energy you need to spend making sure
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:42.320]   that that is what you dial that in on your habits.
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:45.480]   Because if you're trying to force yourself to do something, then it's not a habit.
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:50.540]   A habit is automatic, and the only way it becomes automatic is if it's reinforced with
[00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:53.000]   intrinsic reward.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.320]   You mentioned, of course, you enjoy the food more than restaurants.
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:59.120]   And earlier, you started talking about how you're willing to spend a little bit more
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:00.240]   for food.
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:04.320]   But I just want to throw out there like, if you're spending a little bit more on ingredients,
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:08.880]   but making it at home, net net, it's probably still way less expensive than going way less
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:09.880]   expensive,
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:10.880]   way less expensive.
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:14.800]   I mean, this was like my probably my number one hack for grad school was learning to cook.
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:19.280]   Because I was so broke, and I'm such a food snob that like, it was like, literally, I
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:20.280]   had no other choice.
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:23.400]   I just I was like, I have to figure out how to cook.
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:27.120]   Otherwise, I'm gonna like eat myself into bankruptcy at these like fancy restaurants
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:30.640]   in San Francisco, because I just I discovered those restaurants and I couldn't afford to
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:31.640]   eat there.
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:33.880]   But I, I just I needed I needed good food.
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:35.840]   So yeah, I just got really good at cooking.
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:38.600]   You know, I know you said get past the recipes eventually.
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:39.600]   And that's good.
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:40.600]   And there's a course for it.
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:44.240]   But are there a few kind of like, easy, healthy meals, someone listening to this could say,
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:48.520]   you know what, give me something to make this week that I could try and I might really enjoy.
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:50.600]   Oh my god, I'm gonna give you the best recipe right now.
[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:52.080]   I'm so excited for you.
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:59.560]   Okay, get ahead of cauliflower, fresh as possible, break it up, throw it in a bowl, dose it with
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:03.080]   a solid amount of olive oil and a solid amount of salt.
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:06.640]   Make the pieces as close to evenly sized as possible.
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:14.920]   Heat your oven to 500 or 475 if you have convection, go 475 and put the cauliflower in a baking
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:15.920]   sheet.
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:16.920]   Make sure it's Oh, you know what?
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:18.440]   I like to add curry powder too.
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:20.280]   You don't have to but there's some curry powder on there.
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:25.160]   It's really good on the cauliflower, get get it kind of orange, and then separate it out
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:26.160]   on a baking sheet.
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:29.720]   Make sure there's like enough space on the baking sheet so it's not crowded.
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:31.760]   And then foil over it.
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:32.760]   Stick it in the oven.
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:34.960]   Set your timer for 15 minutes.
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:35.960]   Take it out.
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:38.400]   What will happen is it'll steam a teeny bit inside there and it'll start to look a little
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:40.040]   bit translucent.
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:41.840]   Take the foil off.
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:45.760]   Sometimes I reduce the heat a little bit more like by 25 degrees, stir it up and stick it
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:48.720]   back in the oven set your timer for eight minutes this time.
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:53.240]   And then keep checking it and stirring it every eight minutes until it's brown and crispy.
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:58.760]   I mean, my kids, like, I could feed them that every meal for every day and they would eat
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:00.120]   it like they love it.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:01.120]   Everybody loves it.
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:02.640]   It kind of tastes like cauliflower french fries.
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:07.520]   I don't know, it's by far my most popular recipe and everybody I've made it for absolutely
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:08.520]   loves it.
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.520]   So give that a try.
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:10.520]   Super easy, super healthy.
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:13.720]   And the one thing you'll realize is that you wish you bought more cauliflower, get a big
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:14.720]   one.
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:15.720]   Wow.
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:17.720]   I'm going to get this recipe.
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:20.040]   We're going to type it up and put it in the show notes for anyone who wants to make it.
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:23.160]   I'll probably make it this weekend and I'm excited.
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.160]   It sounds wonderful.
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:28.280]   I can send you a link and there are tons of other recipes over at Summer Tomato is a huge
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:29.280]   recipe section.
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:30.280]   Yeah.
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:31.280]   I was going to tell you one more thing.
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:33.360]   You asked me about some hacks for cooking.
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:35.640]   One of the things that people mistake a lot.
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:40.280]   So with meat, if you're cooking meat, take it out of the fridge like an hour before you
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:41.280]   cook it.
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:45.360]   Like cooking cold meat is like a really fantastic way to make it tough.
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:48.800]   And if you can even better, it'd be salted the night before.
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:51.960]   And then like, that's like probably the number one hack for cooking chicken.
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:55.960]   Just like give it a good rub of salt, probably a little more salt than you think you need.
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:56.960]   Coat it all over.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:59.960]   Let it sit overnight in the fridge, pull it out an hour before you want to cook it and
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:00.960]   then cook it.
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:04.000]   It'll your mind will be blown how much different it tastes.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   And is this true?
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   All meats?
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   Whether it's pretty much.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   Okay.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   I mean, maybe not fish, but that's amazing.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.240]   So you've mentioned your, your kids a few times.
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:16.040]   How have you started to apply these lessons to your kids?
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:20.720]   And I think we probably both grew up at a time where what you eat as a kid is, is kind
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:23.440]   of very different hopefully than, than what the kids eat today.
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:25.160]   But do they love vegetables?
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:27.240]   Cause you know, most kids don't.
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:28.240]   Yeah.
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:34.480]   So this is the main thing I think about these days and yeah, my kids are amazing eaters.
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:38.840]   They have this tree stump down in the yard and they call it their fairy house and they're,
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:41.200]   they like go down there and they're like, we're going to cook for the fairies.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:46.120]   We're going to make the fairies kale and lentils because they love kale and lentils.
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:50.040]   And Zelda, my oldest, she says the onions are her first favorite food and kale is her
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:51.840]   second favorite food.
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:54.040]   And cauliflower is definitely up there somewhere too.
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:58.760]   Yeah, no, they're fantastic eaters, but you know, it was not, not always.
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:01.280]   It's been, it's been a journey for sure.
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:06.120]   Any, any tricks for getting them to like these foods, especially for people whose kids right
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:10.080]   now kind of sneer at, at the idea of eating vegetables.
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:11.080]   Yeah.
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:13.080]   So a few things, I mean, make sure it tastes good.
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:16.800]   I mean, one thing I find that parents will often just sort of steam vegetables in the
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.760]   microwave or something and like barely put any salt or oil.
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:21.400]   It's like, would you want to eat that?
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:23.280]   Like make food you'd want to eat.
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:24.280]   Add garlic, add salt.
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:25.280]   My kids love flavor.
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:26.280]   I don't, I don't know.
[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:30.240]   There's some rumor that started that kids need to start with bland food.
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:33.400]   If you give your kids bland food, they're going to be used to and expect bland food.
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:36.600]   And then when you give them flavor, they're going to freak out and think it's weird.
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:41.840]   So I recommend starting with flavor as early as you can and cook things in different ways.
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:46.080]   If they reject something, which totally happens, or like most kids, I mean, they're good eaters
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:50.120]   until they're two and then they get, and they'll start rejecting things, you know, just be
[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:51.480]   persistent.
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:55.160]   Kids need to try something sometimes up to 20 times before they'll truly accept it.
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:57.840]   So what I'll do is I'll cook things in different ways.
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:02.880]   I'll use different spices, I'll roast versus saute if they didn't like the saute last time.
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:05.720]   And then I just, I don't fight with them over it, but you know, I do expect them to take
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:08.200]   a few bites and they'll usually do that.
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:09.420]   It's not, it's never a battle.
[00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:14.760]   I mean, at one point Zelda would, her limited vegetables, her vegetables were limited to
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:18.320]   cauliflower and kale.
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:21.760]   And I mean, she would sometimes eat broccoli, but like not really, but she, she was pretty
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:22.760]   difficult.
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:25.960]   She wouldn't eat anything orange and she's, I mean, I'm not a hundred percent there with
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:31.080]   everything yet, but she now loves carrots, like loves broccoli, like everything.
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:32.320]   She just really, really loves it.
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:35.420]   And it just took persistence and just making sure that the food tastes good and having
[00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:36.420]   them keep trying.
[00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:39.000]   And sometimes I wait a few months and try again.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.600]   We, someone gave us that tip with toys.
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:44.880]   They were like, Oh, if there's a toy that someone's that your daughter's not interested
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:47.940]   in, just hide it for a couple months and bring it back.
[00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:52.200]   Like memory is not so well-formed yet that two months later, they probably think it's
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:54.400]   a brand new toy and they're excited to see it again.
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:58.480]   So toys, toy rotating is key for sure.
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:52:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:00.480]   Okay.
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:04.560]   So a couple of quick hits I want to, I want to ask, what are your thoughts on skipping
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:10.740]   meals or, or intermittent fasting as, as part of the food lifestyle?
[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:11.740]   Really good question.
[00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:16.200]   So my initial thought is a lot of the data that was done on intermittent fasting were
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:21.320]   pretty short fasts, like 13 to 14 hours, which is a pretty reasonable amount of time to go
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:22.880]   from dinner to breakfast.
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:26.000]   So in that realm, like I think you're fine.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:31.460]   Like you don't really get hungry in 13, 14 hours and there's a lot of like potential
[00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:32.520]   benefits from that.
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:34.320]   So I think that's pretty reasonable.
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:39.600]   When you start getting into longer fasts, 16, 18, 24, multi-day fasts, it gets a little
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:40.600]   trickier.
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:44.080]   I would say that for certain populations, it's amazing.
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:49.960]   For instance, it's been shown to really, really help with cancer, like chemotherapy.
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:55.200]   As our friends, Mike Mazur had a really excellent result with his chemotherapy because he was
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:57.080]   doing a lot of fasting at the same time.
[00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:59.600]   And there's tons of science supporting this now.
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:00.600]   It's really awesome.
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:05.640]   So in certain populations, I think longer fasts can be extremely beneficial.
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:10.880]   But for most people, it can be a little risky, I'd say, for a couple of reasons.
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:17.200]   One, if you've been a chronic dieter at all, it can really lead to some binging behavior.
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:22.640]   And I would generally recommend anybody who has a history of dieting to avoid long fasting.
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:26.280]   I think there's better ways to get those same results.
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:30.480]   I would also say that you have to be really careful with fasting because a lot of the
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:34.840]   recent data that's coming out is showing that extended fasting can really, really reduce
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:37.040]   muscle mass dramatically.
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:40.400]   So if you are going to be fasting, it's really, really important that when you do eat, you
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:43.960]   eat a good amount of protein and you do a lot of strength training exercises.
[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:48.360]   Otherwise, you can really mess up your metabolism and lose a lot of muscle mass.
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:52.200]   So those are some things to be cautious about in that realm.
[00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:55.720]   Otherwise, whatever works for you.
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:58.920]   And what about timing your eating?
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:02.480]   Is it important to follow a schedule or circadian rhythm?
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:07.040]   Or people always talk about how just grazing is a bad habit.
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:10.240]   Is that less important if you're grazing on good things?
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:13.880]   My goodness, I think you're the first non-scientist to ever ask me about circadian rhythms.
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:14.880]   That's amazing.
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:16.760]   I'm so proud of you.
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:20.200]   Yeah, no, circadian rhythms are really, really, really important.
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:23.320]   I think they're underestimated by most people.
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:28.080]   And the more you are on a schedule, the easier your life's going to be for a lot of things,
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:29.080]   especially kids.
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:33.480]   I mean, kids are so on that train.
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:35.040]   We're on a really tight schedule with the kids.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:40.760]   But for myself personally, even, your body and your mind know what to expect, and they
[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:43.720]   can regulate their hormones in a way to prepare you for that.
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:47.360]   And if you're eating all over the place, your body's going to be confused and it's going
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:48.360]   to be a lot harder.
[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:51.600]   So yes, generally, if you can, I highly recommend sticking to a schedule.
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:53.760]   It's going to be super helpful.
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:56.600]   So just to wrap up, a couple last things.
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:56:00.720]   If someone were out there saying, "I want to get started," obviously, you said earlier,
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:02.760]   don't just jump all the way and maybe start with a meal.
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:07.920]   Any other tips for someone who's trying to transition from maybe a less healthy style?
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:13.080]   Yeah, I would say just start with one or two habits at a time.
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:14.080]   Don't go too crazy.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:19.200]   I mean, when it was me, so basically what I did was, I mean, I was like dieting all
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:20.200]   the time.
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:21.200]   I was running marathons.
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:22.200]   I was doing all this stuff.
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:23.360]   I was working out for like two hours a day.
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:25.280]   I was just a crazy person.
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:27.920]   And I just, one day I was like, "I'm going to stop doing this.
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:30.960]   I'm going to stop being crazy and I'm going to start eating breakfast."
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:36.360]   And so I started with breakfast and I hadn't eaten carbs in like seven years or something,
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:39.480]   but I ate oatmeal and I just tried it.
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:41.760]   And crazy things happened just from this oatmeal.
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:43.720]   First of all, I expected to gain weight because I was eating carbs.
[00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:45.400]   I didn't.
[00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:51.320]   And two, I was like, that did amazing things to kill my sugar cravings because I think
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:54.800]   one of the big reasons my body wanted sugar so bad was because I wasn't giving it any
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:55.800]   at all.
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:59.680]   But when I would have just a little bit of carbs in the morning, my whole day was so
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:01.800]   much easier and so much better.
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:07.360]   And that's the sort of thing that you can see when you just change one habit at a time.
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:10.720]   And same thing with like adding vegetables or just like adding more vegetables to your
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:11.720]   dinner.
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:13.120]   Just start with dinner or lunch or something like that.
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:17.080]   And you can see when you make changes that way, you can see what is and what isn't working
[00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:22.280]   and you can adjust accordingly and then you can see your progress and you can see exactly
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:26.760]   what the building blocks you need to create your healthy lifestyle.
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:28.440]   All right.
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:31.000]   I hope everyone can put some of this to good use.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   One last thing.
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   You mentioned sugar.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:37.280]   I have this thing in my head and I think it's totally wrong, but I can't get over it.
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:39.880]   So maybe you can help.
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:44.680]   I've associated sugar with bad and I'm like, ah, sugar, which I know, nothing should be
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:46.120]   bad or good.
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:53.920]   And so somehow I've like translated sugar being bad to fruit has a lot of natural sugar
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:55.920]   and fruit falls in the dessert bucket.
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:58.440]   I mean, fruit is as magic.
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:57:59.800]   I love fruit so much.
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:00.800]   It's funny.
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:02.720]   I always am trying to like decide what my favorite fruit is.
[00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:06.240]   And I think I just do this to torture myself because it's always whatever's in season and
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:07.640]   is amazing right now.
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:12.600]   Like the melons right now are so good, like brings a tear to the eye and those pluots.
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:14.040]   But there's nothing wrong with fruit.
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:15.360]   Can you gain weight eating fruit?
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:16.360]   Totally.
[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:19.640]   If you eat a ton of fruit, you could gain weight eating anything, right?
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:21.620]   You can lose weight eating anything.
[00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:24.440]   It's really just a matter of how much you're eating.
[00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:27.600]   And that sounds simple, but it's true on one level.
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:32.600]   The problem is if you aren't eating a lot of protein and you then you can feel more
[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:34.680]   hungry and you will tend to eat more.
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:37.880]   And that's how people end up gaining weight is if they're eating more because they're
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:40.080]   not satisfied with what they are getting.
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:46.040]   But you know, there's plenty of room for fruit and in a healthy diet.
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:47.040]   It's a wonderful thing.
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:51.080]   And I find fruit is so ethereal, you know, it's like the really good stuff will be in
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:53.520]   season for like a few weeks at their peak.
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:59.200]   So the really good cherries, really good strawberries and like nothing on earth would tell me to
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:01.320]   ever tell somebody to like slow down on that.
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:02.320]   Go nuts.
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:03.320]   They're so good.
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:05.320]   Is there an easy way to figure out what's in season right now?
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:09.480]   I mean, the easiest way is to go to your local farmer's market.
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:11.480]   And they just only sell what's in season.
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:17.360]   I mean, you know, it's funny, it's like people ask me this all the time and I just picked
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:18.880]   it up by going to the market.
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:23.560]   But if you want to think about it in broad terms, so in the spring, everything's coming
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:24.560]   up, right?
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:26.440]   Everything was dead and cold and everything's coming up.
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:31.000]   So you get buds, you get asparagus shooting out of the ground, you get fresh lettuces,
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:35.500]   you get green garlic, you get sort of the delicate early stuff.
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:39.520]   You don't start really seeing new fruit until strawberries come out kind of in the late
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:44.320]   spring, early summer, and then you start getting like a fruit bonanza.
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:49.160]   And then in the summer, like it progresses into more hearty vegetables, carrots, broccolis,
[00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:50.920]   cauliflowers, things like that.
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:53.320]   Later in the summer, you get stuff that like takes a lot more ripening.
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:57.840]   So you think about like harvests and what takes a long time, like a tomato takes longer
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:03.200]   to ripen, winter squash take longer to ripen, corn takes longer to ripen, apples, pears
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:07.960]   kind of even later in the summer, melons are early or late summer.
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:13.580]   And as you move into winter, you start to have to like have the more hearty foods that
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:14.920]   are going to survive the frost.
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:21.040]   You get pomegranates at the beginning, you get a lot of root vegetables, tubers, heartier
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.840]   kales, things like that.
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:27.560]   In the winter, we eat a lot of radicchio salads, a lot of bitter greens, and then that's why
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.800]   we're so happy when the sweet ones come out in the spring again.
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:34.680]   But yeah, I mean, there's certain things that are kind of good all year, like broccoli,
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:35.680]   cauliflower, kale.
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:37.080]   I mean, they're pretty good all year.
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:39.920]   You can always get onions, you can always get garlic, although they're usually grown
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:41.960]   in certain times of year and then stored.
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:44.800]   Winter squash in the winter, summer squash in the summer.
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.160]   Yeah, the squash camp makes it so easy.
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:51.840]   If they just named every vegetable or fruit when it's ripe, that would be wonderful.
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:52.840]   Wouldn't it?
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:53.840]   Awesome.
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:56.640]   Okay, now I'm hungry, which is probably the worst time to go figure out what to eat.
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:00.200]   But before we go, I want you to share a little bit about what you're working on now because
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:03.600]   I know you have a new podcast and tell people where to find everything.
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.040]   Yeah, thank you.
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:11.920]   I recently launched the Daria Rose Show, which is all about me.
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:19.000]   I really wanted to just tackle some of the harder problems I was seeing in the world.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.640]   So I had a podcast called Foodist about all this stuff we're talking about right now.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:24.640]   And it was awesome.
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:26.560]   But then I had a bunch of babies.
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:30.280]   And that kind of fell aside for two years, and then COVID hit, and the whole world turned
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:31.280]   upside down.
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:37.600]   And I just felt like I needed to take a step back and address more basic questions.
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:42.800]   So instead of just personal health, how do we know what's true anymore?
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:46.720]   I felt like I had to step back and define that before I could even really get started
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:47.720]   on episodes.
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:52.960]   So my first four or five episodes are all about figuring out how to know what's true
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:57.680]   in the media, in science, in health, in medicine.
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:00.160]   And I just interview some amazing people on that front.
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:03.840]   And then just other personal health questions that aren't specific to food.
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:09.640]   For instance, I have an episode about sunscreen and how to pick a sunscreen because that's
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:12.640]   surprisingly complicated and tricky.
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:17.560]   So just those questions that are kind of hard, kind of controversial, but that you need answers
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:19.400]   to to navigate your life.
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:24.560]   And I just take a very fact-based, science-based approach and do what I've always done in food
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:27.320]   and kind of apply it to these other questions.
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:28.880]   It's been really, really fun.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:32.960]   It's been awesome to talk to smart people again and learn so much from others and share
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:35.600]   that with my audience who are so wonderful.
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:37.160]   Yeah, the show is fantastic.
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.360]   So definitely check it out.

[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:41.760]   All right.
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:42.760]   That's it for now.
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:04:03.940]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things money.
[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:07.760]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:12.080]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast, and it's much more about building generational
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:16.420]   wealth and spending your money on the things you value than it is about clipping coupons
[01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:17.960]   to save a dollar.
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:21.920]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone in this world
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:27.080]   can build wealth, and his passion and excitement are what make this show so entertaining.
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:32.280]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022, but recently I listened to
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:37.640]   an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow your mind, and it was so crazy
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:42.600]   to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating in their employer's retirement
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:43.600]   plan.
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:47.020]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:49.760]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.

[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:55.280]   money and grow your wealth.
