[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   All right, picking up the pace moving right along
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.140]   We have Jeffrey
[00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.600]   Just my papers here. All right, Jeffrey. What do you have for me?
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:16.700]   Jeffrey says what do you do when your passion might start to become economically viable?
[00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:23.340]   Currently, I have an okay thing going as CFO for a small company, but for a long time I had a hobby
[00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.840]   Writing fiction. I got some short stories published in professional publications
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.200]   I even received a few prizes and caught the interest of an agent
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.260]   At this stage, I realized that the next step was to write a full novel
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.280]   But this would take significant time as a consequence
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.720]   I'd perform some basic economic analysis determine how best to spend my time
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:48.100]   I'll spare you the details of all of Jeffrey's analysis, but basically he worked out that if he wrote one hour per day
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.920]   It would take him three years to write the novel and then he had a lot of issues about that
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.420]   Would he lose interest if he had to drag it out that long
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.160]   Though he has time to do that
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.800]   Would that be time he could have spent on other activities that would help him advance in his career as a CFO?
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.800]   So he's trying to figure this all out
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.920]   All right. So Jeffrey my thoughts
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.440]   Hey, it's clear from your tone that you're
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.200]   Interested in novel writing and not super psyched about your job. You say it's fine. I like my boss
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.800]   It's manageable, but not super exciting you in your elaboration. You say that multiple times. So that's interesting to me
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.880]   So what you want to do it sounds like is seriously explore the possibility of making more of
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:39.320]   Your income come from writing spend more time writing now. I think we have to do a Derek Sivers thing here, right?
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.860]   We need to use money as a neutral indicator of value. We can't just guess
[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.640]   Especially when it comes to fiction writing
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.600]   We can't just guess how much am I gonna make as a writer and plan based off of that?
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.960]   you need to make money as a writer and say here's how much I make as a writer and
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.840]   Then you can make really informed tactical decisions about what to do with your job
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.120]   So, how do you get to that information faster?
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.640]   Well, I'm gonna say first of all, you got to write more than an hour a day
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.040]   I think you should find out how to get the 20 hours a week. I think you can do that
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.680]   I think you need two hour writing blocks, which means you probably have to start earlier in the morning and
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:22.120]   A large weekend block as well. I think do at least that you can get the 20 hours a week
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.080]   Now we're greatly
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.700]   Accelerating the pace and even if you're only doing 15 hours a week, you're greatly accelerating the pace and then to take time off
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.680]   Take two weeks off
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.920]   Don't even have to be vacation. Look
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.880]   You're gonna assume that you're gonna sell the novel and agent is interested roll the dice and take a two-week leave of absence
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.760]   You can get easy
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.800]   50 hours in two weeks
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.720]   So you can get like a big push to finalize and polish it
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.240]   So that's what I'm saying like 20 hours a week 15 20 hours a week
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.160]   Four months from now take a two-week leave of absence knock that thing out. So let's get the feedback soon
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.640]   Get that novel out there. See if you sell it how much money
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.720]   What does my agents think was my editors think what's what are the reasonable case scenarios for my career here as a writer?
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.720]   Then you have the data
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.140]   To make the right decision and the right decision maybe bees full-time writing
[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.240]   Maybe I mean if you're if your spouse also works and you can live kind of cheap that might work
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.280]   Maybe and Jeffrey I'm looking in between the lines here. If Jeffrey is a pseudonym for
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.960]   Brandon Sanderson I
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.920]   Would say you probably are okay
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.160]   You're probably okay. You can probably quit your job or maybe what it is is you change your job
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.680]   you know, you're a CFO of a small company that means you could be a
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.200]   Financial consultant for companies we see this all the time part-time
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.200]   CFOs that smaller firms and smaller nonprofits hire to spend 10 hours a week
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.200]   They keep their books and help them make decisions, but they can't afford a full executive go to that work and like great
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.160]   And I'll be able to do that 30 hours a week and I'm writing the rest
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.520]   Then when my books get more successful I can drop that the 10 hours
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.040]   We like there's a lot that will be open to you
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.800]   But you need the hard data and you have to publish the book or at least sell the book
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.660]   Sell the book to get data to make that decision and I'm just gonna say don't take three years
[00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.720]   Work harder take time off take some but
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.900]   manageable risk risk not like quitting your job, but like leave of absences or
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.060]   Putting aside all promotion activities for a few months get the book done. See what happens
[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.380]   As Brandon Sanderson learned when he wrote name of the wind
[00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.140]   You sometimes you got to just write
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.820]   All right, Jesse. It's not an episode if we don't annoy
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.740]   Not only is that a noise fantasy fans, but a noise everyone who's not because they have no idea what the hell we're talking about
[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.260]   So that's another double whammy. That's the type of stuff you're gonna get with our triple threat show
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:48.600]   Once things died down. He's probably your first guest Brandon. He'll be in here. He'll like to coma coffee. Where's he? Where's he based?
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.540]   He's like Utah or something. He's probably got enough money to fly here though
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.620]   Yeah, you gotta fly out here. I
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.380]   Do want to have I mean we do want to do guests. We're trying to think through like what the right
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.900]   Format is do we want?
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.620]   People who are living interesting lives what famous people do it, whatever. We're trying to figure that out selfishly
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.020]   I want you to talk to a bunch of people. I want you to talk to Elon
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.980]   I want you to talk to mark Jesse has the most unreasonable plans for I think they all want to talk to you
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.660]   Jesse has
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:22.340]   Ridiculously unreasonable plans for who's gonna come in here. I can pick them up from the you know, the train in my truck
[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.980]   Let me awesome. You picked up Elon in your truck. It's not gonna bring your truck
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:32.260]   You know how many publicists would get fired if those people came here and like they came with their publicist
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.060]   They're like, oh my god. I'm terrible at my job. No, I like your optimism
[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.700]   I like it
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.460]   But anyways, we're gonna have guests and and I for sure at the top of my list is I I want to have novelist on
[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:47.040]   I think just be cool to talk to I'm gonna talk to working not literary novelist because that seems unapproachable and hard but genre
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.660]   Novelist and like tell me about your life. Yeah
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:57.020]   Speaking of publicist real quick. It's in some of those shows like the super pumped one and we crash one
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.740]   They have publicists in there and they get treated horribly the publicist. Ah
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:08.820]   Just by those like really rich CEO dudes who like a tenacious. Oh, man, I just get and by the wives. Ah
[00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.140]   well
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.220]   Hopefully Lillian and Margo. You don't feel like I treat you that way. I
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:20.660]   Try to be I try to be nice. We got a great team of publicist at portfolio
[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.780]   Been dragged around
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:29.660]   various cities with me to going to various various places and studios and I
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.980]   Always appreciate what they do. So Lillian and Margo you have my appreciation. I will try not to be like the we work guy
[00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.900]   [music fades out]
