[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.960]   It's been a while since I've done this. I'm back at home in front of my microphone and ready to get back to work. And of course, when you're on the road, it's a useful time to think about the subject of travel. It has been my personal experience that the vast majority of people have, at least they say they have, a major life goal of traveling. Now, the reason I modified the statement is when you ask them, they say they want to travel. But when you look at many people's lives, it seems to me that most people don't actually want to travel because most people don't want to travel. So I'm going to go ahead and get back to work.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:44.800]  .
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:04:02.960]  .
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:13.880]   They traveled nonstop from Moscow, Russia, on this round the world trip. They traveled from Moscow across to China, across India, then to Egypt.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.820]   Then they hitchhiked from Moscow to China.
[00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:44.840]   adopts a plan to make the trip as a way to get back to work. They also did a tour down and up through South America, up through Central America and then all across the United States and Canada. I don't remember the exact number of countries. Probably 35-ish countries, 30 to 40 countries in that time. But they traveled for 752 days. And in that time, how much do you want to think that they spent as a couple traveling for just over two years.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:05:14.860]  , they spent, they were very diligent about tracking their expenses, the total they spent travel for two years was $13,431 and when they left Russia, they just had money in the bank account I think something like $15,000, $10 or $15,000 and they just went out planning to travel until their money ran out. And because of that they were extremely frugal and extremely frugal and they were able to get their money back.
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.860]   And they were able to get their money back.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:44.880]   I'll go over some of their expenses in a minute and I'll make sure to link you to the video. Maybe I'll pull the audio from it and share it with you so that you can listen to him talk about their actual expenses.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.880]   But I found that super inspirational.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.880]   A couple, two people traveling for over two years with a total money of $13,431.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.880]   Their daily cost of total daily cost was $13,431.

[00:06:44.960 --> 00:07:14.940]  , you can travel if you want to do it without regard whatsoever to your financial condition.
[00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:14.940]   It's very simple.
[00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:14.940]   If you want to travel you walk out your front door, toss the keys to somebody, walk out your front door, turn right or turn left and go. And voila, you are now traveling. Any person who wants to do it can do it.

[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:10.700]   Now that's probably not what you were thinking of when you talked about traveling and wanting to travel. That's certainly not necessarily what I'm thinking of. If I really wanted to travel and I had never traveled, I would consider walking out my front door, turning left or right, but it's never been my particular thing. Maybe someday it will be. Maybe I'll walk across the United States or walk across Europe. So thus far, that's never really appealed to me. So you do need to think about what you are trying to accomplish.

Well, that's probably your best place to start. If you have a car and you want to travel, consider just simply traveling in your car and using that to be your means of transportation. In some places, that can be a very inexpensive way to travel. Probably the best here would be the United States and Canada. Traveling around the United States and Canada in car is
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:39.600]   and the United States and Canada in car is probably going to give your best solution and be really your most frugal strategy. Bussing around is hard. The hostile network is not like it is in other places. So having your own car can be a very low price and effective strategy. This can be very freeing for you. When I was younger, newly graduated from college, one of the things that I did that was really for me quite helpful and empowering was I took a trip around the United States in an old car that I had. The first car that I ever had was a Ford.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:39.600]   The first car that I ever had was a Ford.

I exclusively stayed with friends. I mapped my my trip out by where I knew people until I could stay on people's in people's houses that also help with food because I could eat with them. And so I spent a good bit of money on gas but almost nothing on lodging and traveled for several months for a very low budget. I don't remember the exact numbers. So if you have a car consider using that if you don't have a car then look and say what else are my
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:13:09.660]   in the car I would guess that for most of us international travel is probably somewhere that we have a bit of a bent a lean you can walk out your front door and you can go ten miles down the roads and set up a tent in the woods near your house and you are by definition traveling but you're probably already doing that so you don't need much input from me you can go to the next state over but again you probably don't have to be in the car for that long time so I'll just take the car and go and head off.

YEARS AGO, WHEN MY FATHER WAS GROWING UP, MY GRANDPARENTS WOULD DRIVE BACK AND FORTH FROM COLORADO TO CALIFORNIA. AND AT NIGHT, THEY WOULD BE OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT. THEY COULDN'T HAVE MONEY FOR A HOTEL. THEY WOULD PULL OVER ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. MY GRANDMOTHER WOULD SLEEP IN THE CAR. AND MY GRANDFATHER AND MY DAD, THEY WOULD GO OUT IN THE BUSHES AND SLEEP ON THE GROUND. THAT WAS THE WAY IT WAS.

Now, I don't like to travel that way. I like to be a little bit more comfortable because I'm kind of soft and weak, but the point is you can do it. So you could just travel and sleep wherever you find yourself.

[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:39.340]  , you could just like, and you find yourself.
[00:34:39.380 --> 00:35:09.360]  , and you can do this the old fashioned way. Build yourself a teepee and live out in the woods. When I was traveling around the U.S., I spent a bunch of time talking to a guy who did that. He still lives in a teepee in the woods and had for decades. Or you can purchase a more modern tent,
