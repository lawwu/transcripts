[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.700]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.800]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.120]   My name is Joshua, and today I want to help you to live a rich life now while not damaging
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.880]   your plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less with a discussion of how to travel
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.120]   the world on the cheap.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.400]   I've been out traveling the last couple of weeks, and I'm now back at home, back in front
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.000]   of my microphone, and ready to get back to work.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.920]   Of course, when you're on the road, it's a useful time to think about the subject of
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.920]   travel.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.360]   It has been my personal experience that the vast majority of people have, at least they
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.400]   say they have, a major life goal of traveling.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.640]   The reason I modify the statement is when you ask them, they say they want to travel,
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.800]   but when you look at many people's lives, it seems to me that most people don't actually
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.200]   want to travel because most people don't.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.560]   But for years I worked as a financial advisor, and as part of that process I would ask people
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.000]   about their life goals and their financial goals, and especially I would talk to them
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.320]   about retirement.
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.320]   And I would estimate about 80% of the time when I would ask somebody what they wanted
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.080]   to do when they were retired, they would say something like, "I'd like to travel more."
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.560]   And then I would try to open them up and say, "Well, what do you mean?
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.800]   Where would you like to travel?
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.800]   How would you like to travel?
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.060]   What does that mean?"
[00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.440]   And I learned that everyone says they want to travel, and yet very few people are clear
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.280]   on exactly what it is they want to do or how they want to do it.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.160]   Few thoughts on why this is.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.680]   First, many people don't like traveling, and I think that's perfectly fine.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.320]   Frankly, after traveling I'm always happy just to get home.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.840]   One of the best things about traveling is that it makes you appreciate your house.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.880]   It makes you appreciate home.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.960]   So that can be useful.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.680]   In fact, I'm at a place where at the moment I don't particularly want to travel much right
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.680]   now.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.120]   I have been very fortunate and blessed to be able to travel quite a bit in the past.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.000]   I'm sure that I will travel more in the future, but right now I don't want to do any more
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   traveling.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.280]   And there are lots of people who just recognize that they're unproductive when they travel,
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.560]   they're uncomfortable, they don't see the point.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.240]   They'd rather sit at home and be in their comfortable surroundings and watch travel
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.080]   videos on their TV, which is fine.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.080]   It's a free world, right?
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.520]   Nobody has to force anybody to do anything they don't want to do.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.840]   But I know that a lot of people have this desire to travel, and I want to help you if
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.040]   you have that desire.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.440]   I want to help you do it soon.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.600]   I want to show you how you can travel now, how you can do it soon.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:39.000]   I do believe there is great value in traveling, because traveling, being in unusual situations,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.160]   unusual places, it exposes you to things that can have a formative impact on your life.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.320]   It can shape your life.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.740]   It can help you to see the world differently.
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.320]   It can help you to appreciate other people.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.720]   It can help you to consider your own ideas and consider are they really true, or are
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.800]   you just think they're true because you haven't been exposed to alternative ways of seeing
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.800]   the world.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.800]   And so I want to help you.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.320]   If you say that you'd like to travel, I want to help you do that.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.960]   I want to help you do it quickly.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:14.040]   I was also inspired by stumbling across a video on YouTube from a channel called Canrush,
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:21.160]   wherein a couple, a Canadian husband and his Russian wife who live in Russia, profiled
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.280]   and talked about the way that they traveled the world.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.160]   And so they traveled the world for a total of 752 days.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.600]   So that's about two and a half years, or just over two years.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.920]   They traveled nonstop from Moscow, Russia.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.880]   On this round-the-world trip, they traveled from Moscow across to China, across India,
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.880]   then to Egypt, then they hitchhiked all around about eight countries in Africa.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.360]   They flew from Angola to Brazil, did the whole tour down and up through South America, up
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.160]   through Central America, and then all across the United States and Canada.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.040]   I don't remember the exact number of countries, but probably 35-ish countries, 30 to 40 countries
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.280]   in that time.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.840]   But they traveled for, again, 752 days.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:13.320]   And in that time, how much do you want to think that they spent as a couple traveling
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.560]   for just over two years?
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.640]   The total that they spent, and they were very diligent about tracking their expenses, the
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:29.040]   total they spent to travel for two years was $13,431.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.280]   And when they left Russia, they just had money in a bank account, I think something like
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.600]   $15,000, $10,000 or $15,000, and they just went out planning to travel until their money
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.800]   ran out.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:48.440]   And because of that, they were extremely frugal and used it, and were able to stretch their
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.000]   travel time out to a total of two years.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.880]   I'll go over some of their expenses in a minute, and I'll make sure to link you to the video.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.120]   Maybe I'll pull the audio from it and share it with you so that you can listen to him
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.160]   talk about their actual expenses.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.120]   But I found that super inspirational.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:10.660]   A couple, two people traveling for over two years with a total money of $13,431.
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:20.520]   Their daily cost, of total daily cost, was $17.86 per day, including all of the expenses.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.440]   Now that is expenses included buying and selling several cars, renting cars, et cetera, in
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.940]   the United States.
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.280]   And so they could have traveled cheaper if they'd had some better fortune with the cars
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.720]   that they bought, but total it was $17.86 per day.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.200]   If they pulled out the cars and such, it came out to about $12 per day.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.920]   So I found that inspirational.
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.440]   So let's talk about some strategies that you can use.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.520]   If you want to travel, but you feel constrained by money, here are some useful strategies
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.800]   to help you accomplish your traveling goals sooner, to help you do it on the cheap so
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.080]   that you continue to save money, or to help you to do it when you don't yet have a lot
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.260]   of money.
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:06.520]   The first thing is to recognize traveling can be done by any person in the world who
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:15.120]   wants to do it without regard whatsoever to your financial condition.
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:23.320]   You can travel if you want to do it without regard whatsoever to your financial condition.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.760]   It's very simple.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:31.680]   If you want to travel, you walk out your front door, toss the keys to somebody, walk out
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:39.520]   your front door, turn right or turn left, and go.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.740]   And voila, you are now traveling.
[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.720]   Any person in the world can walk out their front door, leave the keys in the lock, and
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:56.120]   turn right or left or maybe straight ahead and start walking.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.240]   And you are now by definition traveling.
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.960]   Now maybe you walk, maybe you stick your thumb out and wait for a ride, maybe you go down
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:11.600]   and buy a bus ticket, maybe you get on a bicycle, buy a bicycle and start pedaling, but that
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.760]   is by definition traveling.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.920]   And walking is by definition traveling.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.120]   And you can walk your way across the world.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.160]   Over the years I've always had an interest in extensive travel stories.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.240]   I've read, I don't think I've read books, but I've read essays and websites and articles
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.760]   about people who have walked across the world for years and years.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.400]   I've read essays about people who've bicycled across the world.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:42.280]   I've read essays about people who ride motorcycles and drive.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:48.320]   There's a great website that was curated by an Australian couple called Lost Horizons
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.560]   who over the course of about a decade, maybe a decade and a half, rode one Harley Davidson
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.000]   motorcycle to every country in the world.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.920]   Remarkable and they chronicled it all on their website.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.120]   It's just a remarkable website.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.800]   So you can do it in all different forms, but you can do it just simply by walking.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.160]   And you can walk without a dime to your name.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.840]   And along the way you can figure out how to provide for your sustenance.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.220]   Now that's probably not what you were thinking of when you talked about traveling and wanting
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.480]   to travel.
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.760]   That's certainly not necessarily what I'm thinking of.
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:27.320]   If I really wanted to travel and I had never traveled, I would consider walking out my
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:32.520]   front door, turning left or right, but that's never been my particular thing.
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.520]   Maybe someday it will be.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.840]   Maybe I'll walk across the United States or walk across Europe.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.060]   But thus far that's never really appealed to me.
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:44.200]   So you do need to think about what you are trying to accomplish in your travels and clarify
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.200]   that.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:51.480]   But don't assume that because somebody else travels in a luxury personal automobile or
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:57.280]   a giant RV or first class airfare all around the world in five star hotels, don't assume
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.640]   that that's exactly what you want to do and what you need to do.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:08.080]   I think most of us, if given the choice between flying around the world using first class
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:14.360]   tickets on premier airlines, staying in five star hotels and eating at fine dining restaurants
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:19.720]   without regard to the cost, if we were given the opportunity to travel in that way versus
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.920]   the opportunity to walk across the world, sleep on the ground under the stars and eat
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:31.360]   what people gave us to eat, most of us I think would prefer the five star hotel route.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:37.680]   But if your choice was between traveling on a budget, even a severely restricted budget,
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:44.680]   and not traveling at all, I think a lot of us would choose the traveling on a budget
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.880]   as being better than not traveling at all.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.400]   Not everybody would.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.480]   If you're comfortable in your home, again, realize, "Hey, I don't want to travel that
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.480]   way."
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.480]   Good, don't.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:58.480]   But there are a lot of us who would rather travel on a budget because it provides that
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.480]   grist for the middle of our life experience.
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.480]   Consider if that's you.
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:09.120]   Now, there's a very decent chance that you have more resources than simply a pair of
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.880]   shoes that you're going to walk around the world in.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.720]   You probably have stuff already that works for you to travel.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.240]   You probably already have a car, for example.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.920]   Well, that's probably your best place to start.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:25.920]   If you have a car and you want to travel, consider just simply traveling in your car
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.760]   and using that to be your means of transportation.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.800]   In some places, that can be a very inexpensive way to travel.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.360]   Probably the best here would be the United States and Canada.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:42.000]   Traveling around the United States and Canada in car is probably going to give your best
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.280]   solution and be really your most frugal strategy.
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.520]   Busing around is hard.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.920]   The hostile network is not like it is in other places.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:55.880]   Having your own car can be a very low price and effective strategy.
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.900]   This can be very freeing for you.
[00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:02.560]   When I was younger, newly graduated from college, one of the things that I did that was really
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.920]   for me quite helpful and empowering was I took a trip around the United States in an
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.160]   old car that I had, the first car that I ever had.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160]   I paid $2,000 for it.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.560]   When I graduated from college, it was an old Honda Accord.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.480]   It had almost 200,000 miles on it.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.200]   I wanted to travel, but as memory serves, I think I had a couple thousand dollars in
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.440]   my savings that I could use for travel.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.040]   I just thought, "Well, how can I do it?"
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:29.400]   I was scared to go off in my car and drive this car with 200,000 miles all around the
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.400]   country, but I thought, "You know what?
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.280]   Worst case scenario, the car breaks down.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:37.520]   I leave it on the side of the road and I buy a bus ticket or a plane ticket home and I
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.520]   go home.
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.320]   I'll make sure that I have enough money to buy a bus ticket or a plane ticket home and
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.760]   I'll take the car."
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.920]   I took the car and drove it all around the United States, all around Canada.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.600]   I exclusively stayed with friends.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:54.920]   I mapped my trip out by where I knew people and so I could stay on people's houses.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.760]   That also helped with food because I could eat with them.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.440]   I spent a good bit of money on gas, but almost nothing on lodging and traveled for several
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.840]   months for a very low budget.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.040]   I don't remember the exact numbers.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.300]   If you have a car, consider using that.
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:12.680]   If you don't have a car, then look and say, "What else am I trying to do?"
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:16.940]   From here on out, I'm going to talk about international travel because I would guess
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:22.280]   that for most of us, international travel is probably somewhere that we have a bit of
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.280]   a bent, a lean.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:29.000]   Yet, you can walk out your front door and you can go 10 miles down the roads and set
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.400]   up a tent in the woods near your house and you are, by definition, traveling.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.060]   But you're probably already doing that, so you don't need much input from me.
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:42.120]   You can go to the next state over, but again, you probably don't need much from me to do
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.120]   that.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.160]   But if you're thinking about going on to the other side of the world, perhaps that might
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.480]   be a little bit more challenging for you.
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:55.000]   So let's talk about how do you save money and travel the world on the cheap.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.240]   In traveling, there are a few different categories of costs.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:06.680]   Your number one cost in traveling is going to be the cost of your life at home.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:10.000]   This is a very important concept for you to grasp.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.180]   Your biggest cost will be your life at home.
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:21.280]   If you rent a house or have a mortgage payment and you continue to maintain that rental house
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:27.360]   and that mortgage or that mortgaged house while you are traveling, you will have your
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:33.600]   home expenses and your travel expenses to pay for.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.160]   That's a big, big cost.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.880]   Now, it's possible that you may not have those expenses if you live in some way where you
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:44.640]   don't pay a monthly rent payment or you own your house outright so you don't owe a monthly
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:45.640]   mortgage payment.
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.320]   That can help quite a bit.
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:55.240]   But your biggest cost of travel is going to be if travel is added on to your normal expenses.
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:59.320]   So you have to think about this and ask yourself, "Is there a way that I can eliminate these
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.440]   normal expenses?"
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:08.840]   In 2018, my family and I traveled around the United States in a travel trailer, in an RV.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:14.600]   But one of the things that we did in that time was we made sure that we abandoned all
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.080]   of our previous housing.
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.680]   So we stopped renting the apartment that we were renting previously.
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:26.320]   We made sure that we canceled all of our expenses so we had no expenses from home.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.040]   And that makes a massive difference.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:35.680]   In traveling the country full-time, we spent more or less the same amount of money traveling
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:39.120]   as we spent living in South Florida.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.440]   It's just the numbers were changed a little bit.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:47.520]   Now it wasn't perfectly more or less because of the purchase price of vehicles and such.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:54.400]   So it wound up being a little bit more based upon the cost of the transportation.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:58.160]   But in terms of being on the road, once you buy the vehicles, which that can be budgeted
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:03.240]   for if you buy an RV or need a car or whatever it is you need, once you're on the road, then
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.600]   the basic costs are just what you have on the road.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:10.520]   And so if you eat at home, you have the cost of eating at home and you have the cost of
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.520]   eating on the road.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.480]   That's the easiest one to adjust.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:18.680]   But if you are used to paying $1,500 a month on rent, you can either pay $1,500 a month
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.120]   on rent in Boston, Massachusetts, or if you have an RV, you can pay $1,500 a month in
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.840]   RV parks all around the country.
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.640]   But it's your costs that are additive that make it tough.
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.160]   This is where the vacation model becomes really challenging.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:38.360]   If we go with the basic concept of a two-week vacation where you say, "Okay, we have our
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.800]   normal life, but around the holidays or in the summer, we're going to take a two-week
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:46.400]   vacation or a four-week vacation," all of your travel expenses generally are going to
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.360]   be added on to your normal cost of living.
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.600]   Thus, your vacation is going to be very high.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:59.720]   If you can figure out a way to eliminate or defray your expenses at home, then your travel
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.320]   costs are fairly straightforward.
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.320]   How do you do it?
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.680]   Well, first, you can eliminate them.
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:09.280]   You can do the drastic step of giving up an apartment, not renting an apartment anymore,
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.840]   of selling your house, putting your things in storage, or getting rid of all your things.
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.200]   It's a very big step.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:20.000]   It's a lot of work, but it can be done and it can give you that ability to go where you
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.160]   want without being tied down.
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.840]   It's really unique.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.640]   It's something that I think very few of us ever do.
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:35.480]   I like to do things myself before I talk about them, but I've gone through the various stages
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:39.080]   of size of your possessions.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.580]   When I was younger, of course, I had few possessions.
[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:44.920]   My wife and I lived in a tiny studio apartment when we first married.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:45.920]   Then we bought a big house.
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:50.280]   I adjusted our possessions to fit the big house, had tools and stuff everywhere.
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:54.080]   Then we downsized into an apartment, downsized into an RV, and then ultimately downsized
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:58.640]   into about seven or eight suitcases and traveled with all our children across the world with
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.320]   seven or eight suitcases.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:05.880]   It was remarkable how we could be perfectly comfortable living out of seven or eight suitcases.
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:10.680]   There were some things in the seven or eight suitcases that we really missed.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:15.080]   That was more due to the challenge of being parents of young children.
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:20.000]   For example, you have a small number of toys fit in the suitcases, which was great.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.240]   A small number of books fit in the suitcases, which was great.
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:27.880]   But we got really tired of reading the same 15 or 20 books again and again and again and
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:28.880]   again.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.440]   So there are some downsides to that.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:37.360]   But in terms of the flexibility of recognizing that, wow, with eight suitcases, even though
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:43.840]   in my case I have a large family, I can move my entire family in a minivan or a sedan.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.880]   It's remarkable how much freedom that can bring to you.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.080]   So it's really freeing to be free of possessions.
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:56.960]   I'm not a proponent of the philosophy of minimalism as being good in and of itself.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:57.960]   I think that's silly.
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:02.800]   I think it's short-sighted to say that there's somehow a prize for whoever has the least
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.880]   number of physical possessions.
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:09.680]   To me, it seems that the number of physical possessions that you have should fit the lifestyle
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.680]   that you're living.
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.880]   So if you want to live on the road, pack light.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.200]   Just have a few things.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.600]   If you're going to be a farmer, you're going to need more possessions because trying to
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.680]   be a farmer and live out of a suitcase can be very, very frustrating.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:25.960]   The hoe doesn't fit in the suitcase or the tractor.
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.340]   You insert whatever you want to.
[00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.340]   So consider the cost of your life at home.
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:34.960]   Another way to cover those costs is to defray your expenses.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.160]   Now you can do this formally or you can do this when you see an opportunity.
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:43.080]   For example, you can do a vacation house swap.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.760]   Let's say you have a house and you live in Boston, Massachusetts.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.360]   You'd like to go to Dublin, Ireland.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:52.480]   Well get online, go to one of the house swap websites and see if you can do a house swap
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.600]   with somebody.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.200]   And you can live in their house in Dublin, Ireland and they can live in your house in
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.880]   Boston, Massachusetts.
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:03.880]   You can also do this when you see an opportunity for perhaps a low-maintenance tenant to rent
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:04.960]   your house.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.500]   Maybe you have a family member who's going through transition time and they're looking
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.160]   for a house to rent but just on a short-term thing.
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.880]   Well put them in your house for a couple of months.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.120]   Let them use your stuff.
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.220]   Have them pay you rent.
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.080]   That covers your cost of home and go travel for a couple of months.
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:22.200]   It allows you to not have to move out of your place but it simply allows you to go on the
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:26.720]   road and you can do that of course with a more arm's-length rental transaction as well.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:31.040]   Rent your house out for a year, go travel for a year, come on back, open up the lock
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.240]   shed in the back where you put your personal items, put them back in your house and you're
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.160]   ready to set up your life again.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:42.180]   But think about how you can eliminate the costs of your life at home.
[00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:47.460]   This is why being free of debt is so important so that you don't have a big debt load because
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:50.440]   if you don't have debt, it's very easy to cut off your home expenses.
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:57.620]   This is why keeping your life relatively contract-free, not having contracts on your cell phone and
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.600]   not having contracts on your internet and all that stuff.
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.400]   So then anytime you want, you can just turn the stuff off, say that's it, this is the
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.580]   last month.
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.920]   You can easily cut your expenses at home, go on the road and then come back and pick
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:07.920]   them up.
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.420]   But recognize your biggest cost is most likely going to be the cost of maintaining your life
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.860]   at home while you're traveling.
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:19.800]   Now with regard to actual travel expenses, your first category is transportation.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:23.020]   Transportation for you from one place to another.
[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:29.440]   And so one of your major strategies needs to be to minimize the costs of your transportation.
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:36.060]   So you should choose an appropriate travel methodology for your goals and think about
[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.840]   low price.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:43.060]   In my example of turning out the door and walking, that could be a great strategy for
[00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:50.220]   an active, healthy young person who just has a little bit of money and isn't too concerned
[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.800]   about going to the other side of the world necessarily.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:57.380]   That would be harder for somebody like me with young children and babies who don't
[00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.060]   really walk very well.
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:02.580]   They don't have quite the hiking stamina that you would like.
[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:06.820]   And so when I would think about traveling, I think about how am I going to minimize the
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.420]   cost of the transportation in an appropriate way.
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.180]   So think about your region of travel.
[00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:13.180]   What's available?
[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:14.900]   Are buses available and inexpensive?
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.340]   Are trains?
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.840]   Should you consider buying a car?
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.280]   Should you hitchhike?
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:25.700]   There are lots of things that you can do that will allow you to move yourself around the
[00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:29.480]   world without much money.
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:35.280]   The very inspiring story that I shared with you about the Kenrush channel where the couple
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:42.960]   spent the $13,500 to travel for two years, they exclusively hitchhiked in every place
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:47.020]   except the United States and Canada where they bought a car and with the exception of
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:50.960]   a few international flights to get them from one continent to another.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:56.700]   But in order to conserve their money, they exclusively hitchhiked in every country.
[00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:01.500]   And they saved massive amounts of money and had incredible adventures by hitchhiking.
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.300]   So you could do that too.
[00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.440]   That'd be something worth considering.
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:10.960]   Another big strategy is to do this, to stretch out your time between transportation so that
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.560]   your daily cost of transportation is much lower.
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.320]   I'll give you a simple example.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:18.780]   Say you're an American and you live living in the United States and you want to go on
[00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:20.680]   a European vacation.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:25.880]   Well if you plan a 10-day tour of Europe and you buy plane tickets for a 10-day tour of
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:32.700]   Europe, let's assume your ticket costs $1,000 to get from the United States to Europe.
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:41.160]   With a $1,000 ticket on a 10-day tour, you have a daily cost of $100 of airfare.
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:46.200]   Every day of your trip, you're going to be spending $100 on airfare as we amortize the
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.680]   $1,000 expense over 10 days.
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:56.760]   Now if you will increase the time in Europe from 10 days to 30 days, you'll have the same
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.560]   $1,000 but now your daily cost is lower.
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:05.400]   You'll have $30 per day on airfare instead of $100 per day.
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:10.100]   Or if you extend it out even further to a 200-day tour of Europe, now your airfare costs
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:14.620]   are only $5 per day instead of $100 per day.
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.160]   Question is, is that a good thing for you to do?
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.160]   Well it depends.
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:22.120]   If you were paying a bunch of at-home expenses for your house in the United States, then
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:26.680]   maybe that 10-day tour is all you could afford because you had to get back and stop the travel
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.040]   expenses.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:32.920]   If you're staying in very expensive hotels and you additionally have a $200 a day hotel
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:37.960]   bill, then certainly it's going to be more expensive for you to be on a 30-day tour at
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.980]   $200 a day than a 10-day tour at $200 per day.
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:44.180]   But if you can adjust those accommodation expenses in Europe and you can adjust those
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:51.740]   home expenses by simply lengthening out your trip, you'll lower the overall impact of the
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.960]   cost of airfare.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:24:01.980]   In the example that I gave you with the Canrush couple, the total that they spent on flights
[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:04.140]   was $2,300.
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:14.420]   They flew from India to Egypt, then they flew from Angola to Brazil, and then they ultimately
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.180]   flew from Canada back to Moscow.
[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:21.620]   And so they chose the flights based upon inexpensiveness, but they traveled around the world for a total
[00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:24.380]   airfare of $2,300.
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:29.100]   Whereas if they had gone from their home in Moscow to all these other places, it would
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.460]   have been tens of thousands of dollars of airfare.
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:32.940]   Well, how'd they get there?
[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.980]   Because they had more time and thus could make more efficient choices.
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:39.580]   Now, the other thing is if you'll stretch out your time between transportation, you
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:45.700]   can very quickly have much cheaper options on even the airfare itself.
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:52.220]   For example, if you want to go to France and yet the tickets to France are very expensive,
[00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:55.820]   if you only have 10 days, you can't fly into the other side of Europe where you could fly
[00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:59.900]   in for $500 and then make your way on the train system to France.
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.980]   You just got to get to France, do your France things and get home.
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:07.620]   But if you have more time, then you can take advantage of a discount ticket or something
[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:11.940]   that's just massive discounts to fly into the other side of Europe and then make your
[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:16.660]   way slowly to France, which would be much cheaper on the local system than the international
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:17.740]   airplanes.
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:23.660]   So consider stretching out your time and calculate your daily cost of air transportation.
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:28.420]   Here are a couple of other things that I would suggest that you do with regard to air transportation.
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:36.340]   First, if you don't care much where you go, first figure out where it's cheap to go and
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.880]   then figure out what to do there.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:44.380]   When you're trying to travel, the time that you will pay the most money in air transportation
[00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:49.220]   is when you need to be in a specific city on a certain set of dates.
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:51.380]   Then you have almost no flexibility.
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:58.900]   I have to be in London from the first through the eighth because I have these events scheduled.
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:06.020]   Well, you're pretty much stuck with whatever the airlines are charging for you to be in
[00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:09.140]   London from the first through the eighth.
[00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:12.460]   So even when you go out and try to get a good deal on a ticket, you're going to have a very
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:13.620]   difficult time.
[00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:17.700]   But if you'll shop the tickets based upon what's cheap to get to and you say all of
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:23.780]   a sudden find a cheap ticket to Germany and you say, "Well, that'd be interesting.
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:26.880]   I bet I could find interesting things to see in Germany."
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.300]   Then you can take the cheaper ticket, go and then look up and figure out what interesting
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.500]   things are there to do in Germany.
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:37.220]   So think about where you can get – find the ticket first that's cheap and then think
[00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:39.180]   about what there is worth doing there.
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:43.300]   A couple of tools that I use there without doing a full lesson on it first.
[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.340]   The Kayak Explore function is fantastic.
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:52.860]   If you go to a website called kayak.com/explore, you can put in your home airport and then
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:56.660]   you can see where in the world you can go on a certain budget.
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:00.300]   Again that's kayak.com/explore.
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:05.140]   And that's a really, really useful function.
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:11.860]   So if you live in Miami, you can see where can I fly from Miami, from Fort Lauderdale,
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:15.180]   from West Palm Beach, from Orlando, from Tampa.
[00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.860]   And then you can see the tickets that are available.
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:19.660]   And this can be a really useful tool.
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:23.300]   You can check it every day, every couple of days and you can find some really great deals
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:24.940]   on airfare.
[00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:30.140]   There are a number of deal websites and subscription services that also will help you find discount
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:31.200]   airfare.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.560]   So if you're not going to go and travel for a year, you just want to travel from time
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.720]   to time but you're open to it, search those companies, find those people who are compiling
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.100]   them and do that.
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:45.700]   Another tool that I think is so useful is the Matrix software.
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:50.300]   The website for Matrix is matrix.itasoftware.com.
[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:55.380]   I'm not going to go deep into this tool but basically it's in many ways a travel agent
[00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:59.820]   tool which you can use to find interesting flight itineraries.
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:03.620]   It's owned now by Google and it's the software that powers Google Flights.
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:04.620]   Many people use Google Flights.
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:06.660]   It's a little bit more user friendly.
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:10.620]   But if you're looking for a way to figure out how to put together massively discounted
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:16.000]   airfares from interesting places to interesting places, it's hard to see how you're not going
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.340]   to be using matrix.itasoftware.com.
[00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:25.720]   Search the internet for the world of travel blogs and airline mile lessons and things
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.380]   for how to use the software.
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.180]   But it's extremely useful.
[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:33.020]   And one of the things I like to do is just to use it to segment out flights in a way
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:34.660]   so that you can stay.
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:39.260]   For example, one of the things you can do with matrix is you can force long stays in
[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:40.260]   a certain city.
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:44.340]   So if you want to have a long layover, say you want to have a 22-hour layover in a city
[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:48.380]   so you can get a good night's sleep in a local hotel or do some sightseeing without paying
[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:52.700]   extra for an extra stopover, the matrix software allows you to do that.
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.100]   I find that to be really useful.
[00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:58.880]   And then think carefully how you maximize your transport for the number of people that
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:28:59.880]   you have.
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:03.920]   If you're a single person traveling alone, hitchhiking is going to be very, very simple
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.060]   for you because you can easily fit into a car.
[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:09.260]   It is one person.
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:13.140]   My family, it's hard to see how anybody is going to have enough room to pick us up.
[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:16.620]   So we can't all stand by the side of the road with our thumbs out unless we're expecting
[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:20.940]   somebody to ride in the back of a pickup truck or ride in the back of a truck.
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:24.480]   Common in many parts of the world, less common in other parts of the world.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:29.220]   So we're more likely to choose the efficiency of a driving option of some kind, of owning
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:34.780]   a car or having our own car because it's really efficient for the number of people that we
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:36.260]   have to move.
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:37.700]   But you may be able to do that too.
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:43.900]   Let's say that you are in the United States but you want to take a road trip in Central
[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:44.900]   America.
[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:48.300]   Well, instead of you just going, get a couple of your friends together.
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:51.700]   If you get four dudes in a car, the weight is going to lower the gas mileage a little
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:56.420]   bit as compared to one, but it's going to be pretty close to cutting your costs on transportation
[00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.300]   by 75%.
[00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:03.180]   Every single border crossing in your car is going to be cheaper because the fees for the
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:06.700]   permiso for your car is going to be cut by 75%.
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.460]   Your fuel costs are cut by 75%.
[00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:11.220]   Your insurance costs are cut by 75%.
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:15.460]   You'll even save money on the lodging by being with some other dudes.
[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:20.320]   So plan it out and think about, is there a way that we can maximize the number of people?
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.460]   That's enough for transportation.
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:25.500]   Your major strategy is, of course, choose a low-cost transportation option that's appropriate
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:26.660]   to you.
[00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:30.000]   Don't forget walking and riding bicycles.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:36.420]   You can travel the world or your state or your country walking and riding bicycles.
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:41.420]   Very efficient, very flexible, very low cost, and you can have some wonderful experiences.
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:44.460]   Just obviously, if you're walking, you're going to meet a lot more people if you're
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:47.600]   walking or riding a bicycle because you're in the people.
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.600]   You're in the crowd.
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:52.260]   You're going to try to hide the way that you can if you're hiding in your car, surrounded
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:53.260]   by walls.
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:54.920]   You're not really talking to people so much.
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:58.720]   So think about what's an appropriate transportation strategy for you.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.180]   Next would be lodging.
[00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:02.880]   So how are you going to sleep?
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.080]   Where are you going to sleep at night?
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.080]   Where are you going to stay?
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.200]   Where are you going to be?
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.840]   Here your major strategy is simple.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:12.280]   Minimize your needs and then consider what would appropriately fit those needs given
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.640]   the constraints that you have.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:18.800]   Another solution is you can just simply sleep wherever you find yourself.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:24.840]   The vast majority of our ancestors, when it came time to sleep, simply lay down on the
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.640]   ground and slept.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.160]   That was what they did.
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.680]   And it wasn't that long ago that they did that.
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.240]   They lay down on the ground and they slept.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:39.920]   If you were a cowboy riding your horse across the range on a cattle drive, when it came
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:44.960]   time for you to go to sleep, you would lay out your bedroll, which was a blanket, basically
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.880]   a sleeping bag.
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.880]   You lay it out on the ground.
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:48.880]   You didn't have a pad.
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.200]   You didn't have a lot of cushion, etc.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:55.120]   And you lay down and you slept, which yes, means that you're hot when it's hot, you're
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:58.020]   cold when it's cold, you get rained on when it rains.
[00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:03.080]   It's uncomfortable generally, but that was what the majority of people have done throughout
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:07.400]   history and even today, what many people in the world do.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:13.240]   It's really tough to be a rich Westerner and say to people, I don't do this to my family.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.880]   I don't tell my wife, we're going to sleep on the floor.
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:19.240]   We spend the money and I buy the hotel room and get the comfortable bed and such because
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.120]   we're soft, we're spoiled.
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.760]   But it's not that way throughout the rest of the world.
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.520]   Just two quick stories.
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:31.200]   Years ago, I was in Asia and I was traveling in a very poor part of Asia, traveling with
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.640]   some very poor people.
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:36.640]   And we traveled from one village to another.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:39.920]   We were staying and stayed for dinner.
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.760]   And at the end of dinner, I look around and I realized that all the noise from all the
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:43.760]   children had disappeared.
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.760]   And I look over in the corner and there's just a heap of kids just lying on the floor
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.560]   in the corner of the little house that we were in.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:56.400]   And it really, in one way, impressed me because it was normal for those children that they
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.920]   were a bunch of people going from one place to another, but there weren't any fancy accommodations.
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.840]   There wasn't a nice guest room.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:05.640]   And so the children had just basically collapsed after they were done playing and lay down
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.320]   in the corner of the floor.
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:12.160]   I slept on the wood plank floor on a bamboo mat.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:15.640]   And you don't sleep all that well, but you do sleep.
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:18.600]   So those options are there.
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:24.640]   Years ago, when my father was growing up, my grandparents would drive back and forth
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.640]   from Colorado to California.
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.880]   And at night, they would be out in the middle of the desert.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.920]   They didn't have money for a hotel.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.400]   They would pull over on the side of the road.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.480]   My grandmother would sleep in the car.
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:39.400]   And my grandfather and my dad, they would go out in the bushes and sleep on the ground.
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:40.400]   That was the normal.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.440]   They'd pull off the highway a ways.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.280]   That was how things happened.
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:47.360]   And even today, if you travel around, you'll see people doing this.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:52.120]   I go to rest stops, and you see people just sleeping in their car at the rest stop without
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.160]   any particular accommodation.
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:58.200]   Now I don't like to travel that way.
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.200]   That's not...
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:03.400]   I like to be a little bit more comfortable because I'm kind of soft and weak.
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.440]   But the point is you can do it.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:09.480]   So you could just travel and sleep wherever you find yourself.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:13.640]   Now with that as the baseline, now you can move up some levels of luxury as your budget
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.120]   allows.
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.080]   First obvious example would be a tent.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:21.480]   Throughout history, many people have lived their entire lives in a tent.
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:24.240]   Many people today continue to live in tents.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:26.360]   And you can do this the old-fashioned way.
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:29.840]   Build yourself a teepee and live out in the woods.
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:33.360]   When I was traveling around the U.S., I spent a bunch of time talking to a guy who did that.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.240]   He still lived in a teepee in the woods and had for decades.
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:41.200]   Or you can purchase a more modern tent, carry it in your car, strap it on the back of your
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:45.400]   motorcycle, carry it in the back of your bike, and use that.
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:50.280]   The ability to set up a tent, roll out a modern sleeping bag, modern sleeping roll, pad, you
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:55.160]   can be very comfortable and yet not have to pay every night for accommodation.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:59.160]   And in most of the world, you can find a place to put up a tent.
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:03.560]   Even if you're in the city, in most cities of the world, if you are a traveler and if
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:09.320]   you're traveling in some way that's obvious that you are a traveler such as walking, carrying
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:15.480]   a backpack, riding a bicycle, if you go into a residential neighborhood that has backyards
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:19.080]   and you knock on a door and you explain, "Hi, I'm traveling.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.360]   I'd like to just have a safe place to put up my tent for the night.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.280]   Could I stay in your backyard?"
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.720]   Probably 80% of the time, you'll get a yes answer.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:30.160]   You'll probably be invited for dinner, beers afterwards, you'll meet a local person, you'll
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.380]   probably make a friend, they'll show you everywhere around the world.
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:33.720]   You can do it in a tent.
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:36.520]   You don't have to spend a lot of money on hotels.
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.240]   You can, of course, live in a vehicle.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.120]   If you're traveling in a vehicle, I've done several shows on living in your car and loving
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.120]   it.
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:46.300]   It's a great option, can be extremely comfortable, is well worth considering.
[00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:48.360]   Very great example would be couch surfing.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:54.820]   The website and other associated websites that you can use to stay with people who want
[00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:56.800]   to open up their couch to you.
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:01.000]   You can do this through one of the websites all around the world, that Canrush couple.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   One of the things they did is on their over two years of traveling, they said they paid
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.180]   for lodging only 11 times.
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:12.000]   The rest of the time, they were couch surfing, using the website, staying with hosts all
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.040]   around the world.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.000]   Couch surfing is a tremendous option.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.800]   Again, for one or two people, can work out really well.
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:22.340]   If you are five or six people, it's going to be a little bit more challenging, but couch
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:24.760]   surfing can be a great solution.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:28.120]   You can consider some kind of work stay arrangement.
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.120]   There are variations on this.
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.640]   In the United States and Canada, there's work camping.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:36.720]   If you have an RV where you go and you're given a place to park your RV in exchange
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.280]   for some work.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:43.960]   There is the woofing community, worldwide opportunities on organic farms, to volunteer
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:45.280]   on organic farms.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:49.240]   You can go and be a woofer and you stay with a farmer and you, in exchange for room and
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:52.900]   board, you volunteer some hours of your day as labor.
[00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:59.020]   If you are open to volunteerism, you can do volunteerism and go and stay with many places.
[00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:04.600]   If you will work, generally a part-time opportunity, you'll go and work with them.
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:10.700]   Then you can have room and board provided for you because of your volunteer activities.
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:15.580]   Volunteerism is a tremendous way for you to travel the world because it provides some
[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:18.600]   of the needs of the traveling that many people don't think about.
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.780]   First of all, working is good for you.
[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:22.960]   It gives you an opportunity to do something useful.
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:23.960]   You feel productive.
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:28.360]   You feel like you're having an impact on something probably that's important to you.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:33.400]   But working in some of these arrangements is usually done on a very reasonable schedule,
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:37.720]   half a day, three quarters of a day, leaving time free for other things.
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:42.440]   I always enjoy doing fun touristy things more if I've done a good day's work before.
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:45.720]   If you work in the morning and then go to the jump and swim in the waterfall in the
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:49.920]   afternoon, I enjoy that usually a little bit more because it feels like a reward for work
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:53.400]   done than if you just spend the whole day swimming in the waterfall.
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:56.680]   Your mileage may vary, but that's a little bit of my opinion.
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:38:02.080]   Also, when you're volunteering, you're usually going to have a built-in community.
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:07.480]   One of the biggest challenges of hotels in places where there isn't a hostile culture,
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.360]   etc., is in hotels, everybody does their own thing.
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.520]   It's hard to make friends.
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.320]   It's hard to find people to do things with.
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.460]   But volunteering usually provides that.
[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.440]   You have friends, people that you meet.
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.440]   You have people in the community that you're interacting with.
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:26.640]   It opens up relationships and can result in a much more meaningful travel opportunity
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:31.960]   than just simply going through and staying at the hotel and buying the package sightseeing
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:32.960]   deal.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.540]   I would be remiss if I didn't point out hostels here.
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.200]   That's my favorite thing about hostels.
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:42.200]   Hostels do certainly allow you to save money, sleep less expensively, $10 to $30 a night
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:46.300]   depending on the city versus much more for hotels generally.
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:48.400]   My favorite thing about hostels is the community.
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:51.160]   In a hostel, generally there's a place for people to hang out.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:52.160]   There's hammocks.
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:54.000]   There's a yard where people are hanging out.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.200]   It's very easy to meet people and a little easier than meeting people in a hotel.
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:05.640]   There are cooking facilities also which allows us to defray costs on food which is our next
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:06.880]   category.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.520]   Consider your lodging strategy.
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:14.640]   You can go from free to very inexpensive to as expensive as you want.
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:18.600]   Probably your best solution would be to put together some of these things as strategies
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:19.920]   and have options.
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:23.280]   If you travel with a small tent, then you know, "Hey, if I can't find any place to
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.960]   stay, at least I have a tent."
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.200]   That can be useful.
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:31.400]   If you are additionally couch surfing or volunteering but you have the tent as a backup plan and
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:35.720]   you also have money to go to a hostel if you need to, that's a really good strategy to
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:41.360]   have a diversity of options so that as you go into different places, you can try different
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:43.160]   things.
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.120]   Let's move to food.
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:52.080]   Food will for many people be after transportation and lodging will be the next biggest category
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:54.360]   of expenses.
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:40:00.120]   Here think about what resources you have and what kind of food experiences you want to
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:01.440]   have.
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:08.120]   There are many people for whom gastronomy is the most important thing of a trip.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:13.240]   They plan their trip around their eating experiences.
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:17.980]   Some people food is less important and there are other aspects of travel that are more
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:19.920]   important.
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:28.720]   Food can be and generally is very inexpensive if you, number one, eat like a local and number
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:34.500]   two, you do the cooking from scratch, from basic ingredients.
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:37.840]   If you change any of those things, then food starts to be more expensive.
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:43.680]   If you eat imported foods and you don't eat like a local, then you're generally going
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:48.480]   to start paying more money and then number two, if you are paying someone else to cook
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:53.880]   for you or if you are cooking not from just the basic ingredients that you can find in
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:58.360]   the local market, food can generally be fairly expensive.
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:03.280]   So you would have to decide what is important to you.
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:07.120]   Back to the inspirational story from the Canrush couple.
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:16.520]   For two years, they spent a total of $1,736 on groceries and they spent a total of $844
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:21.900]   on restaurants for a couple of two and they ate while they traveled the world.
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:26.560]   So you can spend only a few thousand dollars but you're going to need to be prepared to
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.320]   do quite a bit of cooking.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:34.720]   What most people will choose to do is to generally cook for themselves, generally eat local foods
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:39.920]   and then plan their restaurant experiences for a time when they get maximum value for
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:40.920]   the money.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.680]   I won't belabor the food thing.
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:45.800]   I will point out you also need some cooking equipment.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:50.120]   One of the best things about hostels, if you stay in hostels, is you generally have the
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:56.580]   opportunity to use the cooking facilities, the sink, the stove, etc. and there's usually
[00:41:56.580 --> 00:42:00.020]   pots and pans, things like that.
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:02.080]   You may also just simply carry your own equipment.
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:06.800]   If you are traveling in your car, you'll probably have room for more elaborate equipment.
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.920]   Might bring your own stove, might bring your own appliances.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:13.000]   If you're traveling with a backpack, you might just simply need to travel with a small amount
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.200]   of equipment.
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:18.640]   Most backpackers who are doing extended travel but just going with what they carry, they'll
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:24.080]   have a small cooking kit, small pot, maybe a cup, usually something like an immersion
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:29.000]   heater, maybe a small stove that they carry with them to allow them to cook even if there's
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.200]   not cooking facilities available in their hostel.
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:36.240]   Back in episode 518, I did a show called Tools, Tips, and Techniques for Cooking on the Road
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:38.000]   so you can actually afford to travel.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.960]   That one would be useful mainly focused on car travel, US-American travel where you have
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.320]   a hotel room, things like that.
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:47.320]   I suggested some solutions like traveling with electric pressure cookers such as an
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:49.240]   instant pot or rice cooker.
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:53.360]   You can do most of the things you need with those two tools.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.400]   Lots of things that you can do there.
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:58.800]   So food is something that you will have to decide on.
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:04.680]   The good thing is in Western countries, food at restaurants is going to be more expensive.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:08.760]   When I'm in Western countries, I would tend to do more cooking than eating out because
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:10.660]   of the major price differential.
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:15.680]   You go to more third world countries, developing countries, generally food in restaurants is
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:17.320]   far less expensive.
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:21.360]   And so personally, I choose to eat out more and enjoy the eating out experience in many
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:23.040]   of those contexts.
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:25.160]   Then we come to entertainment.
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:29.640]   Now in many ways, we need different words to describe different things.
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:37.120]   In thinking about this, I think a word like travel is different from a word like tourism.
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:42.160]   Just simply that you can travel without doing any tourist things and tourism doesn't necessarily
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.440]   always involve traveling.
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:49.280]   So the best thing to do here is to get a concept of what you like, what entertains you, what
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:51.360]   you enjoy.
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:55.960]   If you're the kind of person who enjoys the act of traveling, act of moving from one place
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:44:00.000]   to another, interacting with locals, being a part of the local culture, you could do
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   that on a fairly tight budget.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.560]   If you're the kind of person who really values the tourist focused activities, the rides,
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:13.740]   the attractions, the things that you have to buy tickets for, you're going to wind up
[00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:15.940]   spending more money on that.
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:20.160]   Now not necessarily will that be cost prohibitive.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:24.200]   Many tourist activities are expensive and they're especially expensive if you're on
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:25.200]   a tight schedule.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:29.520]   Then you have to pay a lot to fit them in, but they don't necessarily have to be, especially
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:30.520]   if you spread them out.
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:33.120]   This comes back to the amount of time that you have.
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:38.400]   If you're on a 10 day trip to see every site, you're not going to have time to cook.
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:43.240]   You're not going to have, so you're going to be eating out two, three meals a day.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:45.280]   Then you're also going to have to fit in a lot of things.
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:48.760]   You might be paying for a museum entrance in the morning, paying for an attraction in
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:52.280]   the afternoon, hiring a tour guide, hiring transportation, et cetera, to get you from
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:54.200]   one place to another.
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:58.920]   A short term trip, the way that most of us do in the vacation model, usually costs quite
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.080]   a bit of money.
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:04.700]   If you're in the more longer term travel model, you can cut down those expenses because you
[00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:05.700]   limit them.
[00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:10.160]   One day your entertainment is walk around the town and you spend your entertainment
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:13.000]   money on a really great restaurant meal.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   The next day you cook for yourself, but you spend your entertainment money on a tourist
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.720]   activity or a ticket entrance fee, something like that.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.720]   Think about that.
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:28.680]   I would encourage you, consider what you actually care about, what you actually want to do.
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:35.720]   Simple example, many people throughout the world save for years and plan to go to an
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:38.160]   attraction like Disney World.
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.160]   I understand it.
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:41.880]   I understand the attraction a little bit.
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:44.120]   I'm not attracted to it.
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:45.520]   I don't like Disney.
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:48.240]   I don't want to go to Disney.
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:53.040]   By being clear on that, when I get opportunities and invitations to go to Disney, unless I'm
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:57.420]   going with somebody who's got the family hookup and gets me in and says, "Let's go and eat
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:01.440]   around the world at Epcot," there's just not any point to going.
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.560]   I don't want to go.
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:05.880]   Choose for yourself.
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:08.600]   Don't think that just because everyone else in the world wants to go to Disney that you
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:09.600]   have to go.
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:13.760]   I have other things that I like that other people don't like.
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:19.040]   Consider what's important to you and then think about how that will fit in.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:23.200]   Other aspects of traveling are probably fairly minor.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.680]   You will need, for example, a travel document.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:29.280]   You'll probably need visas if you're going to go to interesting places.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:32.000]   Depending on the strength of your passport in terms of the number of visa-free countries
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.380]   you can go to, depending on the places that you care to go, you may be spending some significant
[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:38.920]   amount of money in visas.
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:45.080]   Let me go run down, as I close the show, let me run down the costs that this particular
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:46.080]   couple, Canrush, spent.
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:47.760]   Again, I'll just link to their video.
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:48.760]   I won't strip the audio and play it.
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.240]   I'll just link to their video.
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.920]   You can watch it if you would like.
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:56.080]   They spent $3,221 on cars.
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:59.080]   They had some bad experiences on this.
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:02.640]   In traveling the United States, they planned to buy a car.
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:06.040]   That really is one of the best ways to travel around the United States.
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:09.360]   I've met lots of people, Australians and Europeans in the United States.
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:13.200]   They fly in, buy a car, use it for a few months traveling around the United States, and then
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.280]   sell it and then go on their way.
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.800]   It's a really, really great way to do it.
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:23.320]   Met a great Australian couple when I was out in Arizona who was doing that.
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:26.840]   They flew into Canada because it was easier for them to buy a car in Canada, bought an
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:31.640]   older Chevy Astro van, converted it in a day or two to be a camping van that they were
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:35.180]   sleeping in, and then used that and traveled around the United States for several months
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:37.560]   with a plan of selling the van at the end of the trip.
[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:42.360]   We're having a really great experience with their DIY camper van.
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:45.920]   In this case, the couple spent $3,221 on cars.
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:50.320]   They had some bad experiences where they bought a car, broke down, fixed it, and got rid of
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:51.320]   it.
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:52.640]   Then they bought another car, broke down, fixed it.
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:57.000]   Finally, they gave up and just started renting cars instead.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.880]   That was their biggest category expense.
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:04.160]   Then flights, $2,300 for two years of flights, mainly intercontinental flights.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:09.120]   They chose when they would cross continents by choosing when the flights were less expensive
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:11.920]   and the specific flights that were less expensive.
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:15.960]   $1,700 on groceries, already talked about.
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:18.200]   $1,300 on gas for the cars.
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:23.360]   Then they spent about $1,200 on visas, visa fees for them.
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:26.560]   In their case, they were traveling on a Canadian and a Russian passport, so they had to get
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:29.400]   some various visa fees to get into the different countries.
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:30.760]   Those fees do add up.
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:33.360]   Some are simple, the visa on arrival.
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:35.080]   Some you have to pay in advance.
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:40.200]   Some fees, generally most countries will charge you some amount of money to come in.
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.920]   Then sometimes it's very large.
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:46.640]   Just research that based upon the countries that you look at.
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:50.320]   $845 on restaurants over the course of two years.
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:56.280]   Transportation, buses, local transportation, et cetera, not including flights, was $784.
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:49:01.920]   Category of other for $407, $361 of gifts, $266 of cell service.
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:04.400]   Even some miscellaneous stuff, $250 on electronics.
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:09.400]   They spent $154 on entertainment, some money on clothing, et cetera, smaller numbers for
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:17.120]   total expenses of $13,431 to travel the world for 752 days.
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:19.280]   Now if they can do it, you can do it.
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.880]   If I can do it, you can do it.
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:26.200]   Don't take any idea that you don't like of what I've said and think that you have to
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:27.200]   do it.
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:29.960]   Think for yourself about what's important to you.
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:31.760]   Don't try to live somebody else's trip.
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:34.040]   Don't try to take somebody else's trip.
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:40.320]   But if you want to travel, don't let money, don't let these things stand in your way.
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:45.680]   You do have opportunities to make a lot of, to go.
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:46.680]   Don't let money stand in your way.
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:47.680]   It really doesn't need to.
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:52.560]   It's only a lack of imagination and a lack of skill that would ever lead someone to have
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:57.400]   money being the number one reason why I can't travel.
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:01.540]   You might choose to say, "I'm choosing not to travel right now because I'm saving money
[00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:05.280]   or I'm waiting for this specific type of travel that I want to do.
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:07.520]   I really want to travel in my own four-wheel drive vehicle.
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:08.520]   I really want to do that."
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:09.520]   Okay.
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:14.640]   But don't let money in and of itself be an excuse as to why you say, "I can't travel."
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:16.980]   You can travel if you want to.
[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:20.960]   You just have to figure out how to adjust the details to your budget.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:22.400]   That's it for how to travel on the cheap.
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:27.600]   I guess the best thing for me to plug for you today would be my course, which is not
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:30.640]   cheap but is very useful.
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:35.080]   The course is called How to Survive and Thrive During the Coming Economic Crisis.
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:39.520]   One component of it is travel.
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:43.320]   Originally when I was thinking about writing that course, I had a working title called
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:47.040]   something like basically bugging out of the economic crisis.
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:51.000]   The idea being if things are bad where you live, if you're in an economic crisis, one
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.320]   of the best things to do is just leave and go somewhere where things aren't bad.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:58.000]   It's a very simple concept but it's under discussed in my opinion.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:02.160]   If things are bad where you live, just leave and go where things aren't bad until things
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:04.680]   get better and then if you want to come back, come back.
[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:08.280]   But in order to do that, you've got to have some comfort and familiarity with travel.
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:15.000]   Most people have so little comfort and so little familiarity with travel that they can't
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.800]   conceive of it.
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:21.120]   It's best to practice.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:28.240]   Having practiced, I know that my family and I, if things went bad, we would pack up eight
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:29.840]   or ten suitcases.
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:32.840]   We would get flights to the other side of the world where things are better.
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:33.840]   I'd go on Airbnb.
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:38.480]   I'd rent a house and get us settled for a few months until I found something that we
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:42.600]   wanted to be for longer and we would be very happy living somewhere else while things are
[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:45.560]   bad at home until we wanted to go back home.
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:46.560]   But it takes practice.
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:50.160]   It takes some and the best way to practice is just through vacation trips, just through
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.640]   some travel trips.
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:56.360]   So in that show or in that course, in addition to all the ways of how to survive and thrive
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:52:00.200]   in an economic crisis by staying put and how making sure you simply avoid the crisis in
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:04.840]   the first place, I have an extensive discussion on traveling including a lot of international
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:06.760]   travel, a lot of tips and techniques.
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:07.760]   It's a great course.
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:08.760]   I'm really proud of it.
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:11.080]   Probably more proud of it than anything I've produced thus far.
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:13.680]   I've got more up my sleeve but I'm really proud of that one.
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:18.080]   So go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/store and try out the How to Survive and Thrive
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:20.160]   During the Coming Economic Crisis course.
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:21.160]   I think you'll really like it.
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:22.160]   Thanks for listening.
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.160]   Bye.
