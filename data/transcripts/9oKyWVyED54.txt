[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.320]   Most of you, I am sure, will remember that we are now engaged in trying to sum up our
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:17.760]   conclusions concerning the exact meaning and reference of this famous portion of Scripture
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:25.400]   which is found in Paul's epistle to the Romans in chapter 7 and verse 13 or 14 to
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:34.880]   the end of the chapter. Now we began our summing up of this last Friday evening. The first
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.200]   thing we did was this. Having gone through it in detail, verse by verse, we then summed
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:48.440]   up the essential statement which is made by the apostle. And then, in attempting to decide
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:57.400]   whether this is a reference to the unregenerate man or to a regenerate man, even Paul himself
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.880]   and his condition when he wrote the letter, or whether it is some immature Christian,
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.360]   we saw that the best plan to adopt was that we'd better see if we could find other passages
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.760]   in the Scripture which would throw any light on this. And we found that it has often been
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:22.120]   suggested that there are other parallel passages, and you will recall that we looked at them,
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.000]   those which on the surface seem to describe the same conflict, and others which seem to
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.280]   describe the same groaning and state of misery. But we came to the conclusion that none of
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:42.160]   these passages really provides us with a parallel to what we find in this particular section.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:52.920]   Now then, the next step, it seems to me, is this one. If this passage is interpreted as
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:01.880]   describing Paul's maximum experience, Paul the apostle, the great saint of God, at his
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:09.080]   best and highest, even as he was when he wrote this whole epistle, then I think I shall be
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:19.240]   able to show you that it is incompatible with his plain teaching elsewhere in the Bible,
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.920]   indeed with plain teaching elsewhere in the Bible, not only by the apostle Paul, but by
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:33.260]   other writers also, concerning the nature of the regenerate man. Now you see the method.
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:41.480]   We have not found parallels to this, so now we take this next step. Is that interpretation
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.200]   compatible with what is the plain teaching of the Scriptures with regard to the regenerate
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:56.220]   man? And I am suggesting that that interpretation is quite incompatible with such teaching.
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.540]   Let me show you what I mean. First of all, let us look at passages in the
[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:10.360]   writings of St. Paul himself, which I think I can show you make it quite impossible that
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:18.040]   he is here describing his mature Christian experience. Let us go first of all to the
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.920]   apostle's other statements in this epistle. Before we go to any other epistle, let's see
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.960]   what he says elsewhere in this epistle. And here, it seems to me, we've got abundant evidence.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.720]   I would suggest that that interpretation of this passage is, for instance, quite incompatible
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.040]   with what he has already told us in chapter 5, in verses 1 and 2. Listen to it.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.960]   "Therefore," he says, "being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:58.960]   Lord Jesus Christ, by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand."
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:06.480]   And we remember we emphasize the standing, not a slounging or a crouching or a lying
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:13.880]   down. "We stand in this grace and rejoice in hope of the glory of God."
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:20.400]   I cannot imagine that a man who could write that could at the same time cry out saying,
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:27.880]   "O wretched men that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" And furthermore,
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.840]   it seems to me to be quite incompatible with the whole point and purpose of that great
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:41.120]   section in chapter 5 from verse 12 to the end at verse 21. Because there, as we saw,
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:49.160]   his major purpose is just to let us know about the triumph of the reign of grace. That though
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.920]   sin has abounded, grace has much more abounded. It's the victory, the triumph, the certainty,
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.920]   the assurance of it all. That is the apostle's central message, his main reason for writing
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.800]   the passage at all. This "much more" then. You remember how we kept on finding that he
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:14.600]   repeated that. "Much more of grace." This abounding, this superabounding. I cannot see
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:23.680]   that there is any compatibility between emphasizing the superabounding power and capacity of grace
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.360]   and crying out, "O wretched men that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.640]   death?" I can't fit the two things together in the same person. And then when you come
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:42.040]   to chapter 6, as we saw so abundantly, everything practically that he says is incompatible with
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:48.000]   this interpretation. Take verse 2. He replies to the question, "Shall we continue in sin
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.920]   that grace may abound?" by saying, "God forbid! How shall we that are dead, how shall we that
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.120]   die to sin, live any longer therein?" But here's the man who seems to be living in it,
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:05.520]   who has to tell us that his general experience is this, that he's brought into captivity
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:12.000]   to the law of sin which is in his members. But there he says, "This is impossible, God
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.600]   forbid. We have died to sin, we die to it, so how shall we continue any longer therein?"
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.720]   He says the same in verse 6, "Knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:30.480]   the body of sin might be destroyed, disannulled, brought to nothing, that henceforth we should
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.360]   not serve sin." That's the whole object of it all, and that's the thing in which he is
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:42.920]   rejoicing. In verse 7 he says it again, "For he that is dead is freed from sin." Then the
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:50.040]   great exhortation in verse 11, "Likewise reckon ye yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin,
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:56.960]   but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord." I don't know how you interpret that
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:04.360]   or expand it, if this in chapter 7 is a description of the regenerate man at his very best. And
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:10.240]   likewise the exhortations in verses 12 and 13 seem to me to be quite meaningless. Listen,
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:16.240]   "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, not even in your mortal body, don't
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.360]   let it reign there. There's no need for you to let it reign there, that ye should obey
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:28.000]   it in the lust thereof. Stop doing it, don't allow it. Neither yield ye your members as
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.520]   instruments of unrighteousness unto sin." There's no need for you to, you can stop doing
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:37.480]   so, stop doing so. But here's a man who tells us that he can't help it. He's brought into
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:42.920]   captivity constantly by this power greater than himself. The Apostle's exhortation in
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:50.480]   6 verse 13 is on the opposite assumption entirely. "Neither yield ye your members as instruments
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:55.560]   of unrighteousness unto sin, but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:03.240]   dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God." And then the greater separation
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:09.920]   of verse 14, "For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under the law, but
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:17.280]   under grace." The whole thing is the very antithesis of this interpretation of this
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:23.440]   portion of the seventh chapter. But even we haven't finished yet in chapter 6. Take verse
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:32.360]   17, "But God be thanked, you were the slaves of sin, but you have obeyed from the heart
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:39.200]   that form of doctrine which was delivered you." Then in verse 18, "Being then made free
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:48.600]   from sin, you became the servants of righteousness." Take verse 22, "But now being made free from
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:56.280]   sin and become servants to God, you have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:03.240]   life." I cannot see that that kind of thing is at all compatible with this other statement.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:09.520]   I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:18.040]   to the law of sin which is in my members. "I do that I would not, the good that I would
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:22.400]   I do not, but the evil that I would not, that I do." He can't do what he wants to do, he
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:30.560]   does what he doesn't want to do, "O wretched men that I am." It is really an astonishing
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:37.200]   thing to me that anybody who's worked carefully through chapter 6 could conceivably say that
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:44.200]   this is interpreted as the highest experience of the regenerate men. And the appeal in that
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:49.040]   19th verse in the 6th chapter would likewise be quite pointless. "I speak after the manner
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:55.640]   of men because of the infirmity of your flesh. For as you have yielded your members servants
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:01.960]   to uncleanness and to iniquity and to iniquity, even so now yield your members servants unto
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:09.720]   righteousness and to holiness." You can do it, do it. Very well. There's chapter 6.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:18.640]   Chapter 7, the very chapter in which this section comes, I am arguing that verses 4
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:27.280]   and 6 are completely incompatible with that particular view of this section, verse 14
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:34.040]   to the end. Listen to verse 4. "Wherefore, my brethren, you also died to the law by the
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:39.280]   body of Christ, that you should be married to another, even to him who is raised from
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:46.480]   the dead, that you should bring forth fruit unto God." And verse 6, "But now we are
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:52.000]   delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held, that in order that we should
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:02.040]   serve in newness of spirit, not in the oldness of the latter." Now there I say are verses,
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:07.240]   they are the great assertions of this seventh chapter, and they make it quite impossible
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:13.640]   to interpret these later verses in the manner that I am indicating. But then go on to chapter
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:21.200]   8. Listen to him in verse 4. "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:28.040]   Jesus. For the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:32.600]   of sin and death, the law that led to sin and death." And that's what he's been telling
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:37.160]   us about the law in this section, that it leads him constantly to sin and to death,
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.160]   but he says he's been set free from death. "For what the law could not do in that it
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:46.800]   was weak through the flesh, God sending his Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:51.960]   sin has done it." How? "Condemn sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of the law might
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:56.960]   be fulfilled in us." Not that we might fail, but that it might be fulfilled in us. "Who
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:05.160]   walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." Surely, again, you can't reconcile that, for
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:11.800]   there he is describing the regenerate men. You can't reconcile that with that other interpretation
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:19.400]   of section, verses 14 to 25 in chapter 7. But listen again to verse 6 in chapter 8.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:28.400]   "For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life, and not only
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:35.400]   life but peace." The poor man in Romans 7 hasn't got much peace, has he? No, he says,
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:40.520]   "I'm always being led into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. O wretched
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:46.240]   men that I am, who shall deliver me? Is that man enjoying peace?" Well, the apostle says
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:51.080]   that the characteristic, the great characteristic of the man who is spiritually minded, who
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:57.920]   is the regenerate man, is this. That he's got life and peace. Whereas the whole trouble
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:04.240]   with this man was that he couldn't find peace, and cries out in his cry of despair, "O wretched
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:11.920]   men that I am, who shall deliver me?" Well, then you go on to verses like verses 13 and
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:19.640]   others where he makes an appeal. He says, "If you live after the flesh, you shall die.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:27.000]   But if you through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live." He means
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.400]   this, that you can do it, and therefore he says, "Do it." But the whole trouble with
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.240]   the man in Romans 7 is that he can't do it. He's been trying and he's failed completely.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:40.400]   Look here, says Paul, "If you through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, it
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:47.400]   can be done. You've got the spirit, you will need to do it. Well, you shall live."
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:51.360]   The man in Romans 7, in spite of all efforts and endeavors, is still being led into captivity.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:56.200]   Here is a man who has found a way of freedom and of liberty. And then you go on, of course,
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:02.000]   to the great verses 14 and onward. "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:09.360]   are the sons of God." Listen. "For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:16.040]   fear." Bondage? Who's in bondage? Oh, the man who's in captivity is in bondage. Who's
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.160]   the man who's afraid? He's the man who says, "What's going to happen to me? What can I
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:23.520]   do? I try, I want to, but I can't." And cries out, "Oh, wretched man that I am, who shall
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:29.600]   deliver me?" "You have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear. You have received
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:36.080]   the spirit of abduction, whereby we cry, 'Abba, Father.' The Spirit itself beareth witness
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:41.320]   with our spirit that we are children of God. And if children, then heirs, heirs of God
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:46.080]   and joint heirs with Christ. If so be that we suffer with him, that we shall be also
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:51.080]   glorified together. And having said that, I'm to go on to say, 'Oh, wretched man that
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:56.360]   I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?'" My friends, these things are
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:01.920]   utter incompatibilities. They're not breathing the same atmosphere. They don't belong together
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:08.440]   at all. No, no, this man, the regenerate man, the apostle when he was writing was not hopeless,
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:14.240]   not wretched. He knows what's coming. He knows his position. And then you go on to verses
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:22.800]   29 and 30. "For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:28.000]   of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.760]   predestinate, them he also called, and whom he called them he also justified. Now watch
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:39.520]   the leap, and whom he justified them he also glorified." A man who understands justification
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:45.840]   knows that in a sense he's already glorified. Can such a man cry out saying, "Oh, wretched
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:51.100]   man that I am, who shall deliver me?" It's inconceivable. It's impossible. We know that
[00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:55.600]   all things work together for good to them that love God. If I know that I'm foreknown
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:01.600]   and predestinated, I know that I am predestinated to be conformed to the image of his Son. And
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:09.200]   I do not cry out in despair, "Who shall deliver me?" Because I know. I know the answer.
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:14.600]   You see, the whole of this great chapter is quite impossible, and especially that leap
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:21.200]   from justification to glorification. And then if you go on to chapter 12, you'll find statements
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:26.040]   that again I cannot reconcile with that interpretation. "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:31.960]   mercies of God, that you present your bodies even a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:37.920]   unto God, which is your reasonable service. Be not conformed to this world, but be transformed
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:44.400]   by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:51.920]   perfect will of God." And then listen to him in chapter 14 and verse 17. This is almost
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:57.000]   enough in itself. If we had nothing else, he says, "The kingdom of God into which you
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.400]   come is not a matter of meat and drink, or of observing days and eating this and not
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:07.480]   eating that, and all these punctilious, as it were. The kingdom of God is not meat and
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:15.760]   drink." Well, what is it? It is righteousness, and again, peace, but above all, it is joy
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:22.520]   in the Holy Ghost. That's Christianity. That's how the Christian is to be. Righteousness
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:29.440]   and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. Can a man have the joy of the Holy Ghost and at
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:34.280]   the same time say, "O wretched men that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:39.120]   this death, for I am constantly being brought into captivity by the law of sin which is
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:44.400]   in my members." Surely, the two things cannot possibly go together.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:48.760]   Well, there you see his evidence out of the epistle to the Romans, but let's go on to
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:56.160]   other evidence in the writings of Paul. His other writings. I was quoting last week 1
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:02.560]   Corinthians 9, verse 27. I must just repeat it to make this argument complete. Here he
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:10.480]   is and he says, "I keep under my body." My body is not keeping me under. My body is
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:15.520]   not bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. I keep under
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:20.720]   my body and bring it into subjection, lest that by any means when I have preached to
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:27.360]   others I myself should be cast away. But let me go on to that great chapter which
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:33.280]   we read at the beginning, which I would have thought was the final answer to this particular
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:39.720]   argument. 2 Corinthians chapter 3, which almost seems to have been written specially to deal
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:46.520]   with this very question. Look for a moment at what he said in verse 7. Or indeed you
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:51.920]   can start at verse 6. "Who also hath made us able ministers of the New Testament."
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:57.840]   Now watch his negative. "Not of the letter, but of the Spirit." Why? "For the letter
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.360]   killeth." That was the trouble with the men in Romans 7. He was being killed by this
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:05.160]   law. That's the thing he set out to say at the very beginning. "What was ordained
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:11.000]   unto life I found to be unto death. The letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life." But
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:18.120]   this is the phrase in the beginning of verse 7. "But if the ministration of death."
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:22.800]   You know what he's talking about? He's talking about the law of God. As he says,
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:28.620]   it was written and engraven in stones. But here he is actually calling God's holy law
[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:35.120]   that he gave to Moses the ministration of death. Why? Well, because that is what it
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:40.620]   always does, as he tells us in Romans 7 in this very section. "That which was ordained
[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:45.640]   unto life I found to be unto death." It is a ministration unto death. And the trouble
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.880]   with that man in Romans 7 is that he's being killed by the law. He's made to sin by
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:55.400]   it, he's killed by it. And here the apostle actually uses this quite astonishing phrase,
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:02.760]   the ministration of death for the law of God. But look at the end of the chapter, verses
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:12.920]   17 and 18. "Thou, the Lord, is that Spirit." And where the Spirit of the Lord is, or if
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:18.640]   you prefer it, you can translate it like this, "Where the Spirit is, Lord," what
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:24.800]   is that? There is liberty. I'm not brought into captivity to the law of sin which is
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:31.720]   in my members. I'm no longer in that flesh, the Spirit is in me. The Lord is that Spirit.
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:39.960]   And where the Spirit is Lord, or where the Lord is that Spirit, there is liberty. But
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:44.920]   he's not content with saying that, he adds to it in this great and glorious 18th verse,
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:53.000]   "But we all, ye are the regenerate, with open face," the veil is gone, "with open
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.440]   face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord." Now, "ye are the regenerate
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.840]   men," not crying out, "Who shall deliver me?" No, no, "with open face beholding
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:11.200]   as in a glass the glory of the Lord." What happens? We are changed into the same image,
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:16.840]   his image, from glory to glory. We are progressing and developing. We do it at the end of our
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:21.000]   life, say, when we've reached the topmost rung of the ladder of sainthood, "Oh, wretched
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.840]   men that I am!" Not a bit of it. We are changed from glory to glory. It's increasing,
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:34.840]   developing, advancing, going up, "even as by the Spirit of the Lord." You cannot
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:42.360]   equate that with what is said in Romans 7. I do not hesitate to assert that they are
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:51.760]   exact opposites, exact opposites. Very well, go on to Galatians chapter 2, verse
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:59.160]   4, "I have been crucified with Christ." This isn't a second experience. This is
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:05.200]   what happens to every man who is regenerate. "I was crucified with Christ." It's
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:11.160]   Romans 6 again. "Nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me." That's
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:15.000]   how the regenerate man speaks. He doesn't say, "Oh, wretched men that I am, who
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.600]   shall deliver me?" He says, "Christ liveth in me, and the life which I now live in the
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:26.440]   flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me."
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:32.600]   Of course. Then go on to chapter 4. "Now I say that the
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:37.560]   heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be Lord
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:42.440]   of all." There's your man under the law. He is actually a child, but because he's
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:47.320]   actually an heir, he's actually a son, but because he's a child, he differeth nothing
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:51.960]   from a servant, though he be Lord of all. Indeed, he may be tyrannized over by the servants,
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:56.040]   and he may be having a very miserable time, though he is the heir. But he's under tutors
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:01.800]   and governors until the time appointed of the father. Even so, we, when we were children,
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:05.640]   were in bondage under the elements of the world. But when the fullness of the time was
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:10.960]   come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that are
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:18.240]   under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. And because we are sons, we cry out,
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:22.920]   saying, "O wretched men that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:29.120]   No, no. Because we are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts,
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:36.520]   crying, "Abba, Father!" Wherefore, thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:44.960]   a son, then an heir of God through Christ. You can't reconcile that with Romans 7. And
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:50.960]   again, look at chapter 5, the verses we were expanding last week. Verse 16, really right
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:56.480]   to the end of the chapter, "Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:04.040]   flesh. But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law. They that are Christ's
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:10.640]   have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts." There it is in Galatians. Let's
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:19.560]   go on to Ephesians, chapter 1, verse 19. The apostle tells these people that he is praying
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:23.600]   for them. What's he praying? That the eyes of their understanding may be enlightened.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:27.600]   What does he want them to know? Well, three things. I'm only mentioning the third. He
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:35.840]   wants them to know the exceeding greatness of his power to us who believe. He knew it
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:41.440]   himself. He prays that they may know it. Here is Paul the apostle. He knows the exceeding
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:47.480]   greatness of God's power to us who believe. He knows it. What power is it? Well, it's
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:53.560]   the same power, he says, that he exercised which he wrought in Christ when he raised
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:58.200]   him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places far above all
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:02.920]   principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:07.640]   world but in the world which is to come, and hath put all things under his feet and gave
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:12.240]   him to be the head over all things unto the church, which is his body, the fullness of
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:17.320]   him that filleth all in all. Is it conceivable that a man who knows something about the exceeding
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:22.680]   greatness of this power toward himself can cry out saying, "O wretched men that I am,
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:27.240]   who shall deliver me from the bondage of this, the body of this death, this thing that's
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:32.000]   bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members?" My dear friends,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.240]   you're in a different world altogether. You've gone from the North Pole to the equator. The
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:43.120]   whole thing is entirely different. Not only that, I say, look at the end of chapter 3.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:48.680]   Listen to this. These are words addressed to the regenerate. He prays for them again.
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:53.360]   What does he pray? That he would grant you according to the riches of his glory, to be
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:58.040]   strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man. Why? That Christ may dwell in your
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:02.760]   hearts by faith, that you being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:07.440]   with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height, and to know the love
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:13.280]   of Christ which passeth knowledge, that you might be filled with all the fullness of God,
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:18.920]   and then to rub it right in. Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:25.960]   all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us, unto him be glory
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:31.280]   in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages. Does the man who say that go on to say
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:36.040]   also, "Ah yes, but it's equally true of me to say, 'O wretched man that I am, who shall
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:43.480]   deliver me from the body of this death?'" Surely it makes the thing entirely meaningless.
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:49.240]   And all the rest of the epistle to the Ephesians from chapter 4, verse 17 onward, it seems
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:57.160]   to me becomes quite meaningless on that interpretation. But then go on to Philippians 4, 4. What sort
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:05.080]   of Christians, what sort of people are Christians to be? Well, this is how he puts it. "Rejoice
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:16.320]   in the Lord always." And again I say, "Rejoice! Rejoice in the Lord always!" Can you do that?
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:20.480]   If you are conscious of being brought constantly into captivity to the law of sin that is in
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:25.040]   your members, and you're crying out, "O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me?" Rejoice
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:32.640]   in the Lord always! No, no, these things don't belong together. And then of course you've
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:37.120]   got in the first epistle to the Thessalonians, probably the first epistle the apostle ever
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:44.000]   wrote, first epistle, first chapter, verse 5, listen to it. "Our gospel came not unto
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:52.040]   you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance, as
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:56.360]   ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake. And you became followers of
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:02.480]   us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost,
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:08.840]   so that you were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia." And then listen
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:16.620]   to him in the fourth chapter, verse 3, "This is the will of God, even your sanctification."
[00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:22.760]   And then listen to him in chapter 5, there right at the end in verse 23, "And the very
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:29.120]   God of peace sanctify you wholly, and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:36.120]   preserved blameless until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ." That's the apostle's
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:42.240]   teaching. Let me end my summary of his teaching with this. Listen to his references to himself.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:49.880]   How does he normally speak of himself? This is his favorite phrase, "Paul, the bond
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:56.800]   slave of Jesus Christ." That's how he describes himself. You find it at the beginning of his
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:02.440]   letters. Is it possible that a man who describes himself like that, "the bond slave of Jesus
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:06.600]   Christ," is it possible that he should cry out at the same time saying, "O wretched
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:11.040]   men that I am, who shall deliver me? He's been bought, he belongs to the other, he's
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:19.400]   his bond slave." Listen to him in Philippians, "For me to live is Christ, and to die is
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:25.320]   gain." But listen to some other astonishing things that he says about himself in writing
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:32.960]   to the Philippians in chapter 3, verses 13 and forward. "Brethren, I count not myself
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:38.080]   to have apprehended," he's not perfect, "but this one thing I do, forgetting those
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:43.240]   things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:48.640]   toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Jesus Christ." He's not
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:52.920]   spending his time turning around in a circle and crying out for deliverance. He's pressing
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:58.200]   forward, he's going on. "Let us therefore," he says, "as many as be perfect be thus
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:03.040]   minded, and if in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:08.200]   Nevertheless, whereunto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:17.080]   the same thing. Brethren, be followers together of me." Would a man who says, "O wretched
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:22.040]   men that I am, who shall deliver me," have the effrontery to stand up and say, "Brethren,
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:31.000]   be ye followers of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensemble." It
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.280]   seems to me quite inconceivable. Then listen to what he says about himself in the first
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:44.480]   epistle to the Thessalonians again in chapter 2, and in the tenth verse. "Ye are witnesses,
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:57.000]   and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behave ourselves among you that believe."
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:05.080]   I cannot reconcile that with Romans 7. He's not claiming that he's perfect, but he is
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:09.920]   certainly claiming that he's not in that position described in Romans 7.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:15.720]   And that brings me to my last statement concerning this great man. We are told that this is Paul
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:20.520]   at his best, at his highest, therefore at the very end of his life. But I find that
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:27.000]   at the end of his life he is able to write in a very different strain. He writes like
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:36.760]   this, "I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:43.840]   fought a good fight. I have finished my course. I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:50.120]   laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:58.720]   me at that day, and not only to me, but unto all them also, that love is appearing.
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:06.200]   "Ten a man who says that say still, O wretched men that I am, who shall deliver me from the
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:11.280]   body of this death, it's impossible, because the condition of this man, as described by
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:16.280]   a great writer like Wicius, the authority you know in the Covenants, is a man who writes
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:22.680]   like this, "The immense abundance of the Spirit inhabiting his noble breast, and the
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:30.360]   sparkling flames of the love of God kindle in his heart." Of course they did. "And
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:35.200]   a man of whom that is true is not a man who regards himself as a wretched man, and who
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:41.600]   has to cry out in semi-despair, "Who shall deliver me?" The thing is a sheer impossibility."
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:47.920]   There then is the evidence from the writings of the Apostle Paul. But then I could take
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:52.920]   you through the writings of the Apostle John. I could take you through the first epistle
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:59.120]   of John, and prove to you that the whole argument of that epistle is the exact opposite of what
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:04.320]   is stated here. My time is rushing and going. I can't do this. I must just indicate some
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:10.240]   things to you. Why does John write this first epistle at all? Here's the answer. "These
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:19.240]   things write we unto you, that your joy may be full, that you may have fellowship with
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:24.720]   us," he says, "and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:29.160]   Christ." You know, he says, "We apostles are enjoying this fellowship, and I want you
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:37.120]   all to enjoy it, that your joy may be full." That's incompatible, impossible to reconcile
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:43.160]   with the statements in Romans 7. Then look at the third chapter, what he says in verse
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:48.280]   9, "Whosoever is born of God does not commit sin, does not go on committing sin, for his
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:55.280]   seed remaineth in him, and he cannot thus continue in sin, because he is born of God."
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:34:02.200]   And verse 21, "Beloved, if our heart condemneth not, then have we confidence toward God."
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:06.440]   But the man in Romans 7 is utterly condemned by his heart. But here John says, "If our
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:12.080]   heart condemneth not, then have we confidence toward God." Yes, that's the Christian
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:18.800]   position. And you get the same in chapter 5, verses 4 and 5, "Whosoever is born of
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:24.600]   God overcometh the world, and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:30.200]   faith. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:36.720]   of God?" And then at the end, verses 18, "We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:41.240]   not," doesn't go on living that life of sin and failure, "but he that is begotten
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:48.240]   of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not. And we know that we are
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:55.600]   of God. The whole world lieth in the evil one. We know that the Son of God is come,
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:00.560]   and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:06.760]   that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. And
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:11.560]   then must I add, O wretched men that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:21.520]   death?" Impossible. Peter says the same thing. Second Epistle of Peter, first chapter,
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:27.200]   verses 4 to 10. You remember his whole position is this. "All things," he says, "that
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:33.200]   appertain to life and godliness have been given to us, whereby are given unto us exceeding
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:39.280]   great and precious promises, that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature,
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:43.720]   having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust." Very well, he says,
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:47.600]   this is what you have got to do. "Besides this, giving all diligence, furnish out your
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:53.120]   faith with virtue, and with virtue knowledge, knowledge, temperance, temperance, patience,
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:58.200]   patience, godliness, godliness, brotherly kindness, and of brotherly kindness charity.
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:05.000]   For if these things be in you and abound, they make you that you shall neither be barren
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.960]   nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ." That was the trouble with
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:16.000]   the men in Romans 7. "But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:22.880]   off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. Wherefore, brother, give
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:28.320]   diligence to make your calling and election sure. For if ye do these things, ye shall
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:37.360]   never fall. For so, an entrance shall be ministered into you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:44.040]   of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ." You see it everywhere. These are descriptions
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:48.600]   of the Christian men, the regenerate men. But I finally would quote you our Lord's
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:57.040]   teaching to confirm what I am saying. What does our Lord say? Well, in Matthew 11, 28,
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:06.720]   he says something like this, "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden,
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:14.040]   O wretched men that I am, who shall deliver me? What I would I do, not that I would, not
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:19.360]   that I do. I am always being led into captivity by the law of sin, which is in my members,
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:25.160]   and I am laboring, and I am heavy laden, and I am unhappy. Come unto me," he says, "and
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:32.160]   I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:40.320]   heart, and you shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:48.480]   The exact opposite of Romans 7. Then take Luke 14, our Lord's reading of the
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:54.280]   scriptures you remember in the synagogue at Nazareth, when he'd come back from the temptation.
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:38:00.240]   He read out of Isaiah 61, and this is what he read, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:05.680]   me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. He hath sent me to
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:10.960]   heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:16.360]   the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:21.920]   the Lord." He closed the book and gave it again to the minister and sat down, and he
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:29.880]   began to say, "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears." That's what he's
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:34.720]   come to do. He says, "I'm doing it." That is what he does to all who believe in him.
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:39.040]   He delivers the captives, and those that are bruised give sight to the blind. They're
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:44.040]   no longer wretched. And then, of course, you've got those notable
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:50.760]   statements in John's gospel. Take, for instance, that great statement at the end of the Feast
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:59.720]   of Tabernacles in chapter 7, verses 37 to 39. "In the last day," that great day of
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:08.440]   the Feast, "Jesus stood and cried, saying, 'If any man thirsts, if any man is longing
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:13.920]   and thirsting for righteousness and the power to live this law, if any man is wretched and
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:22.120]   unhappy and feeling he's a captive, if any man thirsts, let him come unto me and drink.
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:27.280]   He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:33.440]   of living water.'" He's not only alright himself, but he's able
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:39.120]   to send out these streams of blessing and of fructification to others. "This speak
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:43.840]   ye of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive. For the Holy Ghost
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:49.000]   was not yet given, because the Jesus was not yet glorified. But when he was glorified,
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.320]   he was given, and that is the position of those who are regenerate."
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:40:00.560]   There it is in John's gospel there, but take the 8th chapter and verse 12. "I am
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:05.880]   the light of the world. He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness. He shall not
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:09.720]   be groping in darkness and saying, 'Where can I find deliverance? Who shall deliver
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:14.680]   me?' He shall not walk in darkness, but I shall have the light of life." But listen
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:22.760]   to this still more wonderful, verses 34, 35, and 36 in that 8th chapter. "Jesus answered
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:31.960]   them, 'Verily, verily, I say unto you, whosoever committeth sin, whosoever goes on living this
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:37.440]   defeated, failing life, being made captive to the sin which is in his members, whosoever
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:42.360]   committeth sin is the servant of sin.'" Exactly, that's what the man in Romans 7 says
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:48.720]   about himself. "And the servant abideth not in the house for ever, but the Son abideth
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:59.640]   ever. If the Son therefore shall make you free, you shall be free indeed." You'll
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:03.680]   never again say, "Oh, wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me?" "If the Son
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:09.640]   shall make you free, you shall be free indeed." He says it again in chapter 10, in verses
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:16.320]   9 and 10. Listen to them. "I am the door. If any man, if by me if any man enter in,
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:22.320]   he shall be saved. Not only that, he shall go in and out and find pasture, full satisfaction.
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:28.320]   The thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy. I am come that they
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:35.520]   might have life, oh yes, and that they might have it more abundantly. Oh, wretched man
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:41.200]   that I am, who shall deliver me from this bondage, this captivity, this body of death?
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:50.920]   Life and death more abundantly?" Now, now, all the scriptures in their accounts and descriptions
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:56.920]   of the regenerate men are teaching the exact opposite of what we find in Romans 7. Indeed,
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:03.240]   I'm making a new point now. I go further. I suggest to you that to interpret Romans
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:08.960]   7 of the fully regenerate men, Paul at his best, is indeed to make the regenerate men
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:19.920]   at his best even lower than the Old Testament teaching concerning the saints of God. I suggest
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:27.240]   to you that the man in Romans 7 is in a more desperate position than David in Psalm 51.
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:32.120]   David had committed a terrible sin, adultery and then murder on top of it. And he knows
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:36.400]   what he's done. And he knows that he's guilty. But he doesn't cry out in despair, "Who
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:42.120]   shall deliver me?" He knows. He says, "I want a clean heart. I'm amazed at myself
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:47.200]   that I could have done that. Create in me, within me a clean heart and renew a right
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:51.160]   spirit within me." But this is the essence of his prayer, "Take not thy Holy Spirit
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:58.560]   from me. Take him not from me." He was aware of an essential principle of righteousness.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:03.120]   He has fallen, but he isn't in despair about it. He's not in the position of the men
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:09.320]   in Romans 7. And indeed, I could give you quotations from Psalm 119 which make this
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:14.680]   exposition quite impossible. I can't read them, I'm afraid, to you, but let me give
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:22.720]   you a list of the verses for you to read for yourselves. Read verses 49 to 65 in Psalm
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:35.400]   119. Then read verses 97 to 104. Then read verse 121. And then verses 165 to 168. Here
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:40.480]   is a man delighting in the law of God and claiming that he's captive. Read them and
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:47.240]   work out the argument for yourselves. But look at it like this. If Romans 7 is a description
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:52.200]   of the regenerate men at his best, well then I say that the Old Testament prophecies concerning
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:59.720]   the Gospel have not been fulfilled. For in Isaiah 35 I read that when he comes, when
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:04.560]   the Gospel age arrives, the lame man will leap as a heart, the blind will see, there
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:11.880]   shall be a way, a highway, it shall be called a way of holiness. The unrighteous men shall
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:18.200]   not walk upon it, but the wayfaring men, though a fool, shall walk therein on this way of
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:23.400]   holiness. That's what the Gospel is going to do. But Romans 7 doesn't describe that.
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:31.040]   Or listen to Isaiah 61. This is what the Gospel does. This is why Christ came to appoint unto
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:38.800]   them that mourn in Zion, to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion and say, O wretched men
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:46.120]   that I am. What? To give them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:53.360]   praise for the spirit of heaviness. You see, Isaiah had answered Romans 7 nearly eight
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:58.840]   centuries before. That's the very answer to it. These are the blessings of the Gospel
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:07.160]   dispensation. Beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:13.200]   for the spirit of heaviness that makes me say, O wretched men that I am, who shall deliver
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:19.160]   me from the body of this death? Indeed, I do not hesitate to say this, that if you interpret
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:26.720]   Romans 7 of the regenerate men, you are really excluding the doctrine of sanctification altogether.
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:31.600]   But in a way you are making it impossible that there should be any growth in sanctification
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:38.160]   in this way. The argument is that the more a man advances in the Christian life, the
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:43.920]   more he is aware of sin within him, and the more he therefore mourns. So that it comes
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:49.800]   to this, that the better a Christian man becomes, the more miserable he becomes. And the highest
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:54.920]   point which he reaches will be the greatest depth of his misery. Where is there growth
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:59.880]   in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord? Where is there progressive sanctification?
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:07.800]   No, no. You see, that interpretation really comes to this, that the main effect of the
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:13.440]   Gospel upon men is to increase their misery. The greater the saint, the greater the awareness
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:18.920]   of sin, the greater the awareness of sin, the greater misery. Therefore, the main effect
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:25.680]   of the Gospel is to increase misery. And the New Testament men must be more miserable than
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:32.600]   the Old Testament men. The thing is really quite ridiculous. It is impossible.
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:36.680]   Very well then, I can bring all this to a conclusion, I trust, by putting it in this
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:45.680]   way. The real secret of understanding this passage in Romans 7 is to notice that the
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:51.840]   Holy Spirit and the indwelling Christ are not mentioned at all. Hence the trouble and
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:58.520]   the problem. The Holy Spirit, as my quotations have proved to you tonight, is the great antagonist
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:07.960]   of the flesh and of sin. He gives the victory, but he isn't mentioned. I say therefore
[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:14.720]   that as the indwelling Christ and the Holy Spirit within are not mentioned, this cannot
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:21.720]   therefore be the full analysis of the condition and the experience of Paul at the time of
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:27.600]   writing. Here is a man who is analyzing himself, these two "me's" and so on. It's
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:33.240]   a complete analysis, but when Paul analyzes himself, he says this, "Yet not I, but
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:39.960]   Christ that dwelleth in me." This man doesn't mention Christ. It's not the analysis
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:45.120]   of Paul at the time of writing or the Christian at his best. It is impossible. Such a man
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:50.640]   must mention the indwelling Christ and the indwelling Holy Spirit. But then they say
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:55.280]   it is simply one aspect only of Paul. He's not speaking, they say, here of the whole
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:59.920]   of himself. You've got to take chapter 8 with this to have the whole Paul. But this
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:06.280]   man in Romans 7 is definitely and specifically talking about himself and the whole of himself.
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:10.960]   And he has analyzed himself, the two "me's" and the "I" is the complete man.
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:19.200]   So that argument cannot obtain either. But as I am pointing out, to say that Paul is
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:25.200]   describing only one aspect of himself here, makes it quite incompatible with what he says
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:31.000]   about himself as a Christian in chapter 8 in the whole of verses 1 to 17. "Ah, but,"
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.840]   says somebody, "why not the two at the same time?" Well, I think I've already
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:41.880]   answered that, haven't I, when I put it like this. If a man already knows the answer,
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:47.160]   why does he cry out, "Who shall deliver me?" If he knows Christ does and can deliver
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:52.360]   him, why does he cry out, "Who shall deliver me?" It makes the thing nonsensical.
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:56.440]   If Paul knows everything that he says in chapter 8, when he's here describing himself
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:49:01.360]   in chapter 7, why does he give this description at all? Why doesn't he say, "Well, now
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:05.800]   one aspect of my life, one part of me." He doesn't say that. He's giving a full
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:12.400]   description of this man. And it is quite incompatible, I say, with chapter 8. The men in chapter
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:17.800]   8 cannot use the expressions that Paul uses in verse 14, where he says, "I am carnal,
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:22.800]   sold unto sin." He cannot cry out in despair, "Oh, wretched men that I am, who shall
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:28.440]   deliver me from the body of this death." This doesn't mean that I'm asserting that
[00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:33.160]   the Christian man is perfect. Of course he isn't perfect. He knows, and he knows better
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:38.960]   than anybody else, that sin still remains in him. It is in his body. He knows that he
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:44.920]   exercises still restraint and care and watchfulness, and that he's got to fight. He knows that
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:52.320]   he falls into sin. But when he does so, he never speaks of himself as a wretched man.
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:56.040]   When the Christian, the regenerate man, falls into sin, he doesn't say, "Oh, this is
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:50:00.920]   terrible. This is despair. Oh, wretched men that I am, who shall deliver me." He speaks
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:07.480]   of himself as he should speak, in terms of the first epistle of John, the first chapter,
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:15.200]   "If we confess our sin, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sin, and to cleanse
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:20.160]   us from all unrighteousness." If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father Jesus
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:24.600]   Christ the Righteousness. These things write I unto you that he sin not. And if any man
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:29.000]   sin, we have an advocate with the Father. He is the propitiation for us. The Christian
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:41.560]   speaks like that. He never cries out in despair. The Christian knows that he has to fight sin.
[00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:47.720]   We've dealt with all that in chapter 6. That's where the Christian's fight with sin is described,
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:52.400]   not in this section in chapter 7. But you notice the picture there is of the men who
[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:58.920]   can be confident. Sin is there. It still remains in the body, and it's always ready to try
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:03.160]   and take mastery of the body. Don't let it. Let not sin, therefore, he's not a despairing
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:09.640]   fighter. He's on top. Sin to the Christian is not a master and he the slave. Sin to the
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:14.720]   Christian is a nuisance. It's an annoyance. It's something that worries him and sometimes
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:20.880]   trips him up. But it never drives him to despair. He never goes back under the law. He never
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:28.200]   feels hopeless. It's impossible. Not only is it not a fully regenerate man speaking
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:34.360]   in Romans 7, I say that a Christian must never speak like this. Indeed, Paul's whole object
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:39.360]   in writing was to teach people that they should never speak like that. And if that is his
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:44.840]   object in writing, how can he possibly be saying that about himself? The thing is ludicrous.
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:51.840]   No, no, this was not Paul's experience at the height of his saintliness. "Well, very
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:58.920]   well," says someone, "if it isn't that, why wouldn't you say then that it is the incomplete
[00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:03.840]   Christian? Why not say that it's the man who's not yet had the second blessing? That he's
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:10.040]   a man who's justified but not yet sanctified? That it's an immature Christian?" To which
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:18.260]   the answer is this. There is no indication of that whatsoever. The apostle does not say
[00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:24.120]   that he is describing himself as he once was and before he passed over to Romans 8. If
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:27.840]   he was doing that, he wouldn't be using the present tense. He would be using the past
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:32.880]   tense and saying, "I was once upon a time like that." He's done that in verses 7 to
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:39.680]   13, where he was describing a past experience. No, that isn't the answer. That view, of
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:44.480]   course, is based on that fallacy of saying that a man can be justified without being
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:51.920]   sanctified. That's based upon that false view, which puts an absolute wedge between the two
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:57.640]   and says that we can have the one without the other. But that is not the teaching of
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:03.760]   the apostle. The apostle says that if we are justified, we are in Christ. We are married
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:08.240]   to him. We are no longer under the law and his power is working in us. That's the whole
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:13.840]   teaching of chapter 6. He can't go back in chapter 7 and what he's already said in chapter
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:23.760]   6. The thing is quite impossible. In any case, that view is based upon a further fallacy.
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:29.560]   I don't care how young a Christian a man may be. I don't care how immature. I say it is
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:36.200]   impossible for a Christian ever to utter the cry of verse 24. Even the man who has the
[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:41.160]   first glimmerings of understanding and knowledge, he will never cry out, "Who shall deliver
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:49.360]   me?" He knows that Christ is the Saviour. So he doesn't say who. He turns to Christ.
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:56.720]   But that view also, of course, in its superficiality, imagines that when you turn from chapter 7
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:01.080]   to chapter 8, all your problems are solved and you never have any more difficulty, never
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:05.280]   have any more struggle and no more fight. Whereas Paul, as I've read to you in chapter
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:13.320]   8, verse 13, says this, "But if you through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body,
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:17.880]   you shall live." You've got to do that. And you've got to do it. It isn't all done for
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:21.400]   you after you've got the second blessing. You hand it all over to Christ, he does it
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:27.480]   for you. No, no. If you, through the Spirit, do mortify the deeds of the body, you shall
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:31.920]   live. We'll work that out in greater detail when we come to chapter 8. So I reject that
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:37.360]   view also. What then is the position? Well, it is this. The apostle is not describing
[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:42.800]   his experience. He, as I've gone on repeating, is concerned to tell us a number of things
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:50.320]   about the law. He is trying to show us that the law cannot save in any respect. It cannot
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:56.560]   justify. It cannot sanctify. That's his one object in the whole of the passage. His interest
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:04.040]   is in the law. He's been making strong statements about it in verse 5 in the chapter, and also
[00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:09.360]   in verse 13. In verse 5 he says, "The law makes me sin more than ever." In verse 13
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:12.880]   he says, "It kills me." And he knows he's going to be tackled on this, so he answers
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:17.840]   the objections. That's all he's doing, and he puts it in this dramatic form. He personalizes
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:23.280]   the whole thing. He says, "Now the position you're leaving me in is this. That I know
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:27.640]   that the law is spiritual. Yes, but I'm carnal. What can I do? What's the point of
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:32.640]   knowing that the law is spiritual? I like it, I want to do it, but I can't. I'm paralyzed.
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:38.080]   That's my position. You're leaving me there." What sort of a man is he describing, therefore?
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:46.560]   He is describing a man who is experiencing an intense conviction of sin. He is a man
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:51.920]   who has been given to see by the Spirit the holiness of the law, and he's utterly condemned.
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:55.800]   He's aware of his weakness for the first time, and his complete failure. Yes, but he
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:56:00.560]   doesn't know any more, because he's trying to keep the law, and he finds he can't. He's
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:06.320]   condemned. He's under conviction. He doesn't know. He doesn't understand the truth about
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:19.000]   the gospel, about salvation. I've given you abundant proof of the fact that he's not unregenerate.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:23.640]   Well yet you seem to be saying, Sir Sumner, that he isn't regenerate either. Well, this
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:29.760]   is the difficulty. I don't know how to put it, but this is the experience of large numbers
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:34.240]   of people. You who have been reading the books on revival this year have come across this
[00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:41.720]   many times. People suddenly come under conviction of sin by the Holy Spirit. They see the whole
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:46.840]   of their past is wrong, it's lost. They see the meaning of the law for the first time.
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:50.960]   They've lost their self-righteousness. They're dead. They're killed. They try then to pretend
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:58.280]   they can't, and they may remain like that for days and for weeks. Then the truth about
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:03.160]   Christ and his full salvation is revealed, and they find peace and joy and happiness
[00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:09.240]   and power, and they glory and offer up their prayers. But there they are in this position,
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:13.540]   as it were, neither the one or the other. If you pressed me hard, well then I admit
[00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:20.380]   I'll say this about them, that there must be life in them. There must be life in them.
[00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:25.240]   But you see, they haven't seen the truth clearly even about justification, leave alone
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:30.720]   about sanctification. This man is under the condemnation of the law, and feeling its utter
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:36.480]   hopelessness, his own helplessness, and his complete death. He is under what the apostle
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:48.960]   Paul calls the law of sin and death. There he is. And he feels, of course, utterly and
[00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:58.240]   completely hopeless. Why did Paul write all that? He wrote it for two reasons. One, to
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:03.580]   answer the charge that was brought against him that he was dismissing the law of God,
[00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:09.220]   and saying that it was evil and that it was bad. But he'd got a second and a much bigger
[00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:14.740]   reason, which he's already given us in the first six verses of the chapter. It was this,
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:21.540]   to show us that there's one great and glorious hope for us. The thing he'd already said in
[00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:27.020]   verse 14 of chapter 6, "Sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under the
[00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:32.380]   law but under grace." Chapter 7 is an elaboration of that. It's the exposition of that. And
[00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:35.940]   this is what he says. It's all right, he says, you are not under the law. Like the
[00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:41.060]   woman whose husband is dead, you are dead to the law. You are married to another, even
[00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:45.860]   to him that was raised from the dead, who is full of life and power. He'll bring children
[00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:50.140]   out of you. He'll impregnate you. He'll put his life into you. And you shall bear
[00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:54.620]   fruit unto God. You'll no longer be doing it as under the law. You've been delivered
[00:58:54.620 --> 00:59:01.380]   from that in which you were held. But you will now serve in newness of spirit, and not
[00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:08.180]   in the oldness of the letter. That's what he wants to say. And in these verses, from
[00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:13.100]   verse 7 to the end of the chapter, we've got nothing but two parentheses to deal with
[00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:18.860]   difficulties, nothing else. And then he'll go on in chapter 8, really to tell us his
[00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:25.180]   experience as the regenerate man in Christ Jesus, who has been made free from the law
[00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:30.500]   of sin and death, and who is now able to do what he couldn't do before because of the
[00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:42.060]   weakness of the flesh. That is the position. Just a parenthesis to show us in a dramatic
[00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:55.740]   and a clear way what the law could not do because in that it was weak through the flesh.
[00:59:55.740 --> 01:00:02.700]   Thank God this is not the regenerate man. He is the man that I've been depicting and
[01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:10.180]   describing to you in my almost endless quotations from this epistle, other epistles, writings
[01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:17.180]   by other apostles, and above all by the Lord of glory who said, "If the Son shall make
[01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:29.180]   you free, ye shall be free indeed." Amen.
[01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:37.100]   O Lord, our God, we come to thee to offer up our praise and our thanksgiving for him
[01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:44.780]   who said that. As we realize that he left the courts of glory and humbled himself and
[01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:52.340]   was made in the likeness of men and even went to the cruel death of the cross and its shame,
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:01:02.380]   that we might be free indeed and might have life and might have it more abundantly. O
[01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:10.660]   God, receive our praise. And now may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
[01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:15.620]   and the love of God and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and
[01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:21.820]   continue with us now this night throughout the remainder of our short uncertain earthly
[01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:28.380]   life and pilgrimage and evermore. Amen.
