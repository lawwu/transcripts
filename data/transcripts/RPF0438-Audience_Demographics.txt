[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.280]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.480]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.720]   Today we're not going to talk about a specific financial planning question.
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:22.080]   Rather, I'm going to talk to you about who you are and who your fellow listeners are.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.120]   I'm going to report to you on some demographic data from a recent advertising â€“ excuse
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:35.720]   me, recent demographic survey that I completed, which was very interesting to me to learn
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.600]   who is listening to this show.
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.080]   I'll paint a picture for you.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.280]   I love these pictures that many of you are sending in to me.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.040]   By the way, I ask you if you haven't yet sent me a picture, please just send me a quick
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.040]   family picture.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.620]   I want to put some pictures on a screensaver and print some out so I can always keep in
[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.800]   mind who my listening audience is with actual faces.
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.260]   That's super helpful to me.
[00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.560]   In addition to that, please make sure that you take a moment and record a quick two to
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.840]   three-minute voice memo on your phone and email that to Joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.320]   telling me what you've learned and what you've changed in your life as a result of Radical
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.320]   Personal Finance.
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:18.440]   I'd like to do a special episode 500 of the show and put that together so that you can
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.160]   share your story with other listeners.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.640]   Other listeners can be encouraged by what's happened in your life since listening to Radical
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.940]   Personal Finance.
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.880]   Please just record a voice memo on your phone and email that to me, Joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.720]   in celebration of our 500th show.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.120]   I've received a bunch of pictures.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.600]   I haven't yet received any voice memos yet, so please do that.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.200]   But I'll paint you a demographic picture of who you are.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.520]   You as a listener, you are a man.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.420]   You are white and you are between the ages of 25 to 54.
[00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.800]   You are extremely highly educated and you earn a lot of money.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.800]   That's who you are.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.760]   Oh, and you're married as well.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.240]   That's what my demographic data tells me.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.760]   I'll give you the breakdown of all those because I think it's so interesting to see that data
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.320]   and I want to share that with you as well as share with you what I learned.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.760]   I want to do one quick sponsor of the day before I get into the numbers.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.720]   Today's sponsor is Silly Grasshopper Media.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.400]   Silly Grasshopper is the company that I use to do all of my web development.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.400]   It's run by a friend of mine.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.640]   His name is Jonathan Josephs.
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.520]   I reached out to him when I had put together the first website for Radical Personal Finance
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.800]   and a bunch of the other websites that I have as well.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.480]   I had started that on my own.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.480]   And then I reached out to Jonathan and I said, "Hey, can you please help me?"
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.400]   Because he's a WordPress developer and had really developed some experience there.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.000]   He works on other platforms as well, but he's a real expert with WordPress.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.640]   So he agreed and we've been working together for several years now.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.360]   He does everything on the website.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.560]   I don't do anything except to prove comments.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.840]   That's it.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.280]   Everything else he does, which has been such a blessing to me to be able to get out of
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.280]   the weeds.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.600]   Listen, your website is important.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.840]   If you run a business, your website is your street location.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.280]   Used to matter what street you were on.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.320]   That still matters to some degree, but it matters far more what your website looks like
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.560]   and how it works.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.560]   If you are an employee, you need a website.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.480]   You need a career website that shows your perspective employer, your next great perspective
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.320]   employer, your skills, your talents, and your abilities.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.640]   So you should reach out to Jonathan at SillyGrasshopper.com.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.600]   SillyGrasshopper.com.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.640]   Very reasonable.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.960]   He's got some self-help stuff.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.520]   He's also got full service.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.360]   I found for me that I just could not stand learning all the WordPress stuff.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.560]   It just sucked all my energy out of me.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.240]   And I've been so thrilled to work with him for the last few years.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.240]   SillyGrasshopperMedia.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.240]   SillyGrasshopper.com.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.960]   Let's get to the data.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.880]   So let me run through a couple of the breakdowns here of the listenership, and then we'll come
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.440]   back and I'll give you some of my analysis of these things.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.880]   First, about 80% of you are men and 21% of you are women.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.020]   Now compared to other podcast listeners, that skews pretty heavily male.
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.960]   Talk about comparison here for a moment.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.360]   One of the challenges with going through this data is what do I compare this to?
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.180]   Do I compare this to the general population data?
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.040]   That would be a little hard to do because podcast listeners are a very small slice of
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.040]   the pie.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.040]   Do I compare this?
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.000]   What do I compare it to?
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.640]   I pulled some data from a company called Edison Research who's done some research in the area
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.640]   of podcast listenership.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.580]   What they found is, first of all, still, even though it's growing steadily, a very small
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:48.040]   percentage of people actually listen to podcasts in terms of the number of the percentage of
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.040]   the population that listens to podcasts.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.080]   Just under about 2% of the population regularly listens to podcasts.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.720]   Sorry, not 2% of the population, but 2% of the total listening time from their fall 2014
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.080]   data listens to podcasts.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.720]   Those who listen to podcasts listen to a lot of podcasts and listen for a long time, but
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.520]   a small number of people listen to podcasts.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.240]   I'm comparing this to the Edison data because that's probably the closest comparison I can
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.240]   get.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.680]   The percentage of people who listen to podcasts, you could guess, would skew younger rather
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.280]   than older, for an older person much more likely to turn on the radio than my generation,
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:33.960]   would skew more educated and more higher income because of more familiarity with the digital
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.960]   devices, et cetera.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.720]   I'm going to compare my audience to the Edison data.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.000]   If 80% of you listening to my show are men, 21% are women, that would be compared to the
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.960]   Edison data, which would be, say, 56% are men, 44% are women.
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.960]   The age bracket tree is very interesting to me.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:02.360]   Probably the most important demographic is that 88% of you are between 25 and 54 years
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.360]   old.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.480]   If I broaden that to ... Well, 25 to 54 is 88% of you.
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:14.800]   18 to 34 is 55%, with the most important, of course, being 21 to 34.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:21.120]   That demographic of 25 to 34-year-olds is about 49% of my listening audience.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.040]   Half of you are right in my generational cohort.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:32.000]   Then 30% of you are in the 35 to 44-year-old generational cohort.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Over 55 is 4%.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.720]   10% of you are between 45 and 54.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.720]   I'll put these data.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.000]   It's hard to absorb numbers in audio form.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.360]   I'll put this data in the blog post for today's show.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.840]   Marital status, 70% of you are married, 27% of you are single, 2.4% divorced.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.560]   By the way, this is 903 total responses.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.840]   So 70% married, 27% single.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.840]   That's good.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.240]   Marriage is good for your health and for your wealth.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.160]   Racial breakdown, 82% of you are white.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.160]   4% of you are black.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:12.840]   4.5% of you are Asian, and 4.5% of you are Hispanic.
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:19.600]   So I would say there's a heavy, heavy white skew.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.600]   Educational experience.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.600]   These are the two big ones that are really interesting.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.160]   We'll come back through the analysis in just a second.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.160]   Educational.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:38.280]   91% of you have a college degree or higher, and 96% of you have at least attended college.
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:43.920]   So that is a massive skew towards high education.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.020]   Lots of lots and lots of formal education, which means that my student loan advertisers
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.040]   are pretty good advertisers to keep around for you guys.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.040]   If we were to compare that to other podcast listeners, let me give you an example of how
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.680]   extreme that is.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:04.240]   Other podcast listeners, 22% have a high school education or less, whereas for you, my listening
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:11.460]   audience, 2.1% of you have a high school degree or less.
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:16.260]   Of the one to three years of ... Let's just go with a four-year degree or higher.
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.600]   Of the general population, 51% ... Excuse me.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.760]   The general podcast listening population, 51% report that they have a four-year degree
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.760]   or higher.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:29.920]   But of you, my listening audience, 85% of you, 86% have a four-year college degree or
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.920]   higher.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.280]   So a massive skew towards high education.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.040]   What about money, income?
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:41.600]   58% of you earn over $100,000 a year.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.560]   58% of you earn over $100,000 a year.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:52.160]   85% of you earn over $75,000 per year.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:59.040]   And 90% of you earn in excess of $50,000 per year.
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:05.360]   It's hard to overstate how extreme this skew is towards high income.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:11.100]   If we were to compare that to the Edison data, Edison would report that 28% of podcast listeners
[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:16.000]   earn in excess of $100,000 per year.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.440]   Whereas for you, my listening audience, you report that 60% of you earn in excess of $100,000
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.440]   per year.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.440]   So 28 versus 60%.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:32.480]   If we broaden that to 75 and over, 41% of listeners in the general podcast space report
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.480]   41% ... Excuse me.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:39.640]   Report $75,000 per year over for you at 75%.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:47.000]   And remember that this Edison data is podcast listeners who in and of themselves skew high
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.800]   income.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.560]   So what does this mean and was I surprised by it?
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.880]   Well, let's talk about men versus women.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.440]   Wasn't surprised by this.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.880]   I never have intended to try to speak to men or speak to women here on Radical Personal
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.000]   Finance.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.840]   I don't think much about it.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.060]   I don't pay much attention to it.
[00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:11.020]   My guess would be that my content would appeal more to men than to women, but I've never
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:14.780]   intentionally tried to make any difference here.
[00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.420]   So that doesn't really matter to me.
[00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:20.380]   I have another show, Encouraging Christian Fathers, that's exclusively to men.
[00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:24.320]   I should do some demographic data there to see if any women sneak in, but that one's
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.320]   exclusively to men.
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:31.060]   So I'd expect that to appeal to men, but I don't particularly try to do anything here.
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:36.360]   It's just interesting to observe that the audience does skew very male.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.360]   Not surprising.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.980]   As far as the age bracketing, that makes sense to me as well.
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:46.660]   With the majority of the audience being between that 25 to 54, that's the goldmine for advertising.
[00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:51.820]   88% of you are 25 to 54 and you're the primary target for advertisers.
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:55.920]   So that's where I'm working to beef things up there.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:04.200]   It's also reflective, I think, of the podcast culture, which would skew younger.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:11.780]   My show would definitely skew younger even than podcast listeners.
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:16.480]   I think this is reflective of the type of topics that I choose to talk about versus
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.480]   others.
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.720]   For example, I haven't done a big long series on social security planning, although I have
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.720]   wanted to.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.480]   It just doesn't interest me as much as other things.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:31.120]   Because of my bias in choosing topics that interest me, I think that also is reflective
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.140]   of the topics that will interest more of you.
[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:40.500]   If I want to attract a more diverse age bracketry, I need to choose a more diverse array of topics.
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:46.400]   Marital status is also fascinating to me because of this correlation of marital status with
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.480]   education and income.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:56.340]   70% of you are married, and that's a significant skew versus the general population.
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:02.160]   Over the last five decades, there has been a significant ongoing decline in marriage
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.520]   rates, especially marriage rates among young adults.
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:12.720]   But the story of the decline of these marriage rates varies dramatically depending on the
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:18.140]   education and the income earning level of the respondent.
[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.800]   In many ways, you have the story of two Americas.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.600]   Just recently, a couple of months ago, I finished Charles Murray's book called Coming Apart,
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.080]   The State of White America, 1960 to 2010.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.280]   It was extremely eye-opening for me.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.760]   It was probably the most important book that I've read so far this year in terms of it
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:40.880]   has helped me tremendously to understand what's happened in my own country here in the United
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.280]   States over the last 50 years.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:48.740]   To really understand, it helped me to put current politics into view.
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:53.280]   It helped me to put current social issues into view in a way that I never before understood.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:57.440]   The story that he paints is essentially that there are two new Americas that 50 years ago
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.020]   didn't exist.
[00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.720]   I won't take the time to prove and provide all the supporting evidence for his thesis,
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.780]   but I'll just summarize it for you.
[00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:10.980]   There's been the development of a new upper-class elite class which never before existed, and
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:15.460]   is not based upon income, although income is correlated to the elite.
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:20.100]   It's based upon education, and it's a class difference, a different lifestyle and a different
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.220]   class.
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:28.180]   The other kind of amazing trend that has emerged is that there's been the development of a
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:35.140]   massive new lower class which never before existed in US history.
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:40.580]   That is based partly on income, but it's also class distinction.
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:45.380]   The story that he tells in the book is really interesting because the upper-class elite
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:53.740]   systematically discard many of the traditional values that the United States of America was
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:58.660]   founded on, the traditional values in terms of lifestyle.
[00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.740]   An example of a big one would be married.
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:07.580]   The upper-class discard this in their vocal support, but in actual practice, people who
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:15.900]   are highly educated tend to get married and stay married, whereas in the lower class,
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:20.100]   marriage as an institution has fundamentally fallen apart, and people in the lower class
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.740]   very rarely get married and they very rarely stay married.
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.060]   This has disastrous economic effects.
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.380]   Now, correlation causation, I don't know.
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:32.420]   I don't want to get into that in detail today, but it's interesting to me that you who are
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:41.420]   listening skew heavily married, especially heavily married in the context of the age,
[00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:47.620]   the trending towards youth, because when you pull apart the data on marriage rates among
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:54.340]   the general population, at an older age, that's different than at a younger age.
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:15:00.100]   My generation and younger is, especially among poor people and low-income earners, are getting
[00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.980]   married at very, very low rates.
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:07.740]   Much more likely, again, at higher education and higher income to get married, but still,
[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:12.620]   there's still been a significant decline there over the last 50 years.
[00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:18.260]   The other, of course, possible reason here that so many of you could skew married would
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:24.700]   be my own personal religious beliefs and the fact that I am pretty vocal.
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:29.060]   Many people consider me to be fairly vocal about those religious beliefs.
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:33.820]   My guess would be that if I had any religious information, that you and the listening audience
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:38.220]   would skew more religious than the general population, less secular, more religious.
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:43.820]   I know this is a common complaint in the corners of the internet about my show, that I preach
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.620]   too much, I talk about religion, blah, blah, blah.
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:52.500]   I would expect that you would skew less secular than the general population.
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.660]   That would also correlate heavily with being married.
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.140]   I can't prove that one, but that would be my guess.
[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:02.940]   The racial makeup is, I don't quite know what to do with this.
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:07.220]   On the one hand, it doesn't really matter to me in the sense of what color someone's
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:15.300]   skin is, but what does matter to me is that I'm not really reaching an audience that is
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.300]   less affluent.
[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.300]   I don't know why I expected that I would.
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:25.300]   I bill my show as appealing master's degree level information, so of course my audience
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:28.500]   is going to be more educated.
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:33.620]   But I've had this dream ever since I started of being able to provide information, this
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:39.980]   dream of the 17-year-old boy or girl that finds me on their smartphone and listens to
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:44.260]   my show and learns everything they need to break out and be rich.
[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:49.780]   That's long been a dream of mine.
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:53.600]   Obviously it's nothing more than a dream because my content is so technical.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.780]   That's going to put a lot of people off.
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:01.420]   One thing that this demographic data has done, among other things, I've become much more
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:05.820]   deeply appreciative of other broadcasters and their approach.
[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:11.100]   For example, when I started this show three years ago, I was heavily critical of Dave
[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:12.100]   Ramsey.
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:20.000]   He's, of course, the leading giant force in the personal finance field.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.740]   He sucks everybody.
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.420]   Everything he does rocks through the personal finance world.
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.580]   I was very critical of him.
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:32.820]   Some of that critique was technical, but some of it was just frustration with style.
[00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:34.540]   Why do you say the same thing over and over again?
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.180]   Why do you answer the same questions over and over again?
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:44.660]   Three years later, I have almost no criticisms of Dave Ramsey and almost nothing but appreciation.
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:51.660]   I especially have a deep appreciation of his ability to reach people who are not high income
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:57.140]   earners and who are not very educated because he's done more good in that space than anybody
[00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:58.740]   else I can think of.
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:04.420]   I understand the brilliance of his approach, especially given his radio audience.
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:10.100]   I just understand the brilliance of his approach in a way that I've never understood.
[00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:14.000]   The reason why the racial makeup is important to me is because there's a big difference
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.260]   in income and wealth between black people and white people.
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.060]   This is a big, big problem.
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:25.900]   It's a big problem also between Spanish people, Hispanic people, and white people and black
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.060]   people as well.
[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:32.420]   There are significant disparities here.
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:37.420]   I want to provide content that can help all kinds of people.
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:41.700]   I kind of have this problem where I thought I would be able to create this thing that
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:46.180]   would help the common person, the person who's just getting in off the streets.
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:51.700]   I don't know why I was delusional about this, but thinking that if I say I'm going to do
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:56.540]   master's degree level information and doing three hour long shows on five to nine plans,
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.980]   of course that's not going to reach the common person.
[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:06.460]   But for some reason, I've been laboring under the self-delusion that I was going to reach
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:07.620]   that demographic.
[00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:12.460]   I'm still not ready to give up on that dream, but I think I need to have to go about it
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:16.700]   a different way, which is something I don't have any answers to at the moment.
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.860]   Let's talk education and income.
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:26.620]   Not a lot to say here other than it's fascinating to me just to see the incredible correlation
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:33.820]   between the fact that you are listening to this show and you tend to skew highly educated
[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:40.580]   and you're a high income earner and you're listening to a personal finance show.
[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:46.140]   Now are you listening to a personal finance show because you're highly educated and because
[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.540]   you earn a lot of money and you know what to do with it?
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:53.220]   Or are you earning a lot of money because you're the kind of person who listens to a
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.660]   personal finance show?
[00:19:55.660 --> 00:20:00.220]   Back to the kind of the self-selection bias of this data set, you had to choose to take
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.500]   action on my survey link.
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:03.500]   That was hard.
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:07.060]   900 of you said, "Yes, I'll go take Joshua's survey."
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:13.100]   But most of you, right now the listening audience, probably a daily audience, about 20,000 listeners
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.720]   per show on an average show.
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.780]   Sometimes there's spikes, sometimes less, but that's a small percentage of the 20,000
[00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:24.020]   of you who are listening to the show who actually took the time to go fill out a survey.
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.380]   So that tells me about something about your character.
[00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:30.860]   The other thing that it tells me about is the fact that you listened through an entire
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:34.260]   episode in order to hear my survey instructions.
[00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:40.300]   Because I did not post or advertise that survey that I was doing anywhere except at the end
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.300]   of the shows.
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:42.300]   I didn't put it on social media.
[00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.300]   I didn't put it on the website.
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:46.160]   It wasn't visible as a call to action.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.380]   It was just at the end of the shows.
[00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:54.140]   So that's really fascinating to me, just to kind of think and ponder through the fact
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:58.540]   that you're the kind of person who's likely to listen to an entire personal finance show,
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:04.660]   which is not for the faint of heart, detailed, complex, sometimes long.
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.020]   This is not for the faint of heart.
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:11.300]   And so you're also the kind of person who's earning a lot of money and who has finished
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:15.540]   significant upper level academic coursework.
[00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:19.260]   Really, really interesting to see that.
[00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:22.580]   I would love, I don't know that I have the patience for it.
[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:27.780]   Statistics is not my thing, but I would love to see and hear more research about just the
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:32.260]   type of person and the causation correlation factors of this.
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.660]   On the one hand, let's talk about just kind of output and results.
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:41.980]   Probably the biggest disappointment to me personally was that I'm not reaching people
[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:47.660]   who are not earning a lot of money.
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:50.700]   And that's not bad from a business perspective.
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.980]   And I'm not going to change, by the way, I'm not going to change radical personal finance
[00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.780]   to try to reach that person.
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:57.860]   I'm just telling you personally, that was a dream of mine.
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.100]   It still is a dream of mine.
[00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.580]   I want to help people who are just getting started.
[00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:04.620]   And I thought, well, if I just put something out there for free, people will find it.
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.460]   Well, yeah, the people found it were the people who were looking for it.
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:09.980]   We're already doing just fine.
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:13.460]   I mean, you guys are doing well, many of you.
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:14.460]   Income doesn't tell the whole story.
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:18.600]   I know some of you are struggling, but on the whole, you're doing really well.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.640]   So that was a real disappointment to me.
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.180]   And I don't know quite what to do with it.
[00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:32.980]   I do think that first, that podcasting is probably not the best medium for it.
[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:38.860]   Even though I love that podcasting is free, video is probably a better medium for it.
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:44.740]   A couple of my listeners, and I mentioned it, pointed out that in many ways, Tai Lopez,
[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:49.460]   he's the here in my garage guy who does all the stuff on YouTube, he's probably the one
[00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:54.420]   who's reaching that cohort, younger people getting started, or Gary V, some of these
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:57.180]   kind of people who are doing a lot of video work.
[00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:03.220]   So I'd like to do more video work because video is definitely, unfortunately, young
[00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:08.820]   people don't read, poor people don't really read, and video is probably the best.
[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.700]   They don't listen to podcasts really either.
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:16.420]   So video is probably the best avenue of reaching that type of demographic.
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:18.260]   So I've got to figure out what I want to do there.
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.660]   It's not a real pressing thing.
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:21.860]   That's just a personal desire.
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:24.260]   I want to help people who are poor get rich.
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.620]   I love helping people who are rich get richer.
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:27.700]   That's really cool.
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.780]   But I want to help people who are poor get rich too.
[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:33.420]   And I'm not doing that right now.
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:38.580]   So I guess the other outcome of this is in thinking about the content of the show, that
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:44.700]   now that I know who you are, listening, I need to tailor my content to help serve you.
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:50.260]   Of course, I could try to tailor my content to help serve the poor person, but I think
[00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:54.260]   Dave Ramsey is doing that really well and I don't have the patience to do what he does.
[00:23:54.260 --> 00:24:01.420]   So it's made me reflect and to say, "Okay, how can I serve this audience better?"
[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:07.180]   It's also made me consider more deeply my business model because with the average income
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:14.180]   and the education level of you, the listening audience, it proves to me that if I can create
[00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:21.340]   better, more useful materials for you, you'll pay for education and you've got the disposable
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:22.340]   income.
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:27.540]   And so that's been a major takeaway for me as well, to look at it and say, "Okay, well,
[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:29.780]   I need to serve this audience.
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.940]   I want to serve you."
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:37.020]   I hope you don't feel slighted by my talking about my disappointment.
[00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:38.220]   I thank you for listening.
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.700]   It's an honor and I want to serve you better.
[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.420]   I want to serve you better than I've been doing that.
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:48.060]   So please, I was just simply expressing that because it was just kind of a dream of mine
[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:53.540]   and that was just one takeaway that I had that I wasn't really doing a good job there.
[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:55.740]   So that's the demographic data.
[00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:01.620]   I share that with you and for interest, I applaud you and congratulate you on your listening
[00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:06.780]   to this because it's reflective in the fact that you are getting great results.
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:13.940]   So if you are in the listenership, if you felt not represented here by my commentary,
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:18.020]   if you felt that, "Well, Joshua, I'm not in that bracket.
[00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:22.220]   I'm not earning a lot of money or I'm not highly educated or I'm this other color of
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:29.900]   skin or whatever," just recognize that there is correlation and there is causation here
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:34.980]   that as my job is to serve you and I want to see these numbers go up over time.
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:42.020]   As new people come on, I want to take those of you who are earning under $25,000 per year,
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:48.100]   which is 2.8% of you, and I want to move you into the $200,000 and up category.
[00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.660]   So that's the goal over time.
[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:50.660]   That's the demographic data.
[00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:53.340]   I'll put some of these numbers in the blog post today.
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.460]   You can see them and take a look at the breakdown.
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:26:00.020]   I want to thank you to all of you who have taken the survey.
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:04.020]   If you haven't taken the survey, the survey is still open and I just wanted to promote
[00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:05.980]   it for a short period of time, but it's still open.
[00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:06.980]   You go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/survey.
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:07.980]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com/survey.
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:12.580]   It takes about two minutes to do.
[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:13.580]   Five quick questions.
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:15.380]   There's an email box there, but you can leave that blank.
[00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:18.000]   I don't care if you fill that in or not.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.380]   Five quick questions will take you about 30 seconds to do.
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.900]   So RadicalPersonalFinance.com/survey.
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:28.900]   Don't forget our sponsor of today's show is Silly Grasshopper.
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:35.260]   And then also, just a quick plug for the patron program here that I have done.
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:40.780]   Probably one of the biggest challenges has been to grow the patron program and that's
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:41.780]   my responsibility.
[00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:43.900]   I've struggled with what to offer.
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:50.020]   But as of present, there are 260 of you who are sending me $1,625 a month.
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:54.180]   And I don't want to say thank you for that, but if you're not one of the 260 who's
[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:59.860]   sending me a total of $1,625 a month and you're getting value, educational value from this,
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:03.360]   I would be thrilled if you come on over and support the patron program.
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:11.180]   You can do that at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron and link, as always, in the notes.
[00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.580]   Be back with you tomorrow.
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:18.660]   And tomorrow, I will be sharing with you my book review on Tony Robbins' brand new
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:22.900]   book Unshakeable.
