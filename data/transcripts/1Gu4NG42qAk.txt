[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.160]   Abram in Chesterton, Indiana writes, "Dear Pastor John, in the parable of the wedding
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:15.240]   feast found in Matthew 22, Jesus says, 'Many are called, but few are chosen.'
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.600]   However, in Romans 8, 28-30, it seems that the people who are called are part of an unbreakable
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.020]   chain that ultimately leads to glorification.
[00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.860]   So are the called in Matthew the same called in Romans?
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.080]   And what is the difference between being called and being chosen?"
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.240]   It's remarkable to me that Abram would ask this question now because the book that I
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:47.340]   just finished writing a few weeks ago on reading the Bible supernaturally and reading it naturally
[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.880]   and how those fit together has a section in it on precisely these two texts and their
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.880]   differences.
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.040]   So this was easy for me to think about because it was so front burner.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.380]   And the reason I had taken it up is exactly the reason that Abraham took it up, namely
[00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:19.320]   that Matthew 22, 14 and Romans 8, 30 do not apparently use the word "called" in the
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.320]   same way.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.720]   And if they do, they contradict each other.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.680]   So that's why he's concerned about this.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.680]   And so I took it up as an illustration of how when you want to know the meaning of a
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:42.080]   word in the Bible, you must not assume that the use of that word by other authors besides
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.800]   the one you're studying will be the same as the place where you're reading.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:57.800]   In fact, I would stress, even the same author can use the same word in two very different
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.800]   ways.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.420]   Now we all know this in English, and I quoted this in the book.
[00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.080]   That's why it's on my mind right now.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:16.320]   In the Oxford English Dictionary, the word "set" has listed, I mean, examples of
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.040]   464 definitions.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.680]   That just makes me wild with happiness about the English language.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:35.000]   And the word "run" has 396 listed definitions.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.560]   Now if you need any evidence that words are flexible, that's it.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.080]   And it's true in the Bible as well, which means that good old Mortimer Adler in his
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.000]   book How to Read a Book is absolutely right to have a whole section called "Coming to
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Terms."
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.960]   And what he means is when you see a word, you don't know yet what that word means just
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.360]   because you're familiar with the word.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.560]   You don't know what "set" means or "run" means until you see it, or the word "rock,"
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.400]   like "rock a chair" or "rock music."
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.800]   The words have to have a context.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.760]   And as soon as you have discerned from the immediate context how it's being used, then
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:24.460]   you have "come to terms," and a word becomes a term with a definitive meaning in the context.
[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.120]   So now to Matthew and Romans.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.120]   Romans 8:30 says, "Those whom he predestined, he called."
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.260]   And "called" is the word that Abram is concerned about.
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.260]   He called.
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.600]   And those whom he called, he justified.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.320]   And those whom he justified, he glorified.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.160]   So clearly, Abram's right.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.200]   Paul means that all the called are justified, and all the justified and therefore all the
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:56.040]   called are glorified, which means if you are called, you're going to be saved forever.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.040]   Forever.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.840]   You will not lose your salvation.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.560]   God won't let it happen.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.920]   You are his called.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:09.400]   But when you go to Matthew 22, there's a parable.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.080]   It's a parable of the wedding feast.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.140]   A king is giving this feast, and he wants lots and lots of people to come.
[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.200]   So he sends out invitations, and those who are invited won't come.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.200]   Unbelievable.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.560]   It's just a parable of how horrible we are in turning down the wooings of God in this
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.560]   world.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:36.760]   And so he says to his servants, "Go out and call," it's translated "invite," but it's
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.480]   the word "call" that he's going to refer to in the end.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.720]   "Go call everybody you can find.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.240]   Beat the bushes and bring them in."
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:52.160]   And then his house is full of people, except there are a few in there, at least one, who
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.360]   has the wrong clothing on, no wedding garment, which probably signifies a lack of respect
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:07.200]   for the king and a lack of being changed by the grace that was extended to him in this
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.360]   invitation, and the parable ends like this.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.400]   In that place where this person is thrown, there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth,
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.760]   for many are called, but few are chosen.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:27.840]   Now clearly, the called there are not always saved.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.700]   The chosen are saved, but many are called who may not be chosen.
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.240]   Many are called, few are chosen.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:47.320]   And so what's clear is that in Matthew's terminology, the called is simply the general appeal to
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:55.480]   the world to come to the banquet, but those who come in response to this general call
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:02.600]   may not have been—now I'm going to use Paul's term—called in what theologians call the
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.800]   effectual way.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.720]   And we know Paul thinks this way, too.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.720]   Paul knows about this.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.080]   This is not—they're not theologically different here.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:17.240]   In 1 Corinthians 1:23, Paul says, "We preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to the
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.080]   Jews and folly to the Gentiles."
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:25.240]   So in other words, Christ crucified has been heralded to all the Jews and all the Gentiles,
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.520]   and they have been invited to come.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.080]   They have been called in a general way.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:38.500]   And then he says, "But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.200]   of God and the wisdom of God."
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.520]   So there's a general call that goes out to everyone, "Come!
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.560]   If you believe, you'll be saved."
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:52.560]   And there's a call like the call that Jesus issued to Lazarus as he was standing before
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.400]   his grave when he said, "Lazarus, come forth!"
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:01.200]   And the dead man was given life by the call.
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.200]   And that's the way Paul uses "call" in Romans 8.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.200]   30.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.840]   That second usage is the call creates the obedience.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:17.400]   The call creates the life, and therefore all the called will be glorified.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:25.400]   So the lesson of how to read the Bible is different authors sometimes use the same words
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:31.120]   in different ways, and we need to base our interpretation on the immediate context, not
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.640]   just the fact that they use the same word.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.640]   So good and valuable.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.120]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.060]   And in April, we talked about the next book Pastor John is writing.
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:46.840]   We talked about it in episode number 837, a sneak peek of John's next book.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.640]   We're going to break for the weekend now.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:54.120]   What a week it's been talking about cremation, how to design and pull off a simple and inexpensive
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.120]   wedding.
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.120]   And we talked about the best commentaries on the book of Romans.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.680]   There was something for everyone.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.980]   You can catch up on the week's episodes, search our archive of hundreds of episodes, download

[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.920]   On Monday, we field a question from a reader in Norway where it is illegal to spank your
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:20.120]   own children, and the state can take your kids away for it.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.120]   Wow.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.720]   So what is a God-fearing parent to do?
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.120]   I'm your host Tony Rehnke, and John Piper and I will return on Monday.
