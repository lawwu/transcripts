[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.700]   - This week we welcome to the podcast
[00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.100]   parenting expert Ted Tripp.
[00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.820]   He's the author of two best-selling books,
[00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.820]   Shepherding a Child's Heart and Instructing a Child's Heart.
[00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.180]   Dr. Tripp, how important is it to help children
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.520]   to understand their own hearts
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.940]   and how personal idols work in their hearts?
[00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.540]   And what are some practical tips
[00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.060]   for doing this well as a parent?
[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.540]   - Well, I think that,
[00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.080]   well, one of the things I recommend for parents
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.140]   when I do seminars is to develop a heart notebook
[00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.140]   with your kids and do this in non-confrontational times.
[00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.580]   So it's not when you're confronting them
[00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.700]   about things they're doing wrong
[00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.820]   or you're correcting them or instructing them
[00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.660]   or disciplining them,
[00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.400]   but in non-confrontational times.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.740]   Family worship, for example,
[00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.660]   maybe in five or 10 minutes a day,
[00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.300]   you know, don't overburden them with it.
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.580]   One or two nights a week, work on your heart notebook.
[00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.900]   Look up every passage in the Bible
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.780]   you can find on various topics.
[00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.780]   Like for example, there are things like revenge
[00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.600]   or vengeance rather than entrusting myself to God
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.520]   or pride rather than humility
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.880]   or fear of man rather than the fear of the Lord
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.100]   or love of self rather than love of others
[00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.500]   or anger rather than peacemaking and so forth.
[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.500]   So there are all kinds of attitudes of heart.
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.500]   I mean, the Bible is rich with heart stuff.
[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.900]   I mean, if you think about it,
[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.940]   Hebrews 4, 12 says,
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.740]   "The word of God is living and active,
[00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.140]   sharper than a double-edged sword,
[00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.220]   pierces to the dividing of soul and spirit,
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.680]   joints and marrow.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.820]   And it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart."
[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.580]   That's a very interesting statement
[00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.620]   because one of the primary uses of the Bible
[00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.460]   is to help us to understand our hearts
[00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.580]   because the heart is desperately wicked.
[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.460]   That's what Jeremiah 17, nine says.
[00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.860]   So we need to be wise and understand our hearts.
[00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.820]   We need to help our children understand their hearts.
[00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.460]   So I'd suggest to parents, develop a heart notebook.
[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.880]   Look up every passage you can find on these various topics.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.540]   Write out all the verses on revenge and vengeance
[00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.080]   in your heart notebook.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.040]   Whatever you do, don't do a computer printout
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.220]   of all the verses and hand it to them.
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.260]   You don't want them to write it out
[00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.880]   because in the writing process, you're learning.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.780]   And then look up biblical illustrations.
[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.860]   For example, revenge.
[00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.620]   I mean, you have characters like Joab,
[00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.460]   who's always going around disemboweling people
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.600]   out of revenge.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.060]   I mean, it's a vivid illustration of revenge.
[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.540]   Get them to give you illustrations.
[00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.380]   What does revenge look like in an eight-year-old?
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.340]   They'll be able to tell you.
[00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.140]   Write it out in the heart notebook.
[00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.740]   My point is that over a period of years,
[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.480]   not days or weeks, but years,
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.980]   just pecking away at that heart notebook over time,
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.180]   when kids are school age, say six to 12,
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.980]   you're working on this heart notebook.
[00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.920]   You keep adding to it.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.120]   You're helping your child develop a sense
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.120]   of self-consciousness about internal motivation
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.760]   that then the parent can appeal to
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.000]   in the times of correction and discipline.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.260]   You know, Margie had a 14-year-old girl
[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.800]   came to her at the beginning of the school year.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.340]   She said, "Mrs. Tripp, I'm having trouble
[00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.480]   "getting along with the other girls at school."
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.000]   Now, that's not very surprising.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.940]   Pretty common, 14-year-old girls.
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.080]   They're catty.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.420]   That's pretty common.
[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.980]   What followed was uncommon.
[00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.220]   The girl said, "I know the problem is
[00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.980]   "I'm very self-righteous and proud and judgmental.
[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.420]   "I think I'm off-putting to the other girls."
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.500]   Now, where does that kind of insight come from
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.800]   in a 14-year-old?
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.700]   You see, she's in a home
[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.300]   where her parents talk about the heart.
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.760]   She's in a church where the pastors
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.900]   are not just urging right behaviors,
[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.040]   but they're helping people understand
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.700]   the subtleties of our sin
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.600]   and the ways that our hearts stray from God.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.980]   You know, it's fascinating to me,
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.720]   you know, the last verse in verse John is,
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.480]   "Dear children, keep yourselves from idols."
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.520]   Now, what's amazing is in 107 verses,
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.560]   he's never mentioned idolatry.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.620]   Idolatry's all through the book.
[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.120]   I mean, you know, love not the world,
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.420]   do the things that are in the world.
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.520]   'Cause if anyone loves the world,
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.960]   the love of the Father is not in him.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.020]   That's idolatry.
[00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.160]   I mean, that's the language of idolatry.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.160]   The contrast is being drawn there in John,
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.400]   first John two, between loving the world
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.200]   and loving the Father.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.900]   And loving the things that are in the world,
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.000]   you know, the pride of life, the lust of the eyes,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.080]   you know, all those things are idol issues.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.980]   And that's why at the end of the book,
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.020]   he says, "Keep yourselves from idols."
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.880]   So I think that helping kids grow up
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.220]   with insight into that.
[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.120]   So you're not beating them up with it
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.360]   every time they do something wrong.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.300]   Oh, you're a problem, you're full of pride.
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.620]   Not that at all.
[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.160]   I'm having rich times of Bible study with my kids.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.560]   We're working on this heart notebook.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.500]   We're really developing this compendium.
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.300]   I mean, there are almost 700 passages in the Bible
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.500]   about the heart.
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.600]   You know, we've got a lot of resources to go to.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.040]   We're developing these themes in the word of God.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.300]   And then I'm helping kids to learn
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.700]   how to do self-assessment.
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.940]   What was pushing and pulling me in that situation?
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.280]   Was it pride?
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.440]   Was it self-love?
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.480]   Was it anger?
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.880]   Was I out to get revenge?
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.780]   You know, all those kinds of things.
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.520]   Boy, if you can help kids learn to think in those ways,
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.380]   especially in non-corrective times.
[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.100]   Then in the times of correction,
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.900]   you have this truth that they've imbibed
[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.860]   that they can dig into, you know,
[00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.300]   when you're talking to them and correcting them.
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.700]   - Thank you, Dr. Tripp.
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.000]   That was Christian parenting expert, Ted Tripp,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.240]   author of two best-selling books,
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.340]   "Shepherding a Child's Heart"
[00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.300]   and "Instructing a Child's Heart."
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.180]   Well, tomorrow we dive into controversial waters
[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.080]   and discuss spanking,
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.120]   and talk about the place of physical discipline
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.320]   in parenting, a hot topic in the news
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.380]   here in Minneapolis for sure.
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.280]   I'm your host Tony Rankin.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.380]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.380]   (upbeat music)
