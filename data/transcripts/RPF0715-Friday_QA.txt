[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.580]   How can I serve you today?
[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.580]   Pete Slauson, CEO, Radical Personal Finance, Inc.
[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.580]   Hey, Josh.
[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.860]   Hope you're doing well.
[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.380]   Credit card question for you.
[00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.380]   All right.
[00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.380]   Let's go.
[00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.620]   I finally got through the credit card course after buying it about a year ago.
[00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.980]   I'm glad you got through it.
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:52.980]   I had a little time on my hands.
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:53.980]   Yeah.
[00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.180]   It was great, actually.
[00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.620]   The question I have is it's a little bit of the opposite issue, I think, that some of
[00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.020]   the content was geared toward.
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.740]   I actually have a pretty robust number of credit cards.
[00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.140]   I've sort of done the airline points churn over the years.
[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:19.580]   At this point, the annual fees that I have on all of the cards, it's not insane.
[00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.460]   However, there are cards that I have that are pretty idle where I'm paying the annual
[00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.940]   fee at this point.
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:34.860]   I'm wondering where the sweet spot is between having the credit, keeping my FICO score up,
[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.620]   but on the other hand, not paying fees for cards that are really unlikely to ever be
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.620]   used.
[00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.900]   I don't think that you should pay annual fees for cards that you're not using.
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.220]   I don't think the value is there even with regard to your overall credit, et cetera,
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.540]   unless you think that all of a sudden you need to borrow a bunch of money and so you
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.320]   need to keep that utilization ratio really low.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.220]   If that's the case, then maybe you have to just keep it because you need it, but it doesn't
[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:12.140]   make sense to keep cards with annual fees around for a significant amount of time.
[00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.500]   The first thing to think about is the only cards that you should keep that have an annual
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.460]   fee is a card that has a benefit that you're actively using.
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:30.660]   So if you have a premium card, an Amex Platinum or a Chase Sapphire Reserve or something like
[00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.900]   that and you say, "Yeah, I've got these annual fees, but I'm really using this card and I'm
[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.340]   getting the benefits from it.
[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.180]   I'm taking full advantage of the program and it's worth my paying the money to have access
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.020]   to this premium card," then I think that's fine, but you're not going to have more than
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.180]   a couple of those that you're actively using.
[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.620]   You're not going to have an Amex Platinum and a Chase Sapphire Reserve and a Delta Amex
[00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.820]   and a Marriott, whatever their thing is, and a Hilton with $195 here and $400 there, etc.
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:00.900]   There's no need.
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.920]   And so what you should do is you definitely should get rid of those annual fees.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.320]   So a couple things that you can do.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.020]   Number one is you can just call them and see if they're willing to waive the annual fee.
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.320]   Sometimes they'll do that, and so if you call and say, "I'm going to cancel it before the
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.960]   annual fee," sometimes they may be willing to waive it.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.020]   The best thing to do, if possible, though, is to downgrade the card.
[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:26.420]   So downgrade it from a card with that company that has an annual fee and move it to a card
[00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.460]   with the company that doesn't have an annual fee, and/or move the credit limit if they'll
[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.700]   let you do that.
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.260]   That way you can keep the credit limit available to you, which will help your utilization ratio
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.140]   if you use credit card debt in the future without having to pay those annual fees.
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.460]   Interesting.
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.820]   Okay.
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.820]   And will most of the credit card companies, I would assume some of them would waive the
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.220]   fee, but I can't see that happening, but will they generally downgrade the type of card?
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.060]   Generally, I believe so, yes.
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.980]   I don't have enough personal experience.
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.140]   I've never played the mileage game to have all the premium cards.
[00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.820]   I have a couple of premium cards that I use, but not for the mileage game.
[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.660]   And so I don't have extensive personal experience with it.
[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.540]   I know it's possible.
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.060]   And I've paid a lot of attention to those who do the mileage game, and they certainly
[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.140]   do have the ability to do that.
[00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.220]   So I don't know the percentage.
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.980]   I can't tell you, okay, 50% of them will, but I know many of them will.
[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:25.980]   Great.
[00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.980]   I'll give it a try.
[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.980]   All right.
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.980]   Thank you.
[00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:40.860]   Any other questions then before you go, Pete?
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:41.860]   That's it.
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:42.860]   Great.
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.860]   Nope.
[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:44.860]   I'm back.
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:45.860]   All right.
[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:46.860]   Very good, sir.
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:47.860]   Glad you are here.
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:48.860]   We go now to Jason in Dallas.
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.860]   Jason, welcome to the show.
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:50.860]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:51.860]   Hey, Josh.
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:52.860]   Good to be talking with you.
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:53.860]   Been listening to you for about three years now.
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.860]   Love your stuff.
[00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:55.860]   Thank you.
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:56.860]   I'm glad you're here.
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.860]   Can you hear me okay?
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.860]   Yeah, sounds good.
[00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:59.860]   Go ahead.
[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:00.860]   All right.
[00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:09.860]   So I had a question just about my wife and I's plan for the next couple of years and
[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.740]   just your financial advice and just wisdom on it.
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.900]   So currently between my wife and I, she makes 80 grand a year.
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.500]   I make 100 between two jobs.
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.220]   And we have a home before the COVID.
[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.260]   We could have sold it for 230 and we have 98,000 left to pay off.
[00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.460]   That was the BC era, the before COVID.
[00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.420]   Before COVID, before the Rona.
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.420]   Exactly.
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:47.180]   We've been pretty aggressive on paying off our house and we're on a plan to pay it off
[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:54.980]   by about this time next year with just being real good, real frugal.
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:03.220]   But with all of the economic impact of Corona, we were thinking possibly of shifting that
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:12.060]   plan instead of paying off the house as quickly as we can to stockpiling that money and possibly
[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.860]   getting another house and renting out our current one.
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.800]   The caveat that makes all this kind of tricky is we have our first child on the way due
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.660]   in October.
[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:27.700]   And by the end of the year, my wife plans on quitting her job, staying home with kids
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.540]   and starting our family.
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:34.020]   So that would drop our income down to 100 a year.
[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:42.860]   And then now we're between would we be able to rent out our current house and have enough
[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:49.260]   money for another house for us to move into when our current rent wouldn't cover our mortgage
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.460]   since we have a 15 year mortgage.
[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.540]   Is that clear enough?
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.420]   So the specific question is, should we buy a rental at this point in time?
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.780]   Is that the basic question?
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:06.860]   Our dream is to have two, three acres and a bigger home to raise more kids.
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.420]   And that's what we want to move into.
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:15.540]   And we don't know whether to stay with our specific plan to pay off our house and then
[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:24.400]   stockpile up money to try to get into that next 10, 15 year house or save the money now
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.580]   and look for the opportunity in the midst of this crisis.
[00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:29.980]   I would not pay off extra.
[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:34.320]   I would not focus on paying off my house right now, especially if you've previously thought
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:40.080]   about working on a plan where you're going to purchase investment property.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:45.100]   I'm all for having paid off houses, but I think that it makes more sense for you to
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.180]   start if you're interested in owning rental property.
[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:53.740]   I think it makes much more sense for you to start by building up a rental portfolio early
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:59.400]   in life, setting that in place so you can have your tenants paying off your rental mortgages
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:04.660]   for you and then go to paying off your house and paying off the market, paying off the
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.180]   rental units.
[00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.700]   When you look at where we are right now, I don't see any benefit of your having a paid
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:11.700]   off house.
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.000]   I do see a benefit of your having a lot of money in the bank.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.160]   And so what I would do is – and just be clear, that was an inaccurate statement.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.720]   If your house were today totally paid off, then it would be helpful.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.200]   It would be beneficial.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.720]   But right now, if you lost your job and you instead of having a $98,000 mortgage, you
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:34.900]   have an $88,000 mortgage, you're not helped by just simply having a slightly lower mortgage
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.900]   balance.
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.720]   What you need is money in the bank.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:43.120]   And so when we're in an emergency like we are right now, the first thing I do is stop
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:47.940]   all debt payoff, just stockpile cash and then wait and see.
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.860]   Wait and see what opportunities emerge.
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:54.300]   Now I think there will be quite a few opportunities to invest in real estate very productively
[00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.580]   and profitably in the coming years.
[00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.620]   And so that would be my plan is I think that one of the most important things with real
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:07.180]   estate in order for real estate to work effectively, you can often find a deal but there are times
[00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:09.900]   when it's a lot easier to find deals than others.
[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.060]   And depending on the market that you're in, there have been a lot of markets where
[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.180]   there simply haven't been any deals available over the last couple of years.
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.540]   I've known a lot of real estate investors who said, "I can't find anything worth
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.740]   investing in."
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:25.260]   Now if this recession goes according to normal recessions, then starting six months from
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:29.460]   now, a year from now, there's going to be a lot of distressed sellers and that means
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:33.500]   that there's going to be a lot of opportunities for real estate investment.
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.660]   And so if you can maintain your income and if you can have savings, that's the time
[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.020]   to start expanding that portfolio.
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.420]   The other thing that makes me say that is with regard to timing.
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.460]   You want to have two to three acres in the country, bigger house, great.
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:46.640]   You don't need it with a baby.
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.640]   You don't need it right now.
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.300]   You need it in five years.
[00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:53.300]   And so what I would do is I would set out a five-year plan to buy five rental houses
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:57.580]   in the next five years and then go ahead and once you've bought those five rental houses
[00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:03.220]   in the next five years, then make the switch to the two to three acre farmette out on the
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:07.660]   edge of town with a big old farmhouse because a five-year-old will actually use that.
[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.020]   You don't need that at this stage of life.
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.420]   And so I'd keep on investing.
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.140]   I'd stop the early payoff and I'd look for deals.
[00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:17.220]   If no deals emerge and you're a year from now and you got $98,000 in the bank, then
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.340]   just stroke a check and pay off the mortgage.
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:22.380]   But I think you'll start to see some deals that will entice you to invest.
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.380]   Okay.
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.380]   Yeah, I love that.
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.540]   Can I ask another question?
[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:29.540]   Go ahead.
[00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:37.460]   Given what you just said about the five rental houses in the next five years, do you think
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:45.180]   that the rental market is going to be abundant or a lot of people are going to be renting
[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.180]   as opposed to buying?
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:52.020]   Say I do find some deals, will I be high and dry and not able to find any renters?
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.580]   I think you can always find a renter at some price.
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:12:03.500]   The rental market is certainly being impacted right now by the RONA on all sides.
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.900]   There are some risks that are emerging that I never foresaw.
[00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.820]   I never foresaw states saying you can't evict your tenants.
[00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.060]   You've got massive numbers of tenants behind.
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.700]   And so I think that there are some significant risks.
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.900]   But at the end of the day, people need a place to live.
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:23.460]   And so the biggest risk would be for you if you bought rental houses in a place that was
[00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:28.180]   dying, if you bought rental houses in a town that was dying or in a part of the country
[00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:32.220]   that was dying and people are moving from there and moving into the big city.
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.300]   So you want to think carefully about where you buy.
[00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.260]   But I think that you can mitigate that risk.
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.340]   There's always going to be somebody available.
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.100]   Somebody wants to rent a house at some price.
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:44.580]   And so you'll just need to study the rental market as you get closer to buying and make
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.820]   sure that the demand is there.
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:47.820]   Okay.
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:48.820]   Okay.
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:49.820]   Last question.
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:59.780]   With our current house, we have got a 15-year mortgage and about 1850, 1875 mortgage.
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:03.060]   But I believe we can only rent it out for $1,500 or $1,600.
[00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:09.660]   Is that anything worth refinancing to try to get the rent to be able to cover the mortgage
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:19.380]   or just float that cash to $300, $400 extra a month to make sure that the house is paid
[00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.780]   off and don't worry about the closing costs of a refinance?
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:26.620]   I wouldn't say don't worry about the closing costs of a refinance.
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:27.920]   Calculate them.
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:32.500]   We don't want to be flippant here and I don't know what those costs would be for you specifically.
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:37.580]   But conceptually, assuming that the costs are acceptable, conceptually, if the basic
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:41.740]   plan is we own a house right now and we want to move out of this house and rent it out
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.660]   and we're going to move into another house and maybe you do that every year for the next
[00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:49.420]   five years, do the nomad real estate investing strategy.
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:54.540]   In that circumstance, then yes, I think refinancing to a 30-year mortgage makes sense.
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:14:02.220]   And so I would refinance to a 30-year mortgage and I would put that 30-year mortgage up to
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:08.100]   the maximum amount that I thought was going to make sense based upon what I could rent
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:12.380]   it out at and how much money and cash I could get out of the property.
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:17.380]   Because I would not recommend that you have a 15-year mortgage at $1850 and you can only
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.100]   rent the house out for $1500.
[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:23.220]   That's unsafe, especially if your wife is going to stay at home with the baby, you're
[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.980]   losing $80,000 in your household income.
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:28.540]   That's just not safe to have an extra $300 payment.
[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:33.140]   I'd rather the payment cash flow for a couple hundred dollars because my tenants can pay
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:38.100]   off that mortgage for me over the next 20, 30 years once I get them in there.
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:42.600]   And it doesn't matter whether they pay it off in 15 years or 30 years, I need the property
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:47.580]   to cash flow safely so that I can have safety in my portfolio.
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:52.960]   And so yes, calculate the closing cost, calculate the cost, calculate the interest rate, etc.
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.860]   But conceptually, you want to finance it for the longest period that you can at the lowest
[00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:59.820]   cost because that increases your safety.
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:04.180]   Now I need to of course point out the big risk is don't spend the money.
[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:09.340]   The big risk that if you do a cash out refinance is if you go and spend the money and you buy
[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:13.940]   a new car because well we're having a baby so we need a $50,000 car and you start spending
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:18.380]   it on fancy consumption items, then you start going backwards.
[00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:22.820]   So if you do a cash out refinance, then put the money in a bank account and use that as
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:26.140]   your investing fund that you're going to use to buy more rental houses in the next few
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:27.460]   years.
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.780]   And then if you don't find those, then go ahead and pay off the mortgage again so you
[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:31.780]   can be back where you are.
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:35.660]   You don't want to go backwards because you do a cash out refi and then start spending
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.660]   the money.
[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:37.660]   So be careful there.
[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:38.660]   Okay, great.
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:39.660]   Great.
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:40.660]   Thank you for being here.
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:41.660]   All right, we move to Kevin in Colorado.
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:42.660]   Kevin, welcome.
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:43.660]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:44.660]   Yeah.
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:45.660]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:46.660]   I've got a couple of quick comments and then a question.
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:47.660]   Okay.
[00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:48.660]   First comment is, I'm a little bit concerned about the cost of the mortgage.
[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:49.660]   I'm not sure if it's going to be a good idea to pay off the mortgage.
[00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:50.660]   I mean, I'm not sure if it's going to be a good idea to pay off the mortgage.
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:51.700]   Okay.
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:52.700]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:53.700]   I've got a couple of quick comments and then a question.
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:54.700]   Okay.
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:59.700]   First comment is, radical personal finance destination events.
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:06.540]   You said something about that months ago and I just wanted to encourage you that that's
[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:10.340]   something that I would be absolutely interested in.
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:11.340]   Thank you.
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:14.780]   I was just about ready to commit.
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.060]   Like I had thought it through and I talked to my wife.
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.140]   I was like, okay, here's what I think would be interesting.
[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:25.780]   And the thing that I've wrestled with is just simply how do I make it like cool?
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.100]   How do I, what do I want to do?
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.460]   Am I trying to do something high end?
[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.820]   Am I trying to do something entry level?
[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:31.820]   Is it going to be all lectures?
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.140]   Is it going to be hanging out, et cetera?
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:38.460]   And I finally had kind of built out the idea and then coronavirus came along and shut the
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:39.540]   world down.
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:44.300]   And so it was, I was glad, I was thankful because, you know, one of the groups of people
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:50.700]   that I just feel for intensely right now is anybody who is associated with events and
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:51.700]   makes their living on events.
[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:57.980]   There's a lot of people who make their living on events and those people are just, are being
[00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.180]   hammered right now with everything closed.
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.980]   And so I was fortunate that I hadn't made reservations.
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.740]   I hadn't committed financially.
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:08.700]   And so I put it on pause just until travel restrictions, you know, lighten up a little
[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.180]   bit.
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.180]   But thank you.
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.180]   I appreciate that.
[00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:15.740]   What would you like, if you were going to come to a radical personal finance destination
[00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:19.740]   event, what are the kinds of things that you would really love to see at that kind of event?
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:28.380]   So first of all, for it to be possible for me, it would have to be family friendly.
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:33.740]   So in a setting that I could bring my wife and boys with me.
[00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:43.700]   I would love, I get the feeling that a lot of us listeners would just really enjoy each
[00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:49.380]   other's company and bouncing ideas off of one another, almost kind of like a mastermind
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:56.700]   of just various people with some similar ideas, but obviously with completely diversified
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:57.700]   experiences.
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:01.820]   So definitely time for that sort of thing.
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:08.700]   I personally, like ADD, I really don't like to sit down for hours and hours of classroom
[00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:16.620]   or session, but having some of those options available, obviously, with maybe some guest
[00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:22.820]   speakers on certain topics that they're experts in would be a lot of fun.
[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:30.340]   But nothing too, for me personally, nothing because it's not, it wouldn't necessarily
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:38.500]   be focused for my industry, not necessarily a rigorous academic program, but more of a
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:46.140]   little bit more casual, but with definitely opportunities to maybe find some different
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:49.380]   type of people to invest with and come up with business ideas together.
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:50.380]   Cool.
[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.860]   Well, what you're saying is pretty much along the lines of what I have planned.
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.780]   I definitely would like to do something that's family friendly, just because it allows me
[00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:58.820]   to incorporate my family, which I enjoy.
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:04.380]   I'm at a stage of my family where it's a real burden on my wife for me to go away.
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:10.980]   And so if I go away, I have to make sure that I provide help for her in the household.
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.820]   And so it's a lot easier if I can just do a family event and bring my own children along.
[00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:18.820]   And so I definitely would like to do it as a family friendly event.
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:24.780]   And I think that a lot of the, I think I would guess, and I've proven this from the meetups
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:28.540]   that I've done, the casual meetups here and there, but I think my audience does skew.
[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:33.900]   We probably have, as an audience size, we probably have more children than some other
[00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.460]   personal finance podcasts do.
[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:43.420]   And yeah, what I would like to do is strike that balance of have some useful education.
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:48.380]   But the challenge is that I believe that there's real value.
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:52.960]   When I analyze the world and kind of look at what's working and what's not, as I see
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:20:00.660]   it for pure education, pure education is administered more effectively virtually.
[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:05.180]   I can create something, if I'm just going to teach, teach a class, I can create that
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:11.580]   more effectively in a virtual format where it's more thought out, it's better prepared,
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:14.260]   it's more polished, it's more to the point.
[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:20.460]   And then I can provide that in a way, in a format that is really helpful to people in
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:27.100]   a virtual course or in a written format, preferably with different modalities that serve people.
[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.380]   Some people like video and video with illustration.
[00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.760]   Some people like audio so they can listen to it at multiple times.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.500]   Some people with some good written notes or transcript.
[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:39.180]   For straight up education, I feel like that's a superior mode of delivery.
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:45.580]   I generally don't go to conferences just for education.
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:50.580]   In fact, if I go to conferences, I often skip a lot of the educational sessions and I just
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.700]   get the tapes and I listen to them later.
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:53.700]   I've done that for years.
[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:58.240]   Even when I was a financial advisor, I would go to events but I would never go to the sessions
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:03.100]   because why should I spend my time going to a session when I can just simply pay $300
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.660]   and get the recording of the whole thing and then I can listen to every session instead
[00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:08.260]   of having to pick and choose.
[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:14.220]   So what I look for when I go to an event is I look for basically three things.
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.140]   Number one, what's timely?
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:21.340]   And so what you can get at an event is you can get somebody's real life opinion.
[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:25.700]   So the fact that we're on this phone call right now, if you want to ask me about something
[00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:33.200]   right now, Friday, April 17, 2020, then you can say, "Yes, what's your opinion right now?"
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.540]   And that's something that you can do at an event that you can't do reliably in virtual
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.180]   events.
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.940]   Number two is you can get personalized feedback.
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:45.300]   And so one of the great things about an event is that you have an opportunity to interact
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.120]   with a teacher, with an expert, with a presenter.
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.020]   And so you can ask personalized questions.
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.540]   You can get real-time follow-up.
[00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:57.500]   Something is unclear or you disagree with something or you think that maybe the group
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.140]   would benefit by another idea.
[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:03.980]   That's better done in a live format than in a virtual format.
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:08.580]   And then number three, and that personalized feedback is as I see it, some of the most
[00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.660]   valuable things you can possibly get.
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.740]   And then number three is the community.
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:18.380]   And so the basic reason that I go to events is community.
[00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:21.680]   And that community for me is sometimes with my audience.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:26.580]   But a lot of times for me that community is people who are on the journey with me and
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:32.880]   people who are ahead of me who I can isolate in one place.
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.580]   And so I can fly all over the world and try to nail down all these experts and call up
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:41.740]   so and so who lives in Chicago and say, "I'm going to come see you in Chicago.
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:42.740]   Can I have lunch with you?"
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:45.620]   But that's a pretty expensive proposition.
[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.380]   And for me, especially at this time in my life, it's pretty expensive to do that.
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:51.180]   Or I can say, "Hey, you're in Montevideo.
[00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.300]   Can I come hook up with you there?"
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:54.780]   But those things are possible.
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:23:00.060]   But it's a lot easier if I go to an event that's kind of a centralized attraction for
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:04.380]   the particular subject that I'm studying and now boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, I can meet
[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.740]   five, six, ten people at one event.
[00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.780]   It's a very efficient use of the time.
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:11.540]   And so that's my analysis on the value of live events.
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:15.860]   I think in the future live events are going to be much, much more important than they
[00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:17.580]   are right now.
[00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:23.740]   As I look at many industries, my industry, other industries, I think what I see happening
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:30.140]   is that a lot of stuff is moving to digital interaction, virtual interaction.
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:35.400]   But when you move to virtual interaction, the live friendships, the live relationships,
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:41.540]   the live event becomes even more important because it's the context of a real relationship,
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:47.100]   an in-person physical relationship that makes the digital communication that much more effective.
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:51.300]   So if I'm running a company right now that's working virtually, I'm not going to run a
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.860]   company where we don't get together in person.
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:58.340]   It might be fine if we work virtually the vast majority of the time, but we still need
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:02.900]   to get together at a minimum a couple times a year in person because that's where that
[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:07.620]   human dynamic is enhanced so that now when we go back to the virtual environment, the
[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:09.620]   virtual environment is more productive.
[00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:13.100]   And so you didn't ask for it, but I agree with you.
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:14.100]   Go with your question, Kevin.
[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:15.100]   So the question has to do, another real estate question.
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:30.380]   So I'm selling a rental next week actually that's got a lot of equity and I am planning
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:42.140]   on using the funds, reinvesting using a 1031 exchange to avoid paying the capital gains.
[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:46.700]   And so my question to you, so I've been just trying to think about how to make this decision
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:53.980]   whether I want to either A, go with the 1031, reinvest in another investment property or
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:25:02.580]   B, hold off because I'm not really confident about the market being able to stay nearly
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:05.060]   as strong as it's been.
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:13.140]   Maybe it's more worth it to actually pay my taxes for what could be a much better opportunity
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.860]   in six months or a year or so.
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:21.500]   And so I'm trying to just, I really respect your opinion, the way you think about things.
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:25.980]   And I was wondering if maybe I'm not, I haven't thought about all of my options here about
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.580]   why I might go one direction or the other.
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:32.220]   How much are you selling the property for and what's going to be the capital, the taxable
[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:33.220]   gain?
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:45.180]   So I'm selling it for $320,000 of which about $200,000 is taxable gain.
[00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:49.500]   And how much cash are you going to have after the sale?
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.500]   $240,000.
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:26:04.820]   Have you identified some, already looked at a property that you'd like to 1031 into?
[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:05.820]   I have not.
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:08.180]   I don't have anything in specific.
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:15.660]   And actually just last week, the IRS came out with, they said that normally there's
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:22.220]   a 45 day identification period after the sale and they've extended it right now to July
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:28.940]   15th for anything between now and then.
[00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:34.380]   And so I really, I didn't want to identify anything too soon because I feel like the
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.940]   market is in flux.
[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:45.540]   And so really I've kind of been holding off on even trying to identify or replace a property.
[00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:46.900]   It's really hard.
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:54.020]   This is a really hard question because...
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.660]   Can I kind of tell you how I...
[00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:56.660]   Go ahead, please.
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:04.780]   So the way, yeah, so my thoughts now are, okay, I expect my tax liability on this to
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:08.460]   be about 40,000.
[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:15.940]   And so my thought is if I expect the market to be flat or increase in value at all, it's
[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:20.060]   a no brainer, but I don't.
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:23.940]   So I guess then the question is how much do I expect the market to drop?
[00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:29.540]   And the bigger of a drop I expect, and obviously what I expect doesn't mean what's going to
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:33.500]   happen, the less leverage.
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:39.260]   So one of my thoughts is if I feel like it might be relatively stable, but I'm not real
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:45.380]   confident, maybe I just buy the minimum amount of replacement property so that I'm not increasing
[00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:46.380]   my leverage.
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:54.260]   But it's still, I mean, it's a good chunk of change to have to pay to the tax man.
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:55.700]   Oh yeah, big time.
[00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:58.220]   If I decide to hold off.
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:02.700]   When does the property, so when does this property close?
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:06.780]   On Tuesday, next week.
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:15.260]   I think that's a really hard question because at these numbers, if we knew what was going
[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:22.380]   to happen in the real estate market with some certainty, then we could sketch out the numbers.
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:26.020]   So let's just talk it through for a moment because I think the problem is predicting
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:28.820]   the timing of this situation.
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:37.460]   My current operating assumption as of April 17, 2020 at 1.30 PM, my current operating
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:47.820]   assumption is that we are with coronavirus first.
[00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:52.400]   I've had a hard time understanding it, but I don't think either of the extreme positions
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.820]   at this point in time are probable.
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:59.900]   I don't think that coronavirus is just something to be taken lightly.
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:03.660]   It's clearly something significant and serious.
[00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:08.900]   So the allegation of it's a hoax or it's a political play, I don't think that bears out.
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:13.060]   My evidence for that is number one, you can see that there are in certain communities
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:16.820]   with certain risk factors, you can see that a lot of people are dying.
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:22.660]   Number two, more importantly, you can see that on a global basis, basically almost any
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:29.700]   country that has the capacity and looks at what's happening, takes it very seriously
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:33.020]   and has imposed draconian restrictions.
[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:36.940]   That tells me that this is not a hoax.
[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:41.860]   But on the other side, it doesn't seem like the most pessimistic predictions have come
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:42.980]   true.
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:51.380]   And so it doesn't seem like it is so bad that the pessimistic assumptions are true.
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:56.180]   And so we seem to be kind of squarely in the middle where I think it's bad and I think
[00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:58.640]   a lot of people are going to continue to die today.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:05.460]   Record number of people died yesterday in the United States and 4,000 people in one
[00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:06.900]   day.
[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.620]   And so it's just going to continue.
[00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:13.360]   And the problem is I think that in some ways this is the worst situation we could have.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.780]   If we could be convinced that it's not a big deal, that this stuff is not necessary, we
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:21.460]   can just go back to life as normal and everything was overblown, great.
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:26.260]   And that means that we could improve the, we could say, well, at least we were cautious,
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:29.820]   maybe we were too cautious, but let's get back to work.
[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:33.340]   On the other hand, if it were really bad, then everyone would be justified in saying
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:34.340]   it's really bad.
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:39.020]   But right now what I think is going to happen is I think there's going to be more and more
[00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:43.020]   rebellion from citizens saying, "You're not going to shut my life down.
[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:47.080]   You're not going to shut my business down for something that is the way it is."
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:50.400]   And there's going to be just a patchwork all around the world of people trying to navigate
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.400]   this middle ground.
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:57.020]   In some ways, I think the middle ground is the most difficult situation for us to plan
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:58.020]   in.
[00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:02.540]   So I still can't quite figure out what's going on with coronavirus.
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:07.480]   Today there were a couple of stories about some increased antibody testing that seemed
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:11.180]   to on the surface of the headlines, I haven't been able to dig into them yet, wait for them
[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:15.020]   to be debunked, but on the headline seemed to indicate that maybe the theory that there
[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:19.020]   have been more people infected by it could actually be true.
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:23.920]   I discounted that theory last week for a couple of reasons, but with some more testing that's
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.540]   going on, maybe that is actually true.
[00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:30.140]   And so in the coming weeks, as has always been the case, we'll start to know more and
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:31.140]   more.
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:34.000]   So that's my kind of current up-to-date talk about the virus.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.860]   But unfortunately, I still find that maddening because we don't know what to do.
[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:43.020]   All I know is for me, I'm going to continue to stay home, but I'm lucky, I'm fortunate
[00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:47.200]   in the fact that I can stay home without it harming my productivity.
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:53.260]   It's kind of psychologically frustrating and it's annoying, it's distancing and it's isolating,
[00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:55.020]   but it's not impacting my business.
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:32:00.960]   But at this point in time, if I were running a business that had in-person, I don't think
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.460]   I would be following the mandates.
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:08.980]   I just cannot see how I could let somebody, how I could let a government official destroy
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:12.880]   my life and destroy my business by their mandate.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:17.700]   And so at this point in time, I would probably be putting in some kind of precautions, but
[00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:23.100]   I think I would try to put in some precautions, but I can't sit around and let them destroy
[00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:27.020]   my life and my livelihood with this stuff.
[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.540]   That's just kind of where I'm at.
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:33.360]   So now let's pivot to the economy.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:39.700]   At this point, I'm pretty well convinced that we're in the beginning stages of a multi-year
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:43.540]   global – I'm going to use the word – depression.
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:49.060]   I think that we won't know, of course, whether this actually is labeled a depression until
[00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:50.060]   after the fact.
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:56.100]   There's no way for us to predict for sure because basically there's no formal definition
[00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:57.100]   of a depression.
[00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:58.100]   You just know it after the fact.
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:59.780]   It's a really bad, really long recession.
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:04.420]   But I think that all of the evidence indicates that this recession that we are in the middle
[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:10.340]   of or starting at the beginning of is going to be really long and really deep.
[00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:14.420]   And one of the biggest reasons for that is just simply that it is global.
[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:16.460]   It is a global event.
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:19.260]   And so it's going to be devastating.
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:25.940]   And I cannot see how at some point in time that doesn't have the normal expected effect
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:29.260]   on real estate values, on other values.
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:35.740]   I understand maybe why stock markets are up when everyone's getting bailout money, etc.
[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:40.920]   But I still – I can't understand the positive case right now for demand.
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.420]   Is there some pent-up demand?
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.440]   Yeah, probably so.
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:48.040]   And to the extent that you can pay everyone more money for them sitting at home collecting
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:52.580]   unemployment and then you'll stretch that out for a couple of years and who knows.
[00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:57.540]   But I still think it's going to have the normal effects on real estate.
[00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:01.900]   And so as more and more people lose their jobs and as more and more people run out of
[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:07.620]   money and as at some point in time banks start foreclosing, landlords start evicting, states
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:10.020]   of emergency are lifted through whatever means, right?
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:13.900]   They can't continue the state of emergency just indefinitely.
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:19.460]   At some point in time, the normal economic impacts are going to apply.
[00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:27.020]   The basic laws of the market can be pushed off for some time perhaps, but they can't
[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.220]   be ignored forever.
[00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:30.220]   They're going to have an impact.
[00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:38.220]   So if we come back now to your situation, on a $320,000 property, a 10% decrease in
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:42.140]   value at $320,000 is $32,000.
[00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:49.300]   And so in order for you to basically pay your tax and then buy another property, you know
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:52.140]   that it's a $40,000 bill right now.
[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:59.980]   But if you close on a property, then a 10% move in real estate would be a $32,000 drop.
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:04.700]   Probably something like 12 or 13% would be that $40,000 number.
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:11.540]   I have a very hard time not seeing in most markets, I have a very hard time seeing in
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:17.740]   most markets not seeing at least a 15% decline in real estate prices.
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:20.660]   I just can't see how that doesn't happen.
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:25.620]   And I would say in the fullness of time, that's my guess.
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:36.820]   So when I look at it, yeah $40,000 is a big bill, but your concern is relevant.
[00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:42.820]   The only idea that I have is, and I don't know where you are in your settled kind of
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:48.980]   family situation, but the only idea that I have is maybe you could do the move where
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:54.740]   you did, you'll just lay the idea out and you can see, but I don't know if this works
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:36:00.700]   with your family, but maybe you could do the move where you go ahead and identify a property
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:07.860]   that you're earmarking it for a rental, so you do the like kind exchange into a rental,
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:12.460]   but perhaps you're earmarking it for a rental, but you're choosing something that you would
[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:16.100]   not be sad to move into as an individual.
[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:20.540]   You're choosing something that you and your family would not be sad to move into and would
[00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:23.020]   be okay with living in for a while.
[00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:29.860]   And so if you did that, my basic idea is that could do two things for you.
[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:33.900]   Number one, it could allow you to move into it, and if you lived there for a couple of
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:39.320]   years and if the prices stayed stable, it didn't go down, then you could go ahead and
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:40.580]   sell it.
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:43.820]   You would market it as a rental of course, so that you fulfill the agreement of the like
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:47.940]   kind, but if for some reason it doesn't work in the rental market, you can't fill it really
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:51.380]   well, you can't sell it or something, then you move into it, you convert it to a personal
[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:55.260]   residence and then on the backside you sell it using the exclusion for personal residence
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:37:05.580]   and then you can go ahead and take your $200,000 gain tax-free under the exclusion, the 121
[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:06.580]   exclusion.
[00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:10.040]   And then the second thing, the second idea about that is that if you chose something
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:14.300]   that you wouldn't be sad to live in, then you wouldn't be so frustrated about short
[00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:23.100]   term movements of that property and you might be happy to live there for five years and
[00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:31.300]   then that could be time where it goes ahead and comes back and it's just less sad and
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:35.740]   less frustrating when you're living in a house getting benefit from it if the value declines
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:36.860]   a little bit.
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:39.660]   So I don't know if you're willing to move or if that works at all in your family, but
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.020]   that's the best I got.
[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:45.620]   Otherwise I think it's just a matter of you looking at your market, looking at your predictions
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:51.500]   and saying is it likely that we're going to get in excess of a 12 or 13% move or is
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:52.500]   it not?
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:55.060]   I think it's a really hard question.
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:38:00.100]   I would probably go in the, I'm more flexible in my outlook towards moving.
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:03.700]   If I thought that worked in my family needs, I would consider that.
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.380]   If not, I don't know.
[00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:06.380]   I just don't know.
[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:16.460]   Okay, well I hadn't thought about it from that angle of a potential primary, but that
[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.660]   adds another element of complication to it.
[00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:21.100]   Yeah, but I think it's very doable.
[00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:22.220]   You're not required.
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:29.660]   You can convert a rental into a house to live in any time and so you need to make a good
[00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:31.380]   faith effort at trying to rent it.
[00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:33.820]   You need a good faith effort at putting it in the market.
[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:36.100]   That's the terms of the deal.
[00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:42.260]   But there's some interpretation available there under what it means to make a good faith
[00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:44.940]   effort of putting it on the market.
[00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:52.140]   I think that if you bought a house, let's say you did the like kind exchange and you
[00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:55.780]   run the numbers on it and you know that the house could go down, but you go ahead and
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:59.100]   put it on the market at numbers that work for you, well you know you've avoided the
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:04.500]   $40,000 of gain for now or the $40,000 of tax for now.
[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:08.820]   So you can go ahead and put it on the market and if you get a good tenant, you're going
[00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:10.660]   to be fine even if the value declines.
[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:14.300]   But if you can't get that good tenant, if you can't make your numbers work, then your
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:17.820]   backup plan is just go ahead and move into it if you buy something that would work for
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:19.540]   your family.
[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:21.500]   I think it's not a bad plan.
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.100]   You consider it, but I think it's not a bad plan.
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:24.100]   It's worth considering.
[00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:30.740]   Yeah, actually, so in that situation, do you know, does it have to be rented for a certain
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:33.700]   period of time before you can make it your primary?
[00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:35.500]   I've never looked at it this direction.
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:38.900]   I've looked at going primary to rental, but never rented the primary.
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:43.700]   I'm not aware of any legal requirement that it has to be rented for a certain amount of
[00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:45.060]   time.
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:51.140]   But what I would do if I were doing that is I would document very carefully my attempts
[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:52.660]   at renting it.
[00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:58.060]   And so I would very carefully document my advertising for the house.
[00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:03.300]   I would carefully, I would put it on Airbnb for a temporary period of time.
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:08.180]   I would make a good faith effort to rent it and I would document that good faith effort.
[00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:12.420]   But to my knowledge, there's no requirement that it be rented for a certain amount of
[00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:13.420]   time.
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:14.420]   It's about the effort.
[00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:17.060]   And that would make sense in terms of the IRS doctrine.
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:22.740]   For example, many people are confused over the hobby loss rules with business deductions.
[00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:28.500]   And they mistakenly assume that a business has to earn a profit in two years out of five
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:33.700]   in order for it to be labeled appropriately as a business rather than it being labeled
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:37.620]   as a hobby so that exclusions of their deductions occur.
[00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:38.620]   It's not the case.
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:44.120]   A business actually never is required to make money in order to qualify as a business.
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:50.140]   What is required is that the owner is running things in a business-like manner, that the
[00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:55.220]   owner is making a real genuine good faith effort to make a profit, and that they're
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:41:00.620]   genuinely doing all the things that you would do to make a profit.
[00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:02.300]   And so you're adjusting expenses.
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:04.860]   You're adjusting the business plan based upon the market.
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:09.060]   So when you're in something where it's kind of on the border this way where you're understanding
[00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:13.780]   that this is possible, the key is you need to make a genuine effort and be able to document
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:14.780]   that.
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:18.200]   So if you're sitting in front of a judge, you say, "Judge, look, I put it on the market.
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.620]   These were my predictions going through.
[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:20.700]   This was my business plan.
[00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:22.180]   This is what we did.
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:27.220]   And unfortunately, the market conditions changed, but I made a genuine good faith effort to
[00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:28.620]   rent it out."
[00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:33.580]   And so as long as your plan involves you're actually doing that, I think you're okay.
[00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:35.620]   It's fine to have a backup plan, right?
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:38.740]   Every business owner that opens a business knows that their backup plan is the business
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:40.480]   may go bankrupt.
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:41.760]   We all know that.
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.420]   We may go bankrupt.
[00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:49.420]   But the key is just understand that it's the effort that's required, and if you'll document
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:53.860]   that effort, you can create a strong chain of evidence that would support you in that
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:54.860]   decision.
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:55.860]   Awesome.
[00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:56.860]   Well, I appreciate that.
[00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:57.860]   I appreciate your different thoughts on this.
[00:41:57.860 --> 00:41:58.860]   Good.
[00:41:58.860 --> 00:41:59.860]   My pleasure.
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:03.900]   All right, Kevin, thank you for calling in.
[00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:06.860]   We go now to looks like Phillip in Louisiana.
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:07.860]   Phillip, welcome to the show.
[00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:08.860]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:09.860]   Hey, hi.
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:10.860]   Can you hear me?
[00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:11.860]   Sounds good.
[00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:12.860]   Phillip, go ahead.
[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:13.860]   Hey.
[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:19.020]   I don't know if you remember me, but we spoke two years ago.
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:22.700]   It was a paid session, but I was 28 then.
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:27.740]   I worked for two years, and I just put in my credit cards and my student loans.
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:31.100]   And I guess I was deciding back then.
[00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:40.940]   I told my parents, 40K, I was deciding back then whether to pay them or to start investing.
[00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:47.700]   And I guess you gave me advice to pay them with the same fervor as I paid the government
[00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:48.700]   and the other lenders.
[00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:50.220]   And so I did that.
[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:54.340]   And I guess it's two years later, and I'm out of debt, completely out of debt now.
[00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:55.340]   Congratulations, dude.
[00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:56.340]   That's awesome.
[00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:57.340]   Well done.
[00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:58.340]   Thanks.
[00:42:58.340 --> 00:42:59.340]   Yeah.
[00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:03.540]   So my last check to them, Wednesday, 10K check.
[00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:07.900]   And so I'm basically almost at zero right now.
[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:13.060]   I have 2.5K somewhere around in places.
[00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:18.380]   But I guess I was just looking at plans for the future.
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:25.740]   And I know you've mentioned a lot of times about, like you were saying, if I didn't do
[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:33.660]   it over again when you were sitting, you would buy a house, I guess, every year, just accumulate
[00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:34.660]   assets.
[00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:39.460]   And so I was just basically wondering about that strategy of, I guess, buying a house
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:40.460]   every year.
[00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:45.060]   Let's say if I want to do that in the next six months when my lease expires.
[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:52.140]   I was just wondering about that strategy and any other advice you have on building wealth.
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:54.980]   From today's calls, we're going to have to change the name of the show to Radical Real
[00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:55.980]   Estate.
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:59.820]   This is the third call in a row that we've spoken about real estate.
[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:00.820]   Interesting.
[00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:04.620]   So you are currently 28 years old, and you are unmarried, no children?
[00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:07.180]   No, I'm 30 now.
[00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:08.180]   Okay.
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:14.380]   So your number one goal at this point in time, now that you've gotten out of debt, congratulations.
[00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:16.700]   First thing is don't go back into debt.
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:21.420]   Make a commitment that with the exception of an investment asset, you're not going to
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:22.980]   go back into debt.
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:27.140]   Because if you will commit that to yourself, you will always maintain your flexibility
[00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:28.140]   and your freedom.
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:33.740]   You'll lose some flexibility and freedom borrowing money on investment assets such as real estate.
[00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:37.300]   But at least there, if you ever want out, and you're thoughtful and careful, if you
[00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:41.020]   ever want out, you can just simply sell the house and pay off your debt.
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:46.380]   So at this point in time in your financial plan, you now have two primary goals.
[00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:50.580]   Goal number one is to increase your income massively.
[00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:56.580]   That has got to be your primary focus is how can I increase my income massively?
[00:44:56.580 --> 00:45:00.540]   Far more important than buying real estate, far more important than investing at this
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:07.140]   stage of your life is generating a very, very high income from work that you care about,
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:10.740]   with people that you like, under conditions that you enjoy.
[00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:14.140]   You don't have to choose a bad job just because it makes a lot of money, but you need to choose
[00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:19.440]   a good job or a good business that you're well suited for and put your focus on massively
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:21.980]   increasing your income.
[00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:25.380]   Prior to coronavirus this year, what was your income expected to be?
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:28.780]   What's still the same?
[00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:30.420]   My job is pretty stable.
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:32.620]   I basically work in a pension.
[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:34.300]   I'm an actuary.
[00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:37.500]   I'm certified.
[00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:40.020]   My job isn't going anywhere really.
[00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:42.540]   I make 100K, I guess.
[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:44.540]   I just got a raise, like land.
[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:45.540]   Congrats.
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:46.540]   Good.
[00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:47.540]   Yeah.
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:57.660]   So my expected, I guess going into the future, my salary right now is I think 98K.
[00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:01.420]   It was 88 at the start of this year, so I guess this year I'll probably make around
[00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:06.020]   95K total plus bonus.
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:11.140]   And how much are your living expenses?
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:19.500]   My apartment is around 1200, including water, but I guess utilities, electricity are add-on
[00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:20.500]   expenses.
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:25.060]   So add everything, as far as internet or whatever, it might be around 1400.
[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:29.340]   Besides from that, I don't have any other expenses.
[00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:34.260]   I have two old cars that I fix whenever one breaks.
[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.460]   They're both 20 years old.
[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:40.820]   One's a 99, I think, CRV.
[00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:43.900]   Another one's a 2002 Honda CRV.
[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:44.900]   So let me cut you off for a moment.
[00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:45.900]   I live pretty frugally.
[00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:46.900]   Good.
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:47.900]   All right.
[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:50.740]   So what that means, if you live pretty frugally, if you've got $100,000 income and you've got
[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:55.340]   to say $30,000 a year of personal expenses, then you should be able to save after taxes
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:57.580]   something like 40 to 50 grand a year.
[00:46:57.580 --> 00:46:58.580]   Does that sound about right?
[00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:01.820]   Yeah, if I really push it, yeah.
[00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:02.900]   All right.
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:06.180]   So if you can save 40 to 50,000 dollars a year, you're doing awesome.
[00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:10.460]   And that's going to quickly allow you to pile up money for investing.
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:13.380]   So back to kind of my guidelines.
[00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:16.500]   Number one, most important thing is increase your income.
[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:20.180]   And so congratulations for making a six-figure income.
[00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:24.560]   You should still look at that and study your career and study your income and ask yourself,
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:30.020]   how can I 10x my income over the next 10 years with career moves that I'm going to be excited
[00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:31.020]   about?
[00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:35.580]   How can I 10x my income over the next 10 years with career moves that I'm going to be genuinely
[00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:36.580]   excited about?
[00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:40.420]   I'm not trying to get you into a job that you don't like just because it makes a lot
[00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:44.580]   of money, but very few people ever set out an income goal.
[00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:47.660]   And that's why very few people actually make a lot of money.
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:52.740]   So the first thing you can do is set an income goal that you have and then work on how you
[00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:57.140]   can achieve it in a way that upgrades your lifestyle, in a way that gives you something
[00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:58.320]   really exciting.
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:02.300]   Because if you can go from 100,000 dollars a year to a million dollars a year and you
[00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:08.620]   can keep a 30 or 50 or 70,000 dollar a year expense ratio, it's a lot easier to get wealthy
[00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:09.620]   really quickly.
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:10.620]   Agreed?
[00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:11.620]   Agreed.
[00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:12.620]   I get it.
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:13.620]   All right.
[00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:14.620]   You're an actuary.
[00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:15.620]   You run the numbers.
[00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:18.940]   Imagine that you go from 100,000 dollars a year to a million dollars a year.
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:21.700]   It's a lot easier to get wealthy really quickly.
[00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:23.340]   So think about that.
[00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:26.860]   Now you don't have to always do that, okay?
[00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:28.700]   But you do have to think about it.
[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:31.540]   You may come to a point where you say, "I've got a great job.
[00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:33.340]   I'm really well suited for this job.
[00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:34.780]   I really like it."
[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:39.700]   And you may come to a point where you turn aside from a goal of always increasing your
[00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:45.740]   income because you've decided that for right now what you're doing is the best for you.
[00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:49.600]   But from a wealth building perspective, before you ever think about investing, you should
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:51.760]   go back and look at your income.
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:57.180]   Because investments in your income are almost always the best investments you can possibly
[00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:59.220]   make.
[00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:00.660]   So don't forget about that.
[00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:04.340]   Just because you got your actuary certifications, just because you got a college degree, just
[00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:07.980]   because you did that doesn't mean that you should stop investing in your income.
[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:12.140]   If you'll go from $100,000 a year to a million dollars a year, it'll be a lot easier to become
[00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:13.140]   wealthy.
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:14.140]   Now, number two.
[00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:16.220]   Number two is you keep your expenses low.
[00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:17.300]   And so you're doing a great job.
[00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:22.340]   And so going forward, if you will maintain your low expenses, especially while you are
[00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:27.300]   single, especially while you're in this situation where you are flexible, if you'll keep your
[00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:31.040]   low expenses, you will pile up income massively.
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:33.980]   You haven't had a chance yet because you've been paying off the debt.
[00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:39.460]   You haven't had a chance yet to experience the joy of saving $40,000 or $50,000 in a
[00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:40.460]   year.
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:44.860]   But it's awesome because now that you've gotten your income up to six figures and you keep
[00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:50.340]   your expenses low, you can go to a point of saving $40,000 or $50,000 in a year, which
[00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:55.060]   means that your worlds open up in a way that you haven't experienced yet.
[00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:59.780]   And this is what's so frustrating about kind of your 20s is that the modern concept, and
[00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:01.260]   I don't remember all the details of your situation.
[00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:02.340]   I'm speaking generally.
[00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:06.540]   But in general, what many 30 year olds would have experienced is that you go through this
[00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:10.740]   rough, tough, expensive period of life.
[00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:13.100]   You graduate from high school, you got no money and they say, go to college.
[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:15.000]   You go to college, you start borrowing money.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:20.460]   Maybe you take out some credit cards or you just do stupid stuff and you go into debt.
[00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:23.060]   You have student loans and then you finally get out of college.
[00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:25.420]   You get your first job and it's an entry level job.
[00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:29.460]   So you're not making a ton, but then you work at it and you increase your certifications.
[00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:30.820]   You're taking lots of extra classes.
[00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:35.500]   You're passing actuary exams and then boom, finally, now you got $100,000, but you want
[00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:39.580]   a year of income, but you only got $2,500 to your name because you've been working to
[00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:40.860]   pay off debt.
[00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:45.580]   That makes you far ahead of many other people, but you haven't yet had the joy of piling
[00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:46.580]   up money.
[00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:51.820]   And so the next step is keep your expenses low and experience the joy of piling up money.
[00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:54.980]   If you need to upgrade anything in your life, that's a really big deal.
[00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:58.020]   You need a car that's a little bit better or something like that.
[00:50:58.020 --> 00:50:59.380]   Make a note of that.
[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:01.980]   But keep your expenses low so you can save money.
[00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:05.840]   And then the most important thing when you're moving to investing is saving money, is having
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:07.460]   investment dollars.
[00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:11.540]   But at the beginning of an investment career, the thing that drives your results is not
[00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:13.900]   the rate of return that you can earn on your investments.
[00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:17.380]   It's the amount of money that you can save for investing.
[00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:19.940]   And that's driven by income and expenses.
[00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:20.940]   So you're doing awesome.
[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:22.260]   Keep up that good work.
[00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:26.180]   Now let's assume that you've decided that real estate is a good fit for you.
[00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:29.140]   You shouldn't necessarily decide that hastily.
[00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:34.700]   I still believe that for the majority of people, if you have an inclination towards some form
[00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:39.180]   of entrepreneurship, if you have an inclination towards something like that where you can
[00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:44.340]   move into a job where you have more responsibility, where you can profit from it more, it's be
[00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:49.180]   far more profitable for you to do that than to just simply own real estate.
[00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:52.220]   But if you've decided that you're settled in your job, you're settled in your career,
[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:56.900]   this is a good fit for you, then real estate is a really good mixture of a business and
[00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:58.080]   an investment.
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:03.540]   And so the nomad strategy that you're alluding to is dirt simple.
[00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:07.900]   Basically you buy a house and you just buy the house just like a standard house.
[00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:09.740]   You buy a house.
[00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:15.180]   You go around, you look around, you find a house, you get a mortgage and you buy a house
[00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:16.180]   and you move into the house.
[00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:17.180]   Then you can house hack it.
[00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:20.340]   If you're single and 30 years old, it works really well.
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:23.100]   Get a couple of buddies, buy a three bedroom house.
[00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:26.740]   Maybe your mortgage payment is going to be $1,500 a month, but get two buddies that you
[00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:32.020]   rent out two rooms to for $650 a month including utilities and that covers you and drops your
[00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:38.500]   personal living expenses from $1,400 a month down to maybe $400 a month or $500 a month,
[00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:41.820]   something like that because you took the risk of buying the house.
[00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:48.740]   So you buy a house, you live in it and then after a year, you'll have satisfied the requirements
[00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:50.360]   of a residential mortgage.
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:52.580]   Then you go ahead and you buy another one.
[00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:55.820]   So you buy another house and you rent out your first house and you move into the second
[00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:58.100]   one and you get your buddies to move with you.
[00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:00.900]   You say, "Listen guys, I know it's a hassle to move, but I got another great house.
[00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:01.900]   Would you come with me?
[00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:03.140]   I'll move your stuff for you.
[00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:05.180]   I'll pay for the mover so it's not such a big deal."
[00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:07.700]   You move them in with you and you rent out the first house.
[00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:11.140]   And then basically you repeat that as often as you want.
[00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:16.260]   You can buy more houses other than what you're just living in, but the once a year kind of
[00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:20.260]   scenario works really naturally and if you need a place to live anyway, it works out
[00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:21.260]   really well.
[00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:27.660]   The great thing about that system is that you can just do traditional residential financing.
[00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:29.620]   You're buying a house as an owner-occupant.
[00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:30.620]   It's a little easier.
[00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:32.480]   It's just what you're accustomed to.
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:36.340]   But if you do that for about five years and you pick up something like five rental houses,
[00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:40.700]   then you get yourself in a situation where you're 35 and now maybe you're married, maybe
[00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:42.100]   you got a baby or something like that.
[00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:44.940]   You say, "Okay, now I'll go ahead and pick the house that I want to live in."
[00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:48.660]   So you move again and you move into the house that you're going to live in for a while.
[00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:53.540]   And then you just fast forward and you let your tenants pay off those mortgages for you.
[00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:59.060]   And if your tenants pay off your mortgages for you over a course of 20, 25, 30 years,
[00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:03.580]   then 20, 25, 30 years from now, you're sitting there with a paid off real estate portfolio
[00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:09.380]   that may be making you, if you got five houses at $1,500 per month, you've got a gross income
[00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:16.020]   of something like $7,500 a month and now you're by most considerations financially independent,
[00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:18.580]   financially free based upon your real estate income.
[00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:27.380]   And so based upon your numbers, if you can earn $100,000, pay $25,000 of tax, that gives
[00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:29.220]   you $75,000.
[00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:34.340]   If you can live on $30,000, that leaves $40,000 available for investing.
[00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:40.020]   If you can save $40,000, then every year you can make a down payment on a house, a $30,000
[00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:44.980]   or $40,000 down payment on a house if necessary, depending on what your local market is like.
[00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:49.100]   And so you can comfortably save the money for a new down payment every single year.
[00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:55.020]   And what you got to make sure of is that the whole portfolio cash flows along the way where
[00:54:55.020 --> 00:55:01.220]   your rental income is at least as much more than your mortgage payment and other expenses
[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:04.020]   as possible so that you have some safety.
[00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:07.740]   But as long as the portfolio cash flows and as long as you have the ability in the case
[00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:11.660]   of an emergency, right, coronavirus comes along and all of a sudden you got to just
[00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:15.860]   pay all your mortgages out of pocket, then you have the ability to do that out of your
[00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:17.020]   income and out of your cash flow.
[00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:18.740]   So that's the basic strategy.
[00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:23.540]   And if you'll do that and commit to that for a few years, it can be extraordinarily productive
[00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:28.660]   because once you own the houses, now you need to manage them, but your tenants are now paying
[00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:33.500]   off your mortgages for you and your houses may increase in value.
[00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:37.940]   What is frequently the case is let's say you buy a portfolio of five or six houses, you
[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:43.620]   fast forward 10 or 15 years, your mortgages are paid down, but maybe all your houses have
[00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:45.420]   appreciated in value.
[00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:49.500]   And so what you do is you sell one or two of the houses that you don't like anymore.
[00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:55.320]   And by the way, the little hack that I mentioned to the previous caller about moving into it,
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:56:01.180]   if you're still flexible enough and you can move into one of those houses, you move into
[00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:04.500]   one of the houses, you live there for a couple of years, and then you go ahead and sell it
[00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:09.420]   and take the exclusion on the sale of the gain, $250,000 for a single person, $500,000
[00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:10.420]   for a married couple.
[00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:15.380]   You go ahead and sell that house, take that tax-free capital gain if you moved into it.
[00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:19.300]   Otherwise, go ahead and sell the house and pay the tax, and then you pay off the mortgages
[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:20.860]   on a couple of the other ones.
[00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:25.980]   And so if property prices appreciate, which is a possibility, it's not a guarantee and
[00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:29.540]   you don't want to depend on it, but it's a good distinct possibility if you're really
[00:56:29.540 --> 00:56:33.700]   wise with where you buy and when you buy, if property prices appreciate, then you can
[00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:38.660]   get yourself in a situation where a 15-year plan is very reasonable, where you pay off
[00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:41.580]   a couple of the houses, they appreciate enough that you can finish paying off the mortgages,
[00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:46.460]   and now you're left with three or four houses completely debt-free because you used appreciation
[00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:48.460]   to pay off the rest of them.
[00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:53.500]   And so a plan like that is a very reliable plan towards financial independence at an
[00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:59.300]   early age, and it complements really well a high, stable income because the high, stable
[00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:01.300]   income makes it easy for you to plan.
[00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:04.420]   And so if you put those three pieces together, keep your income high and work on getting
[00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:09.780]   it higher, keep your expenses low and keep them low, and then number three, invest aggressively
[00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:14.260]   into something that's well-suited for you, then you're on the fast track to financial
[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:15.260]   independence.
[00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:16.260]   Awesome.
[00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:17.260]   Definitely.
[00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:18.260]   Yeah.
[00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:25.780]   I guess my goal, I guess, is to, I guess, is stability.
[00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:35.340]   I guess more than it is, I guess, just like, I guess, trying to maximize my income.
[00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:40.660]   What do you mean by stability?
[00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:46.340]   I figure just having, I guess, only three houses, renting those out, that'll run with
[00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:49.860]   them stability, I guess, in any situation.
[00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:56.900]   I mean, as far as what I do, I don't mind what I do, but I think my goal would be to
[00:57:56.900 --> 00:58:05.380]   teach or do something more hands-on than, I guess, just stare at a screen for like 30
[00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:06.380]   years or something.
[00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:07.380]   Sure.
[00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:08.380]   Sure.
[00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:13.900]   Well, at this point in time, the best thing right now in the middle of this current emergency,
[00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:14.900]   keep your job, right?
[00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:18.620]   Even if you don't like your job, keep your job and save some money.
[00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:23.180]   So, get as quickly as you can to several tens of thousands of dollars in savings and enjoy
[00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:27.380]   what that feels like of having tens of thousands of dollars of savings.
[00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:31.140]   If you're not sure kind of about what's next, just save money, save money and look forward
[00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:33.060]   to the future and work on those plans.
[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:34.060]   You have the ability.
[00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:36.180]   So, if at any point in time you decide, "You know what?
[00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:37.340]   I don't want to be an actuary.
[00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:38.340]   I want to be a teacher."
[00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:41.940]   Well, now that you're out of debt, you have the ability to pivot and do that.
[00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:43.780]   You can do that in any context.
[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:46.620]   So, that's what getting out of debt bought for you.
[00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:48.300]   It bought you freedom.
[00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:52.820]   And so, I want you to enjoy that freedom and to go in the direction of the life and the
[00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:56.120]   lifestyle that you'll be happiest with.
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:59:00.940]   If you're not sure if you're going to continue in your career, then slow that plan down that
[00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:01.940]   I said.
[00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:03.860]   You know, slow it down.
[00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:07.860]   But if you want to continue your career and you keep your income up, then that plan is
[00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:09.400]   very, very feasible.
[00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:13.580]   And as long as you can save some money first, you need to save money and have it to do the
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:14.820]   plan to be a real estate investor.
[00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:17.820]   You need to have the ability to absorb unexpected expenses.
[00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:19.540]   You've got to have cash.
[00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:23.580]   You've got to have the ability to absorb three empty houses in a month because nobody's paying
[00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:25.760]   because they all got laid off from coronavirus.
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:28.540]   You've got to have the ability to pay for a new AC.
[00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:29.580]   You've got to have cash.
[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:33.380]   And so, you need to take some time and study this out and think it out.
[00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:36.900]   But I'm not going to say to you, you've got to just prioritize money if you've got a different
[00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:39.200]   dream.
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:41.740]   But I guess in closing, save money.
[00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:43.140]   Congratulations for getting out of debt.
[00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:47.420]   Save some cash and then we'll see where we go from here.
[00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:49.100]   All right, we'll go to Brittany in Texas.
[00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:50.100]   Brittany, welcome to the show.
[00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:51.100]   How can I serve you today?
[00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:52.100]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:53.100]   Thanks for taking the call.
[00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:54.100]   My pleasure.
[00:59:54.100 --> 01:00:04.460]   So, I wanted to talk to you really about starting a business and doing that while being a W2
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:07.780]   employee, something that's always been kind of knowledge.
[01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:12.380]   And I really appreciate your transparency and monetizing knowledge work, what you've done
[01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:17.180]   to pivot over the years to try different models of doing that.
[01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:24.700]   And just wanted to discuss your thoughts on really everything from narrowing your market,
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:27.660]   finding your client base and monetizing knowledge work.
[01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:28.660]   Okay.
[01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:33.500]   Do you want to ask a question or you just want to kind of a monologue on it?
[01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:38.100]   I'll give you a context maybe for a monologue.
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:39.100]   Please.
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:40.100]   I do like your monologue.
[01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:41.460]   So, I'm a W2 employee.
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:43.020]   I work in corporate finance.
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:47.700]   Also, very passionate about personal finance.
[01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:52.300]   And I'm working towards having a few certifications that I think could help kind of prevent imposter
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:57.980]   syndrome and validate the background to help with small business consulting.
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:03.300]   Specifically, a CMA, certified management accountant, MBA, I'm currently a candidate
[01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:08.540]   and a CTP, certified treasury professional.
[01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:11.660]   And my background is a degree in finance and international business.
[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:19.220]   Married, no kids, W2 employee at a large multinational corporate, we'll say.
[01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:23.620]   And wanted your discussion around the value of adding letters, especially whenever trying
[01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:29.020]   to break into consulting work or a new industry.
[01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:31.980]   And then also just kind of around clarifying that business idea.
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:32.980]   What does that look like?
[01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:33.980]   Do you have good resources?
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:38.540]   You've recommended a lot of great books over the years.
[01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:40.580]   And then also how to differentiate.
[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:44.460]   Highly compensated for my existing work.
[01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:48.500]   Investing in my current career versus investing in starting a business from a time and energy
[01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:53.540]   perspective because I could see my life going either way.
[01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:58.100]   Moving up in the corporate world, starting my own business and allowing that to grow
[01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:03.140]   or even moving to a smaller company and having a larger role, say, as treasurer or CFO.
[01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:04.140]   How old are you?
[01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:05.140]   I'm 28.
[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:06.140]   Okay.
[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:15.240]   Well, I'll give you a couple of things to think about that I think are important.
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:21.580]   Number one, the most important thing when starting a business, in my opinion, is clearly
[01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:30.540]   identifying a specific customer that you can market to.
[01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:35.620]   And that I think is the hard part because generally you don't want to narrow down.
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:41.420]   But you've got to identify a specific customer that you can market to.
[01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:46.100]   And so if you're going to go out and build a knowledge business, the question is who
[01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:48.820]   specifically are you targeting?
[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:51.300]   Who are you going after?
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:57.620]   And if you cannot identify one person specifically, then it's very hard to make enough noise in
[01:02:57.620 --> 01:03:00.080]   the marketplace to reach that person.
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:05.380]   And so I'll use, you've listened to my work and you've made complimentary comments.
[01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:09.780]   I could not start Radical Personal Finance today and have it succeed because it's too
[01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:10.780]   general.
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:11.980]   I could not do it.
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:13.380]   The marketplace is too crowded.
[01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:14.740]   The brand is too broad.
[01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:15.740]   It's too general.
[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:17.380]   I could not do it today.
[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:22.340]   If I were starting over today with some kind of personal finance brand, the only way that
[01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:27.580]   I would be able to find enough listeners to make a difference is to narrowly identify
[01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:31.640]   one specific segment that I'm trying to help.
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:38.520]   Now I can expand out after that, but what you see if you compare, if I compare my brand
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:46.400]   to some other brands in my space, that brands that are more narrowly focused are far more
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:47.400]   successful.
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:52.380]   So for example, the work that Jonathan and Brad do at Choose Fi, their brand has gone
[01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:53.380]   through the roof.
[01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:55.900]   It's far bigger than mine is now.
[01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:58.440]   I had them on Radical Personal Finance right when they were getting started.
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:01.600]   I like to think that I kind of helped give them a push and sent a few listeners their
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:07.000]   way, but their brand is far bigger than mine is now because they chose one specific niche.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.880]   They chose the financial independence niche.
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:14.520]   And so that's a good example because when people go looking for financial independence,
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:16.760]   they're now referable to that.
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:19.100]   And so the same thing happens in your business.
[01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:23.420]   Any brand you're going to start, whether it's consulting with people from a corporate finance
[01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:27.440]   perspective or a personal finance, you have to be focused on a niche.
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:32.840]   If I tried to start again today with Radical Personal Finance, it would be a complete failure
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:35.000]   because no one would find me.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   No one would find me fast enough and my brand is too non-referable.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.080]   It's like, "Well, what's the show about?"
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:44.640]   "Well, Joshua talks about stocks sometimes and real estate.
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:49.560]   He does these Q&A calls and he talks about modern portfolio theory."
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:50.560]   How do you describe it?
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:51.560]   Right?
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:55.400]   If they're my listening base, if they're my listeners, they really like it.
[01:04:55.400 --> 01:05:00.200]   But the reason that I got it started was because when I started, it was a timing thing.
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:03.880]   There was a broad market, there was an empty market, and I knew that there was an opportunity
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:07.160]   for someone to come into that market and that's what I wanted to build.
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:09.560]   I didn't want to be bored left, right, and center.
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:13.560]   I used to own all these domain names for these very niche podcasts like Backup Plans.
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:18.520]   I had Social Security Podcast and Podcasting for Financial Advice, all these different
[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:22.680]   brands that I had lined up that I could go with because they were better marketing fits
[01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:25.200]   but I didn't really want to do them.
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:31.040]   But the point is, be honest about your market and recognize that what works for somebody
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:34.120]   at a certain point doesn't work for everybody along the way.
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:40.120]   The key is to be able to niche down to the point where when your prospective customer
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:43.140]   hears you, they immediately know you're talking to them.
[01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:47.440]   As specific as you possibly can be is the key.
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:51.520]   That helps you with step number two is how to find the customer.
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:55.560]   One of the biggest problems that you face with a business is where are you going to
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.160]   find your customer.
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:00.640]   If you don't know who your customer is, you don't know where to find them.
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:04.480]   If you're focused on CEOs, that's too broad, right, because you don't know where to find
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:05.480]   CEOs.
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:06.480]   Is it CEO magazine?
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:12.400]   But there's a big difference between CEOs of Fortune 100 companies versus CEOs of plumbing
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:15.720]   businesses in small town rural America.
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:20.120]   Both of those are CEOs and I can find both of those people if I've got a business that
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:22.960]   can serve them but I can't find CEOs.
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:25.360]   That's just too broad.
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:29.720]   Once you can identify who your customer is, that allows you to go and find them with your
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:30.720]   marketing message.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:34.600]   Then when they hear about your content, they hear about your blog, they hear about your
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:38.520]   brand, they hear about your podcast, they read about the title of your book, they say
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:39.720]   "That's me."
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:42.160]   You want them to immediately say "That's me.
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.160]   That's me.
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.160]   That's what I want.
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:45.160]   That's me."
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:50.040]   That to me is your single most important thing is to clearly identify who you want to work
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:54.600]   with, have some sense of kind of how you're going to work with them so that you can go
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:55.880]   and find them.
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:59.120]   And then once you can find them and start putting stuff in front of them, then you can
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:01.920]   start listening to them and see what they want.
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:04.920]   And then you just give them what they want.
[01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:08.840]   But you've got to begin with who do I want to find and then listen to them of what do
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:09.840]   they want.
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:13.520]   Now, to your question on like designations and whatnot.
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:17.920]   Designations might be important, but I think they're most important for you, not for your
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:18.920]   customers.
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:20.360]   I have a lot of designations.
[01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:21.360]   I used to have more.
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:23.000]   I've dropped several of my designations.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.360]   I haven't maintained my CFP designation in a number of years.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.520]   There was a time in my life when that was really important to me.
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:33.200]   I keep meaning to call the CFP board and go ahead and go through the reinstatement process,
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:38.480]   but it's just it doesn't matter to me anymore because I am at a place where I know I'm more
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:41.640]   confident in who I am and what I know.
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:45.600]   Whereas when I go back when I first started studying for the CFP exam, I didn't have that
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:50.200]   confidence and I didn't know what I didn't know and I was scared of everybody and I just
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:51.880]   didn't know like how can I help.
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:59.400]   And so for me, the process of designating up was probably more about me than it was
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.760]   about my customers and my clients.
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:03.600]   Do people respect designations?
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:07.680]   I think sometimes, but I have no idea what a CTP is.
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:08.920]   You know, I'm in the finance business.
[01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:11.560]   I've never heard of a CTP designation.
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:16.320]   And so if you handed me a business card that says Britney, you know, CMA, MBA, CTP, the
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:20.280]   only one of those that I know about is the MBA because that's a famous one.
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:24.720]   But if it says MBA, I don't know if it's an MBA from a big fancy prestigious school or
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:28.520]   if it's an MBA from an online night thing that you did in three months.
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:29.760]   I have no idea.
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:36.960]   And so the beauty of content marketing is that you can shine through and depend on the
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:41.420]   value of your ideas far more than the value of your designations.
[01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:43.940]   And to me, that's the beauty of content marketing.
[01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:49.840]   If I could have as a financial advisor, if my firm had allowed me to build media the
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:55.180]   way that I build it now, I would have had a huge business because people can assess
[01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:57.580]   who I am by hearing me speak.
[01:08:57.580 --> 01:09:02.120]   And to me, that's a far better resume than the number of titles on my business card.
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:04.400]   So are designations valuable?
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:06.060]   I think they're valuable.
[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:09.980]   To me, the biggest value of designations is it makes it easier to get a job.
[01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:15.360]   So one of the reasons why I keep meaning to go ahead and reinstate my CFP, one of the
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:19.160]   reasons why I have those designations is just simply what if I go bankrupt?
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:25.520]   You know, if I go bankrupt and I need a job with my, you know, Joshua J. Sheets, CFP,
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:30.880]   CLU, CHFC, you know, CASL, RHE, REBC, CAP.
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:36.180]   I think like when I put that on a resume, I can put that resume in any stack and there's
[01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:41.320]   nobody that has more designations than I do other than Michael Kitsis probably now.
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:45.920]   But you know, I can put that resume in a stack and they're going to look at it carefully
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:49.640]   because they're going to say, "Well, I know Michael Kitsis has as many designations as
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:52.800]   Joshua does, so let me at least talk to him."
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:56.480]   So that's how I see designations.
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:57.480]   Designations do two things for you.
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:01.440]   Number one, they may increase your confidence and cause you to just feel more confident
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:04.400]   in the marketplace and that's infectious.
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:08.600]   When you feel confident, your clients will absorb that.
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:12.680]   And so if you need those designations in order to feel confident, get them.
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:15.000]   And then number two, is there a great backup plan?
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:21.160]   They make it easier for you to get hired for a job if you just got to make your resume
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:22.920]   stand out in a stack of papers.
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:26.280]   But do you need designations for content production?
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:31.760]   Probably not because when you're doing content, you have the ability to just simply rely on
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:36.400]   the quality of your ideas rather than relying on your designations.
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:39.920]   All right, that's helpful.
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:47.040]   Do you have any guidance on what to consider whenever thinking about managing your energy
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:52.880]   between growing your current income, you know, if you have a highly compensated W2 career
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:58.480]   versus the potential returns on a nascent business?
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:00.520]   I guess there's probably two ways to do it.
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:03.760]   Number one is what are you excited about?
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:08.640]   So if you're really excited about the W2 career, then I don't think you walk away from it.
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:09.840]   You focus on it.
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:14.160]   If you've got a lot of room to run, let's say you're making $200,000 a year, but you
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:19.320]   see that this W2 career could go to $800,000 a year with the right moves and you'd be excited
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:21.560]   about that, that's a big, big move.
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:25.800]   And I think that a lot of times it's a lot easier to do that in a career than it is starting
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:26.800]   a business.
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:31.160]   Business, when you're starting a side business and a content business, it takes a while to
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:32.240]   get your legs under you.
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:36.880]   And so from a financial perspective, if I'm advising you as a financial advisor, unless
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:42.020]   you hate your job, I'm going to say what opportunity do you really have here in your day job and
[01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:44.200]   let's not just despise it.
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:54.240]   Because five years of major income growth from you being 28 years old, from 28 to 35,
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:57.640]   seven years and you can add an extra hundred or a couple hundred thousand dollars with
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:04.400]   some right moves on your W2 job, you'll probably make more money doing that than building up
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:07.100]   a new business, especially if you're starting from scratch.
[01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:11.560]   And so I don't want you to walk away from your job unless you hate it, unless it's just
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:12.560]   terrible.
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:13.560]   In which case, all right, fine.
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:14.560]   You can convince me.
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:17.400]   But from a financial perspective, if you're okay at your day job, good.
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:25.060]   So give that puppy some time to run because being able to make a lot of money on somebody
[01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:28.680]   else's risk is awesome.
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:33.600]   And if your expenses are low and you can save a lot, that can set you up for financial independence
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:36.520]   and can make starting a business far easier.
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:38.680]   I bootstrapped all my businesses.
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:42.240]   But let me tell you, I don't ever want to bootstrap a business again.
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:45.200]   There's a place and a time for bootstrapping and I'm into it.
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:47.480]   Like, hey, I'm not going to sit around and waste time.
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:51.160]   But I don't ever want to bootstrap a business again because man, it's a lot of work.
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:55.520]   And the older that I get, the more I start to feel like a creaky old man when I'm like,
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:57.160]   I don't know if I could do it again.
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:58.640]   I don't know if I have the energy.
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.240]   I don't know if I have the enthusiasm.
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:02.360]   I don't know if I have the passion.
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:05.280]   You know, there were times when I was a new financial advisor, I was in my office at 4
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:06.280]   a.m.
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:11.080]   There were times I was leaving my office at 2 a.m. and just because I had the energy.
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:12.360]   Today, I couldn't do it.
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:17.160]   Now, I'd like to think that I could still be really effective because I got a little
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:19.560]   bit more wisdom now and a little bit more confidence.
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:25.160]   And so what I didn't have at 23, I do have now, which would make a difference.
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:31.000]   But I also, I increasingly kind of feel that question of, I wonder if I could still do
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000]   this.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.360]   You know, right now in the stage of life that I am, I can't do 70 hours a week.
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:37.360]   I can't.
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:41.520]   I've got too, it would cost too much in my life for me to do 70 hours a week.
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.440]   So I got to be effective on 40.
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:48.120]   But you're still, you know, in that stage where you can do both.
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:51.440]   So I would not run away from a W-2 income.
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:55.280]   What I would try to do is I would think about a strategy that allows me to do both.
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:59.560]   And so take an honest assessment of the new business and say, how much time can the new
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:00.800]   business produce?
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:08.280]   How much effort, you know, how much can I do with the new business?
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:10.680]   And can I make it work on 10 hours a week?
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.480]   Can I make it work on 15 hours a week?
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:16.960]   So if you do 40 to 50 at your day job and you can do 10 to 20 on your side job, I think
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:18.520]   that's really reasonable.
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:25.800]   I think 60 hours a week is, 60 to 70 is a really reasonable, consistent work week that
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:27.840]   you can do as a single woman.
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:32.400]   And so if the numbers would work that you can be effective enough at your day job with
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:38.400]   40 to 50 hours and you can be effective enough with your night job with 10 to 20, I think
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.400]   something like that would be good.
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:43.800]   And it'll give it time to see if the side business has legs.
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:48.800]   I would never advocate, so what I did, I do not recommend.
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:51.120]   I had to leave financial services.
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.640]   I had to close my business.
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:55.480]   I had to walk away from a lot of money.
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:56.560]   I lost pensions.
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:58.600]   I walked away from residual income.
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:01.640]   I walked away from all of it.
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:06.400]   But that was exclusively because of the stupidity of the financial services industry and the
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:08.640]   onerous regulations.
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:12.040]   In any other industry, I think that's a foolish move.
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:18.240]   I think that unless it's absolutely required, do not walk away from the cash cow until you're
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:21.600]   sure that the side business has legs and you're really sure you want to do it.
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:26.680]   And to me, a good metric of being sure is how much am I willing to work on this early
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:29.680]   in the morning, late at night, on the weekend, etc.
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:32.120]   How much am I really willing to work on it?
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:35.120]   Because if you're willing to work on it a lot and it starts to show some legs and starts
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:39.620]   to show some financial potential, then you'll feel good about walking away from the day
[01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:41.480]   job because you're really excited about it.
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:45.400]   But if you find that you're too tired and you're not going to build up the side thing,
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:48.760]   well then, now you know that probably better to stick with the day job and make the money
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:49.760]   there.
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:51.800]   All right, that's helpful.
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:55.680]   Last question, where can we sign up?
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:16:00.800]   I know you do some one-on-one consulting, but I don't recall how to sign up.
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:01.800]   Email me.
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:02.800]   Joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:03.800]   Email me.
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:04.800]   It's not on the website.
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:05.800]   You have to email me for details.
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:06.800]   Great.
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:07.800]   Thank you.
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:08.800]   Thank you, Brittany.
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:09.800]   All right.
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:11.880]   We are going to do something that Joshua is not very good at.
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:16.400]   I've got four callers on the line and I've got about 10 minutes that I have to wrap up.
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:17.560]   So we're going to do rapid fire.
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:19.640]   So we go to Pottstown, Pennsylvania.
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:20.640]   Welcome to the show.
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:21.640]   Go fast with your question.
[01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:23.760]   We're going to do rapid fire and you can call back next week for more conversation.
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:24.760]   Hey, Joshua.
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:25.760]   Go ahead.
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:26.760]   Can you hear me?
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:27.760]   Yep.
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:28.760]   Go fast.
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:29.760]   Okay.
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:30.760]   I just was curious.
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:37.240]   Based on your advice like 45 days ago, you were like, "Hey, stock up.
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:38.240]   Get ready.
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:39.240]   Be ready for this kind of stuff."
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:44.040]   And I still see problems in the supply chain and you read about stuff about new packing
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:45.840]   places closing down and things like that.
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:50.320]   How do you evaluate that sort of information and know what kind of moves you might want
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:52.800]   to make in this kind of weird time right now?
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:53.800]   Got it.
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:57.520]   You think about what's in your life, what you actually need, and you think about what
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:02.200]   the risk to you would be if you weren't prepared for it and then you move accordingly.
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:08.640]   So nothing has fundamentally changed in the last 45 days that would make me more optimistic.
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:12.720]   The specific concern is that it's progressing slowly.
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:16.640]   And so what you do is you say, "What's the cost to me of stocking up?
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:18.760]   What's the cost to me of being prepared?"
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:23.160]   And with things like food or shortages in the supply chain, the cost is basically nothing.
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:28.000]   You simply buy the stuff that you're going to use anyway and you stockpile the stuff
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.000]   that you're going to use anyway.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.900]   And that way you're protected if everything goes bad.
[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:35.640]   But yet if nothing goes bad, you still use the stuff.
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:40.340]   That's why stockpiling is such an absurdly simple strategy and it's always the right
[01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:42.660]   move because it works both ways.
[01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:44.320]   You don't have to be right.
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:48.520]   And so if you're pessimistic about shortages in the supply chain, you're pessimistic about
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:53.160]   meat disappearing off the shelves, you're looking around and you're reading a story
[01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:55.360]   and you say, "I don't know if this is true or not."
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:59.120]   And just ask yourself, "If it were true, what would I do and what would the cost of
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:00.120]   that be?
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:02.980]   And if it were not true, what would I do and what would the cost of that be?"
[01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:07.120]   And so for me, if I've got the money and I'm worried about supplies of meat drying up,
[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:09.160]   I'm just going to stock up.
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:14.520]   My freezer remains completely full of meat and my pantry remains completely full of food.
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:19.500]   And I feel great about that because there's no downside whatsoever.
[01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:23.440]   If everything continues to go bad and the shortages are right and all the fear mongers
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:28.860]   are right, which they certainly could be, then I'm going to be better prepared.
[01:18:28.860 --> 01:18:35.600]   And if they're wrong and the optimistic case is actually the right case and, hey, it was
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:37.360]   all an overreaction, no big deal.
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:39.920]   I'm going to eat food that I would have consumed either way.
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:42.440]   Now that's different than a big investment decision.
[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:44.920]   That's different than making a bet on the direction of the market.
[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:49.000]   That's different than making a bet on real estate or something like that.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.600]   But that is the truth.
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:51.840]   All right.
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:55.320]   Everyone jumped off because they heard my rapid fire, except New Jersey.
[01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:56.320]   New Jersey, welcome to the show.
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:57.320]   How can I serve you today?
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:58.320]   Hey, Joshua.
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:02.920]   I'll ask you my rapid fire question first.
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:07.040]   Getting married soon, do you think it's a good idea to set up some type of business
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:14.120]   LLC to manage the number of contractors that I'm going to have to hire?
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:15.120]   For the wedding?
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:18.240]   Yeah, for different services.
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:26.520]   Like to limit personal liability as well as kind of shield myself a little bit.
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:34.880]   I can't see the risk that you would personally incur why that would at all be necessary.
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:38.280]   I can't see why that would be worth the hassle.
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:46.960]   If you're renting a facility and you're hiring a florist and a photographer and a preacher
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:55.520]   and a caterer, etc., I just can't see the liability exposure that you have that would
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:57.560]   make that necessary.
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:58.560]   So my answer is no.
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.040]   I don't see the benefit of it.
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:01.040]   Okay.
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:02.040]   Thank you.
[01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:04.120]   You said you had another one.
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.640]   I did that one in 45 seconds.
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:06.640]   So go ahead.
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:07.640]   Yeah.
[01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:14.480]   So I took your career and income planning course and I wrote out kind of my plan.
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:18.160]   And what I came up with was I want to invest in people whom I can have a high influence
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:23.200]   with and a high impact using their skills and ideas in niche areas.
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:25.720]   And if this goes too long, I'll call back next week.
[01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:32.560]   But the primary idea was to employ someone in my family who has extensive experience
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:38.320]   in the child care industry and trying to set up a Montessori or Waldorf type school, particularly
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:39.840]   in the Southeast.
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:43.200]   And this would be my first venture into business.
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:48.200]   And I'm wondering, where do you think is a good place to get started with that?
[01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:50.040]   The best place to start with that.
[01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:59.200]   So Montessori and Waldorf would have their own marketing attraction in certain environments.
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:04.160]   But what I would say the best place to start with that, go read Nick Kozel's manual that
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:07.160]   Gary North publishes on his website, GaryNorth.com.
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:10.800]   You'll have to sign up and become a member and then he's got it somewhere in his downloads.
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:16.880]   But Nick Kozel, years ago, North got him to write a manual on how to start a daycare,
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:18.600]   basically on the cheap.
[01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:24.160]   And that has always been, when I read that manual, it persuaded me that it's a good potential
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:25.440]   business.
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:33.560]   And so that to me would be a really good place to start, could be very profitable.
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:39.280]   The basic outline of the idea is you go to churches that have facilities that are not
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:48.400]   being used during the week and you make a deal with them to use those facilities during
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:50.980]   the week to provide daycare services.
[01:21:50.980 --> 01:21:56.420]   And so what I would do is I would start with that and then I would set up the next stage
[01:21:56.420 --> 01:22:04.340]   of schooling for the daycare children to matriculate into.
[01:22:04.340 --> 01:22:10.100]   And I personally would not, if you find that Waldorf or Montessori branding is appropriate
[01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:16.220]   for you, and it's a draw, I think it would be a draw, I would not personally brand as
[01:22:16.220 --> 01:22:17.220]   that.
[01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:21.300]   I would rather go ahead and get rid of the baggage of those two identifiers and just
[01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:24.940]   simply build my own brand in a local area.
[01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:32.340]   Because if I built my own brand, then I can have more leeway with the type of things that
[01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:36.420]   I build and probably more financial opportunities.
[01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:40.700]   I do think there's a real opportunity for for-profit schooling.
[01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:43.260]   And I'll call in next week and we'll chat about some ideas.
[01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:47.540]   I don't know, I have not tested them in the market, but I'll give you all my ideas and
[01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:51.380]   you can see if you can test them in the market and see if people would actually buy them.
[01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:52.380]   Will do.
[01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:54.300]   I'll call in next week.
[01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:55.300]   Thank you.
[01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:56.300]   All right.
[01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:57.540]   Thank you everybody for being here for today's Q&A show.
[01:22:57.540 --> 01:22:58.540]   I've got to go for today.
[01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:03.340]   Got a bunch of questions and if you'd like to join, a couple things that some listeners
[01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:05.420]   have alluded to and let me give you some info on those.
[01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:08.820]   First of all, if you'd like to join me next week, go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance.
[01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:09.820]   That's important.
[01:23:09.820 --> 01:23:10.820]   Patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance.
[01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:13.820]   I do a small amount of individual consulting.
[01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:18.780]   I've got some time in early May now, but if you'd like to reach out to me for individual
[01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:22.660]   consulting, send me an email, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:25.980]   Sometimes I'm 10 minutes behind on email, sometimes I'm 10 days behind on email.
[01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:29.000]   The only way I know how to manage my life and business is sometimes I walk away from
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.740]   communications and I focus on getting stuff done.
[01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:35.060]   And so if you don't hear back from me immediately, I promise you will hear back from me, but
[01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:39.100]   send me an email, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com if you're interested in consulting.
[01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:41.260]   Some listeners have referenced some of my courses.
[01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:45.680]   I have a course on how to borrow money safely and never pay interest using credit cards.
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:51.180]   You can find that course at radicalpersonalfinance.com/store and every single one of you who has a credit
[01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:54.660]   card or who will ever have a credit card needs that course.
[01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:57.520]   So the only people who don't need that course is if you're firmly convinced I'm never going
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:59.100]   to have a credit card, don't buy it.
[01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:03.540]   But if you are, then if you have one, then go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/store and
[01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:04.540]   sign up for that course.
[01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:07.500]   And then finally, I do have a career and income planning course.
[01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:11.660]   The single biggest decision that you can make that will influence your life positively and
[01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:15.540]   help you live a rich life now while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or
[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:20.540]   less is going to be to optimize your career and your income choices.
[01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:25.780]   What you want to do is you want to build a career based upon something that you really
[01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:31.020]   are thrilled about doing and do it in a way that's insanely profitable.
[01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:38.780]   And in that context, you have the ability to enjoy your life now, enjoy the impact of
[01:24:38.780 --> 01:24:45.340]   your career while simultaneously building a massively profitable career which opens
[01:24:45.340 --> 01:24:50.820]   up fascinating groups, fascinating opportunities for you that nothing else does.
[01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:56.780]   Trust me, it's a whole lot easier to become financially independent very quickly if you
[01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:59.660]   make a million dollars a year versus a hundred thousand.
[01:24:59.660 --> 01:25:02.460]   It's a whole lot easier to become financially independent quickly if you make a hundred
[01:25:02.460 --> 01:25:04.260]   thousand instead of thirty thousand.
[01:25:04.260 --> 01:25:10.300]   And so bar none, I have almost never talked to somebody where the first thing that we
[01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:15.260]   didn't talk about was how can you increase your income while maintaining and improving
[01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:16.620]   your lifestyle.
[01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:22.140]   And the single best way to do those two things together is to build a career that you don't
[01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:25.700]   want to retire from, to build a career that you're excited about that has opportunity.
[01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:29.260]   And so if you're interested in that course, go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/store and
[01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:30.260]   you will find that there.
[01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:31.260]   Thank you for listening.
[01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:32.260]   I'll be back with you next week.
[01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:33.260]   Or yeah, next week.
[01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:38.740]   If you are looking for an exciting role in customer service, food service, or retail,
[01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:40.900]   connect with a job at the airport.
[01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:45.940]   Get started in a role that offers competitive wages, consistent schedules, and fast-tracked
[01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:51.460]   in management while you work in a vibrant, exciting environment where security is a priority.
[01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:53.200]   The airport has it all.
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:55.020]   You can have it all too.
