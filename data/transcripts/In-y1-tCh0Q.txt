[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800]   I should like to call your attention this evening to that incident which we read the
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:13.920]   account of together in the book of the Acts of the Apostles in chapter 5 from verse 17
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:22.400]   on to the end of verse 32. Now we take up this incident which is recorded here and which
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.160]   follows on what we have been considering on previous Sunday evenings. It's an astonishing
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:38.280]   chapter this. It starts with that amazing incident of the death of Ananias and Sapphira,
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.760]   the judicial death as we have described it of Ananias and Sapphira. And that in turn
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.240]   was followed by an astonishing manifestation of the power of God through the apostles.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.280]   We read that by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders brought among
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.440]   the people, insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid them on
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.920]   beds and couches that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.360]   of them. There came also a multitude out of the cities round about Jerusalem, bringing
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.720]   sick folks and them which were vexed with unclean spirits, and they were healed every
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:27.240]   one. And then comes the beginning of this incident which we are now going to look at
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:35.440]   together. Then, after that, the high priest rose up and all they that were with him and
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:44.360]   were filled with indignation. Well now here is a further incident, a further episode in
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:51.080]   the history and the life of the early church. And we are looking at it for the same reason
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.280]   as we've been looking at the other incidents. We are concerned about discovering what the
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.320]   Christian church is, what her message is, what she's meant to do here in this world.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:10.360]   And it is here, and here alone, we have this authentic account of the origin and the beginning
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.680]   of the Christian church. We're dealing here with historical facts. There would never have
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.440]   been a church at all were it not for these historical facts. You can't explain the
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.440]   church in any other terms whatsoever. As these authorities themselves had to point out, they
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.320]   were confronted by a great problem. And the problem was this. They perceived that these
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:40.560]   apostles were unlearned and ignorant men. And they marveled and they couldn't understand
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.880]   it. And that is, of course, the standing and the continuing marvel. It is because these
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.120]   things happened that the church came into being and continued and was enabled to do
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.400]   the astounding things that are recorded not only in this book of the Acts of the Apostles,
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.520]   but the things which are recorded in the subsequent history of the Christian church during the
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.520]   early centuries, and indeed down the centuries until this very night.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.120]   Now, here then, if we really are anxious to know what the Christianity is about, what
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.520]   it is, and what the church is, it is here alone we can discover it. Here we have the
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:29.480]   great fundamental principles put before us in a very clear and in a very definite manner.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.560]   And these are the principles which still are to govern the life of the Christian church.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.120]   A church which can't link herself up with this is not a Christian church. She may be
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:48.480]   an institution. She may still call herself a church. She may still call herself Christian.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.600]   But if she doesn't conform to the principles that are laid down here, she has rarely no
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.960]   right to call herself a Christian church. And that seems to me to be the great problem
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.160]   that is confronting so many at the present time. There is confusion in the church. There
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.200]   is still more outside. People are in trouble and they look to the church. But they say,
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:17.720]   what is the church? What is the message? And they find nothing but this confusion. That
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:25.000]   is why I say it's important that we should go back and consider this early history. This
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.080]   is authentic Christianity. And this alone is authentic Christianity. It's an amazing
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.640]   story right away through. As I say, the church would never have come into being or lasted
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:45.200]   a few days were it not for this kind of thing that we're going to look at together once
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.880]   more. Well now this particular incident that we're examining comes, I'm sure you all
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:58.200]   must feel, to all of us with a considerable degree of astonishment and amazement. There
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:04.600]   is something that is almost incredible about this. Look how the story opens. "Then, then
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.600]   the high priest rose up and all they that were with him and were filled with indignation
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:17.160]   and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison." Then, what does
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:23.560]   that refer to? Well it means immediately after what has just been recorded. What is that?
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.880]   Well you remember what had gone before and I've already reminded you of it. And this
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:37.000]   is what makes it so astonishing and almost incredible. After the sudden death of Ananias
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:46.760]   and Sapphira. After that startling and amazing and dramatic event. It was after that that
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:53.720]   this happened. But then it was also after that unusual display of miraculous supernatural
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.040]   powers. Here were the people coming in from the surrounding towns and countryside bringing
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.480]   their sick and so on and we are told they were all healed. Now this was a fact, this
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:11.360]   was there, it was visible. But this is what we are told. It was that that produced this
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:21.280]   reaction in the chief priests and in the sect and the party of the Sadducees. Now here I
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.440]   want to put it to you tonight. Here is something that is really amazing and astonishing as
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:34.480]   a phenomenon. Surely we can all understand people being afraid as the result of those
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:41.000]   things. You suddenly see a man drop dead and in a three hours his wife drops dead in the
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.640]   same way. That's enough to frighten anybody. We can understand people being frightened
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.880]   and that's the thing we were considering, you remember last Sunday night. We read "a
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:59.280]   great fear came upon all the church and upon as many as heard these things." That I think
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:05.240]   we can all understand quite well. We can also understand this, we are told that the people
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:12.960]   magnified the apostles. They were in great favor with the people. That I think we can
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.640]   understand again. It may have been that the people were credulous, that they were a little
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:22.040]   bit even superstitious if you like, I'll grant you that. But I do suggest that the
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:29.480]   reaction of a man when he hears of this sudden death of men and wife in this judicial manner
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:37.200]   and when he sees these extraordinary miracles being enacted before his very eyes, well his
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:43.480]   reaction surely should be one of amazement and of astonishment and feel that this was
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:49.920]   wonderful and feel favorably disposed towards these men who were given such power and who
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:08:00.280]   were enabled to do such amazing and remarkable things. But what I suggest to you is astonishing
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:08.320]   and amazing and surprising is that anybody could react in this way. Then the high priest
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:16.720]   rose up and all they that were with him and were filled with indignation and laid their
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:22.000]   hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.400]   Now here's the phenomenon that I want to consider with you this evening. What is this?
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:37.720]   Well you see this is unbelief. The gospel, these records, are very honest. They don't
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:43.200]   only give us one side, they give us all sides. We've already seen this in the case of Ananias
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.440]   and Sapphira. How with this extraordinary honesty they tell us the whole truth about
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:53.160]   these people. And here again they make it quite plain and clear to us. You see unlike
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.400]   the methods of big business and advertising which never says there's anything wrong at
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.800]   all, that powder is perfect, it's perfect whiteness and all the rest of it, you don't
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.480]   get that in the scriptures, you get honesty here. You get told about the failures as well
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:12.240]   as the successes and the opposition as well as the support. Here it's all put honestly
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:21.960]   before us. And here I say we are looking tonight at this amazing picture of unbelief. And I'm
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:27.800]   calling your attention to it for this reason. That it is quite as important in a sense for
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:34.040]   us to understand the nature of unbelief as it is for us to understand belief. We were
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:42.080]   considering the elements of belief last Sunday night. The fear, the fear of the unseen and
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:50.120]   of the power of God. Leading in turn to a readiness to listen. A readiness to accept
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:55.400]   and to believe the message of the gospel. The believers we are told were added to the
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:10:01.360]   Lord. Yes that was the third thing, the power of the Holy Spirit adding to the Lord. Not
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:06.760]   some temporary superficial reaction but a profound change in the man that leads him
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:13.200]   to believe and to become a part of the body of Christ. That's belief. But here we're
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:19.040]   confronted by unbelief. Last Sunday night if you like we indulged in what may be called
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:24.760]   the anatomy of belief. Tonight it's the anatomy of unbelief. And I say it's equally
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:34.160]   important because sometimes it happens that what brings a man to belief is his realization
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:40.240]   of the character and the nature of unbelief. He sees what a terrible thing it is, what
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:45.600]   a horrible thing, what a foolish thing, what a mad thing. And seeing that he turns from
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.880]   it. That's happened to many and many a man. So you see these records they give us not
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:55.000]   only the pictures of belief, not only the positive, they give us the negative. It's
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:02.560]   all designed to open our eyes and our understanding and so to bring us to a belief in this great
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:09.480]   gospel of salvation. And of course we should be very grateful to God for such a picture.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:15.840]   I've often put it like this. We've all always found it easier haven't we to grasp
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:24.320]   a point or a principle when we see it in somebody else rather than in ourselves. You see we
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:29.240]   are so well dispersed towards ourselves on such good terms with ourselves and always
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:34.720]   so protecting ourselves that we never really see the truth about ourselves. But when we
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:40.960]   see the same thing in somebody else at once we recognize it. And so these scriptures they
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:45.640]   give us these pictures. And it's often happened to us as it did with David and Nathan. You
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:50.600]   remember I was referring to it a few Sunday nights back. That seeing the very thing that's
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:56.480]   true about us enacted and depicted in somebody else we see the very thing. And then the gospel
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:03.920]   says "thou art the man". And it's brought home to us. That is the value of these histories
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:10.960]   and illustrations and stories that we find given us with such profusion in the pages
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:20.520]   of Holy Writ. And of course we must remember this great principle. As belief doesn't
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:27.040]   change unbelief doesn't change. Somebody may say to me "oh well you were going to
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.680]   I see what you're going to do. You're going to show us the picture of the unbelief of
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:36.560]   the chief priests and the party the sect of the Sadducees. But after all that was nearly
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:42.720]   well 1900 years ago and more. That's all right it was not true of them but it's no
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.840]   longer true we are in the 20th century now. What's that got to do with us? Well it's
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:55.080]   got this to do with it. That unbelief is always the same. Doesn't change at all. And you
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:13:03.160]   see you find here that in the first century there was unbelief. There is still unbelief.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:09.560]   Now of all the modern pharisees there is none that I know of that is quite so pathetic and
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:16.320]   so feeble. As the pharisee of thinking that there's something new about unbelief. Of
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:21.960]   course that is what is thought isn't it? You ask the average man today who is not a
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:27.120]   Christian why he is not a Christian and he will tell you more or less always you'll
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:33.080]   find it's almost invariable that it's really because of his being of the 20th century
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:38.040]   men. He thinks this is something new. He thinks somehow and it's all due to ignorance you
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:44.680]   see. He has an idea that in the past everybody was a Christian. In their ignorance they believed
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:51.440]   it and swallowed it not he. Ah no he's 20th century but everybody in the past of course
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:14:00.440]   all my dear friend here's the answer. The gospel was rejected in the first century.
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:06.200]   The son of God was crucified in the way that I've shown you by reading that section out
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:11.840]   of the 27th chapter of Matthew's gospel just now in exactly the same way as he's
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:16.200]   being rejected tonight. There is no difference. Did you notice it? That's why I've read
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:22.880]   about it. Did you notice that what the people did to our Lord was exactly the thing they
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:28.600]   did to his disciples. Even the common prisoners it were. Everything is the same. There is
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:38.720]   no change. Christ remains the same. Belief and faith are the same. Unbelief is the same.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:45.280]   There is no difference whatsoever. And so what we find as we analyze what we are told
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:53.400]   here about these men in their unbelief is nothing but the simple truth still about all
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:15:00.880]   who reject this gospel. All who turn their backs upon it. All who dislike it. Even as
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:06.880]   this Sadducean party and sect did at the very beginning in the first century at the very
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:13.280]   origin of the church. Now then what are we told here? Well of course the first thing
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:20.560]   that we are told here is we are told something about the nature of unbelief. And this is
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:28.880]   always the starting point. What is the nature of unbelief? Why is it that anybody in this
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:34.040]   congregation tonight who is not a Christian is in that position? Why don't you believe
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:38.920]   the gospel? Have you ever thought of that? What's your reason? Well here's a very
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:44.280]   profound question as I say and it's answered here for us very perfectly. Here were men
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:50.640]   who rejected it. As they'd previously rejected our Lord and had said give us but rabbits
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:56.280]   a thief and a robber. And away with him crucify him we want nothing to do with him. What is
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:02.800]   it that makes people do this? Well let's look at this and let's first start with the
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:10.920]   negative. What is the nature of unbelief? What is the cause if you like of unbelief?
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:18.680]   And our first answer negatively is this. It is not intellectual, not because of intellect.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:24.960]   I've got to go on saying these things because I know that this is what is held at the present
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:31.040]   time. This is the proud boast of men, the scoffers at religion on your television sets
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:39.720]   and everywhere else in their articles. They claim it's an intellectual matter. They
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:46.800]   claim that they're men who've got massive brains, great ability, great understanding,
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:53.440]   great powers of reasoning, and especially today of course all governed by a scientific
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:17:03.160]   outlook. And the scientific outlook is a calm, detached, it's a dispassionate, it's an
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:10.440]   unemotional attitude. The scientist is a man who has no prejudices. He's a man with a
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:18.800]   truly detached mind and he looks on at facts objectively. He's no prejudice, no preconceived
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:25.360]   notions. That's your religious person. But the scientist is the exact opposite of this.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:33.840]   Cool, calm, quiet, dispassionate, looking with a kind of Olympian calm upon objective
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:39.600]   positions as they are placed before him. Now that's the picture, isn't it? And you see
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:48.000]   the idea is today that men are not Christians because they look at it in that way and they
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.640]   have come to the conclusion as the result of their investigation that this isn't true.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:58.760]   So therefore they are not Christians. They reject the gospel and its message and everything
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:07.200]   that they stand for because of this brain and power to reason and to understand which
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:13.120]   they possess. They're very sorry about this. I heard a man saying not long ago, he said,
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:18.240]   "I wish I could believe." But he couldn't. His great brain wouldn't let him. "I wish,"
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:24.120]   he said, "I wish I could. I wish I had faith," he said. I think he was a theatrical producer,
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:28.160]   this particular man. He used that term and I'm sure he meant it. I'm not saying he was
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:33.320]   dishonest. He wasn't. I'm sure he was sincere. But the trouble was he was mistaken. He was
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:38.720]   saying, "I wish I could. Why can't I? Well, I happen to have been born with this great
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.280]   mind and understanding. Of course, it's impossible to such a man. Now, what about
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:47.560]   this? Well, I could keep you the rest of the evening on this, but there's no need for
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:55.640]   me to do so. I can deal with this very simply and I do it like this. If you could show me
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:00.960]   and prove to me that no man with a brain like that ever believed the gospel, well then you'd
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:07.840]   be in a very powerful position. But you just can't do that. Men with great brains have
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:13.320]   believed this gospel. That raises the doubt at once about this modern position, doesn't
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.800]   it? Secondly, there have been men in this world,
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:20.800]   there are some of them recorded here in the scriptures, there are many others in the subsequent
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:26.960]   history of these things, there have been men who have been bitter opponents of the gospel.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:31.480]   They've dismissed it. They have ridiculed it. They've proved to themselves and everybody
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:37.880]   else that they thought that it was all wrong. Later, they've become Christians, the same
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:44.160]   men. Well, why did they make this change? There's no evidence that they developed tumors
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:49.480]   in their brains. There's no evidence that their brains began to degenerate owing to
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:53.240]   arteriosclerosis or something. They changed over some of them when they were comparatively
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:58.320]   young and they, not only that, they gave abundant proof afterwards that their minds and their
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:04.560]   brains were functioning with the same brilliance as they had before. The same men. The same
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:11.360]   men with the same brain, rejects it, later believes it. And shows and demonstrates with
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:16.400]   his mind and reason why he's done so and what it means to him.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:22.840]   Surely that is enough in and of itself. Or as I've sometimes put it, you know, you'll
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:32.160]   often find two brothers, same family, very much the same gifts. Both went to the same
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:38.240]   school, did equally well. Both of them, top of their form, class, whatever it was, went
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:44.480]   on to the university. Their record is almost identical. They did equally well, outstanding
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:51.880]   men, the two brothers. But one of them is a Christian and one of them isn't a Christian.
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:56.080]   What makes the difference? You can't say it's a matter of intellect or of brain because
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:00.200]   everybody agrees that you really can't choose between them. Which is the abler, which is
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:05.040]   the beggar? You can't tell. Nobody, the best judges say, "I really can't tell which
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:10.120]   I put first." And yet one's a Christian, one's not a Christian. What makes the difference?
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:15.680]   Well all I'm deducing is that it cannot be a matter of intellect. It's impossible.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:22.160]   Now there I've given you enough to dispose of that argument once and forever. But then
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:29.160]   some people say, "All right, I'll accept that. But isn't it a question of knowledge?"
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:34.640]   My position, says the man, is that it really is a matter of knowledge. And that's where
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:40.520]   I emphasize, he says, the fact that we are now in the 20th century. I find men writing
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:44.840]   books, even bishops doing so, saying that of course you can't expect the men of the
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:50.880]   20th century to believe what men formerly... Ah, that's it, scientific knowledge. We know
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:55.800]   certain things today which were not known in the past. And it's these things that we
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:00.680]   now know that make it impossible for us to believe. So our unbelief is based upon our
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:06.520]   knowledge. Very well, all I say in reply is this, if that is the cause of unbelief, what
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:12.440]   was the cause of the unbelief of these people in the book of the Acts of the Apostles?
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:16.760]   They rejected it in exactly the same way, but they haven't got your latest knowledge.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:21.880]   They have some other reason for their unbelief, obviously. You see, it isn't a question of
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:26.240]   knowledge. If you could say that everybody in the past believed the gospel, and that
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:31.560]   unbelief has only come in since we split the atom, well then of course you'd have a watertight
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:37.040]   case. But that isn't right. There has been as much unbelief in the past as there is in
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:44.600]   the present. It has been continuous and coextensive almost with belief. But you see, in addition
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:50.960]   to that, let me put it like this. Take all this new and modern knowledge. It's very wonderful,
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:55.120]   I agree with you. I'm not here to say a word against it. A man who says anything against
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:23:01.160]   modern knowledge and discoveries and inventions is just a fool. But all I'm here to point
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:06.200]   out to you is this, that all this increase in modern knowledge has got nothing to do
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:11.920]   with the subject that we are discussing. You split the atom. Does that tell you any more
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:17.240]   about yourself? Does the fact that the Russians have landed that instrument on the moon, which
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:22.240]   is a marvelous achievement, let's give them due credit for it, does that explain why you've
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:27.880]   committed that same sin again last night which you said a week ago you'd never do again?
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:34.640]   Does it help you with that? Does all this increase in knowledge tell you anything more about
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:41.480]   man? What he is, who he is, what he's doing in this world, how to live a clean and a straight
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:48.960]   and a moral life, how to die, what lies beyond death? Does it help you? Jodrell Bank can't
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:56.080]   see through death. Sputniks can't tell you anything about the soul, about God, or about
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:01.400]   the great fundamental issues of life. You see, the modern knowledge has got nothing
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:06.840]   to do with this question. That's why it is a complete irrelevance. Unbelief was here
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:12.440]   before it came. It's still here. That's not the cause of unbelief. Well, I mustn't
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:17.840]   wear you with these negatives, but I had to start with them, hadn't I? You see, now
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:24.040]   I'll tell you positively the cause of unbelief. Neither of those two. Well, what then? Oh,
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:30.400]   here it is. Listen. Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, and were
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:43.040]   filled with indignation. Indignation. Somebody suggested a better translation is this, angry
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:49.680]   jealousy. And laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison. Now we
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:25:00.800]   are beginning to get at it, aren't we? Is this the picture of your calm, detached, cool,
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:07.920]   scientific impartial and prejudiced observer? Of course it isn't. There's no such thing.
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:13.600]   There never has been such a man. Some of us, you know, have had a little bit of scientific
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:18.560]   training, and I spent two years of my life doing scientific research work. And if it
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:22.640]   comes to a matter of prejudice, I saw as much of it in those circles as I've ever seen
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:28.800]   anywhere else. The idea that these men are impartial, and that they never are jealous
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:36.160]   of one another, and that they never know anything about malice or spite at all. You go and tell
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:41.440]   some of the scientists that kind of story, and just watch their facial expressions. No,
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:49.040]   no, my friend, this is the deceit of the devil. This is where he fools us. Unbelief is not
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:53.840]   intellectual. The trouble is not, the cause of it is not intellectual. What is it? Well,
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:26:03.120]   I make bold to say that unbelief is always the result of irrationality. In other words,
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:10.480]   it's the exact opposite of intellectual. Irrational. Unbelief, I say, is irrational.
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:14.480]   It's entirely a matter of feeling and of prejudice. Look at it here. Here's a great
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:18.800]   instance of it, a great illustration. What I read about the way they treated our Lord
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:24.320]   puts it equally plainly and clearly. Now let me analyze it, let me show it to you. We are
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:29.040]   told here in the 24th verse concerning these men, "Now when the high priest and the
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:34.480]   captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:40.240]   were unto this would dwell." What does that mean? It means this. Here they are, they've
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:46.800]   seen these men, heeling them in at the beautiful gate of the temple. They've heard them speaking,
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:51.280]   and speaking with eloquence, and understanding, expounding the scriptures, and yet they're
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:57.600]   ignorant and unlettered. They've seen them speaking in this judicial manner, and Ananias
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:02.880]   and Sapphira drop dead. They've seen these extraordinary manifestations of supernatural
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:11.680]   powers, and they don't understand it. They can't explain it. And yet you see, instead
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:19.520]   of abducting the truly scientific attitude, which would be this, surely, to say, "Well,
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:25.520]   we can't dispute the facts. Facts are facts after all. And these things are happening,
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:30.080]   and it's obvious that it isn't these men, there must be something else. What is this?
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:34.960]   Let's watch this. Let's see what it's going to lead to." Instead of adopting that
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:41.600]   attitude of inquiry, humble inquiry, and tolerance, and fair play, and give it an opportunity,
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:48.720]   they do the exact opposite. And they dismiss it out of gawk. And they're filled with
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:55.120]   angry jealousy, and annoyance, and indignation, and try to put a stop to it. Now, you see,
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:28:03.200]   it's still the same, isn't it? Now, I can prove this to you. Look at modern men.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:11.360]   Look how tolerant he is. He's so tolerant now that he's prepared not only to excuse,
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:20.000]   but to legitimize moral perversions. You see, he says, "We've judged these things with
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.920]   passion in the past. We've regarded men as criminals. We've called certain actions
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:29.280]   sin, these perversions." But they say, "That's all wrong, and we've grown up
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:34.400]   out of that now. We really must look at this in an intellectual and in a scientific manner."
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:40.000]   And so he's prepared to tolerate something that breaks the very laws of nature.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:47.760]   I'm sorry for poets, but I'm talking now about the principle. And I think the worst
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:52.000]   thing you can do for them is to praise them, and to almost make them feel that they're
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.960]   normal. They're not. It's an abnormality. But, you see, the worst of the modern men
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:05.760]   is that he's so fair, he's so tolerant, he'll tolerate even perversion. He'll tolerate
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:13.920]   even foulness. But he won't tolerate the gospel. Look at these tolerant gentlemen,
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:19.040]   who tolerate things like that. You listen to them speaking about the gospel. Listen
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:22.960]   to them doing it on the wireless. Look at the sneer. Look at the contempt. Look at the
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:29.520]   bitterness. Why is this? Now that's the question that's confronting us. And, you
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:34.880]   see, the explanation is here before our eyes. There's no tolerance when this comes in.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:40.240]   There's no fair play here. There's no readiness to allow possibilities here. No,
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:48.080]   no. Total rejection. They doubted, God, that whereunto this would grow. What was the matter
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:52.880]   of them? Well, there's no difficulty in telling you, unfortunately. We all know something
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:57.840]   about unbelief. We've all been guilty of it. Why did these men react like this? Well,
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:04.000]   the answer is that their jealousy and their pride. How? Well, they were the leaders, you
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.640]   see. They were the high priests in the party. They were important people. And in the past,
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:14.080]   the populace had looked up unto them. So they're guarding their position. They're proud of
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:18.880]   their learning. They're proud of their knowledge. They're proud of the fact, I say, that the
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:25.200]   people have always listened to them. But now, they see these unlearned and ignorant men
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:29.600]   occupying the center of the stage. And the populace, the crowd, is running after these
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:34.480]   unlettered and ignorant men and listening to them and not to the authorities. And they're
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:39.920]   furious. They're filled with indignation. They don't worry about miracles. They don't
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:44.560]   worry about judicial justice. Nothing matters except their position, their great position.
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:51.600]   I can understand these Sadducees very well. You notice the record puts emphasis on that
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:57.200]   the high priest rose up and all they that were with him, in brackets, which is the sect of the
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:04.000]   Sadducees, of course, they really were in trouble. And for this reason, the Sadducees had always
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:13.280]   taught that there was no such thing as resurrection. The Sadducees didn't believe in the supernatural.
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:18.880]   They didn't believe in life after death. They therefore didn't believe in the possibility
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:25.760]   of resurrection. But on top of it, they didn't believe in angels either. And there's something
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:30.080]   almost humorous about this, isn't there? You see, they're predicting them here now. Here it is.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.640]   These men, they're able to do these marvelous things. How do they do it? Well, they say it is
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:40.400]   because Jesus of Nazareth rose from the dead. The Jesus whom they had condemned and succeeded in
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:46.240]   putting to death and buried, has risen. And he's exercising power from heaven, resurrection.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:51.440]   But still more humiliating at this point, they've taken these men, they've thrown them into the
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:57.760]   common prison, they've locked the doors and the keepers are there. But the angel of the Lord by
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:04.640]   night opened the prison doors and brought them forth. Angels. Well now, when you've always said
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:09.520]   that there's no such thing possible as resurrection and that there's no such thing as an angel,
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:13.840]   and everybody's believed you, but suddenly things begin to happen which prove that there is
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:19.680]   resurrection and angels, well you're obviously in trouble, aren't you? You see, your whole position
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:25.200]   is being shaken, and people are tending to laugh at you. When you come with your great pomp and
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.440]   ceremony in the morning and say, "Produce the prisoners please." And the soldiers go to the
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:33.440]   prison and come back saying, "Well, we found the prison intact and all the doors locked and the
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:38.400]   keepers standing before the doors, but we found no prisoners." You're in trouble, aren't you?
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:44.480]   Well, you see, this is an old first century picture, isn't it? But what a perfect picture it
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:52.560]   is of the modern man who rejects the gospel. He's always said that there's no God. He has always
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:58.480]   said that there's no miracle, that Jesus Christ was only a man. He's always said this, and that
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:04.800]   he's been the great proponent of these views. Yet something happens that he can't explain,
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:12.240]   and some fool of an ignoramus who calls himself a Christian seems to be able to live a better life
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:17.440]   than he does, and seems to be able to help people in misery and distress in a way that he cannot do.
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:22.480]   And things happen through this ignorant ignoramus which he can't do, and he can't explain,
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:27.280]   and he's in trouble. His whole attitude, his whole position is involved. People are turning from him.
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:32.800]   That's the trouble, you know, that's the real cause of unbelief.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:37.600]   What will people think of you if you become a Christian?
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:46.400]   What about your intellectual respectability? Does anybody but a fool any longer believe this?
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:50.640]   That's why most people are not Christian. That's their argument. That's what's really happening
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:56.960]   within them, their whole position, the whole idea of the modern literate, educated, sophisticated,
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:02.080]   scientific man. It comes crashing to the ground. It's of no value. And of course that's a terrible
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:07.200]   thing. Your pride's involved, your whole position is involved. You feel that your world has collapsed
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:13.200]   beneath your feet. That's why men don't believe the gospel. But then you've noticed the element
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:23.200]   of hatred and of rage, filled with indignation. And let me point out to you how you see this at
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:30.160]   the present time. Why can't people talk quietly and calmly about the Christian faith? Why can't
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:36.000]   they write about it in a decent manner? Why must they always scoff at it? Why must they jeer at it?
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.760]   Why must they always poke fun at it? Why this feeling? Why this passion? Why the absence of a
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:49.600]   calm, rational attitude? Why is this? Now I'm not inventing facts. You know what I'm saying. You
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:53.840]   know it as well as I know it. You're aware of it as I'm aware of it. Why is it considered to be
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:35:00.000]   clever to pour scorn upon this? Why did those people deal with the Son of God in the way they
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:07.200]   did? Why do they still deal with him in the same way and all he stands for and all he came to do
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:14.400]   and his followers? You see, here is this hatred and this rage. They take these men and we are
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:19.280]   told that they threw them into the common prison. There were divisions in the prison.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:27.760]   In the common prison you threw the felons, the men who were guilty of the vilest and the foulest
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:33.600]   crimes. There was no lower department in the prison than the common prison. It's there they
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:39.280]   put them. They don't put them in the nicest, the best part and say well after all these men have
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:44.800]   committed no glaring crimes. They're not drunkards. They're not murderers. They have murdered anybody.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:49.680]   Let's put them there at any rate until we get, no no, common prison. Why there? Now that's the
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:53.840]   modern attitude. You see that's the attitude of unbelief always. It puts the whole thing
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:36:02.400]   into the common prison. Christ is crucified between two thieves. Is this intellect? Is this
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:10.000]   the calm, rational, dispassionate, scientific view towards truth? No, no my friends it's the exact
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:16.400]   opposite. Here there's feeling and passion shouting at you and then you notice their employment of
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:23.600]   their authority and force, their attempt to silence these men, indeed their very attempt
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:30.880]   to destroy the Christian church. And that has always been the characteristic of unbelief.
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:39.840]   I could take you through the history of the treatment by men of the saints of the centuries
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:45.280]   and you'd always find the repetition of this self-same thing. Look at the way they treated
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:50.960]   our Lord. Look at the way they treated these men. Look at the way they treated the Christians
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:57.200]   afterwards in the first and second centuries. The massacres, the cruelty, the branding of them
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:02.240]   with hot irons and how they continue to do it throughout the centuries. Look at it in the
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:07.760]   middle ages. Look at the treatment given to the reformers here in London and elsewhere.
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:12.480]   Look at the treatment meted out to the Puritans and the Covenanters in Scotland. Look at the
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:16.960]   treatment meted out to the early Methodists. Do you know this is the sort of thing they've done?
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:21.920]   They took men and they cut off both their ears. They branded them again with hot irons in the
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:30.240]   17th century and afterwards. Why do men do this? This is unbelief. But why this passion? Why this
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:35.760]   kind of treatment? Why the repetition of this thing? My dear friends, isn't it obvious to you?
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:41.920]   This is not intellectual detachment. This is not a calm scientific view of truth.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:49.200]   This is passion. This is feeling. This is jealous, anger, indignation, hatred, raging, malice, and
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:57.920]   spite. Ah, but you say there's nothing done of that today. Isn't there? Is there no persecution
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:03.840]   today? Well, I happen to be in a position to know something about these things.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:10.960]   And alas, it is the simple truth to say this, that there is grievous persecution today.
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:19.760]   There are people who are in jeopardy of a post, in high educational circles sometimes,
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:26.400]   because of their beliefs. There are people who are held back because they're Christians,
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:33.920]   in all walks and departments of life. You can see it in the articles. Men are ridiculed,
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:38.560]   they're scoffed at, they're laughed at, they're jeered at, because they're Christians,
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:43.840]   and because they're trying to live a Christian and a moral life. You can be a pervert and you'll
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:50.240]   be praised. There's something marvelous about this, this wonderful love. But if you're a Christian,
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:55.520]   well then, they'll get at you. They'll whisper and they'll wink at one another.
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:39:00.720]   And when they get an opportunity, they'll keep you down, they'll keep you back. I'm simply putting
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:07.520]   facts before you, unfortunately. And yet, you see, we are asked to believe that all this is just
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:15.040]   rationalism, the calm, cool detachment of the scientific observer and investigator out upon
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:21.600]   such nonsense. This is still the cause of indignation, fury. Why? What is this?
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:28.400]   Well, I say it is nothing but sheer irrationality, and I'll prove it finally to you in this way.
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:36.240]   It proves that it's irrational in opposing the very thing that it opposes.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:43.200]   What does it oppose? What was the thing that these people were rejecting? Well, we are told here,
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:47.440]   the angel, you remember, appeared to these men in the prison, and this is what he said to them.
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:58.640]   He said to them, "Go, stand, and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life."
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:05.360]   That's the thing. They're in prison, why? Because they've been speaking the words of this life.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.640]   What is this? What is this thing that these people are rejecting that fills them with fury?
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:15.920]   Now, this is the most amazing thing of all, and if you don't agree that this is irrational,
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:19.280]   well, then there's something wrong with your thinking, I suggest. You'd better examine
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:26.000]   yourself again. What are they rejecting? Are they rejecting some unintelligent, emotional sub-stuff?
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:33.520]   They're not, there's no evidence of it. Are they rejecting something primitive and debased?
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:41.680]   Are they rejecting something that is opposed to men and his best interests in any way whatsoever?
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:48.560]   Is their teaching something that puts fetters on men's intellect? Is it a teaching that does harm
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:53.920]   to a man's morals? Is it something that does harm to a man spiritually? Is it something that does
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:41:01.120]   harm to a man in this life and in the next life? Is it? Is this a message that is inimical to men
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:11.280]   and his highest and his best interests in any way? The answer is this. This message is the words of
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:20.640]   this life. What is it? Oh, here it is. "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son,
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:26.960]   that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life."
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:34.880]   What is this message that men rejected? This, that the great God who made this world and made us all
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:41.600]   and who is over all and is our judge eternal, the one against whom we've sinned and whom we've
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:52.080]   reviled and spat upon him, is nevertheless a God who has so loved us that he has planned a way
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:59.600]   to deliver us and to set us free, a way of salvation. The apostle Paul puts it in these
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:08.000]   words, "The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared." It is good news, it is the gospel.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:16.400]   This is the amazing thing. But if the message of the gospel was that God was a great tyrant
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:22.240]   waiting to pounce upon us and to crush us and always keeping us down and stultifying our minds
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:27.440]   and our spirits and our souls and putting us to live a kind of hell of a life, I don't understand
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:34.480]   men rejecting it but it's the exact opposite. It isn't God putting up a legal curd which is
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:39.680]   impossible and saying, "Keep that and I'll forgive you and if you don't I'll damn you." It's a God
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:45.760]   who says, "Though you failed and have sinned against me, my love is such that I am preparing
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:55.760]   this way of salvation for you, grace of God." That's what they're rejecting. Look at those men
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:02.880]   and their actions as recorded in that portion in Matthew 27. Look at this one on whom they're
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:08.560]   spitting. Look at the one on whom they put the crown of thorns and put a reed in his hand
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:13.920]   and mock him and jeer him and spit upon him literally and laugh at him and mock at him in
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:19.680]   his agony on that cross. Why are they doing this to him? What's the matter? What has he done? Who is
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:27.840]   he? And the answer is that he's none other than the Son of God who has come into this world.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:36.480]   He's the most amazing person the world has ever seen. He went about doing good we are told.
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:41.440]   Here was a man who sat and mixed with publicans and sinners
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:48.160]   when the best and the most respectable and religious people pulled their skirts to themselves
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:55.600]   and wouldn't be seen anywhere near such people. He sat down amongst them. He sat down with publicans
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:44:01.200]   and sinners. He supped with them. He spent his time with them. He allowed a poor foreign woman
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:05.680]   to wash his feet with the tears of her eyes and to wipe them with the hair of her head.
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:13.040]   Here is one who had a word of kindness to say to everybody. Here was one who had encouragement to
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:19.360]   give to the hopeless. Look at him he goes about doing good. He heals sicknesses. He restores
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:26.000]   people who are diseased. He gives sanity to the insane. He heals the blind, the lame, the deaf.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:35.280]   He raises the dead. Here's the person they're spitting on. Listen to his teaching. Why a common
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:43.840]   soldier hearing him one day had to say never men speak like this men. Others had to admit that
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:50.240]   they'd never heard such gracious words of the words that fell from his lips. His teaching, look at it.
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:57.120]   If only the whole world lived his teaching tonight our world would be a very different place.
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:02.480]   If only everybody practiced the sermon on the mount the world tension would disappear.
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:07.360]   There'd be no industrial problems. There'd be no social problems. There'd be no moral problems.
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:12.720]   There'd be no international problems. If only everybody listened to this man's teaching and
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:18.000]   practiced it. That's the one they're crucifying. That's the one they're spitting upon and treating
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:27.600]   with scorn and derision. But what am I speaking about? What's he doing on that cross?
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:34.720]   The answer is that he went there deliberately. He could have avoided it. He could have evaded it.
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:43.280]   He says so. He went there deliberately. Why? Well because as he put it he had come into this world
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:50.720]   to seek and to save that which is lost. That's why he'd come. He had come because he's the greatest
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:56.560]   benefactor in the universe. He had come because of his great heart of compassion and of love.
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:02.160]   He had come to deliver men, to set them free, to deliver them from the punishment their sins so
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:07.760]   richly deserved, to deliver them from the shackles and the bondage of the world, the flesh, the devil.
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:12.960]   He'd come to set them free, to make them sons of God, to give them new life and to prepare them for
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:17.920]   a glorious eternity. That's why he came. And the death was a part of it and the burial was a part
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:22.240]   of it. The resurrection is a part of it. The sending of the Holy Ghost is a part of it.
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:30.560]   That's the one that they reject. Now I'm asking you in all seriousness and soberness.
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:38.080]   Is this rationality? Is it rational to gnash your teeth against such a person?
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:44.400]   Is it rational to throw into the common prison men who tell you about him and to show you why he
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:52.080]   came, who he was and what he offers you? Go, says the angel, and tell them, stand forth and let them
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:47:01.520]   know the words of this life. Life! My dear friend, if he came and offered you some sort of slavery,
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:06.080]   I know that that's what you think Christianity is. You've listened to the devil, haven't you?
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:10.160]   And the devil has told you, don't become a Christian man, you'll only be half a man.
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:14.640]   Christianity is repression. Christianity is the teaching that tells you, don't do this,
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:21.600]   don't do that, don't do the other. Don't indulge your sex, either heterosexually or homosexually.
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:26.640]   Don't listen to it. Both are right, let's carry on. Don't listen, you'll only be living a little
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:31.840]   cramped, narrow, confined life. You lose everything that's joyous and wonderful and happy,
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:36.480]   and you'll become a little man and live a little life in a little world. Don't do it!
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:45.120]   And you're mad enough to listen. Go, says the angel, stand and speak in the temple to the people
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:57.120]   all the words of this life. It's a life, didn't he say so? I am come that they might have life,
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:04.800]   and that they might have it more abundantly. Life, my dear friend, this is what you need.
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:12.480]   The world can't give you life. Does drinking alcohol give you life? Life, that's slavery.
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:17.120]   That's cutting out your highest faculties. That's crippling your mind. That's interfering
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:23.280]   with your morals and your sense of judgment and of righteousness. That's not life. That's existence
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:29.280]   on an animal and a lower level. That's not life. Here is life. Here is something that delivers the
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:35.440]   whole man. Here is a truth that's bigger than men and the world. It is the truth of God and
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:41.840]   it stretches through death to eternity. Here is a great worldview that explains everything,
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:48.560]   that nothing else can explain. And it not only gives you intellectual life, it gives you a new
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:55.280]   moral nature, and it gives you a new joy and a new appreciation. Oh, I'm sorry for a man who's
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:49:00.000]   not a Christian. He doesn't know what it is to be really happy. He doesn't know what it is to have
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:07.200]   real life and joy and vigor and enthusiasm. My dear friend, that other life is a life that
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:12.960]   drugs you, it takes from you, it cripples you, and it leaves you an empty wreck and a mere husk
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:20.960]   at the end. Here is life. I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:29.280]   abundantly. It begins here, it grows, it develops, it expands, and it continues throughout eternity.
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:36.800]   That's what they're rejecting. With scorn, with anger, with bitterness, with annoyance,
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:41.280]   feeling it's an insult to them. A gospel that tells you that you can be born again,
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:46.080]   that you can have a new start, that you can have a new principle of life, and a power put into you
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:51.040]   and the Spirit of God dwelling in you, which will set you free. That's the thing they hate with
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:57.280]   indignation and feel it's an insult to their great minds. Their great minds don't seem to help them
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:01.680]   very much, do they? They don't help them to keep sober, they don't help them to keep loyal to their
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:07.680]   marriage contracts, they don't help them from their fun conversions. No, no, they don't help
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:14.080]   them in any respect except in some mechanical superficial respects. But here is life which
[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:20.480]   is life indeed, and life which is eternal. I'm simply putting it to you. To reject this and to
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:27.200]   reject it with feeling and pattern and scorn and indignation is nothing but a sheer demonstration
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:35.200]   of utter irrationality. And if you want to know the final proof of the irrationality of this,
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:42.040]   I'm only saying a word. Listen, here are these men, they took them, they laid their hands on
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:46.480]   the apostles and put them in the common prison. They've got the authority, they've got the power,
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:50.400]   they're going to put a stop to this. And they came, they after all are the authorities,
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:51:02.800]   they put them in the common prison. But, but, there it is, that's Christianity. This but that
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:10.480]   comes in, this blessed but, what? God, power of God. But the angel of the Lord by night opened
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:18.800]   the prison doors and brought them forth and said, "Go stand and speak." If I don't do the thing
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:25.040]   they're telling you not to do. Here it is, you see, this is where the unbeliever is such a fool.
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:32.320]   He is not only rejecting the most glorious person the world has ever seen, he is not only rejecting
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:37.400]   the most glorious teaching the world has ever heard, he's not only rejecting life and the
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:49.920]   offer of eternal salvation, he's mad enough to defy the living God. He thinks he's got the power,
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:55.120]   the power of knowledge, the power of authority, the power of science, the power of the 20th
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:52:02.960]   century, and he locks the doors, he's going to finish this thing. But he can't finish this thing.
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:10.920]   They always come out of the prison. You see, these men, they ought have known better. That's
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:15.600]   why I emphasized that word "them" at the beginning. "Then the high priest rose up." When? Well,
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:20.320]   after the death of Ananias and Sapphira. Fools, why didn't they see the power of God there,
[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:25.760]   after all the miracles? Power of God, why don't they see that? They're standing against that,
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:31.520]   not men, these not ignorant and unlettered men, it's the power of God. They're standing against
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:37.920]   that. They're utter fools, and they're made to look fools, they're ridiculed, they become the
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:44.960]   laughingstock of the populace whom they think they can impress. And that is where you see the
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:50.920]   final irrationality and madness of unbelief, it's nothing less than that. My dear friend,
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:58.560]   if you reject this gospel, you're not rejecting me, you're rejecting God, the power of God.
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:05.200]   Here it is in one incident. "Knock the door of the common prison, put the keepers,
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:11.240]   mock the angel of the Lord, and he sets them free." And that's, if you like, a summary of
[00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:16.680]   the whole of the subsequent history from the end of the New Testament. That's what's been
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:23.480]   happening throughout the running centuries. This isn't the first century when clever
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:29.040]   intellectual people have thought they could put an end to Christianity. They have sometimes tried
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:35.520]   by the force of the sword, and by the stake, and by hanging, and other physical ways to do it.
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:41.680]   They've tried intellectual ways as they're doing today, but you know it's all futile,
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:52.080]   it's all coming to nothing. God has settled this once and forever. The devil brought out
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:58.880]   his last reserves when he brought about the death and the burial of the Son of God,
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:07.400]   and he thought he'd charged the resurrection. He is the eternal answer. And though men and
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:13.760]   devils and hell do their utmost as they are doing to finish Christianity and lock it up
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:21.640]   once and forever, the doors will always be opened. And the thing that you think you've
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:27.880]   finished will be standing and addressing the world and its peoples, and leading many to life
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:34.520]   and to salvation. My dear friend, this is the final irrationality of sin that is not pitting
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:42.840]   itself against a man or a human teaching, but against the living God. And as certainly as we
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:52.960]   are here tonight, whatever this twentieth century may do, Jesus shall reign. Where'er the Son doth
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:55:00.960]   his successive journeys run, his kingdom stretch from shore to shore, till moon shall wax and
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:14.240]   wane. No more, oh my friend, I plead with you, see your irrationality. Repent, acknowledge your
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:24.640]   folly and your errors, and believe the gospel. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:36.640]   shalt be saved, and given life and life more abundantly. Amen.
