[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Right, so this is our booth at Weights & Biases.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Oh, I just met Lucas.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Hey, Lucas.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Hey, how's it going?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   I'm trying to record our booth in NeurIPS for our livestream.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Ah, cool.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   And so we're actually live right now.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Oh, we're live?
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   So yeah, you want to say hi to some folks as we're live.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   And we're having a bunch of people in our booth just talking to other people.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   Here's Derek and here's the whole team.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Say hi.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Here's our cool stickers for today.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   You can see we have, if I can focus on it, Weights & Biases + NeurIPS 2023.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   And we have a bunch of other folks.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   We also have some cool gifts over there that we're giving out to people.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   And there's a bunch of great, great conversations that are happening.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Again, if you're here, you should definitely check us out.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   If you're not here, a bunch of the stuff that we talk about over there, we actually have on our website.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   So you definitely should check this out.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   And I hope that the sound came through well for this one.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   And yeah, Booth 209.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   As we finish up the first day in NeurIPS, and many people have left the talks and now are in the networking phase of this event,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   you can see how kind of crazy this is.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   And it's been an incredible place to meet a lot of people, a lot of machine learning engineers,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   a lot of folks from Gemini, from Google, so right here, you see DeepMind.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   It's pretty cool.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   So we'll see you on day two.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   And this has been the recap of day one on NeurIPS.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   And tomorrow we're going to do something cool.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   We're going to introduce people and papers, and that's going to be awesome.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   So we'll see you guys.
