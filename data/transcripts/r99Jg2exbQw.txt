[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.720]   All week long we have been joined by pastor and author Tim Keller.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.880]   He has a wonderful new book coming out soon, Prayer Experiencing Awe and Intimacy with
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.520]   God is the title.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.160]   It releases on November 4th and he joins us once more from New York City to finish out
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.160]   the week.
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.680]   Okay, Dr. Keller, we near the finish line here with question number nine.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.760]   In passages like James chapter 4, verse 3, we are told there's a type of prayer that
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.760]   doesn't work.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.800]   It's an idol-centered prayer, it's asking for something with wrong motives.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.120]   Can you explain this?
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.920]   What type of prayer doesn't work?
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.800]   Well, yes, when James talks about prayers that, where you're asking for something selfishly
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:54.360]   or just to spend on your own selfish desires, I would say that there's, that's a sub,
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.880]   put it this way, that would be a subheading under even a bigger heading.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.960]   God's not going to give you something that's bad for you.
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.960]   See, if he's your father, he's not going to give you something that's bad for you.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.400]   Just like I as a father wouldn't give my children something they ask for if they don't realize
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.840]   it would not be safe, they'd probably hurt themselves.
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.640]   So you know, J.I.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.920]   Packer in his book on prayer actually says that ultimately there's no such thing as unanswered
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.680]   prayer.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.920]   And even John Calvin says God grants our prayer even if he does not always respond to the
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.680]   exact form of our request.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.280]   That's a pretty amazing thing for John Calvin to say.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.760]   God grants our prayer even if it does, he does not always respond to the exact form
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.000]   of the request.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.520]   So what Packer and Calvin are saying is that we might ask for something that's just not
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.680]   good for us.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.360]   And God being a good father tries to give us what we would have asked for if we, if
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.480]   we knew everything he knew or try to give us what we're after, even though he won't
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.880]   give it to us in the form that we asked for it.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.400]   Now that's the general heading of things that he won't give us, things that are bad for
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.400]   us.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.920]   But inside there are some things that we're asking for with very bad motives.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.840]   We don't know about it at the time, they're very selfish or very proud or very, or maybe
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.960]   there are things that assume a very overblown assessment of our own gifts.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.240]   And those things that are actually badly motivated, God particularly can't give us because that
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.920]   would just fuel that pride.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.080]   And so I would say that's a subheading, it's something that's not good for us.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.480]   Now you could ask for something that's not good for you with the best of motives.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.280]   You're not being selfish, it's not idle, it's not idol-driven, it's just unwise and he's
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.640]   not going to give it to you.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.000]   But then the idol-driven kinds of requests would even be worse and he just simply won't
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   do it.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.600]   So that's what I think that means.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.200]   >> Very good.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.920]   And we finally arrive at the last question of the week, question number 10.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.920]   Of course there are a lot of books on prayer and some very good ones too.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.080]   So what do you think will surprise readers about your book or what do you think makes
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.640]   your book on prayer unique?
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:12.240]   >> I'll give you three and I'm not sure that, I think people will probably come away with
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.400]   at least one of these three.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.280]   One is it's a more comprehensive book.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.620]   The reason I wrote it was because there's a lot of great books on prayer, but books
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.240]   on prayer either go into the theology of prayer or they go into the practice of prayer or
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.200]   they troubleshoot it and they say here's problems.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.100]   And I felt I didn't have one book I could give to people that was basically covering
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.100]   all the bases.
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.480]   You know, here's the biblical view of prayer, the theology of prayer, and here are some
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.480]   methods of prayer.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.980]   I didn't have a good first book just to give somebody.
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.160]   So some people might come away and say what's unique about it is it's sort of balanced and
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.080]   kind of comprehensive but not too long.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.680]   The second thing that might be surprising, I think, is on the one hand I really go deeply
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.120]   into John Owen's stuff in his book, not only his book on prayer, The Role of the Holy Spirit
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.080]   in Prayer, but also his book on the grace and duty of being spiritually minded.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.560]   John Owen is very mystical.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.860]   He really believes that you can have a faith sight of Jesus Christ, really see the glory
[00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.660]   of God, not with your physical eyes but with the eyes of the heart.
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.760]   And he actually says your affections have to be involved, there needs to be deep, deep,
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.520]   deep joy in prayer.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.300]   So he's very, very mystical in that sense.
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:31.540]   But at the same time he's very down on Catholic mysticism and a lot of, he would be very down
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:38.280]   on an awful lot of the ways in which evangelicals are trying to bring in Catholic contemplative
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.200]   prayer practices.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.780]   And I think that's what's unusual about the book.
[00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.720]   Because most books I know that are critical, as I am, of contemplative prayer, and I am,
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.000]   then do not turn around and try to give you a really robustly Reformed and Protestant
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.060]   approach to affectionate prayer, affection and meditation.
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.320]   So I think Luther, Edwards, and John Owen give you that.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.560]   But many people who are trying to get away from the contemplative prayer practices are
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.280]   afraid of talking about meditation at all, and they're afraid of talking about deep experiences
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.280]   and encounters with God.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.280]   They're just afraid to go there.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.520]   And what I try to do is I try to say, "No, we've really got to get there.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.640]   We have to get there.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.800]   And these guys are good guides, Owen, Edwards, Luther."
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.240]   But at the same time we need to be pretty critical of a lot of the contemplative prayer
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.120]   practices that are being brought into the church right now.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.400]   That's what I think a lot of people probably find pretty interesting.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.400]   I think probably the third reason is, in the end, it's pretty practical.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.660]   And I do find an awful lot of books are afraid of actually saying, "Here's a way to actually
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.440]   spend 15, 20 minutes in prayer."
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.280]   I actually try to get pretty practical at the end.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.160]   I think some people would expect a Reformed evangelical type to be a little bit more,
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.880]   "Here's the exegesis, and now you go and apply it for yourself."
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.560]   Well, the book is surprisingly practical and comprehensive.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.280]   You have accomplished something really remarkable in this book.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.040]   Thank you for your time, Dr. Keller.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.320]   That was Tim Keller, author of the new book titled, "Prayer, Experiencing Awe and Intimacy
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.320]   with God."
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.120]   It releases on November 4th, and you should seriously consider getting this book and reading
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.320]   it and perhaps even reading it together with a friend or a group of friends.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.280]   I suspect this book is going to mark a turning point in the prayer lives of a lot of Christians
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.040]   this fall and this winter.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.620]   I'm still putting together my list of Christian books of the year, but I think this one may
[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.720]   finish at the top.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.200]   It's that good.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.200]   And this has been a really fun week talking about prayer with Tim Keller.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.940]   And today on the DG blog, I published a full transcript of our time together.
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.420]   It's titled, "10 Questions on Prayer with Tim Keller."
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:40.360]   Go to DesiringGod.org to read it or Google the title, "10 Questions on Prayer with Tim
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.360]   Keller."
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.520]   And if you missed any of the episodes this week, all five of them are embedded in the
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.680]   bottom of that post.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.480]   And speaking of reading the Bible, we'll be back on Monday with Pastor John and a question
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.440]   from a listener who has really never read the Bible for themselves.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.440]   Where should he start?
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.440]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:56.440]   We'll see you on Monday.
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.500]   Thank you for watching.
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:57.500]   God bless.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.060]   [End of Audio]
