[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440]   Do gender roles apply beyond marriage?
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.460]   I think most of us would confirm that biological differences play a specific place in defining
[00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.740]   the roles of husbands and wives within the marriage covenant, but what about gender distinctions
[00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.940]   in broader society and in the workplace?
[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.860]   It's a question from an anonymous young woman who asks this.
[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.860]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.800]   My question is whether gender alone should affect the way a Christian views his or her
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.320]   identity, and should gender alone change the way he or she behaves, even outside of marriage?
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.120]   If so, how and why?
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.280]   It seems most questions of this type get answered related to gender roles within the family
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.480]   and not at the level of mere gender alone, even among singles.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.320]   Pastor John, what would you say to her?
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.080]   Well, the answer is yes.
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:01:01.160]   Gender alone—that is, our sexual maleness or femaleness alone—is an essential part
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.920]   of our God-given identity, whether we're married or not.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:16.320]   You are who you are, everywhere you are, and with whomever you are.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.040]   Your core identity as male or female does not change according to your audience or your
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.040]   relationships.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.400]   You have God-given stability, constancy in who you are.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.480]   You're not a chameleon in your sexual personhood.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:46.080]   Your sexuality is rooted in your biological and anatomical identity, and more than that,
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.600]   it's rooted, as we are discovering more and more every day in sociological and psychological
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:59.080]   research, it's rooted in the distinct workings of the male and female brain and the psychological
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.360]   outworkings of those distinctions in all of life.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.400]   Just go to YouTube and type in almost anything like, "Are men and women different?" or
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.400]   "Are men and women brains?"
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:15.600]   And you'll get all kinds of amazing documented research about how different men and women
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.400]   are in their very biological, psychological natures.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:33.360]   Now, as Christians, we believe that the brain and the soul are not identical but are interrelated
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.600]   in mysterious ways that have profound correspondence.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:47.960]   All Christians agree that we are responsible morally before God for our thoughts and our
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:57.840]   feelings, even though our brains, that organ inside our skull, our brains and our hormones
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.000]   are involved in what we think and feel.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:13.200]   The mystery of how the brain and the supraphysical soul are related is probably incomprehensible
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.200]   to finite people.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.200]   That'd be my guess.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.960]   I don't think we'll ever comprehend fully this mystery.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:29.440]   But we know that what the brain does in thinking and desiring reflects reality in the personhood.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:36.520]   I mean a personhood that is more than physical, the personhood that will exist after death
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.760]   when we go to be with Christ before the resurrection.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.200]   In other words, we are persons in the presence of Christ enjoying Christ as far better, Paul
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.280]   says, even though we don't have bodies.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:56.600]   The brain is down there rotting in the grave, and our soul, our personhood, is in heaven
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.600]   with Christ.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.440]   And the differences that exist in general between men's and women's brains, along with
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:12.120]   the innate differences that mark our lives, are profoundly woven together with the supraphysical
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.680]   personhood.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:22.520]   So my answer is yes, our sexual identity as male and female is part of our true God-given,
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:29.240]   body-based, brain-based, soul-based identity, whether we are married or single.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.080]   It is relevant for all our relationships, not just one of them.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:42.840]   And when we are spiritually and physically and psychologically whole and healthy, this
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.400]   will manifest itself with scarcely any self-consciousness.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.640]   A mature, healthy woman does not consciously try to be a woman.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.520]   She just is what she is, and so with a mature, healthy man.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.640]   Now let me come at it one other way.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.880]   Let's come at it from Ephesians 5 like this.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.880]   Paul gave us a picture of distinct manhood and womanhood in marriage, a picture that
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:16.560]   is relevant, I'm going to argue, relevant for men and women outside marriage.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.920]   Here's what he wrote.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.720]   This is Ephesians 5:22 following.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.080]   "Wives, submit to your own husbands as to the Lord, for the husband is the head of the
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.880]   wife, even as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:38.800]   Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in everything to their
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.800]   husbands."
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:48.560]   Therefore, that's the dynamic of leadership and glad support for that leadership of the
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.560]   husband.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.760]   The husband's leadership, the wife's glad support for that leadership.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.920]   Now keep reading.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:03.560]   "Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her."
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.720]   Now there's the dynamic of protection.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:13.080]   Christ dies to save her, dies to rescue her, dies to protect her from the devil and from
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.640]   sin and from hell in the analogy with the church.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:24.300]   And so husbands are willing to die to rescue, die to save, die to protect her in every kind
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.400]   of way she may need it.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.360]   "He who loves his wife loves himself."
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.880]   We're at verse 29 now.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:37.800]   "For no one ever hated his own flesh but nourishes and cherishes it just as Christ does the church."
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.720]   Now there's the third element.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.200]   So first we saw leadership, then we saw protection.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.000]   Now here's the dynamic of provision.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.680]   A husband feels a special God-given responsibility.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:58.920]   I say special, not soul God-given responsibility, but a special, unique responsibility in the
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:07.160]   family to be a nourisher, a cherisher, a provider for his wife and the family.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:15.560]   So in my little book, What's the Difference?, I define manhood or masculinity like this.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:22.160]   At the heart of mature masculinity is a sense of benevolent responsibility to lead, provide
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.560]   for, and protect women in ways appropriate to a man's different relationships.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:35.880]   And I define, accordingly, womanhood or femaleness or femininity like this.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:43.880]   At the heart of mature womanhood or femaleness or femininity is a freeing disposition to
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:53.000]   affirm, receive, and nurture strength and leadership from worthy men in ways appropriate
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.080]   to a woman's differing relationships.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:02.920]   Now you can hear in each of those definitions that a man's manhood and a woman's womanhood
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:09.840]   are relevant to all their relationships, but in differing ways.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:17.400]   And this follows from the fact that there is nothing magical about a wedding ceremony
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.680]   that turns a man into a man or a woman into a woman.
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:27.720]   What a woman has been becoming all her life is what she will be in marriage.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:33.200]   What a man has been becoming all his life, he will be in marriage.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:40.200]   They can't turn on manhood and they can't turn on womanhood like a switch on their honeymoon.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:46.960]   When a woman contemplates marrying a man, she doesn't have to do it blindfolded.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.080]   She can watch the man for a year or two years.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:56.320]   She can be involved in dating relationships or an engagement relationship.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:04.880]   And during all that time, a discerning woman can see the evidences of whether a man's instincts
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:14.720]   and inclinations revealed a deep-seated sense of benevolent responsibility to lead and provide
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:21.480]   for and protect women in ways appropriate to his different relationships.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:27.500]   She can see the trajectory of his life and what kind of leader and provider and protector
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.640]   he will be in marriage.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:37.960]   Neither he nor she suddenly becomes a biblical man or woman on the day they are married.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:43.720]   So for these reasons, my answer to her is yes.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:53.840]   Inside and outside marriage, our sexual identity as male and female are wonderful, inescapable
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:59.340]   parts of who we are in every relationship.
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:06.160]   And the best way to become the kind of men and women we ought to be in all the relationships
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:15.200]   of life is to immerse ourselves gladly in all of Scripture, absorbing all of its implications
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:22.560]   for manhood and womanhood, and then fix our eyes on men and women who walk in the most
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.840]   biblically mature way.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.840]   That's beautiful.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.240]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:31.440]   And I should say here that Pastor John has written and edited a 600-page book on these
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.400]   themes, which is titled Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood, and then also a 100-page
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:41.240]   book version of that called 50 Crucial Questions.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.120]   You can download both of those books entirely for free at desiringgod.org/books.
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:51.160]   Yes, the whole thing entirely free times two.

[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:15.640]   How can God be good and sovereign over all things and also allow intense personal suffering
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.640]   into people's lives?
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:21.120]   It's a heavy and important question from the real world, and it's one we get a lot.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.600]   And it's a question in the inbox for Monday on the other side of the weekend.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.960]   We'll address that question.
