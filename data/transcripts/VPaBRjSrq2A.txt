[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - What kind of computation do you think
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   the fundamental laws of physics might emerge from?
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.900]   So just to clarify, so you've done a lot of fascinating work
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.400]   with kind of discrete kinds of computation that,
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.080]   you know, you could sell your automata,
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.080]   and we'll talk about it, have this very clean structure.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.400]   It's such a nice way to demonstrate that simple rules
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.560]   can create immense complexity.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.560]   But what, you know, is that actually,
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.440]   are cellular automata sufficiently general
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.000]   to describe the kinds of computation
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.640]   that might create the laws of physics?
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.840]   Just to give, can you give a sense of
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.880]   what kind of computation do you think
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.720]   would create the laws of physics?
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.640]   - So this is a slightly complicated issue,
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.600]   because as soon as you have universal computation,
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.640]   you can, in principle, simulate anything with anything.
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.080]   But it is not a natural thing to do,
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.920]   and if you're asking, were you to try to find
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.400]   our physical universe by looking at possible programs
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.260]   in the computational universe of all possible programs,
[00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.300]   would the ones that correspond to our universe
[00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.320]   be small and simple enough that we might find them
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.600]   by searching that computational universe?
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.500]   We gotta have the right basis, so to speak.
[00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.800]   We have to have the right language in effect
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.840]   for describing computation for that to be feasible.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.880]   So the thing that I've been interested in for a long time
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.460]   is what are the most structuralist structures
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.720]   that we can create with computation?
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.520]   So in other words, if you say a cellular automaton
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.400]   has a bunch of cells that are arrayed on a grid,
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.040]   and it's very, you know, and every cell is updated
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.440]   in synchrony at a particular, you know,
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.400]   when there's a click of a clock, so to speak,
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.480]   and it goes a tick of a clock,
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.000]   and every cell gets updated at the same time.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.440]   That's a very specific, very rigid kind of thing.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.880]   But my guess is that when we look at physics,
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.080]   and we look at things like space and time,
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.420]   that what's underneath space and time
[00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.080]   is something as structureless as possible.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.040]   That what we see, what emerges for us as physical space,
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.380]   for example, comes from something
[00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.940]   that is sort of arbitrarily unstructured underneath.
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.800]   And so I've been for a long time interested in kind of
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.220]   what are the most structuralist structures
[00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.620]   that we can set up?
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.820]   And actually what I had thought about for ages
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.580]   is using graphs, networks, where essentially,
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.100]   so let's talk about space, for example.
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.860]   So what is space?
[00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.360]   Is a kind of a question one might ask.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.580]   Back in the early days of quantum mechanics, for example,
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.900]   people said, "Oh, for sure, space is gonna be discrete,
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.820]   "'cause all these other things we're finding are discrete."
[00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.880]   But that never worked out in physics.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.560]   And so space and physics today is always treated
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.940]   as this continuous thing, just like Euclid imagined it.
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.080]   I mean, the very first thing Euclid says
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.580]   in his sort of common notions is, you know,
[00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.740]   "A point is something which has no part."
[00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.340]   In other words, there are points that are arbitrarily small
[00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.820]   and there's a continuum of possible positions of points.
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.780]   And the question is, is that true?
[00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.540]   And so, for example, if we look at, I don't know,
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.460]   fluid like air or water,
[00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.100]   we might say, "Oh, it's a continuous fluid.
[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.260]   "We can pour it, we can do all kinds of things continuously."
[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.620]   But actually we know, 'cause we know the physics of it,
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.500]   that it consists of a bunch of discrete molecules
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.980]   bouncing around and only in the aggregate
[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.420]   is it behaving like a continuum.
[00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.660]   And so the possibility exists that that's true of space too.
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.340]   People haven't managed to make that work
[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.460]   with existing frameworks and physics,
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.540]   but I've been interested in whether one can imagine
[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.780]   that underneath space and also underneath time
[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.700]   is something more structureless.
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.540]   And the question is, is it computational?
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.740]   So there are a couple of possibilities.
[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:43.880]   It could be computational,
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.400]   somehow fundamentally equivalent to a Turing machine,
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.420]   or it could be fundamentally not.
[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.820]   So how could it not be?
[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.620]   It could not be, so a Turing machine
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.140]   essentially deals with integers, whole numbers, some level.
[00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.060]   And it can do things like it can add one to a number,
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.500]   it can do things like this.
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.940]   - It can also store whatever the heck it did.
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.460]   - Yes, it has an infinite storage.
[00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.580]   But when one thinks about doing physics
[00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.580]   or sort of idealized physics or idealized mathematics,
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.440]   one can deal with real numbers,
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.660]   numbers with an infinite number of digits,
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.940]   numbers which are absolutely precise.
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.660]   And one can say, we can take this number
[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.340]   and we can multiply it by itself.
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.140]   - Are you comfortable with infinity in this context?
[00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.140]   Are you comfortable in the context of computation?
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.400]   Do you think infinity plays a part?
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.740]   - I think that the role of infinity is complicated.
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.860]   Infinity is useful in conceptualizing things.
[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.060]   It's not actualizable.
[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.700]   Almost by definition, it's not actualizable.
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.740]   - But do you think infinity is part of the thing
[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.380]   that might underlie the laws of physics?
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.300]   - I think that, no.
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.660]   I think there are many questions that you ask about,
[00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.940]   you might ask about physics,
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.420]   which inevitably involve infinity.
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.420]   Like when you say, is faster than light travel possible?
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.180]   You could say, given the laws of physics,
[00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.480]   can you make something even arbitrarily large,
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.700]   even quotes infinitely large,
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.180]   that will make faster than light travel possible?
[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.460]   Then you're thrown into dealing with infinity
[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.580]   as a kind of theoretical question.
[00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.740]   But I mean, talking about sort of
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.580]   what's underneath space and time
[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.060]   and how one can make a computational infrastructure,
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.540]   one possibility is that you can't make
[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.680]   a computational infrastructure in a Turing machine sense,
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.580]   that you really have to be dealing with precise real numbers,
[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.340]   you're dealing with partial differential equations,
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.580]   which have precise real numbers
[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.600]   at arbitrarily closely separated points.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.260]   You have a continuum for everything.
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.120]   Could be that that's what happens,
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.700]   that there's sort of a continuum for everything
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.140]   and precise real numbers for everything.
[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.100]   And then the things I'm thinking about are wrong.
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.620]   And that's the risk you take
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.680]   if you're trying to sort of do things about nature,
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.180]   is you might just be wrong.
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.060]   For me personally, it's kind of a strange thing,
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.500]   'cause I've spent a lot of my life building technology
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.580]   where you can do something that nobody cares about,
[00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.980]   but you can't be sort of wrong in that sense,
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.460]   in the sense you build your technology
[00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.860]   and it does what it does.
[00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.100]   But I think this question of what
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.100]   the sort of underlying computational infrastructure
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.440]   for the universe might be,
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.900]   so it's sort of inevitable it's gonna be fairly abstract,
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.820]   because if you're gonna get all these things,
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.380]   like there are three dimensions of space,
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.860]   there are electrons, there are muons,
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.680]   there are quarks, there are this,
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.900]   you don't get to, if the model for the universe is simple,
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.900]   you don't get to have sort of a line of code
[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:39.820]   for each of those things.
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.900]   You don't get to have sort of the muon case,
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.900]   the tau lepton case and so on.
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.780]   - All of those things have to be emergent somehow.
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:48.620]   - Right.
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.860]   - So something deeper.
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.060]   - Right, so that means it's sort of inevitable
[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.860]   that it's a little hard to talk about
[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.260]   what the sort of underlying
[00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260]   structuralist structure actually is.
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.300]   - Do you think human beings have the cognitive capacity
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.300]   to understand, if we're to discover it,
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.860]   to understand the kinds of simple structure
[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.740]   from which these laws can emerge?
[00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.300]   Like, do you think that's a hopeless pursuit?
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.220]   - Well, here's what I think.
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.660]   I think that, I mean, I'm right in the middle
[00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:15.500]   of this right now.
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.340]   So I'm telling you that I--
[00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.900]   - Do you think you're hit a wall?
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.180]   - Yeah, I mean, this human has a hard time understanding
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.460]   a bunch of the things that are going on.
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.900]   But what happens in understanding is,
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.140]   one builds waypoints.
[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.300]   I mean, if you said,
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.220]   understand modern 21st century mathematics,
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.780]   starting from counting back in,
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.900]   whenever counting was invented 50,000 years ago,
[00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.980]   whatever it was, right?
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.540]   That will be really difficult.
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.620]   But what happens is we build waypoints
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.340]   that allow us to get to higher levels of understanding.
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.540]   And we see the same thing happening in language.
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.900]   You know, when we invent a word for something,
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.260]   it provides kind of a cognitive anchor,
[00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.500]   a kind of a waypoint that lets us, you know,
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.640]   like a podcast or something.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.700]   You could be explaining, well, it's a thing,
[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.180]   which this works this way, that way, the other way.
[00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.780]   But as soon as you have the word podcast
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.460]   and people kind of societally understand it,
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.420]   you start to be able to build on top of that.
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.260]   And so I think,
[00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.780]   and that's kind of the story of science actually too.
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.820]   I mean, science is about building these kinds of waypoints
[00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:19.240]   where we find this sort of cognitive mechanism
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.320]   for understanding something,
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.460]   then we can build on top of it.
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.780]   You know, we have the idea of, I don't know,
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.380]   differential equations, we can build on top of that.
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.020]   We have this idea or that idea.
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.400]   So my hope is that if it is the case
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.060]   that we have to go all the way
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.780]   sort of from the sand to the computer,
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.580]   and there's no waypoints in between, then we're toast.
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:40.940]   We won't be able to do that.
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.260]   - Well, eventually we might.
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.700]   So if we're, us clever apes are good enough
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.580]   for building those abstractions,
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:50.220]   eventually from sand we'll get to the computer, right?
[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:51.820]   And it just might be a longer journey than-
[00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.820]   - The question is whether it is something that,
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.500]   you asked whether our human brains
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.300]   will quote, "Understand what's going on."
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.620]   And that's a different question,
[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:04.220]   because for that, it requires steps that are,
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.780]   for whether it's sort of,
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.140]   from which we can construct
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.420]   a human understandable narrative.
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.180]   And that's something that I think
[00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.100]   I am somewhat hopeful that that will be possible.
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:19.120]   Although, as of literally today, if you ask me,
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.120]   I'm confronted with things that I don't understand very well.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.820]   - So this is a small pattern in a computation
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.880]   trying to understand the rules
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.820]   under which the computation functions.
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.500]   And it's an interesting possibility
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.700]   under which kinds of computations
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.700]   such a creature can understand itself.
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.620]   - My guess is that within,
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.260]   so we didn't talk much about computational irreducibility,
[00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.860]   but it's a consequence of this principle
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.420]   of computational equivalence.
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.660]   And it's sort of a core idea
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.140]   that one has to understand, I think, which is,
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.580]   question is, you're doing a computation,
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.820]   you can figure out what happens in the computation
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.820]   just by running every step in the computation
[00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.460]   and seeing what happens.
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:02.780]   Or you can say, let me jump ahead and figure out,
[00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.660]   have something smarter that figures out
[00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.020]   what's gonna happen before it actually happens.
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.380]   And a lot of traditional science
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:13.260]   has been about that act of computational reducibility.
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.820]   It's like, we've got these equations
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:16.900]   and we can just solve them
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.140]   and we can figure out what's gonna happen.
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.460]   We don't have to trace all of those steps,
[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.260]   we just jump ahead 'cause we solved these equations.
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.500]   Okay, so one of the things that is a consequence
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.060]   of the principle of computational equivalence
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.980]   is you don't always get to do that.
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:32.260]   Many, many systems will be computationally irreducible
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.240]   in the sense that the only way to find out what they do
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.520]   is just follow each step and see what happens.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.360]   Why is that?
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.740]   Well, if you're saying,
[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.540]   well, we, with our brains, we're a lot smarter.
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.260]   We don't have to mess around
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.000]   like the little cellular automaton
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.020]   going through and updating all those cells.
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:50.980]   We can just use the power of our brains to jump ahead.
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.860]   But if the principle of computational equivalence is right,
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.120]   that's not gonna be correct
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.340]   because it means that there's us
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.460]   doing our computation in our brains,
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.240]   there's a little cellular automaton doing its computation,
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.620]   and the principle of computational equivalence says,
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.540]   these two computations are fundamentally equivalent.
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.320]   So that means we don't get to say,
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.140]   we're a lot smarter than the cellular automaton
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.900]   and jump ahead 'cause we're just doing computation
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.700]   that's of the same sophistication
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.720]   as the cellular automaton itself.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.300]   - That's computational irreducibility.
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.740]   It's fascinating, and that's a really powerful idea.
[00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:28.660]   I think that's both depressing and humbling and so on,
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.300]   that we're all, we and a cellular automaton are the same.
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.000]   But the question we're talking about,
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.020]   the fundamental laws of physics,
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.100]   is kind of the reverse question.
[00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.300]   You're not predicting what's gonna happen.
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.260]   You have to run the universe for that.
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.280]   But saying, can I understand what rules likely generated me?
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.060]   - I understand, but the problem is,
[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.280]   to know whether you're right,
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.020]   you have to have some computational reducibility
[00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.020]   because we are embedded in the universe.
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.060]   If the only way to know whether we get the universe
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.940]   is just to run the universe, we don't get to do that
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.980]   'cause it just ran for 14.6 billion years or whatever,
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.680]   and we can't rerun it, so to speak.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.020]   So we have to hope that there are pockets
[00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.380]   of computational reducibility
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:11.980]   sufficient to be able to say,
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.020]   yes, I can recognize those are electrons there.
[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.740]   And I think that it's a feature
[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.700]   of computational irreducibility.
[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.020]   It's sort of a mathematical feature
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.740]   that there are always an infinite collection
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.780]   of pockets of reducibility.
[00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.660]   The question of whether they land in the right place
[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.460]   and whether we can sort of build a theory
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.100]   based on them is unclear.
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.860]   But to this point about whether we,
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.260]   as observers in the universe,
[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.740]   built out of the same stuff as the universe,
[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:39.620]   can figure out the universe, so to speak,
[00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.620]   that relies on these pockets of reducibility.
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.180]   Without the pockets of reducibility,
[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.240]   it won't work, can't work.
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.440]   But I think this question about how observers operate,
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.120]   it's one of the features of science
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.100]   over the last hundred years particularly,
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.720]   has been that every time we get more realistic
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.100]   about observers, we learn a bit more about science.
[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.740]   So for example, relativity was all about
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.860]   observers don't get to say when,
[00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:07.420]   you know, what's simultaneous with what.
[00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.660]   They have to just wait for the light signal to arrive
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.780]   to decide what's simultaneous.
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.580]   Or for example, in thermodynamics,
[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.420]   observers don't get to say the position
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.060]   of every single molecule in a gas.
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.380]   They can only see the kind of large scale features
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.700]   and that's why the second law of thermodynamics,
[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.980]   law of entropy increase and so on works.
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.420]   If you could see every individual molecule,
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:32.680]   you wouldn't conclude something about thermodynamics.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.340]   You would conclude, oh, these molecules
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:35.700]   just all doing these particular things.
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.420]   You wouldn't be able to see this aggregate fact.
[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.100]   So I strongly expect that,
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.500]   and in fact, in the theories that I have,
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.900]   that one has to be more realistic
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.860]   about the computation and other aspects of observers
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:52.580]   in order to actually make a correspondence
[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:53.580]   between what we experience.
[00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:57.400]   In fact, my little team and I have a little theory
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.820]   right now about how quantum mechanics may work,
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:03.340]   which is a very wonderfully bizarre idea
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:07.460]   about how the sort of thread of human consciousness
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.540]   relates to what we observe in the universe.
[00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.540]   But there's several steps to explain what that's about.
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.140]   - What do you make of the mess of the observer
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.700]   at the lower level of quantum mechanics?
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:23.700]   Sort of the textbook definition with quantum mechanics
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:27.540]   kind of says that there's two worlds.
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.940]   One is the world that actually is,
[00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.920]   and the other is that's observed.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.820]   What do you make sense of that kind of observing?
[00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.900]   - Well, I think actually the ideas we've recently had
[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.580]   might actually give away into this.
[00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:47.220]   And that's, I don't know yet.
[00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.060]   I mean, I think that's, it's a mess.
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.540]   I mean, the fact is there is a,
[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.620]   one of the things that's interesting,
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.740]   and when people look at these models
[00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:59.380]   that I started talking about 30 years ago now,
[00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.980]   they say, "Oh no, that can't possibly be right.
[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.660]   "What about quantum mechanics?"
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:04.500]   Right?
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.460]   And you say, "Okay, tell me what is the essence
[00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:07.300]   "of quantum mechanics?
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.220]   "What do you want me to be able to reproduce
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:12.340]   "to know that I've got quantum mechanics, so to speak?"
[00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:14.140]   Well, and that question comes up,
[00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:15.540]   comes up very operational actually,
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:16.700]   because we've been doing a bunch of stuff
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.060]   with quantum computing,
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.360]   and there are all these companies that say,
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.020]   "We have a quantum computer."
[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.020]   We say, "Let's connect to your API,
[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.980]   "and let's actually run it."
[00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.260]   And they're like, "Well, maybe you shouldn't do that yet.
[00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:29.740]   "We're not quite ready yet."
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.220]   And one of the questions that I've been curious about is,
[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.740]   if I have five minutes with a quantum computer,
[00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.860]   how can I tell if it's really a quantum computer,
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.140]   or whether it's a simulator at the other end?
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:39.980]   Right?
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:40.860]   And turns out it's really hard.
[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:41.860]   It turns out there isn't,
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.900]   it's like a lot of these questions about sort of,
[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.740]   what is intelligence, what's life?
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.020]   - That's a boring test for a quantum computer.
[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.060]   - That's right, that's right.
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.460]   It's like, are you really a quantum computer?
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.540]   And I think-- - Or just a simulation, yeah.
[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:55.380]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:56.500]   Is it just a simulation,
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.140]   or is it really a quantum computer?
[00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.020]   Same issue all over again.
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:03.780]   But that, so, you know, this whole issue
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:06.140]   about the sort of mathematical structure
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.580]   of quantum mechanics,
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:12.340]   and the completely separate thing that is our experience,
[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:14.740]   in which we think definite things happen,
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.100]   whereas quantum mechanics doesn't say
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.540]   definite things ever happen.
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.380]   Quantum mechanics is all about the amplitudes
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.020]   for different things to happen.
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.460]   But yet, our thread of consciousness
[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.340]   operates as if definite things are happening.
[00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.220]   - To linger on the point,
[00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.740]   you've kind of mentioned the structure
[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:35.660]   that could underlie everything,
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.860]   and this idea that it could perhaps have something
[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.660]   like the structure of a graph.
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:43.660]   Can you elaborate why your intuition is
[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:46.340]   that there's a graph structure of nodes and edges,
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:48.300]   and what it might represent?
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.340]   - Right, okay.
[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:50.900]   So the question is,
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:54.340]   what is, in a sense, the most structuralist structure
[00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.380]   you can imagine, right?
[00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:01.220]   So, and in fact, what I've recently realized
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.580]   in the last year or so,
[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.540]   I have a new most structuralist structure.
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.260]   - By the way, the question itself is a beautiful one
[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.700]   and a powerful one in itself.
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.420]   So even without an answer,
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.700]   just the question is a really strong question.
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:14.540]   - Right, right.
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.140]   - But what's your new idea?
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.060]   - Well, it has to do with hypergraphs.
[00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:23.060]   Essentially, what is interesting about the sort of model
[00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:26.500]   that I have now is it's a little bit like
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.140]   what happened with computation.
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.940]   Everything that I think of as,
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.340]   oh, well, maybe the model is this,
[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.500]   I discover it's equivalent.
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.420]   And that's quite encouraging,
[00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.180]   because it's like I could say,
[00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.500]   well, I'm gonna look at trivalent graphs
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.700]   with three edges for each node and so on,
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.780]   or I could look at this special kind of graph,
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:48.060]   or I could look at this kind of algebraic structure,
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:51.380]   and turns out that the things I'm now looking at,
[00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.220]   everything that I've imagined
[00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.260]   that is a plausible type of structureless structure
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.820]   is equivalent to this.
[00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:59.140]   So what is it?
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.820]   Well, a typical way to think about it is,
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:08.260]   well, so you might have some collection of tuples,
[00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:14.380]   collection of, let's say numbers.
[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:19.380]   So you might have one, three, five, two, three, four,
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.500]   little, just collections of numbers,
[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.780]   triples of numbers, let's say,
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.580]   quadruples of numbers, pairs of numbers, whatever.
[00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:31.020]   And you have all these sort of floating little tuples.
[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.020]   They're not in any particular order.
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:37.780]   And that sort of floating collection of tuples,
[00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.820]   and I told you this was abstract,
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.900]   represents the whole universe.
[00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.220]   The only thing that relates them
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.820]   is when a symbol is the same, it's the same, so to speak.
[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:50.340]   So if you have two tuples,
[00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.500]   and they contain the same symbol,
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.060]   let's say at the same position of the tuple,
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.540]   the first element of the tuple,
[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:57.860]   then that represents a relation.
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.860]   Okay, so let me try and peel this back.
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:01.940]   - Wow, okay.
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.860]   (laughing)
[00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:06.820]   - I told you it's abstract, but this is the--
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.220]   - So the relationship is formed
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.820]   by some aspect of sameness.
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:13.660]   - Right, but so think about it in terms of a graph.
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.620]   So a graph, a bunch of nodes,
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.340]   let's say you number each node, okay?
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:20.500]   Then what is a graph?
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.340]   A graph is a set of pairs that say,
[00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:26.780]   this node has an edge connecting it to this other node.
[00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:30.940]   So that's the, and a graph is just a collection
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:33.540]   of those pairs that say,
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.540]   this node connects to this other node.
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:38.020]   So this is a generalization of that,
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.940]   in which instead of having pairs,
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.020]   you have arbitrary and tuples.
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.820]   That's it, that's the whole story.
[00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.300]   And now the question is, okay,
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.620]   so that might represent the state of the universe.
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:51.980]   How does the universe evolve?
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:53.500]   What does the universe do?
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:56.140]   And so the answer is that what I'm looking at
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:00.180]   is transformation rules on these hypergraphs.
[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.860]   In other words, you say this,
[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:07.380]   whenever you see a piece of this hypergraph
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.300]   that looks like this,
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.220]   turn it into a piece of a hypergraph that looks like this.
[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:15.140]   So on a graph, it might be, when you see the subgraph,
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.100]   when you see this thing with a bunch of edges hanging out
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.580]   in this particular way,
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:22.340]   then rewrite it as this other graph, okay?
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:24.540]   And so that's the whole story.
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:29.100]   So the question is, what, so now you say, I mean,
[00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:32.180]   as I say, this is quite abstract.
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.700]   And one of the questions is,
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.540]   where do you do those updating?
[00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:38.020]   So you've got this giant graph.
[00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:39.380]   - What triggers the updating?
[00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:42.180]   Like what's the ripple effect of it?
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:43.540]   Is it?
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:44.380]   - Yeah.
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:48.980]   I suspect everything's discrete, even in time, so.
[00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:51.420]   - Okay, so the question is, where do you do the updates?
[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.020]   And the answer is, the rule is,
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.020]   you do them wherever they apply.
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:58.540]   And you do them, the order in which the updates is done
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.020]   is not defined.
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.780]   That is, you can do them,
[00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:05.180]   so there may be many possible orderings for these updates.
[00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.180]   Now, the point is,
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:09.020]   imagine you're an observer in this universe.
[00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:12.260]   So, and you say, did something get updated?
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.580]   Well, you don't in any sense know
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.800]   until you yourself have been updated.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.620]   - Right.
[00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:21.940]   - So in fact, all that you can be sensitive to
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.160]   is essentially the causal network
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:29.160]   of how an event over there affects an event that's in you.
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.100]   - That doesn't even feel like observation.
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:33.660]   That's like, that's something else.
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:35.220]   You're just part of the whole thing.
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:37.700]   - Yes, you're part of it, but even to have,
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:41.460]   so the end result of that is all you're sensitive to
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.940]   is this causal network of what event affects
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.580]   what other event.
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:47.420]   I'm not making a big statement
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.920]   about sort of the structure of the observer.
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.260]   I'm simply saying, I'm simply making the argument
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:56.820]   that what happens, the microscopic order of these rewrites
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.980]   is not something that any observer,
[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.580]   any conceivable observer in this universe
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.280]   can be affected by.
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.400]   Because the only thing the observer can be affected by
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:11.180]   is this causal network of how the events
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:14.100]   in the observer are affected by other events
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.060]   that happen in the universe.
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:16.300]   So the only thing you have to look at
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.620]   is the causal network.
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:20.580]   You don't really have to look at this microscopic rewriting
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:21.400]   that's happening.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.140]   So these rewrites are happening wherever they,
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:25.660]   they happen wherever they feel like.
[00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.820]   - Causal network, is there,
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:30.900]   you said that there's not really,
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.580]   so the idea would be an undefined,
[00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:37.380]   like what gets updated, the sequence of things is undefined.
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:39.660]   - Yes.
[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.420]   - Is that's what you mean by the causal network,
[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:42.260]   but then the--
[00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:45.520]   - No, the causal network is given that an update has happened
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.900]   that's an event.
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:50.580]   Then the question is, is that event causally related to?
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:53.380]   Does that event, if that event didn't happen,
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.820]   then some future event couldn't happen yet.
[00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:56.660]   - Gotcha.
[00:22:56.660 --> 00:23:00.020]   - And so you build up this network of what affects what.
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:00.860]   Okay?
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:04.480]   And so what that does, so when you build up that network,
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.380]   that's kind of the observable aspect of the universe
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:08.220]   in some sense.
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.040]   - Gotcha.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.780]   - And so then you can ask questions about, you know,
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:14.820]   how robust is that observable network
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:16.740]   of what's happening in the universe.
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.620]   Okay, so here's where it starts getting kind of interesting.
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:23.340]   So for certain kinds of microscopic rewriting rules,
[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.780]   the order of rewrites does not matter
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.300]   to the causal network.
[00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:31.060]   And so this is, okay, mathematical logic moment,
[00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.340]   this is equivalent to the Church-Rosser property
[00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:35.700]   or the confluence property of rewrite rules.
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:37.980]   And it's the same reason that if you are simplifying
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.120]   an algebraic expression, for example,
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.460]   you can say, oh, let me expand those terms out,
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.100]   let me factor those pieces.
[00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:45.940]   Doesn't matter what order you do that in,
[00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:47.640]   you'll always get the same answer.
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.720]   And that's, it's the same fundamental phenomenon
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.560]   that causes for certain kinds of microscopic rewrite rules
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.820]   that causes the causal network to be independent
[00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:00.600]   of the microscopic order of rewritings.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.800]   - Why is that property important?
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:04.760]   - 'Cause it implies special relativity.
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:10.800]   I mean, the reason it's important is that that property,
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:16.760]   special relativity says you can look at these sort of,
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.840]   you can look at different reference frames.
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:21.560]   You can have different, you can be looking at your notion
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.540]   of what space and what's time can be different,
[00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.480]   depending on whether you're traveling at a certain speed,
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.860]   depending on whether you're doing this, that, and the other.
[00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:31.000]   But nevertheless, the laws of physics are the same.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.900]   That's what the principle of special relativity says,
[00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.240]   is the laws of physics are the same
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.240]   independent of your reference frame.
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:41.680]   Well, turns out this sort of change
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.880]   of the microscopic rewriting order
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.100]   is essentially equivalent to a change of reference frame,
[00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.700]   or at least there's a sub part of how that works
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:50.640]   that's equivalent to change of reference frame.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:54.080]   So, somewhat surprisingly, and sort of for the first time
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:57.040]   in forever, it's possible for an underlying
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.440]   microscopic theory to imply special relativity,
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.520]   to be able to derive it.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.960]   It's not something you put in as a,
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.320]   this is a, it's something where this other property,
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.600]   causal invariance, which is also the property
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.080]   that implies that there's a single thread of time
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:14.440]   in the universe.
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.760]   It might not be the case.
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:20.320]   That's what would lead to the possibility
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.720]   of an observer thinking that definite stuff happens.
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.200]   Otherwise, you've got all these possible rewriting orders,
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.280]   and who's to say which one occurred.
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.680]   But with this causal invariance property,
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.440]   there's a notion of a definite thread of time.
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.880]   - It sounds like that kind of idea of time,
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.920]   even space, would be emergent from the system.
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:38.760]   - Oh yeah.
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.440]   - So it's not a fundamental part of the system.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.440]   - No, no, at a fundamental level,
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.200]   all you've got is a bunch of nodes connected
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.120]   by hyper edges or whatever.
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.760]   - So there's no time, there's no space.
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.000]   - That's right.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.760]   But the thing is that it's just like imagining,
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.840]   imagine you're just dealing with a graph,
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:56.800]   and imagine you have something like a honeycomb graph,
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.800]   where you have a bunch of hexagons.
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.840]   That graph, at a microscopic level,
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:04.160]   it's just a bunch of nodes connected to other nodes.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.440]   But at a macroscopic level,
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:09.160]   you say that looks like a honeycomb, you know, lattice.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:11.520]   It looks like a two-dimensional, you know,
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.880]   manifold of some kind.
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.760]   It looks like a two-dimensional thing.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:15.840]   If you connect it differently,
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.560]   if you just connect all the nodes one to another,
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.000]   in kind of a sort of linked list type structure,
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:21.840]   then you'd say, well,
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.200]   that looks like a one-dimensional space.
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.720]   But at the microscopic level,
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.920]   all these are just networks with nodes.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.400]   The macroscopic level,
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.120]   they look like something that's like
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.680]   one of our sort of familiar kinds of space.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.280]   And it's the same thing with these hypergraphs.
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.040]   Now, if you ask me, have I found one
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.680]   that gives me three-dimensional space,
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.320]   the answer is not yet.
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:43.800]   So we don't know, you know, this is one of these things,
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.480]   we're kind of betting against nature, so to speak.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.480]   And I have no way to know.
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:51.920]   So there are many other properties of this kind of system
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:56.040]   that are very beautiful, actually, and very suggestive.
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.520]   And it will be very elegant if this turns out to be right,
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.200]   because it's very clean.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.360]   I mean, you start with nothing and everything gets built up.
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.120]   Everything about space, everything about time,
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.520]   everything about matter,
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.520]   it's all just emergent from the properties
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.520]   of this extremely low-level system.
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:14.360]   And that will be pretty cool
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.520]   if that's the way our universe works.
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.880]   Now, do I, on the other hand,
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:22.880]   the thing that I find very confusing is,
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.440]   let's say we succeed.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.240]   Let's say we can say this particular
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:32.320]   sort of hypergraph rewriting rule gives the universe.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:35.360]   Just run that hypergraph rewriting rule for enough times,
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.200]   and you'll get everything.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.880]   You'll get this conversation we're having.
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.840]   You'll get everything.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.480]   It's that,
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:47.240]   if we get to that point and we look at what is this thing,
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.280]   what is this rule that we just have
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.640]   that is giving us our whole universe?
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.720]   How do we think about that thing?
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.240]   Let's say, turns out the minimal version of this,
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.880]   and this is kind of cool thing
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.600]   for a language designer like me,
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.560]   the minimal version of this model
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:03.560]   is actually a single line of orphan language code.
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.280]   So that's, which I wasn't sure was gonna happen that way,
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:10.520]   but it's, it's, that's, it's kind of, no.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.720]   We don't know what, we don't know what,
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.680]   that's, that's just the framework.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.240]   To know the actual particular hypergraph,
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.840]   it might be a longer,
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.760]   the specification of the rules might be slightly longer.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:24.200]   - How does that help you accept marveling
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.760]   in the beauty and the elegance of the simplicity
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.200]   that creates the universe?
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.320]   That does that help us predict anything?
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.520]   Not really, because of the irreducibility.
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.000]   - That's correct, that's correct.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.360]   But so the thing that is really strange to me,
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:39.720]   and I haven't wrapped my brain around this yet,
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.560]   is, you know, one is,
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.560]   one keeps on realizing that we're not special,
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.240]   in the sense that, you know,
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.880]   we don't live at the center of the universe,
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.480]   we don't blah, blah, blah.
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:55.080]   And yet, if we produce a rule for the universe,
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.400]   and it's quite simple,
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.840]   and we can write it down in a couple of lines or something,
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.560]   that feels very special.
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:04.720]   How did we come to get a simple universe,
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.560]   when many of the available universes, so to speak,
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.080]   are incredibly complicated?
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.400]   Might be, you know, a quintillion characters long.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.600]   Why did we get one of the ones that's simple?
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.840]   And so I haven't wrapped my brain around that issue yet.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:21.040]   - If indeed we are in such a simple,
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.160]   the universe is such a simple rule,
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:27.320]   is it possible that there is something outside of this,
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.960]   that we are in a kind of what people call,
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.080]   so the simulation, right?
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.760]   That we're just part of a computation
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.520]   that's being explored by a graduate student
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.280]   in an alternate universe?
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:40.280]   - Well, you know, the problem is,
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.760]   we don't get to say much about what's outside our universe,
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.800]   because by definition,
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.680]   our universe is what we exist within.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:50.720]   Now, can we make a sort of almost theological conclusion
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:54.380]   from being able to know how our particular universe works?
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:55.840]   Interesting question.
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:59.120]   I don't think that, if you ask the question,
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.680]   could we, and it relates again to this question
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.160]   about the extraterrestrial intelligence,
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.620]   you know, we've got the rule for the universe.
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.720]   Was it built in on purpose?
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.840]   Hard to say.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.360]   That's the same thing as saying,
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:13.600]   we see a signal from, you know,
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:18.320]   that we're receiving from some random star somewhere,
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.800]   and it's a series of pulses,
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.880]   and, you know, it's a periodic series of pulses, let's say.
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.080]   Was that done on purpose?
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.880]   Can we conclude something about the origin
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.320]   of that series of pulses?
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:32.040]   - Just because it's elegant does not necessarily mean
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.480]   that somebody created it,
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.320]   or that we can even comprehend what would create it.
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.600]   - Yeah, I mean, I think it's the ultimate version
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.120]   of the sort of identification
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.560]   of the technosignature question.
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:45.600]   It's the ultimate version of that,
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:47.960]   which is, was our universe a piece of technology,
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.660]   so to speak, and how on earth would we know?
[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:54.240]   Because, but I mean, it'll be, it's, I mean, you know,
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.100]   in the kind of crazy science fiction thing
[00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:57.960]   you could imagine, you could say,
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.040]   oh, somebody's going to have, you know,
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.260]   there's gonna be a signature there.
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:04.040]   It's gonna be, you know, made by so-and-so.
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:07.120]   But there's no way we could understand that, so to speak,
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.860]   and it's not clear what that would mean,
[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:12.760]   because the universe simply, you know,
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:16.080]   this, if we find a rule for the universe,
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.040]   we're not, we're simply saying that rule
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.720]   represents what our universe does.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.320]   We're not saying that that rule is something
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:26.160]   running on a big computer and making our universe.
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:29.240]   It's just saying that represents what our universe does,
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.760]   in the same sense that, you know,
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:33.360]   laws of classical mechanics, differential equations,
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:37.000]   whatever they are, represent what mechanical systems do.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.480]   It's not that the mechanical systems
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.120]   are somehow running solutions
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.840]   to those differential equations.
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.920]   Those differential equations are just representing
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.280]   the behavior of those systems.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.360]   - So what's the gap, in your sense,
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.740]   to linger on the fascinating,
[00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:52.760]   perhaps slightly sci-fi question?
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:55.280]   What's the gap between understanding
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.680]   the fundamental rules that create a universe
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:00.640]   and engineering a system,
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.800]   actually creating a simulation ourselves?
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.080]   You've talked about, sort of,
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.360]   you've talked about, you know,
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.080]   nanoengineering, kind of ideas that are kind of exciting,
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.520]   actually creating some ideas of computation
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.720]   in the physical space.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.440]   How hard is it, as an engineering problem,
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.440]   to create the universe,
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.520]   once you know the rules that create it?
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.920]   - Well, that's an interesting question.
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:24.400]   I think the substrate on which the universe is operating
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.660]   is not a substrate that we have access to.
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.680]   I mean, the only substrate we have
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.960]   is that same substrate that the universe is operating in.
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.020]   So, if the universe is a bunch of hypergraphs
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:37.420]   being rewritten, then we get to attach ourselves
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:39.960]   to those same hypergraphs being rewritten.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.360]   We don't get to,
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:44.600]   and if you ask the question, you know,
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:46.240]   is the code clean?
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.600]   You know, can we write nice, elegant code
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:50.600]   with efficient algorithms and so on?
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:53.440]   Well, that's an interesting question.
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.440]   How, you know, that's this question
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.280]   of how much computational reducibility
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:58.600]   there is in the system.
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.920]   - But, so I've seen some beautiful cellular automata
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:04.080]   that basically create copies of itself within itself, right?
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:07.600]   So, that's the question, whether it's possible to create,
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.800]   like, whether you need to understand the substrate
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.560]   or whether you can just--
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:12.400]   - Yeah, well, right.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.240]   I mean, so one of the things that is
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.960]   sort of one of my slightly sci-fi thoughts
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.800]   about the future, so to speak, is, you know,
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:22.280]   right now, if you poll typical people, you say,
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.320]   "Do you think it's important to find
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:25.580]   "the fundamental theory of physics?"
[00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:29.320]   You get, because I've done this poll, informally at least,
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.640]   it's curious, actually.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.500]   You get a decent fraction of people saying,
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.840]   "Oh, yeah, that would be pretty interesting."
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:38.360]   - I think that's becoming, surprisingly enough, more,
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:43.080]   I mean, a lot of people are interested in physics
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:44.920]   in a way that, like, without understanding it,
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:49.120]   just kind of watching scientists,
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.880]   a very small number of them, struggle to understand
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.160]   the nature of our reality.
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.400]   - Right, I mean, I think that's somewhat true,
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:58.680]   and in fact, in this project that I'm launching into
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:01.200]   to try and find the fundamental theory of physics,
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.040]   I'm going to do it as a very public project.
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.800]   I mean, it's gonna be live-streamed
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.560]   and all this kind of stuff, and I don't know
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.560]   what will happen, it'll be kind of fun.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.520]   I mean, I think that it's the interface
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:14.120]   to the world of this project.
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:18.000]   I mean, I figure one feature of this project is,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.240]   you know, unlike technology projects
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:21.980]   that basically are what they are,
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:23.920]   this is a project that might simply fail,
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.500]   because it might be the case that it generates
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:27.200]   all kinds of elegant mathematics,
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.440]   but it has absolutely nothing to do
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.880]   with the physical universe that we happen to live in.
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:32.640]   Well, okay, so we're talking about
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.920]   kind of the quest to find the fundamental theory of physics.
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.960]   First point is, you know, it's turned out
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:42.080]   it's kind of hard to find the fundamental theory of physics.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.440]   People weren't sure that that would be the case.
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:48.720]   Back in the early days of applying mathematics to science,
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:50.840]   1600s and so on, people were like,
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.720]   "Oh, in 100 years, we'll know everything there is to know
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:54.960]   "about how the universe works."
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.520]   Turned out to be harder than that,
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:58.800]   and people got kind of humble at some level,
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.000]   'cause every time we got to sort of a greater level
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.080]   of smallness in studying the universe,
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:05.080]   it seemed like the math got more complicated
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:06.920]   and everything got harder.
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:11.720]   When I was a kid, basically,
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:13.600]   I started doing particle physics,
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.800]   and when I was doing particle physics,
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.360]   I always thought finding the fundamental,
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.120]   fundamental theory of physics,
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:24.240]   that's a kooky business, we'll never be able to do that.
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:27.200]   But we can operate within these frameworks that we built
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.280]   for doing quantum field theory and general relativity
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.160]   and things like this, and it's all good,
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:33.400]   and we can figure out a lot of stuff.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.040]   - Did you even at that time have a sense
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.480]   that there's something behind that too?
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.400]   - Sure, I just didn't expect that.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.800]   I thought in some rather un,
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.560]   it's actually kind of crazy thinking back on it,
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:48.520]   because it's kind of like there was this long period
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:50.360]   in civilization where people thought the ancients
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.000]   had it all figured out and will never figure out
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.240]   anything new.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.480]   And to some extent, that's the way I felt about physics
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.240]   when I was in the middle of doing it, so to speak,
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.600]   was we've got quantum field theory,
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.560]   it's the foundation of what we're doing,
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:06.880]   and yes, there's probably something underneath this,
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.640]   but we'll sort of never figure it out.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.920]   But then I started studying simple programs
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.680]   in the computational universe,
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:16.880]   things like cellular automata and so on,
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:20.320]   and I discovered that they do all kinds of things
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.760]   that were completely at odds with the intuition
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:23.920]   that I had had.
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:27.740]   And so after that, after you see this tiny little program
[00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:30.280]   that does all this amazingly complicated stuff,
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:33.240]   then you start feeling a bit more ambitious about physics
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:36.000]   and saying, maybe we could do this for physics too.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.780]   And so that got me started years ago now
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:44.160]   in this kind of idea of could we actually find
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.440]   what's underneath all of these frameworks
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.240]   like quantum field theory and general relativity and so on.
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.520]   And people perhaps don't realize as clearly as they might
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.680]   that the frameworks we're using for physics,
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:54.960]   which is basically these two things,
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:59.520]   quantum field theory, sort of the theory of small stuff
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.760]   and general relativity, theory of gravitation
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:04.420]   and large stuff, those are the two basic theories,
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:05.840]   and they're 100 years old.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:08.280]   I mean, general relativity was 1915,
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:11.120]   quantum field theory, well, 1920s.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.960]   So basically 100 years old.
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.800]   And it's been a good run.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.740]   There's a lot of stuff been figured out.
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:21.680]   But what's interesting is the foundations haven't changed
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.360]   in all that period of time.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.760]   Even though the foundations had changed several times
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.460]   before that in the 200 years earlier than that.
[00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:32.360]   And I think the kinds of things that I'm thinking about,
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.360]   which are sort of really informed by thinking
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.880]   about computation and the computational universe,
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.480]   it's a different foundation.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:42.400]   It's a different set of foundations and might be wrong,
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:45.680]   but it is at least, we have a shot.
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:48.520]   And I think it's, to me, it's,
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:51.040]   my personal calculation for myself is,
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:55.840]   is, you know, if it turns out that the finding
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.160]   the fundamental theory of physics,
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:59.600]   it's kind of low hanging fruit, so to speak,
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:02.160]   it'd be a shame if we just didn't think to do it.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.080]   You know, if people just said,
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.640]   oh, you'll never figure that stuff out.
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.280]   Let's, you know, and it takes another 200 years
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.720]   before anybody gets around to doing it.
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:15.560]   You know, I think it's, I don't know how low hanging
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.600]   this fruit actually is.
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:19.920]   It may be, you know, it may be that it's kind
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:21.840]   of the wrong century to do this project.
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:25.520]   I mean, I think the cautionary tale for me, you know,
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.560]   I think about things that I've tried to do in technology
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:32.160]   where people thought about doing them a lot earlier.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.560]   And my favorite example is probably Leibniz
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:38.360]   who thought about making essentially encapsulating
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:41.280]   the world's knowledge in a computational form
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:45.600]   in the late 1600s and did a lot of things towards that.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:48.680]   And basically, you know, we finally managed to do this,
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.560]   but he was 300 years too early.
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:54.100]   And that's kind of the, in terms of life planning,
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:56.640]   it's kind of like avoid things that can't be done
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:59.040]   in your century, so to speak.
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:02.200]   - Yeah, timing, timing is everything.
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:07.200]   So you think if we kind of figure out the underlying rules
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:11.360]   it can create from which quantum field theory
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.540]   and general relativity can emerge,
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:15.160]   do you think that'll help us unify it
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.320]   at that level of abstraction?
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.400]   - Oh, we'll know it completely.
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.080]   We'll know how that all fits together.
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:20.800]   Yes, without a question.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:25.800]   And I mean, it's already, even the things I've already done,
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:30.000]   there are very, you know, it's very, very elegant actually,
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.920]   how things seem to be fitting together.
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.040]   Now, you know, is it right?
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:33.960]   I don't know yet.
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.320]   It's awfully suggestive.
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:40.720]   If it isn't right, it's then the designer of the universe
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.120]   should feel embarrassed, so to speak,
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:43.920]   'cause it's a really good way to do it.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.620]   - And your intuition in terms of design universe,
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:48.400]   does God play dice?
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:53.200]   Is there randomness in this thing, or is it deterministic?
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.040]   So the kind of--
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.800]   - That's a little bit of a complicated question
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.220]   because when you're dealing with these things
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:00.760]   that involve these rewrites that have, okay.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:03.240]   - Even randomness is an emergent phenomenon perhaps?
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.320]   - Yes, yes.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.240]   I mean, it's a, yeah, well, randomness,
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:09.880]   in many of these systems, pseudo-randomness and randomness
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.840]   are hard to distinguish.
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.840]   In this particular case, the current idea that we have
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.840]   about measurement and quantum mechanics
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:21.960]   is something very bizarre and very abstract,
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:25.120]   and I don't think I can yet explain it
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:28.360]   without kind of yakking about very technical things.
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:32.920]   Eventually I will be able to, but if that's right,
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.720]   it's kind of a, it's a weird thing
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:39.220]   because it slices between determinism and randomness
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:42.140]   in a weird way that hasn't been sliced before, so to speak.
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:45.120]   So like many of these questions that come up in science
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.660]   where it's like, is it this or is it that?
[00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:50.040]   Turns out the real answer is it's neither of those things.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.540]   It's something kind of different
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:55.860]   and sort of orthogonal to those categories.
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:58.020]   And so that's the current, you know,
[00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:01.120]   this week's idea about how that might work.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:05.780]   But, you know, we'll see how that unfolds.
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:09.180]   I mean, there's this question about a field like physics
[00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:12.420]   and sort of the quest for fundamental theory and so on.
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:14.860]   And there's both the science of what happens
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:18.380]   and there's the sort of the social aspect of what happens
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:21.700]   because, you know, in a field that is basically
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:25.060]   as old as physics, we're at, I don't know what it is,
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:26.860]   fourth generation, I don't know, fifth generation,
[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:29.540]   I don't know what generation it is of physicists.
[00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:31.580]   And like, I was one of these, so to speak.
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:34.940]   And for me, the foundations were like the pyramids,
[00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:36.880]   so to speak, you know, it was that way
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:38.220]   and it was always that way.
[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:42.180]   It is difficult in an old field to go back
[00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:44.920]   to the foundations and think about rewriting them.
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.780]   It's a lot easier in young fields
[00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:49.340]   where you're still dealing with the first generation
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.000]   of people who invented the field.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.460]   And it tends to be the case, you know,
[00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:56.740]   that the nature of what happens in science tends to be,
[00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:59.260]   you know, you'll get, typically the pattern
[00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:02.400]   is some methodological advance occurs.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.520]   And then there's a period of five years, 10 years,
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:06.260]   maybe a little bit longer than that,
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:08.860]   where there's lots of things that are now made possible
[00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:12.580]   by that methodological advance, whether it's, you know,
[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:14.420]   I don't know, telescopes or whether that's
[00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:16.740]   some mathematical method or something.
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:21.740]   It's, you know, there's a, something happens,
[00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:25.580]   a tool gets built, and then you can do a bunch of stuff.
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:28.600]   And there's a bunch of low-hanging fruit to be picked.
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.980]   And that takes a certain amount of time.
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:33.980]   After that, all that low-hanging fruit is picked,
[00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:38.180]   then it's a hard slog for the next however many decades
[00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:42.620]   or century or more to get to the next sort of level
[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:43.660]   at which one can do something.
[00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:46.420]   And it's kind of a, and it tends to be the case
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:48.460]   that in fields that are in that kind of,
[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:51.140]   I wouldn't say cruise mode, 'cause it's really hard work,
[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:54.260]   but it's very hard work for very incremental progress.
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:56.500]   (laughing)
