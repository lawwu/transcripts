[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Alright, let's go on with a question now from Ab.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Ab asks, "Which emails do you keep? Do you have a filing system?"
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Ab, an email inbox is not a good information or knowledge management system.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   People do try to keep track of the different obligations or information relevant to projects, etc. in their inbox
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   because they trust their inbox as a system. They know they always check.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   They trust it as one of the few productivity systems that they know is not going to just disappear.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   They'll forget what's in there.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   But I don't think it's a great idea to mix information management with back and forth communication.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   So when you clear an email out of your inbox, the relevant information needs to go into your relevant long-term system.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   An inbox is a terrible system.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Where that system is depends on the information.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   So if there's an email that's talking about an upcoming meeting, well, that's going to go on your calendar.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   And then you don't need that in your inbox anymore.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   If an email captures some sort of task that you are going to need to get done,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   well, that should get transformed into, let's say, a card on your task board
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   where you could even copy the whole text of the email and put it on the back of that virtual card.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   So the information is there, but it's better for it to be on a card
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   where the card can be under a column that captures its status,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   and that column can be on a board that captures the particular professional role to which that task is relevant.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   That's a way more informative way of storing that information than just,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   "Here is an email buried somewhere in my inbox that I vaguely remember that it has some information in there that might be relevant."
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   So this is what you need to do.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Get it out of your inbox.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Get it into a more trusted system that's part of a more systematic way of organizing your work.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   You want it, and this is the analogy I often give to people,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   in an age of old-fashioned interoffice memos and interoffice mail cubbies
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   where you would go to the mail room, remember this,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   and there would be letters and memos in your mail slot that you would take out to bring back to your office.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   You want to just keep stuff in there to organize your professional life.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Like, "Yeah, I just have a bunch of stuff stacked in my mailbox cubby in the mail room at my office,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   and I just sort of go in there and look through it to see what's going on."
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   You say, "No, I have my own to-do list and a day planner, and I keep track of things myself."
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Your email inbox is the same way.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   That's not the right place to keep track of what's going on in your life.
