[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.600]   - Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.320]   Normally on Wednesdays, we feature a sermon clip
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.600]   from John Piper's preaching archive.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.440]   Not today.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.120]   Today we have a full message.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.360]   It's just a short one.
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.640]   And it's a recent one.
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.540]   When Pastor John preached at a gathering
[00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.800]   of our friends at Crossway.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.720]   The gathering met at the most recent
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.640]   Evangelical Theological Society meeting
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.720]   in Fort Worth, Texas.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.880]   That was the occasion for a celebration
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.320]   of the life and work of Lane and Ebeth Dennis
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.680]   on the occasion of Lane and Ebeth stepping down
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.840]   from their positions at Crossway,
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.280]   which they started back in 1978.
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.480]   If you own an ESV Bible or a book published by Crossway,
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.680]   you have Lane and Ebeth Dennis to thank for that.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.520]   But they are now in transition.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.680]   In the transition, Josh Dennis, their son,
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.880]   will take over for his dad, Lane,
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.080]   and will now lead Crossway as a CEO and president.
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.640]   Lane will continue to serve as the chairman of the board
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.680]   and as executive consultant.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.520]   Ebeth will continue as an associate consultant.
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.040]   They're not retiring.
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.880]   That's the point.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.440]   They're not retiring, Pastor John.
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.080]   You're normally not with us on Wednesdays,
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.280]   but you're here today.
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.640]   You're making an exception for this couple.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.400]   We're about to play your message in a moment,
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.280]   but introduce us to this couple.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.440]   A lot of listeners don't know them.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.280]   Who are they?
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.520]   What do they mean to you?
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.560]   Why are they so precious and important to us
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.120]   at Desiring God?
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.080]   And tell us, what did you hope to accomplish
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.960]   in this brief message we're about to hear?
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.880]   - Yeah, thanks, Tony.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.640]   I love the thought of talking about Lane and Ebeth Dennis.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.160]   Just a little more background
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.120]   before I point to my friendship.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.000]   In 1938, the parents of Lane Dennis
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.240]   started a small track publishing ministry.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.240]   And within five years,
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.240]   they were distributing five million tracks a year.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.320]   And that good news publishing, as it's still called,
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.720]   grew into a nonprofit ministry
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.000]   spreading Christian literature around the world.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.400]   And in 1978, as you said,
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.880]   Crossway Books became the book publishing arm
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.480]   of this nonprofit ministry.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.600]   So Crossway is one of the unusual
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.760]   major book publishing companies
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.400]   that is a nonprofit today.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.000]   Lane and Ebeth Dennis have led that ministry for decades
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.880]   until the recent handoff to their son, Josh.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.040]   Crossway has published, I think, 1,500 titles
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.000]   and is today really quite an influential Christian publisher
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   of biblically faithful books.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.200]   And I can't really distinguish
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.960]   between my personal friendship with Lane and Ebeth
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.280]   and my relationship with Crossway Books
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.280]   as the primary publisher of the things that I've written.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.360]   So let me give you three examples of that intersection
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.240]   between my life and their life and Crossway Books.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.360]   In 1987, I got a phone call from Lane Dennis.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.080]   It was my first acquaintance.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.960]   I didn't know who he was.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.600]   And he wanted to explore with me the idea
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.440]   of a major book on the nature of manhood and womanhood
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.520]   and the biblical teaching
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.680]   concerning the roles of men and women.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.600]   And the outcome of that phone call
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.480]   was the publishing of "Recovering Biblical Manhood
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.600]   and Womanhood," affectionately known as "The Big Blue Book,"
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.560]   (laughs)
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.280]   that Wayne Grudem and I edited
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.080]   and Crossway published in 1991.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.360]   That was the beginning of a 35-year friendship
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.720]   and publishing partnership.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.320]   Then in the late '90s, both Wayne Grudem and I
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.320]   felt the need for a new Bible translation
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.040]   that would lean in a little more
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.400]   in the direction of formal equivalence
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.080]   than only dynamic equivalence,
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.320]   and that would be in the tradition of the King James,
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.520]   American Standard Version,
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.000]   Revised Standard Version tradition.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.440]   And Wayne and I both spent decades
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.920]   reading and memorizing the Revised Standard Version
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.440]   in spite of its flaws. (laughs)
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.920]   And it went out of print.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.200]   And so we couldn't give it to anybody.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.800]   We couldn't ask people to use it in church
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.960]   'cause they couldn't get ahold of it.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.920]   And we thought, "What a great idea
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.800]   if Crossway could get the rights
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.600]   from the National Council of Churches
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.840]   and produce an improved version
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.640]   of the Revised Standard Version
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.440]   while keeping it in the same linguistic tradition."
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.440]   And we urged Lane Dennis to make that faithful phone call
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.920]   to the National Council of Churches,
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.640]   and to everyone's amazement, it happened.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.560]   And the ESV was published in 2001,
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.040]   and today the ESV is one of the most widely used
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.400]   English versions of the Bible in the world.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.440]   And the third thing I would mention
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.360]   that has knit us together
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.920]   is that since those days of partnership
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.040]   in recovering biblical manhood and womanhood
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.320]   and the Bible translation,
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.760]   almost all of my books have been published through Crossway.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.040]   I made that decision to publish with Crossway
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.320]   knowing that Crossway
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.480]   is not the biggest Christian publisher in America.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.440]   It doesn't have the most dollars.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.440]   And more important than that, it seemed to me,
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.680]   I feel this way today,
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.960]   was a theological and philosophical oneness of mind
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.640]   between author and publisher,
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.160]   which I am very happy to say in this case
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.720]   meant a rich friendship and oneness of mind
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.280]   between Lane and Ebeth Dennis and me.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.520]   I think in this message that you're about to hear,
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.320]   you will hear some of my affection for them,
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.920]   and I hope it comes through loud and clear.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:05.920]   - Yeah, it sure does.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.640]   And with that, here is Pastor John's message
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.520]   simply titled "God's Providence
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.320]   in the Ministry of Crossway Books
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.120]   and in the Life of Lane and Ebeth Dennis."
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.960]   Have a listen.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.280]   - Lane and Ebeth Dennis
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.840]   are two of the most gracious people that I know.
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.600]   And I say that not because of reputation,
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.560]   though that is true and easy to verify,
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.840]   but because of over 35 years of knowing each other
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.840]   and them showing me personally unremitting kindness,
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.640]   even through circumstances
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.840]   that could have been relationally destructive.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.960]   And were not because Lane and Ebeth
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:05.080]   love like they have been loved by their Savior.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.080]   So I count it an enormous privilege
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.320]   to speak for a few minutes at this juncture
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.600]   in your professional and personal lives.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:22.680]   I'm gonna spend the next few minutes exalting with you,
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.880]   all of you, in the preciousness and the greatness
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.440]   and the beauty of God's providence
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.000]   as it relates to you and crossway.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.400]   I define providence as God's purposeful sovereignty.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:44.640]   It is the all-embracing, all-pervasive,
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:49.320]   all-wise governance by God of all things
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.880]   for the demonstration of his glory
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:58.240]   in the Christ-exalting gladness of his people in God.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:03.400]   As each of us here lifts our hands in thankfulness
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:13.480]   to God for his merciful providence
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:18.360]   that you were not in your house when it burned down.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:24.640]   We know, you know, we know that the very providence
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:31.080]   that rescued your life could have prevented the fire.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:38.120]   Which means that our peace, our joy,
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:44.120]   our hope does not rest on being rescued
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:49.000]   from the disaster, the loss, the sorrow.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.680]   Our hope rests finally on the freedom and wisdom
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:59.560]   and mercy of God's providence to govern all fires,
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:04.560]   all calamities, all rescues, all non-rescues
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:10.160]   so that all things work finally to magnify the fullness
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:15.560]   of the glory of God and all that he is for us in Jesus.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:22.400]   So let us exalt together in seven manifestations
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.560]   of God's providence in the history of crossway books
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.360]   and your lives in particular.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.520]   Number one, providence and deity.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.720]   I am God and there is no other.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.200]   I am God and there is none like me.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.920]   Declaring the end from the beginning
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.920]   and from ancient times saying, my counsel will stand
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:51.680]   and I will accomplish all my purpose.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.680]   So the most fundamental thing that God is making clear
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.560]   in the mouth of Isaiah in Isaiah 46
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:05.560]   is that his sovereignty in accomplishing his purposes
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.640]   is what it means to be God.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:16.320]   I am God, my counsel will stand.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:20.640]   I am God, I accomplish my purposes.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:25.640]   Only God depends on no one but God,
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.180]   no one but himself informing his purposes
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.520]   and accomplishing them.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.280]   That's the ultimate foundation of good news publishers,
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:41.280]   crossway books and what makes this morning so happy
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:47.920]   is that you know that and you are glad to have it so.
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:52.840]   Number two, providence and purpose.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:57.600]   The God of all embracing providence
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.060]   has not left us in the dark at all
[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.700]   about his ultimate purpose in redemption and creation.
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:08.040]   It's not hidden, it runs like a golden thread
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.840]   from Genesis to Revelation.
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.240]   Bring my sons from afar,
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.120]   my daughters from the ends of the earth,
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.040]   everyone who is called by my name,
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.240]   whom I created for my glory.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:24.200]   It's not unclear why you're in existence.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.440]   It's just gloriously clear.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:31.560]   We were predestined according to the purpose of him
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.800]   who works all things according to the counsel of his will
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:39.600]   so that we who were the first to hope in Christ
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.560]   might be for the praise of his glory.
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:49.640]   That's why we be, we exist for the praise of his glory,
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:53.800]   the meaning of the universe.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:58.640]   Now praise is not a sad affair,
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:03.520]   especially when the last vestige of evil
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.480]   is wiped from the new earth.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.740]   Therefore, the final goal of all providence
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:15.660]   is the glorification of God in the gladness
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:20.080]   of the blood bought people of God in God.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:25.660]   And when we search as I did online,
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:30.140]   all the documents available for good news publishers
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:33.860]   and crossway books back to 1938,
[00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:38.420]   the refrain is as clear there as it is in the Bible
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:42.260]   that you exist for the glory of God.
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.780]   It's clear in every mission statement
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.080]   that has been written that I could find.
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:53.700]   Glad news for the lost from your parents,
[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:58.320]   from you and glory to God through Jesus Christ.
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.500]   Number three, providence and gospel.
[00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.820]   In this city, they were gathered together
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.600]   against your holy servant, Jesus, whom you anointed,
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:12.060]   both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.380]   and the peoples of Israel to do whatever your hand
[00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:20.900]   and your plan had predestined to take place.
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:26.140]   So at the moment in history when the greatest evil
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:30.260]   was perpetrated against the greatest good,
[00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.840]   the all governing hand of God
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.900]   was most lovingly active and sovereign.
[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.560]   Herod scoffed, Pilate prevaricated,
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.540]   the mobs cried, "Crucify!"
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.600]   The soldiers drove the nails.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:50.920]   And in it all, God was doing his plan
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:57.760]   and his purpose to save sinners.
[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:02.600]   If God's providence did not extend
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.800]   to the greatest evil ever done,
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.520]   there would be no good news
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:11.240]   and there'd be no good news publishers
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.600]   and there would be no crossway books.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:19.480]   For 83 years, good news publishers and crossway books
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:24.480]   has flooded the world with the good news
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:28.660]   that it was God who bruised his son.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.200]   To save millions of sinners.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:37.080]   Number four, providence and conversion.
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:43.180]   When Jesus said to the departing rich young ruler,
[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:49.680]   "It's easier for the camel to go through the eye of a needle
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.380]   "than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven."
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:58.400]   His disciples were dismayed and said,
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.860]   "Well, then who can be saved?"
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:06.860]   To which Jesus answered, "With man, it is impossible,
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:14.940]   "but not with God, for all things are possible with God."
[00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:22.860]   Good news publishers has cast upon the waters of this world
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:28.220]   billions of gospel tracts
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:34.500]   and more recently, millions of gospel-laden books.
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:41.320]   And surely it is no exaggeration to say
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:46.080]   that thousands upon thousands of persons
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:50.000]   have miraculously passed from death to life
[00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:54.540]   reading that good news.
[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:58.320]   Every one of them a miracle.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:04.280]   Because with man, it is impossible, but not with God.
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:09.120]   Number five, providence and loss.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:13.560]   Every godly life, every fruitful ministry
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:17.200]   advances through loss.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.520]   Through many tribulations, we must enter the kingdom.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:21.940]   And through many tribulations,
[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.600]   we must advance in godliness and fruitfulness.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:31.960]   When the final word of loss came to Job
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.880]   that your 10 children are dead,
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:40.080]   Job rose, tore his robe, shaved his head,
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.940]   fell on the ground and worshiped.
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:48.200]   And said, "Naked I came from my mother's womb,
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.940]   "naked shall I return the Lord gave,
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:56.140]   "the Lord has taken away.
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.920]   "Blessed be the name of the Lord."
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:05.140]   So whether by flood or fire or relational heartache
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:11.220]   or physical challenges, crossway and you,
[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:15.480]   Lane and Ebeth, have known loss on your way
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:19.020]   to godliness and fruitfulness.
[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:23.160]   And we today join you in saying,
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.780]   blessed be the name of the Lord.
[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:30.500]   Six, providence and humility.
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:36.600]   God intended and designed his meticulous providence
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:42.860]   in order to shut the mouth of all self-reliant pride
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:49.640]   and to awaken in us God-dependent humility.
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:54.360]   Come now, you who say today or tomorrow
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.360]   we will go up to such and such a town
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.540]   and spend a year there and trade and gain.
[00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:01.640]   What is your life?
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.840]   You do not know about tomorrow, you're a vapor.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:08.840]   Rather, you ought to say,
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:13.840]   if the Lord wills, we will live and do this.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.040]   This or that.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:20.320]   As it is, you are arrogant
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:26.200]   in saying, I will get on the plane this afternoon
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.640]   and go to Minneapolis.
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:32.880]   If you do not, also say,
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.920]   if the meticulous providence of God orders it so.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:44.800]   If God wills, we will do this or that.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:48.240]   That's why I use the term
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.960]   all-embracing, all-pervasive providence.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:58.220]   But the existential reality is this.
[00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:03.760]   That meticulous providence is designed
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:07.720]   to remove boasting from human beings
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.280]   and to instill humility.
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:16.040]   And I just want to bear public witness,
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.080]   happy witness with all of you,
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.880]   that God has wrought this in you, Lane and Ebeth.
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:26.520]   He has wrought this in you.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:31.400]   We need examples today of your kind
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:35.920]   of strong backbone and conviction
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.800]   mingled with humble contrition and dependence.
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.280]   We need it very badly.
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:47.560]   Finally, number seven, providence and perseverance.
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:53.760]   You and I, you too, and all of us, I am sure,
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.680]   hope to say with the Apostle Paul,
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.320]   I have fought the good fight.
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.400]   I have finished the race.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.920]   I have kept the faith.
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:09.760]   And to those of us who love you and love this ministry,
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:16.000]   we say that we will pray that indeed both of you
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.040]   will say that cheerfully and confidently
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.080]   in the hour of your death.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.920]   And we have good hope that you will.
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.880]   And it isn't in you or me.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.920]   It's in the keeping providence of God.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:39.440]   I will make with you an everlasting covenant
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:44.200]   and I will not turn away from doing you good.
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.720]   I'll put the fear of me in your heart
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:52.040]   and you will not turn away from me.
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:55.560]   I will not grow weary in doing you good
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.520]   and I will plant you in this land with all my heart
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.120]   and with all my soul, says the Lord.
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:06.960]   That's your only hope, to say in the hour of your death,
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.200]   I have finished the race.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.760]   This is our only hope.
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:14.360]   If you have another hope, you're building on sand.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:19.040]   He who calls you is faithful.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.040]   He will do it.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:26.040]   So I say it on God's behalf and I say it to Lane and Ebeth
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:33.440]   on all of our behalf, you are greatly loved.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:39.080]   And I join with you and the rest of us here
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:44.080]   in ascribing your keeping to our all-embracing,
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:52.320]   all-pervasive, all-wise, merciful providence
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.960]   that God has shown to us.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:59.960]   So now unto him who is able to keep you from falling
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.800]   and to present you before the presence of his glory
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.440]   with great joy.
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.960]   To God, our Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:12.320]   be glory and majesty, dominion and authority
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:17.560]   before all time now and forever.
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.520]   Amen.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.200]   - Amen. A precious couple to us.
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.360]   Thank you for joining us today
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.720]   for this special episode of the podcast.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.680]   Next time on Friday, we're going to talk about
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.920]   how to pursue education in this world
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.520]   without thinking like the world.
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.280]   As the apostle Paul warns us in Colossians 2.8,
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.400]   we are to be careful that no one takes you captive
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.240]   by the philosophy of this world.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.840]   So how do we pursue education and learning in this world
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:45.080]   while avoiding the philosophy of the world?
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.840]   It's an important discussion we need to think through.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.160]   I'm your host, Tony Renke.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.520]   We will see you back here on Friday for it.
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:05.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
