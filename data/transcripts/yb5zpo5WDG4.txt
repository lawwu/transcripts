[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.600]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.420]   and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.480]   Today, we are discussing focus and concentration
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.720]   and tools for improving your focus and concentration.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.520]   This is a topic that I've covered previously
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.280]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast, but in different contexts.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.920]   For instance, we had a very popular episode on ADHD,
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.120]   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.100]   which of course relates to the topic of focus
[00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.520]   and how to improve focus.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.440]   We've also talked a lot about dopamine motivation and drive.
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.580]   In fact, that's the title of your previous,
[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.200]   also quite popular episode of this podcast.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.180]   But never before have we had a single episode
[00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.920]   solely devoted to the tools
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.920]   to improve focus and concentration.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.960]   The rationale for recording this episode
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.560]   is to provide people one location where they can go
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.460]   and quickly access the specific tools
[00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.480]   for increasing focus and concentration
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.060]   that are known to be the most powerful tools
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.760]   and the most up-to-date tools.
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.940]   In fact, today's episode is going to include
[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.380]   description of several peer-reviewed studies
[00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.520]   and the tools that emerge
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.360]   from those scientific peer-reviewed studies
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.040]   that point to new and fortunately even briefer protocols
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.360]   than I've described before.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.080]   So what I'm basically describing here
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.080]   is tools that in a very short amount of time
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.200]   will allow you to significantly increase
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.580]   your focus and concentration abilities.
[00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.600]   Those tools will include behavioral tools,
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.000]   nutrition-based tools, supplement-based tools,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.940]   brain machine interface-based tools,
[00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.420]   and for those of you that are working with physician,
[00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.120]   prescription drug tools.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.160]   Today's episode ought to benefit anybody,
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.360]   young or old or anything in between,
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.000]   whether or not you have ADHD or not.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.720]   Today's episode is going to give you tools
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.560]   that you can apply in your daily life.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.640]   Most all of them are completely zero cost
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.920]   and those tools will allow you
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.640]   to tap into the neurochemistry
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.800]   and the neural circuits within your brain and body
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.440]   that peer-reviewed science has reliably shown
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.680]   can significantly improve your focus
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.480]   and concentration abilities.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.200]   Just to give you a little teaser of the kinds of tools
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.320]   that I'm going to provide you on today's episode,
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.100]   a previous guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.400]   was Dr. Wendy Suzuki.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.660]   Dr. Suzuki is a professor of psychology and neuroscience
[00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.080]   at New York University or NYU as it's commonly referred to.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.800]   She's also the Dean of Arts and Sciences at NYU.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.200]   Her laboratory made a very important discovery
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.960]   which was that a very brief, just 12,
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.520]   actually 13 if you really count the intro,
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.980]   but 13 minute daily meditation
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.640]   performed for a period of about eight weeks
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.880]   significantly increased people's focus
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.160]   and concentration abilities.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.400]   And the great news is you didn't need all eight weeks.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.560]   It was just that's how long that you ran the study.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.700]   So during today's episode,
[00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.840]   I will describe that protocol in detail.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.360]   I'll also provide you an even briefer alternative
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.160]   to that protocol that you can use if, for instance,
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.600]   you find yourself with only three minutes or four minutes
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.760]   or five minutes a day to meditate.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.920]   The great news is there's quality peer-reviewed science
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.160]   to support that form of meditation
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.840]   for improving focus and concentration.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.920]   And that falls under the bin of these zero cost tools
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.000]   that you can really use to tap into the neurochemistry
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.480]   and neural circuits that really allow you to take control
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.520]   of your cognitive abilities and improve them over time.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.080]   I'll also provide you important details
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.680]   about that protocol and other protocols.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.120]   For instance, contrary to popular belief, it is not,
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.960]   I repeat, it is not a good idea
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.960]   to do a focused-based meditation within the four hours
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.840]   before bedtime.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.600]   Many people, including some of the subjects in that study
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.040]   performed by the Suzuki lab,
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.040]   found that when they did a focusing meditation protocol,
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.640]   even if it was very calming,
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.880]   it led to difficulties in falling and staying asleep.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.600]   So that runs counter to a lot of what we heard
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.320]   about meditation being great for sleep.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.200]   It turns out meditation might be great for sleep.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.800]   It certainly is great for improving focus capacity,
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.660]   but I highly recommend that if you're going to apply
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.520]   a focused meditation tool
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.840]   in order to improve your focus and concentration,
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.600]   that you make sure that that's performed
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.580]   not within four hours prior to bedtime.
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.860]   So that's just a brief example
[00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.680]   of the sorts of tools and protocols
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.520]   and details about the tools and protocols
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.540]   that I'll provide on today's episode.
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.780]   I should mention that we have provided links
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.020]   in the show note captions
[00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.620]   so that you can quickly go to the studies that we describe,
[00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.200]   as well as some of the behavioral tools
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.600]   and other tools that we'll cover,
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.360]   things like the use of binaural beats, supplements, et cetera.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.080]   Our goal here again is to provide you
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.220]   the maximum number of tools for focus and concentration
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.560]   that you can pick from and choose from
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.740]   and apply in your life
[00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.700]   and try and eliminate as much of the legwork required
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.020]   to seek out and apply those tools.
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.900]   I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.220]   is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.440]   We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.140]   First of all, they ship internationally
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.060]   because we know that many of you are located
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.840]   outside of the United States.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.920]   That's valuable.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.940]   Second of all, and perhaps most important,
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.480]   the quality of their supplements is second to none,
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.160]   both in terms of purity and precision
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.100]   of the amounts of the ingredients.
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.720]   Third, we've really emphasized supplements
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.920]   that are single ingredient supplements
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.000]   and that are supplied in dosages
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.960]   that allow you to build a supplementation protocol
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.800]   that's optimized for cost,
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.680]   that's optimized for effectiveness,
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.820]   and that you can add things and remove things
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.140]   from your protocol in a way
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.840]   that's really systematic and scientific.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.180]   This is really hard to do
[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.060]   if you're taking blends of different supplements
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.800]   or if the dosages are such that you can't titrate
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.180]   or that is adjust the dosages of a given supplement.
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.820]   So by using single ingredient supplements,
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.480]   you can really build out the supplement kit
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.580]   that's ideal for you and your specific needs.
[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:23.760]   If you'd like to see the supplements
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.080]   that we partner with Momentus on,
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.180]   you can go to livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.320]   There you'll see those supplements.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.780]   And just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding
[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.480]   the library of supplements available through Momentus
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.420]   on a regular basis.
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.140]   Again, that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.720]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.040]   that this podcast is separate
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.220]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.320]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.780]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.500]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.600]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.320]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.220]   Our first sponsor is Thesis.
[00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.040]   Thesis makes custom nootropics.
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.360]   And to be quite honest, I don't like the word nootropics
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.800]   because the translation of nootropics is smart drugs.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.960]   And as a neuroscientist, I can tell you,
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.780]   there is no neural circuit in the brain
[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.800]   for being smart.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.700]   Rather, there are neural circuits
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.060]   that are responsible for focus,
[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.880]   neural circuits for creativity,
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.360]   neural circuits for task switching,
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.800]   and so on and so on.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.720]   Fortunately, Thesis understands this
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.280]   and has developed custom nootropics
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.940]   that are tailored to your specific goals
[00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.520]   and your specific needs.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.360]   They use only the highest quality ingredients,
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.840]   things of the sort that we'll talk about in today's podcast,
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.320]   things like alpha-GPC, phosphatidylserine,
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.960]   ginkgo biloba, et cetera.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.380]   However, I should mention that they are customized to you.
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.760]   So you can go to Thesis, take a brief quiz,
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.180]   and you can get a nootropic starter kit
[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.120]   that will allow you to try various nootropics
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.900]   and determine which ones you like and work for you
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:44.900]   and which ones don't.
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.220]   I've been using Thesis nootropics customized for me
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.480]   for close to six months now,
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.380]   and can confidently say that their nootropics
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.180]   have been a total game changer.
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.560]   My go-to formula is the Clarity formula.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.220]   I like to use that before cognitive work,
[00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.680]   and I use the Energy formula before my workouts.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.580]   To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.360]   go online to takethesis.com/huberman,
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.600]   take that three-minute quiz,
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.480]   and Thesis will send you four different formulas
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.600]   to try in your first month.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.240]   Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman,

[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.780]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.280]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.960]   that has all the things you need and none of what you don't.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.240]   That means the electrolytes, salt, magnesium,
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.060]   and potassium are in there, but it does not have sugar.
[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.480]   Electrolytes are key to cellular function,
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.900]   in particular, neuronal or nerve cell function.
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.140]   In fact, for your nerve cells
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.960]   to be able to fire action potentials,
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.520]   those are the electrical signals
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.400]   that allow your brain and body to work
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.680]   and move and think, et cetera, you need sodium.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.160]   A lot of people don't realize that.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.520]   And while, of course, there are people out there
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.480]   that need to reduce their sodium intake,
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.160]   these would be people with pre-hypertension or hypertension,
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.040]   many people actually don't get enough sodium,
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.800]   especially people that are following low carbohydrate diets,
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.800]   drinking a lot of caffeine, or eating extremely clean.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.720]   Oftentimes, those people feel better
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.160]   when they increase their sodium intake,
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.380]   and their health can actually improve
[00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.860]   when they increase their sodium intake.
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.880]   Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.420]   of one gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium,
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.360]   and 60 milligrams of magnesium.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.960]   If you'd like to try Element, you can go to Drink Element,

[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.980]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.520]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.520]   with heating, cooling, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.880]   The reality is that sleep is the foundation
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.400]   of mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.840]   Now, I've talked before in this podcast
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.980]   about the fact that there's a direct relationship
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.120]   between temperature and our ability to fall and stay asleep.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.840]   In fact, our body temperature needs to drop
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.400]   by about one to three degrees in order to fall asleep,
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.460]   and then there are further decreases in our body temperature
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.740]   that allow us to get into the deepest stages of sleep,
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.980]   and the so-called rapid eye movement, sleep,
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.000]   all the aspects of sleep
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.920]   that really restore our brain and body.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.200]   And then waking up actually involves a heating up
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.740]   of core body temperature.
[00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.800]   By sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover,
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.360]   you're able to control the temperature
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.320]   of your sleeping environment precisely.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.700]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:05.960]   for many months now,
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.500]   and I can tell you it has completely changed my sleep.
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.200]   I thought I was sleeping pretty well before,
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.420]   and now, frankly, I don't even want to travel
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:13.920]   because I don't want to be away from my Eight Sleep.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.320]   I can't wait until hotels and Airbnbs include Eight Sleep.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.320]   If you want to try Eight Sleep,
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.600]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman

[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.580]   and the United Kingdom.
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.920]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman

[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.280]   Okay, let's talk about focus and concentration
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.020]   and how you can improve your focus and concentration
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.600]   using science-based protocols.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.340]   Now, because today's episode is mainly focused on tools
[00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.780]   and not so much the underlying mechanisms,
[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.840]   I'm mainly going to focus on what to do and when
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.120]   and how to do it.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.460]   But I just want to take about three minutes
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.580]   and briefly describe a model that is a visual image
[00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.340]   that you can put in your mind
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.400]   that will help you incorporate the tools that I'll provide
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.580]   and that generally will help you understand
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:10.480]   at a mechanistic level how focus and concentration work.
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.640]   So what I want you to imagine is an arrow.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.820]   And an arrow, of course, has an arrow head
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.160]   and it has the shaft of that arrow.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.400]   And in the context of the neuroscience
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.360]   of focus and concentration,
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.440]   the neurochemical system that really represents
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.360]   the shaft of that arrow, right, the straight line,
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.760]   is epinephrine, also called adrenaline.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.460]   And today I'll refer to adrenaline
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.200]   and epinephrine interchangeably.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.460]   It turns out that epinephrine/adrenaline
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.340]   are released within your brain from a little location,
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.260]   a little cluster of neurons called locus coeruleus,
[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.340]   but you do not need to remember that name,
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.400]   and from your body from the adrenal glands.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.600]   And the release of epinephrine from those two locations
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.400]   overall increases energy, it increases alertness.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.520]   It does not alone increase focus, okay?
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:01.320]   So the reason I've assigned epinephrine, adrenaline,
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:05.560]   as the shaft of the arrow is that if focus is the arrow,
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.640]   there is no focus without epinephrine.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.240]   So things, whether or not they're behavioral
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.080]   or psychological or supplements or drugs
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.440]   that increase epinephrine allow focus to occur.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.200]   They are necessary for focus,
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.540]   but they are not sufficient for focus.
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:23.640]   That is, they are required,
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.220]   but they are not enough to create focus.
[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.680]   So we're going to need epinephrine in the equation.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:33.200]   Without epinephrine, there is no focus or concentration.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.540]   Now, the arrowhead on this metaphorical arrowhead
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.660]   that represents focus and concentration
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.980]   is going to be represented or related to the mechanisms
[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.060]   of acetylcholine, a different neurochemical
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.520]   that also exists in the brain and body.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.000]   In fact, in the body, it's responsible
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.600]   for the contraction and movement of your muscles.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.300]   But today we're talking about acetylcholine
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.280]   not in that context, but rather in the context
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.040]   of it's released within the brain.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.660]   Acetylcholine is released from a couple
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.060]   of different locations in the brain.
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.400]   And the best way to think about it is it's like a spotlight.
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.500]   It highlights specific neurons, nerve cells
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.000]   that should be active or more active, I should say,
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.900]   than the other neurons in the environment.
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:15.440]   So the reason I've assigned the arrowhead to acetylcholine
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.820]   and acetylcholine to the arrowhead is that if you have
[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.100]   an arrow with a very big arrowhead that's really broad,
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.600]   really blunt, imagine a mile wide arrowhead,
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.540]   that's not very focused on any one location.
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:29.200]   It's not really pointing to any one location, is it?
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.440]   But with a narrow, really tightly focused arrowhead,
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.420]   well, that's focused on one location.
[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.740]   So we have alertness, epinephrine,
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.600]   and then we have the actual direction
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.660]   in which our concentration and focus is placed.
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.040]   And that's, at least in this mental model,
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.700]   I'm creating acetylcholine.
[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.920]   And then in order to have ongoing focus,
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.460]   we need another neurochemical.
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.580]   And it turns out that that third neurochemical is dopamine,
[00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:00.000]   a molecule often associated with pleasure and reward,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.200]   but it's really the molecule of motivation.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.480]   So here, I want you to imagine in your mind an arrow
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.300]   with an arrowhead, think acetylcholine in the arrowhead,
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.600]   a shaft or a line behind that arrowhead,
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.080]   which is epinephrine, also called adrenaline,
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.240]   and then behind it, a sort of an engine
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.420]   that keeps that focus moving forward, right?
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.680]   Because we don't just want to be focused for a moment,
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.480]   we want to be able to focus for 10 minutes or for an hour,
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.160]   maybe even for two hours.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.140]   It turns out there's an optimal duration to focus.
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.040]   I'll teach you that in just a little bit.
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.940]   But these three neurochemicals together,
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.100]   acetylcholine, epinephrine, and dopamine,
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:37.100]   really allow you to get focused, to focus very precisely,
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.600]   and in fact, increasingly precisely over time
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.500]   to really narrow and narrow and narrow your focus
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.380]   progressively within a single bout of focus,
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:46.980]   and to continue to do that
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.560]   and to be able to do that repeatedly whenever you want.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.780]   So here, I'm purely talking in metaphor
[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.960]   and in models and mental models of arrows,
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:54.800]   but in a moment or two,
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.140]   I'll start transitioning to discussing tools
[00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.300]   in which I'll talk about increasing dopamine
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.520]   and acetylcholine or increasing epinephrine and dopamine
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.220]   in various combinations with various approaches.
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.320]   And what I'd like you to conceptualize
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.080]   is how those are contributing
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.740]   to creating a very narrowly pointed arrow
[00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.040]   that has the capacity to continue moving forward
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.660]   over and over so that you can focus as sharply
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.580]   and as long as you like.
[00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:19.580]   And of course, for those of you
[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.580]   that want to get really down in the weeds
[00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:22.780]   of how dopamine works,
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:25.620]   we have an entire episode about dopamine motivation and drive
[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.940]   that really gets into neurotransmitter release
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.020]   and dopamine baselines and thresholds
[00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.640]   and all of that sort of thing.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.500]   We also have episodes on focus,
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.620]   much longer episodes, I should say, on focus,
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.140]   that incorporate a lot of the biology of acetylcholine.
[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:39.980]   It turns out acetylcholine
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.140]   is also involved in neuroplasticity, et cetera.
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.860]   And epinephrine, of course, relates to stress
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:46.940]   and our capacity to deal with and buffer stress
[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.380]   and on and on.
[00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:50.220]   Those episodes are all available to you
[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.980]   in their long form at HubermanLab.com.
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:54.020]   You can find them very easily.
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.160]   They are all timestamps.
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.860]   You can navigate to the particular topics
[00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:57.960]   most of interest to you.
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.020]   I mentioned this all not as a diversion
[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:01.400]   from what we want to cover today,
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.740]   but I know that some of you are hungry
[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.180]   for a lot more mechanism,
[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.880]   but today's episode is really mainly focused on the tools.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.220]   I will, of course, touch on mechanism,
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.420]   but if you really want to do the deep dive on mechanism,
[00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.780]   go to HubermanLab.com and you'll have more
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:16.800]   than you ever could want about those mechanisms.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:20.380]   Let's jump into the tools for concentration and focus.
[00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:23.700]   If you want to think about tools of any kind
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.920]   to modify your biology or physiology in any way,
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.200]   whether or not it's for cognitive function
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.700]   or you want to get better at exercising
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:30.560]   or you want to build muscle
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.160]   or you want to improve your hormones,
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.540]   you need to think and understand tools
[00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.960]   in the context of modulation and mediation.
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:39.840]   What do I mean by that?
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.480]   Well, it's quite simple, really.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.960]   Mediation is how specific types of chemicals
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.940]   and cells and circuits and organs
[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.080]   control very specific things in your brain and body,
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.400]   whereas modulation is the ability of chemicals
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.940]   and cells and circuits to adjust how different things change,
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.040]   how different things work in your brain and body,
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.660]   but to do it more broadly.
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:03.500]   What do I mean by this?
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:04.780]   Let me give an example.
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.560]   For instance, I'm going to tell you now
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.040]   that one of the most important things
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:14.020]   to build and maintain your focus and concentration
[00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.320]   is to optimize your sleeping behavior.
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:20.020]   That is to get enough quality sleep,
[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.080]   I would say 80% of the nights of your life.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.860]   Not everyone can get optimal sleep
[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:25.220]   100% of the nights of their life.
[00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.280]   Nobody, truly nobody achieves that.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.060]   However, sleep has been shown to relate
[00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.780]   to cognitive performance, physical performance,
[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.660]   hormone output, and so many other things,
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.380]   including immune system function.
[00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:42.520]   What we can reliably say is that sleep modulates
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.880]   just about every process in your brain and body.
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.120]   So you have to get great sleep.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.260]   There's simply no tool that's going to allow you
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.060]   to overcome chronic sleep deprivation
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:54.560]   and allow you to remain focused.
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:58.840]   No pill, no device, no supplement, no protocol whatsoever.
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.000]   There are tools to overcome one night
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.600]   or maybe two nights of sleep deprivation,
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.040]   and we'll talk about those,
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.560]   but at a fundamental level,
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.600]   we need to do the things that modulate
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.200]   our focus and attention in powerful ways,
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.200]   and sleep really is that thing.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.200]   So we've done two episodes, one called Master Your Sleep,
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.920]   and the other episode is Perfect Your Sleep.
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.260]   The Perfect Your Sleep is a little bit more
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.120]   like this episode, more focused on protocols.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.440]   Master Your Sleep includes protocols and mechanism.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.200]   Again, you can find those at HubermanLab.com.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.020]   We also have a sleep toolkit,
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.440]   a distilled list of things to do
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.720]   in order to optimize your sleep.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.800]   I highly recommend that you download that.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.040]   You can go to HubermanLab.com,
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.360]   go to the Neural Network Newsletter.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.200]   It is listed there.
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.680]   If you want, you can sign up for the newsletter,
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.560]   but you don't have to.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.080]   You can simply download the PDF of that toolkit
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.900]   for zero cost.
[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:45.960]   Why do I say sleep modulates focus and attention?
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.920]   Well, I'll give an analogy.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.840]   If right now someone pulled a fire alarm in this building,
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.140]   or if we had a fire in this building,
[00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.120]   my attention would drift.
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.240]   It would not be on recording this podcast.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.800]   It would be on something else.
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.120]   But would I say that the fire alarm mediates attention?
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.520]   I mean, fire alarms are not really involved in attention.
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.680]   No, rather, they modulate my attention.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.920]   The noise in the room modulates my attention.
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.320]   That's quite a bit different
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.680]   than a tool that I'll provide later,
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.220]   and I'll just give you a little hint of now.
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:14.600]   In fact, I'll give it to you now,
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.720]   which is that 40 hertz binaural beats
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.040]   have been shown in a number of peer-reviewed studies
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.420]   to increase focus and concentration.
[00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:25.360]   And if you'd like to access 40 hertz binaural beats
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.740]   in order to improve your focus and concentration,
[00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:28.580]   you can do that.
[00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.200]   You can actually get it at zero cost.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.240]   You can go into the App Store.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.040]   For instance, the Apple App Store.
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.660]   This is also available for Android phone.
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.940]   There's an app called Brainwave, and you can go there.
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.580]   You can dial in 40 hertz,
[00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.500]   and it'll play these binaural beats.
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.920]   It's been shown in multiple quality peer-reviewed studies
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.280]   that playing a pattern of sound waves to one ear,
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.040]   doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, and the other ear,
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.660]   which is slightly offset in frequency,
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:50.980]   meaning not quite the same frequency,
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.580]   so more like doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,
[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:54.240]   that that combination of frequencies
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.340]   played to the different ears
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:59.280]   actually get integrated within deep brain centers
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.420]   and can increase focus and concentration
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.980]   in part by increasing levels
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.340]   of the neurochemical dopamine and acetylcholine,
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:07.740]   which we talked about a little bit earlier
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.900]   in this aero model of focus.
[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.860]   So we'll provide a link to that app.
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.740]   I don't have any relationship to that app I should mention,
[00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:16.780]   but it's an excellent one.
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:18.140]   It's one that I've used for many years.
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.560]   There are also additional functions within the app,
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.700]   such as for sleep and for other things,
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.220]   but the 40 hertz, four zero HZ,
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.420]   is the way it reads out.
[00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.400]   40 hertz stimulation has been shown
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.460]   to improve focus and concentration.
[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.580]   Here is my recommendation in the way that I use it.
[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:36.340]   I would not use 40 hertz binaural beats
[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:38.620]   every time I'm doing a bout of work.
[00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:39.900]   What I tend to do is use it
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:43.060]   for about five minutes prior to that work
[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:45.160]   and then turn it off and then do the work,
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.780]   and I'll talk about other tools to use during that work,
[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.000]   whether or not it's reading or math or even just emailing
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.380]   or something where I require a bunch of focus for awhile.
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:56.340]   However, there are times in which I'm in an area
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:57.380]   or I'm in a state of mind
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:58.620]   where I'm feeling very distractible,
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:00.400]   and then I'll keep the 40 hertz binaural beats
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.260]   on the entire time I'm doing that bout of cognitive work.
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.380]   I'll also sometimes use the 40 hertz binaural beats
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.400]   prior to a workout, in particular weight workouts,
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.860]   where I really want to be able to focus on
[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.460]   and contract specific muscles.
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.020]   This is a very useful tool,
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.620]   again, supported by quality peer-reviewed science,
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.600]   zero cost available out there,
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.540]   not just in the Brainwave app, but in multiple apps.
[00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.980]   I think many of you will benefit from it.
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.300]   Some of you might not experience it immediately
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.420]   as a total dropping into a tunnel of focus
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:30.460]   in the same way that you might with, say,
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:33.180]   the sorts of neurochemicals that we'll talk about later,
[00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:35.300]   like alpha-GPC and some of these other things
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.580]   that change neurochemicals directly.
[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:39.980]   But nonetheless, 40 hertz binaural beats
[00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.320]   are a very powerful tool.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.580]   Again, zero cost non-pharmacologic tool
[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.820]   that tap into your own endogenous, meaning within you,
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.040]   or exists within you, physiology,
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.620]   in order to increase acetylcholine
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:51.980]   and some other neurochemicals,
[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.580]   and they have been shown to work quite well.
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.640]   Okay, so assuming that you are sleeping well
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.020]   80% of the nights of your life,
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:01.740]   or at least working on the various protocols and tools
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.540]   to sleep well and sufficiently long,
[00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.500]   80% of the nights of your life,
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.420]   and you are interested in additional tools
[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.380]   that are sound-based in order to improve
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.460]   your ability to concentrate and focus.
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.860]   There are quality peer-reviewed studies
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:20.260]   supporting the idea that white noise or pink noise,
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.120]   and believe it or not, there is something called pink noise.
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.180]   It has to do with the specific frequencies of sound
[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.560]   that are in the noise.
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:30.100]   Well, white noise and pink noise have been shown
[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.360]   to not improve concentration per se,
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.980]   but to improve people's ability
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.900]   to transition into concentrated states.
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.060]   So I don't tend to use white noise and pink noise
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.380]   while I work, but I know a number of people that do.
[00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:45.120]   I know people that also use what's called brown noise.
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.040]   The folks I know from the engineering
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.820]   and computer science side get really into these details
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.660]   of white noise, pink noise, brown noise.
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.140]   You can find white noise, pink noise, or brown noise
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.260]   and listen to it through headphones or in the room.
[00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.480]   There is indeed some data to support the fact
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.680]   that white noise and to some extent pink noise
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.540]   and brown noise can support the release
[00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:05.620]   of particular neurochemicals,
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:09.300]   but more data showing that they can amplify the activity
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.940]   of neurons in the so-called prefrontal cortex,
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:14.900]   this front area, sort of the bumper behind your forehead,
[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:18.020]   that is directly related to your ability
[00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:19.660]   to direct your own focus
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.940]   and remain focused on certain things.
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:26.540]   So you have the option of either using binaural beats before
[00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:29.340]   but not during your work, that is 40 hertz binaural beats
[00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.060]   or 40 hertz binaural beats
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.980]   throughout your attempt to focus.
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.880]   You also have the option of not using binaural beats
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.420]   but using white noise, pink noise, or brown noise.
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:41.500]   Again, there are a lot of zero cost apps.
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.620]   You can find also white noise, pink noise,
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.340]   and brown noise on YouTube.
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.060]   Again, these are tools that really have been shown
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:51.460]   over and over in humans to allow people to focus
[00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:54.620]   with more depth and to decrease the transition time
[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:55.540]   into focus.
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:56.620]   This is a really key point.
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:58.060]   A lot of people are challenged
[00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:00.660]   with getting into a mode of focus.
[00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:03.880]   None of us, however, should be expected to just sit down
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.740]   and drop directly into a state of focus.
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:09.600]   I think that's completely an unfair request of ourselves.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.100]   I mean, for instance, you wouldn't expect yourself
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.240]   to go out on the track or go out for a run and not warm up.
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.000]   You might jog for a few minutes or even walk
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.380]   before you would jog and then jog before you would run,
[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:20.020]   right, I would hope you would do that.
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.740]   And if you're doing resistance training,
[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.780]   I doubt that you go over and load up the bar of the machine
[00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:25.380]   with the maximum amount of weight that you can move
[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.140]   and then just drop right into that, you always do a warmup.
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.660]   And I think it's very important to understand mental work,
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.640]   focus, and concentration as requiring that warmup.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.140]   What is that warmup?
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.340]   Well, you know what that warmup is.
[00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:40.100]   That warmup is the ramping up or the increase
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:45.100]   of epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine, and dopamine.
[00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.300]   The way that neurochemicals work is we don't just get
[00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.340]   to flip switches in our brain because we decide to.
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:51.180]   That's a fantasy.
[00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:54.420]   That's sort of the limitless movie or, you know,
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:55.860]   movies and ideas that suddenly, you know,
[00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:56.980]   you're going to flip a switch on your arm
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.840]   and all of a sudden you're going to be in a laser focus.
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:01.420]   That is just not the way that your nervous system works.
[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:03.820]   There's a gradual dropping into any state,
[00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.220]   whether or not that state is sleep, right?
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:06.720]   You go from shallow sleep to deep sleep
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.540]   and then out eventually.
[00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:11.860]   Focus too, you go from shallow focus
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:13.740]   to increasingly deep focus.
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:18.700]   That is in our metaphor of the arrow, it's very broad.
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:19.780]   It's pointed at a lot of things.
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:21.520]   And over time, as we drop into focus,
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.220]   that arrow is narrowing and narrowing and narrowing.
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.800]   In fact, probably better to think about it narrowing
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.940]   and then sometimes oscillating and getting wider again.
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:31.700]   You know, we might hear something down the hallway
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.240]   or more typically our phone will buzz or we'll think,
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.520]   oh, I wonder what so-and-so is doing
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.620]   or I had to contact them about something.
[00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.920]   Your focus is dynamic.
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.700]   It is not what we call a step function.
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.620]   It's not like you go from unfocused to focused
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:45.900]   and then you drop into your maximal focus.
[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.040]   By understanding that it's dynamic,
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:50.300]   by understanding that you are going to be continually
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:54.460]   going in and out of progressively but varying levels
[00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:58.900]   of focus, you will greatly release the pressure on yourself
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:02.160]   to feel focused all the time when you want to be.
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.000]   This is very key.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.540]   People who are very good at focusing understand this
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:09.260]   and understand that they can't expect themselves
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:11.900]   to just immediately focus and then snap into
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:13.220]   or out of focus, okay?
[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.900]   So be patient with yourself and also understand
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:19.100]   that focus is an ability that you can improve your ability
[00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:22.020]   to focus by engaging the neural circuits responsible
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.300]   for focus repeatedly over time
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.620]   through so-called neuroplasticity,
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:27.780]   the ability of your nervous system to change
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:28.820]   in response to experience.
[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.660]   And that has a couple of different components,
[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:33.900]   but put very simply, what we repeat gets etched
[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:36.500]   into our nervous system and becomes easier over time.
[00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:39.980]   And the more emotionally important
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:41.660]   or vital something feels to us,
[00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.580]   the more likely it is to trigger neuroplasticity.
[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:44.500]   We're going to talk a little bit more
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.620]   about how to increase neural circuits for focus later,
[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:48.740]   but right now, what you have in hand is
[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:49.940]   the key importance of sleep.
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:52.700]   And I, again, will direct you to Hubermanlab.com
[00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:53.820]   and the Neural Network Newsletter
[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:57.420]   to really work on optimizing your sleep.
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:01.060]   We've also got two auditory sound-based tools
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:01.900]   for improving focus.
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:04.140]   There's 40 hertz binaural beats used before
[00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.580]   or during bouts of focusing concentration.
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:09.300]   And if you don't like those, or even if you do,
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:11.660]   you might alternate them with or occasionally use white
[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.060]   noise, pink noise, or brown noise,
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:15.220]   also readily available at zero cost.
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:18.300]   The question I often get is how long should I try to focus?
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:20.820]   Well, the research literature point to the key importance
[00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:22.540]   of so-called ultradian cycles.
[00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:25.280]   You've all probably heard of circadian cycles
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.180]   or circadian biology.
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:30.700]   Circa, the day, circadian is about 24 hour cycle.
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.820]   Well, our brain and body operate within that day
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.680]   or within each and every day, I should say,
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.360]   with 90 minute ultradian cycles.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.940]   So my suggestion would be anytime you're going to sit down
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.520]   and try and focus, you're going to try and do a focused bout
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:47.660]   of physical exercise or skill learning or musical learning,
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:49.300]   or maybe you're even just having a conversation.
[00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.260]   Maybe you're a therapist or you're attending therapy
[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:53.180]   or a class, how long should it be?
[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:56.020]   And the ideal duration is about 90 minutes,
[00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:57.580]   not exactly 90 minutes,
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:00.900]   but we can reliably say 90 minutes or less, okay?
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.840]   It doesn't have to be the full 90 minutes,
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:04.740]   but trying to push yourself to be able to drop
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:07.540]   into two hours of focus or three hours of focus
[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:11.820]   while possible is not really in line with what we know
[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:13.260]   about the underlying biology.
[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:15.100]   Everything from our sleep states
[00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.780]   or the different stages of sleep
[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:18.460]   and our waking states is divided
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:21.500]   into these 90 minute cycles or so-called ultradian cycles.
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:24.200]   So what I like to do is set a timer for 90 minutes.
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.180]   I acknowledge and accept the fact
[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:27.900]   that under most conditions,
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.940]   unless I'm really pressed for a deadline
[00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:32.140]   and I'm optimally caffeinated, et cetera,
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:34.620]   the first five to 10 minutes of that 90 minutes
[00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:35.740]   are a transition time.
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.100]   It's like the warmup for focus,
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.100]   but I do include it in that 90 minutes.
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:42.480]   And then I really try and drop into doing focused
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.480]   mental work or learning of some sort.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.120]   Again, this could be physical as well, motor skill learning,
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.680]   or I think we're running or lifting weights, et cetera,
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.280]   and really try and drop into that
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.880]   across the full 90 minutes, again, accepting the fact, okay?
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:55.760]   It's not just an idea,
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.800]   the fact that occasionally our focus will flicker.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.120]   It will jump out of focus.
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.840]   And then a big part of being able to focus
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.080]   is to go back to focusing.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.400]   The way I'd like you to conceptualize this perhaps
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.800]   is that arrowhead suddenly getting very, very broad,
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.080]   that you're focusing on many things,
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.260]   or that arrow shifts to a different location in the room.
[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:14.240]   The key is to be able to shift it back.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.520]   And to narrow it once again.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.400]   And that's an active process.
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:20.360]   So much so that it requires a lot of metabolic energy.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:25.360]   Your brain is the chief consumer of metabolic energy.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.840]   The calories that you consume
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.180]   is so-called basal metabolic rate.
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:29.700]   Most of that isn't related to movement
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:30.680]   or heartbeat or breathing.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.520]   It's related to brain function.
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.880]   Your brain is a glutton with respect to caloric need.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.800]   So understand that at the end of 90 minutes,
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.400]   or maybe even after 45 minutes,
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.080]   you might feel rather tired or even exhausted.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:45.140]   And it's very important that after about a focus,
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.880]   that you take at least 10 minutes,
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.960]   and ideally as long as 30 minutes,
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.620]   and go through what I call deliberate defocus.
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:54.220]   You really want to focus on somewhat menial tasks
[00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:55.800]   or things that really don't require
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.880]   a ton of your concentration.
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.040]   This is starting to become a little bit of a movement
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.180]   out there in the kind of pop psychology
[00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:04.000]   and optimization world.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.260]   This idea of not looking at your phone
[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:07.600]   as you walk down the hall to the bathroom.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.100]   Certainly not looking at your phone in the bathroom.
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.520]   And I should mention, by the way,
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.680]   this is a particular annoyance of mine.
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.600]   Have you noticed that wait times for restrooms
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.560]   in public places has increased substantially
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:18.800]   in the last 10 years?
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.640]   The reason for that is not digestive, okay?
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.160]   It's not the gut microbiome.
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.640]   I mean, it might be the gut microbiome,
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.460]   but chances are it's because people are on their phones
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:27.300]   in the bathroom.
[00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:30.040]   So you're doing yourself and everybody else a favor
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.440]   by staying off your phone in the restroom,
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:35.360]   staying off your phone while walking down the hall.
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.440]   Try and give yourself some time to deliberately decompress,
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.200]   to let your mental states idle,
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.040]   to not be focused on any one thing.
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.020]   That period of idling is essential
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.400]   for your ability to focus.
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.480]   Much in the same way that rest between sets
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:52.560]   of resistance training or rest between exercise
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:55.240]   is vital to being able to focus and perform
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.760]   during the actual sets or during the actual bouts
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:00.080]   of running or cycling or whatever
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.200]   your particular form of exercise might be.
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.360]   So deliberate decompression is key.
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.800]   And I know this is hard because we're all being drawn in
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:11.160]   by the incredible rich array of sensory information
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:13.480]   available on our phones and other devices,
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.400]   but I can't emphasize this enough.
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.940]   Our ability to focus is not just related
[00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:20.820]   to what happens during the entry and movement
[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:21.880]   through those focus bouts,
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.760]   but after those focus bouts,
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.540]   we really need to deliberately decompress.
[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.320]   And of course, the ultimate decompress,
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.400]   the time in which we are not directing our thinking
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.840]   and our action is during sleep.
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.260]   And so it's no wonder,
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.240]   or I should say it holds together logically
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.440]   that that deep long lasting duration
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.960]   of not controlling where our mind is at
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.480]   is in fact the ultimate form of restoration
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.320]   even if we have very intense dreams.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.680]   So take that period after each 90 minute
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.880]   or less focus bout, right?
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.160]   Remember those focus bouts don't have to be full 90 minutes.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.880]   Let's say you do 45 minutes of work.
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:52.720]   You're just done with it,
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:55.320]   set it down and go do something for maybe five, 10,
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:59.280]   maybe even 30 minutes that is functional for your day, right?
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.940]   Just not just walking around in circles
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:02.920]   or staring up at the sky, although if you can do that,
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.280]   do that, but most of us have other things to do,
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.920]   but do things that are rather automatic
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:10.440]   or reflexive for you and try not to do any focused reading,
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.280]   try not to bring your vision into a tight location
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:16.420]   such as your phone and try and deliberately decompress
[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:18.880]   because that will allow you to drop into
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.600]   intense bouts of focus again,
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.640]   repeatedly and repeatedly throughout the day.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:25.160]   I'm often asked how many ultradian cycles
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:26.780]   one can perform throughout the day.
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.760]   That depends on how well you slept,
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:29.880]   how well you are nourished,
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.320]   which we'll talk about in a moment
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.520]   and how well trained up your focus capacity is.
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:37.040]   And here's the paradox.
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:39.560]   If you are very trained at focusing,
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:41.600]   if you're very good at dropping into focus,
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.760]   you're actually going to need
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.280]   more deliberate decompression and defocus.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.400]   And I recommend only doing about two,
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:51.080]   maybe three deep work sessions per day.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:53.320]   So not one 90-minute session
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.120]   then expecting yourself to do another one
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:55.940]   and another one, another one,
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:58.340]   but rather one deep work 90-minute session
[00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:00.100]   and maybe another in the afternoon.
[00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:01.820]   A lot of people get surprised by this and say,
[00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:03.360]   "Wait, how many people can afford
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.640]   to just work three hours a day?"
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.080]   I'm not saying just work three hours a day.
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.360]   I'm really talking about the hard mental work.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:11.120]   And again, somewhat paradoxically,
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.600]   the more you can concentrate,
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.380]   the more deeply you can concentrate,
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.840]   the fewer deep work concentration bouts
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.200]   you can actually perform each day.
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.440]   It makes sense, however,
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.800]   if you think about it in the context of say,
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:22.620]   resistance training,
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:25.360]   if you are stronger and stronger in the gym
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.720]   or you're an endurance athlete
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:30.540]   and you can run ultra marathons a hundred miles or so,
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:33.760]   you are essentially cutting a deeper cut
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.000]   into your recovery capacity
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.260]   than somebody who's not very skilled at those things
[00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:40.700]   or can't perform as much intense work.
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.560]   So the intensity of the work scales directly
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:46.080]   with how long you need to rest after that work.
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.620]   I, at this stage of my life,
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:49.540]   am pretty good at dropping into
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:52.180]   and maintaining focus bouts of concentration
[00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:54.040]   provided the landscape of my life is right.
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.600]   I don't have some burning stressful thing
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.040]   that's essential or an emergency that I'm tending to
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:00.340]   and that I put my phone away or turn it off.
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:03.880]   I can do three 90-minute focus bouts per day,
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:04.920]   but that's about it.
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.880]   And then in between those focus bouts,
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.260]   I'm doing other things that require less focus.
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:11.140]   Some of you may be able to perform four.
[00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:15.060]   What I highly recommend is that you try doing at least one,
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:18.520]   that is one 90-minute or less bout
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:21.520]   of focused concentrated work per day.
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.080]   And yes, that means the weekends too.
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:23.920]   And on the weekends,
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.520]   I like to read a book with my phone nowhere in sight,
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:28.720]   not on a device, that's what I do.
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.360]   Or I'll listen to an audio book sometimes
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.360]   while taking a walk,
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:34.200]   but really concentrating on what I'm trying to learn,
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.960]   what I'm hearing and what I'm seeing.
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:39.120]   So again, a daily 90-minute bout is one to start with.
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.820]   And I would say after about four weeks of that,
[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:42.120]   if you're able to stay concentrated
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.460]   and work through the agitation,
[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:46.600]   then I would consider increasing the number of focus bouts.
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:49.440]   Again, this is not to say that you should go to your teacher
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:52.600]   or your PhD advisor or your parent or your friends
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:54.320]   and say, listen, I can't really concentrate
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:56.740]   or think about anything for more than 90 minutes per day.
[00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:57.580]   That's not what I'm saying.
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:58.880]   These are deep focus bouts.
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:02.640]   These are bouts of work or I should say mental work
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.100]   or physical work where you're really forcing yourself
[00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:06.160]   to focus and refocus,
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.840]   to sharpen the head of that arrowhead,
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.940]   to redirect it to what you're trying to concentrate on.
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:11.480]   And it is indeed hard work.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.120]   I would even think about it more or less like a workout
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.180]   of any kind.
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:16.920]   Before we continue with today's discussion,
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.520]   we're going to take a brief pause
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:21.040]   to acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens,
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.800]   also called AG1.
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:26.100]   I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012.
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:27.940]   So I'm delighted that they've been a sponsor
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:29.520]   of this podcast.
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:32.340]   Athletic Greens contains vitamins, minerals, probiotics,
[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:35.080]   digestive medicines, and adaptogens.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.360]   So it's got a lot of things in there.
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.000]   And that's actually the reason I started taking it.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.680]   And the reason I still take it once or twice a day,
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:42.800]   essentially covers all of my nutritional bases.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.040]   And the probiotics in particular are important to me
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.380]   because of the critical importance
[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:47.980]   of what's called the gut brain axis.
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:51.220]   That is neurons and other cell types in the gut,
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.740]   in the digestive tract that communicate with the brain
[00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:56.020]   and the brain back to the digestive tract
[00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:58.340]   in order to control things like mood,
[00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:01.380]   immune function, hormone function, and on and on.
[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:02.800]   Whenever somebody has asked me
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.980]   what's the one supplement they should take,
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:06.620]   I always answer Athletic Greens.
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:09.020]   I gave that answer long before I ever had this podcast.
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:10.780]   And it's the answer I still give now
[00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:13.580]   for all the reasons that I detailed just a moment ago.
[00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:14.940]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:17.820]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:18.920]   to claim a special offer.
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.340]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:22.100]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:23.100]   while you're on the road,
[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:25.920]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2,
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:28.120]   which are also very important for a huge number
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.240]   of bodily factors and brain factors
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.140]   that impact your immediate and long-term health.
[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:34.760]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:36.320]   to claim that special offer.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.300]   I'd like to call your attention
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.460]   to a new and extremely useful tool
[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:42.100]   for learning and applying science-based protocols
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.460]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:47.420]   It's called Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N.
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:48.420]   And it's an app.
[00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:51.200]   And inside the app, you'll find what are called journeys.
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.580]   Each journey is aimed at a specific goal,
[00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:56.780]   such as improving your sleep, or tracking your sleep,
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:59.940]   or improving your ability to focus and concentrate,
[00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:04.640]   or improving your nutrition, or specific exercise programs.
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.080]   The Virtusan app makes a lot of the protocols
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.140]   that you've seen here on the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:11.600]   and elsewhere very easy to understand
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.060]   and access and practice.
[00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:15.100]   And in fact, it tracks your progress
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.780]   with each of these protocols.
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:18.260]   I and several other researchers
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.620]   have been directly involved
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:22.060]   in developing the specific journeys and protocols
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:23.820]   that you'll find within the Virtusan app.
[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:26.580]   In fact, a lot of it involves direct video tutorials
[00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.580]   from me and others that you'll recognize
[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:30.580]   from social media and from podcasts.
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:32.740]   Everything that you'll find within the Virtusan app
[00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:34.860]   is geared towards giving you the latest science
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.220]   in simple, straightforward protocols
[00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:38.860]   to allow you to improve your mental health,
[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:40.900]   physical health, and performance.
[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:41.780]   If you want to check it out,
[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:44.260]   you can go to the app store under Virtusan.
[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:47.100]   Again, that's spelled V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N,
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:50.580]   or you can go to virtusan.com/huberman.
[00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:53.280]   Again, that's virtusan.com/huberman.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.980]   I mentioned the topic of nutrition a little bit ago,
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:58.100]   and of course, nutrition is a complicated topic.
[00:36:58.100 --> 00:36:59.480]   In fact, one of the quickest ways
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:01.580]   to get yourself into a battle online
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:03.940]   is to say something definitive about nutrition.
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:06.360]   I just want to clearly state my stance about nutrition.
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:08.320]   I fully support and applaud those of you
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.740]   that are vegans for whatever reason,
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:11.940]   those of you that are pure carnivore for whatever reason,
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:14.060]   and those of you that are omnivores for whatever reason.
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:15.420]   I happen to be an omnivore.
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:17.240]   My goal is always to eat high quality,
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:19.140]   minimally or non-processed foods,
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:20.380]   and to eat things in moderation.
[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:23.260]   So I do eat some meat from sustainable sources
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:24.700]   or from organic sources.
[00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:27.920]   I eat some starches and I eat vegetables and I eat fruits.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.220]   I try not to eat sugars,
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:30.780]   and I don't really like highly processed foods
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:31.780]   at this point in my life.
[00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:33.000]   That's me, that's what I do,
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.340]   but I'm certainly not dictating what people should eat.
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:36.940]   I know certain people are ketogenic,
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:40.060]   and I can say that for people who achieve ketosis
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:42.340]   and can get into ketosis, yes, indeed,
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:44.820]   there is a mental state associated with ketosis
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:46.780]   that will allow your brain to function
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:48.060]   and to think really clearly
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.860]   that many people find very attractive
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:52.140]   and keep them going back over and over again
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.460]   to a ketogenic diet.
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:54.540]   I'm somebody who, for instance,
[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:57.020]   has not been in ketosis many times in my life,
[00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:58.680]   at least not deliberately so,
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:01.340]   but I actually will ingest liquid ketones from time to time
[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:03.660]   because of the further cognitive enhancement
[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:05.320]   or physical enhancement that I experience
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:08.740]   on top of nutrition that does include some carbohydrates.
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:11.100]   So there are a lot of different ways to approach all this.
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:13.500]   Whether or not you're a vegan, omnivore, vegetarian,
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:16.540]   carnivore, et cetera, the point is this.
[00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:18.360]   Your ability to focus, and in fact,
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:21.900]   your ability of neurons to encode specific information
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.840]   in your environment, that is to represent
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.140]   what's out there in the world,
[00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:28.100]   is actually related to your blood glucose level.
[00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:31.620]   Now, here I'm setting aside the discussion of ketosis
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:33.880]   and ketogenic diets for the moment,
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:34.900]   but there's a beautiful study
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.460]   that was published in Neuron not long ago
[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:37.500]   that showed that the tuning,
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:40.340]   that is the precision with which neurons in the brain
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:42.380]   will represent things in our environment
[00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:44.740]   is actually much greater
[00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:47.020]   when there is sufficient glucose in the brain.
[00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:50.060]   Translated into English, this means that when we are fasted
[00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:52.020]   or when our blood glucose is very low,
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:56.040]   we aren't able to perceive and think about things as clearly.
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.740]   Now, there's a twist to this, however.
[00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:59.820]   Many people who practice intermittent fasting,
[00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:00.840]   and I should say I practice
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.440]   a sort of pseudo-intermittent fasting.
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.640]   I generally eat my meals
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.860]   between the hours of 11 a.m. and 8 p.m.,
[00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:07.900]   although sometimes there's some wiggle around that.
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:09.260]   Occasionally I have an early breakfast.
[00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:10.700]   I'm not super rigid about it,
[00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:12.060]   but I know there are a number of people
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:13.220]   who are doing longer fasts
[00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:15.660]   or they're eating in a six-hour window.
[00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:17.840]   We did an entire episode about fasting.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:19.980]   You can, again, find that at hubermanlab.com.
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:21.780]   We'll likely have Sachin Panda,
[00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:24.800]   who's an expert in intermittent fasting on the podcast.
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.260]   Intermittent fasting
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:29.060]   has a lot of different potential benefits.
[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:30.460]   For some people, it's a convenient way
[00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:31.460]   to restrict their calories.
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:33.660]   For other people, it's a convenient way to avoid eating.
[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:36.300]   That is, it's easier to not eat than to eat a small portion,
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:38.500]   so they opt for intermittent fasting,
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:39.880]   and so on and so forth.
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.720]   But one of the things that you hear very often
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.420]   is that some people like being fasted
[00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:46.660]   because they like the clarity of mind that it provides.
[00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:48.060]   Here's the situation.
[00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:50.020]   Neurons, unless you're in a ketogenic diet,
[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:51.540]   really thrive on glucose.
[00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:53.140]   They love glucose.
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:54.680]   And as I mentioned before,
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:56.520]   your ability to think and perceive things
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:57.860]   is actually enhanced
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:00.060]   by having sufficient glucose in your bloodstream.
[00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:02.460]   So why would it be that some people experience
[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:05.100]   a heightened state of mental clarity when they are fasted?
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:06.940]   I've certainly experienced that before.
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:09.540]   Well, I should say that provided you're well hydrated enough
[00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:11.500]   and you have enough electrolytes in your system,
[00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:14.120]   what tends to happen is that when you ingest food,
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:15.660]   there's a shift in your nervous system
[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:17.700]   towards so-called parasympathetic mode.
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:19.200]   That is, the more relaxed,
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.780]   you probably heard it as rest and digest,
[00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:22.880]   although it does other things, the more relaxed mode,
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.540]   that can indeed make us very sleepy.
[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:25.820]   If we have too many carbohydrates,
[00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:27.440]   it actually can make us quite sleepy.
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:31.140]   However, if we have any food, if we have enough of it,
[00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:34.060]   that is, if our gut is full, it diverts blood to our gut,
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:36.460]   and we become sleepy and we can't focus as well.
[00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:38.400]   So a lot of people really like fasting
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:41.700]   in the state of being fasted for focus and concentration,
[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.940]   because they don't have as much
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:45.900]   of that parasympathetic activation.
[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:46.960]   They're just not as sleepy.
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:48.560]   And in fact, under those conditions,
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:51.340]   half as much caffeine will give you just as much lift
[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:53.500]   as twice as much caffeine will give you
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:54.740]   on a full belly of pasta.
[00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:56.020]   And that's just the way that caffeine
[00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:57.360]   interacts with blood glucose.
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.940]   So what I'd like you to imagine
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:02.300]   is if you had a measure of focus from zero to 10,
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:04.800]   these are arbitrary units, 10 being maximally focused
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.960]   and zero being not focused at all.
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:10.020]   Imagine a U-shaped function, right?
[00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:11.860]   Where if you're very fasted,
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:14.840]   you're going to have a high degree of focus and concentration.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:17.360]   But then if you ingest some food and your belly is full,
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:19.700]   your focus and concentration is reduced.
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:22.220]   But having enough blood glucose
[00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:24.300]   and maybe even elevated blood glucose
[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:25.820]   will increase cognitive function.
[00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:27.060]   So there are two ends of the spectrum.
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:28.320]   On one end of the spectrum,
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.140]   blood glucose is relatively low and you're fasted,
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:34.700]   and you can think and behave in a very concentrated way.
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.300]   And on the other end of the spectrum,
[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:37.720]   you have a lot of blood glucose,
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:39.160]   or I should say sufficient blood glucose.
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.460]   You never want your blood glucose to be too high.
[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:45.200]   And that allows your neurons to encode and perceive
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:47.440]   and basically allow you to think really clearly.
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.520]   So you sort of have to pick your condition.
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:52.780]   What do you want for your bouts of focus and concentration?
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:53.820]   I actually do both.
[00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:55.340]   So what I do is, as I mentioned before,
[00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.960]   I eat my meals sometime around 11 AM, my first meal,
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:00.080]   typically, unless I'm very hungry when I wake up.
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:04.500]   And so I will do my workout in one bout of focused work.
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:07.540]   I always think of this as my hard work early in the day.
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:08.940]   And I do that fasted.
[00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:11.220]   I'll be consuming water with electrolytes,
[00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:12.660]   maybe Element or other electrolytes,
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:14.700]   maybe some caffeine as well
[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:17.160]   in the form of Yerba Mate or coffee.
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:20.340]   That's my first focus bout of 90 minutes or less.
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:21.820]   That is essentially done fasted.
[00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:22.900]   And then I'll eat.
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:24.740]   And then I do notice after I eat,
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:26.900]   I actually have a diminished capacity to focus.
[00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:28.220]   But then again, in the afternoon,
[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:30.180]   I will do another 90 minute bout of focus.
[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:31.720]   And I'll talk about some of the tools I use
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.100]   to make sure that that bout of focus is optimal
[00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:37.440]   for getting the most amount of focused work done,
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:39.300]   whether or not it's mental work or physical work,
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:41.540]   although I tend to do my physical work early in the day
[00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:44.540]   and my mental work both early and late in the day.
[00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:48.340]   So to make this very simple or as simple as I can for you,
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:52.040]   being fasted is great for focus and concentration
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:55.120]   provided you're not thinking about food the entire time.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:58.240]   And being fed is terrific for focus and concentration,
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:00.520]   actually can improve neuronal function
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:02.960]   provided that you didn't eat too much food.
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:06.240]   So one way to manage this is if you're going to have a lunch
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.400]   to make sure that you don't stuff yourself at lunch,
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.760]   that you're not overeating and to not get quite so full
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:13.700]   that you put your nervous system
[00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:15.160]   into this parasympathetic mode
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:17.240]   and make it hard to focus in the afternoon.
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:18.600]   I know a lot of people experience a dip
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:20.320]   or even a crash in energy in the afternoon
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:21.920]   that make it really hard to focus.
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:23.920]   For that reason, I'll just remind people of a tool
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:25.640]   I've talked about many times before,
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.360]   which is based on the biology of adenosine
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:28.600]   and caffeine, et cetera,
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:31.120]   which is to delay your first caffeine intake
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.680]   to 90 to 120 minutes after waking up.
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:35.700]   I know that can be painful for certain people.
[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:36.880]   I violate that rule
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.780]   when I'm working out very early in the morning,
[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:41.260]   I'll drink my caffeine before my workout,
[00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:45.200]   which often occurs within 30 to 60 minutes of waking.
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.920]   But in general, unless I'm working out very early,
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.960]   I will ingest my caffeine 90 to 120 minutes
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:52.500]   after I wake up.
[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:53.900]   So again, I want to emphasize
[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:56.060]   that if you hear somebody out there say,
[00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:59.640]   "Being fasted is optimal for focus and concentration."
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:02.220]   Well, that is true in one context
[00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:04.800]   and perhaps ideal for a certain part of the day.
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:06.200]   And other people will say,
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.980]   "No, you know, neurons run on glucose.
[00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:09.860]   You need glucose in your bloodstream
[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:12.380]   in order to get those neurons to be tuned,
[00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:14.540]   that is to respond with electrical activity
[00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:16.940]   in the optimal way when you're reading something
[00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:18.220]   or when you're trying to perform exercise."
[00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:19.300]   Well, that's also true.
[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:21.340]   And of course you can incorporate both.
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:23.820]   I, in fact, as I just described,
[00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:27.100]   incorporate both fasted states and fed states
[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:30.900]   in order to optimize my concentration and focus.
[00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:33.220]   And as a brief note about ketosis,
[00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:34.780]   for those of you that actually manage
[00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:36.220]   to transition into ketosis
[00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:38.660]   and are maintaining a ketogenic state,
[00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:40.700]   that, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:44.860]   can enhance brain function, concentration, and focus
[00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:47.460]   because of the way in which ketones can be used
[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:50.860]   as a so-called optimal fuel for neurons.
[00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:54.220]   The ketogenic diet was originally designed, if you will,
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:57.020]   for epilepsy, it has a whole relationship to epilepsy
[00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:58.740]   and controlling epileptic seizures.
[00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:00.980]   And it can, in fact, allow people
[00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:03.340]   to achieve focus concentrated brain states.
[00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:05.380]   So in the future, I'll do an episode about ketosis
[00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:07.580]   and be sure to circle back on how to optimize ketosis
[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:08.800]   for focus and concentration.
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:09.780]   Although I have to believe
[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:11.140]   that most of the people listening to this
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:14.020]   are probably not in ketosis or following a ketogenic diet.
[00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:17.420]   So that's why I mainly focused on fasted states
[00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:18.860]   and fed states.
[00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:20.740]   And just to make sure that I'm thorough,
[00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:22.660]   a fasted state to me would be a state
[00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:25.240]   in which you haven't ingested any calories,
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:27.100]   but may have ingested caffeine
[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:29.180]   or maybe even a small amount of artificial sweetener
[00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:30.540]   or something like that,
[00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:33.000]   but really haven't ingested any significant number
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.620]   of calories in the previous four to eight
[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:36.860]   or maybe even 12 hours.
[00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:38.720]   And again, there's tremendous variation here,
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.420]   depending on how long people have fasted,
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:41.660]   whether or not we're talking about the state
[00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:43.420]   right after people wake up, et cetera.
[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:45.140]   Again, if you're interested in intermittent fasting,
[00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:48.680]   both for sake of mental and physical health and performance,
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:51.500]   check out our episode on fasting at hubermanlab.com.
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:53.180]   I also want to touch back on this idea
[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:55.580]   of which foods can increase focus.
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:58.420]   You know, in the episode on ADHD that I did,
[00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:00.380]   I touched on this quite a bit
[00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:02.200]   as it relates to elimination diets.
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:04.200]   You know, there's a whole industry
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:06.520]   and a ton of interest for obvious reasons
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:08.960]   into what sorts of things kids and adults
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:09.900]   should and shouldn't eat
[00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:12.020]   in order to reduce symptoms of ADHD.
[00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:14.920]   I think that the sum total of those data
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:17.300]   point to the fact that reducing simple sugar intake
[00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:19.300]   and certainly highly processed foods,
[00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:22.020]   so ice cream, candy, chips, et cetera,
[00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:24.520]   those sorts of things really does seem to improve symptoms
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:26.940]   of ADHD in both children and adults.
[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:28.960]   But once you move past that and you start to say,
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.840]   well, which foods can improve concentration and focus?
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:35.420]   Well, foods that, for instance, include a lot of tyrosine,
[00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:36.880]   which is a precursor to dopamine,
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:40.160]   and now you know why dopamine is important in this context,
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:42.720]   are certainly going to increase concentration and focus.
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:46.040]   So things like Parmesan cheese, certain meats, certain nuts,
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:47.440]   you can look up which foods
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:48.960]   contain high amounts of tyrosine.
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:50.720]   There are also some fruits and vegetables
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.620]   that include higher amounts of tyrosine.
[00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:56.580]   But to be quite direct, it doesn't matter
[00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:59.120]   whether or not you're ingesting foods
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:01.740]   that are rich in the precursor amino acids
[00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:04.020]   to dopamine, acetylcholine, et cetera,
[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:07.040]   if you're consuming large amounts of those foods.
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:09.940]   That is, one can look and see, for instance,
[00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:13.460]   that a steak includes a lot of the precursors
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:14.720]   to acetylcholine.
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:17.640]   It has amino acid precursors to dopamine as well,
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.540]   and there are other foods that will do that as well.
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:22.560]   But if I were to ingest, say, two ribeye steaks,
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:24.040]   that's a lot of meat,
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:26.860]   and it will direct a lot of blood to my gut,
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:29.120]   and it will cause me to be sleepy,
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:31.440]   and that will create challenges in me
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:33.980]   being able to achieve states of focus and concentration.
[00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:36.560]   So the simple way to put this is if you eat too much
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:38.680]   or you eat a very large volume of food,
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:42.400]   you are going to diminish your focus and concentration.
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.960]   Okay, the key is to eat enough that you're nourished
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:47.480]   for the certain activities, mental and physical,
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:48.940]   that you need to perform.
[00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:50.520]   But if you're eating large meals,
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:53.700]   you are going to diminish your concentration and focus,
[00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:54.540]   period.
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:57.160]   I know many people are curious as to whether or not caffeine
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:01.720]   can improve focus and concentration, and indeed, it can.
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:05.000]   There is an immense amount of data supporting the idea
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.720]   that caffeine, provided it's consumed
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:08.240]   in the appropriate dosages,
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:11.160]   can improve mental performance and physical performance,
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.960]   and it largely does that
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:16.120]   through improvements in focus and concentration.
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:18.560]   The dosage of caffeine, of course,
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:21.280]   is going to depend on how caffeine-adapted you are,
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:23.480]   how much caffeine tolerance you have,
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:26.440]   and that is going to vary tremendously
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:28.920]   depending on whether or not you ingest that caffeine
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:31.400]   with or without food, as I mentioned earlier.
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:33.600]   But there is a kind of general range
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:35.600]   in which we can talk about caffeine
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:37.800]   as being useful for focus and concentration,
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:42.320]   and the range is basically from 100 milligrams to 400 milligrams.
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:44.040]   I want to caution everybody out there.
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:47.700]   If you're somebody who suffers from anxiety or panic attacks,
[00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:49.400]   and you're not used to ingesting caffeine,
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:52.080]   and you run out and ingest 400 milligrams of caffeine
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:53.960]   in the form of espresso or yerba mate
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.380]   or an energy drink or in pill form,
[00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:58.420]   that is going to be very uncomfortable for you.
[00:48:58.420 --> 00:48:59.880]   You're going to be sweating profusely.
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:01.140]   Your heart rate is going to increase.
[00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:04.080]   You're going to be quite panicked, in fact,
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:05.440]   or at least anxious.
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:09.220]   So be cautious with your use and adopting of caffeine
[00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:11.480]   if you're not already caffeine-adapted.
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.280]   But most people do quite well to ingest
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.440]   100 to 200 milligrams of caffeine
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:17.620]   prior to doing some focused work.
[00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:20.320]   And again, I recommend delaying your caffeine intake
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.480]   to 90 to 120 minutes after waking
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:24.340]   unless you are using that caffeine
[00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:28.160]   to really jolt your system before a workout.
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:31.020]   Caffeine can, of course, be ingested in various forms,
[00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:32.920]   even pill form, but most people ingest it
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:35.680]   in the form of coffee or my particular favorite way
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:37.880]   to ingest caffeine is yerba mate.
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:40.040]   It is important, and I should note
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:43.420]   that you should actively avoid the smoked versions
[00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:44.920]   of yerba mate as they contain a lot
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:47.380]   of carcinogenic cancer-promoting compounds.
[00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:49.720]   There's some great yerba mate brands out there.
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:52.460]   The most cost-effective way to consume it
[00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:53.860]   would be to use the loose leaf tea
[00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:55.960]   and to pour water over that.
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:57.660]   There's one particular brand that I like.
[00:49:57.660 --> 00:50:00.100]   I don't have any affiliation to them whatsoever,
[00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:01.160]   but I've been using it for years.
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:04.160]   It's Anna Park, it's an organic brand that is sold.
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:06.320]   I buy mine on Amazon, but you can find it elsewhere
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:07.360]   on the internet as well.
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:09.000]   Again, I don't have any affiliation to them.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.720]   It's just very cost-effective, very clean.
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:12.560]   It doesn't have the smoked flavor.
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.500]   At least the one that I buy is not the smoked variety,
[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:16.860]   so none of the carcinogenic compounds are in there,
[00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:18.320]   at least that I'm aware of.
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:20.160]   And I like the way it tastes,
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:23.960]   and it provides a very even lift and stimulant
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:25.640]   that I think certainly works for me
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.100]   and that a number of people I know
[00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:29.440]   that I've suggested to also enjoy.
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:34.320]   Yerba mate or caffeine also have other additional benefits.
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:38.000]   In particular, the caffeine in yerba mate and coffee
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.120]   and other sources of caffeine
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:42.280]   are known to increase the density and efficacy,
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:46.720]   that is the number and the function of dopamine receptors.
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:49.340]   And this has been shown in humans several times.
[00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:51.280]   So by ingesting caffeine pretty regularly,
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:53.600]   you're actually increasing the ability of dopamine
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:57.920]   to have this effect of increasing motivation and drive.
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:00.400]   I tend to ingest caffeine only early in the day.
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:01.980]   I tend to cut off my caffeine intake
[00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:03.660]   somewhere around one or 2 p.m.
[00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:05.840]   to ensure that I can get into a good night's sleep.
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:07.240]   But I realized that there are people out there
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:09.920]   that ingest caffeine as late as two or three in the afternoon
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:11.320]   and can still sleep fine.
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:12.580]   I will caution those of you
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:13.920]   that think that you can drink caffeine
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:16.660]   in the evening or nighttime and still fall asleep.
[00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:18.560]   All of the research points to the fact
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:20.000]   that the architecture of your sleep
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.640]   and the depth of your sleep is disrupted
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:24.340]   even if you're able to fall and stay asleep.
[00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:26.000]   The sleep you're getting is simply not as good
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.320]   as the sleep you would get if you were to shut off
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:31.240]   your caffeine intake at least eight hours before bedtime
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:33.940]   and ideally more like 10 or even 12 hours before bedtime.
[00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:36.780]   But of course there are practical constraints as well.
[00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:41.020]   Okay, so caffeine is increasing dopamine's function
[00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:45.280]   by changing the number and efficacy of dopamine receptors.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:47.120]   But of course it also increases our wakefulness,
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:48.280]   our alertness.
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:51.200]   And that is largely through the neurochemical systems
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:53.280]   related to adenosine, which is a molecule
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:54.680]   that builds up in our brain and body
[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:55.700]   the longer we are awake.
[00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:58.560]   It's part of the sleepiness system, if you will.
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:00.780]   It makes us feel fatigued or tired.
[00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:05.140]   And caffeine also operates on the epinephrine,
[00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:06.460]   the adrenaline system.
[00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:08.060]   In fact, if we ingest too much caffeine
[00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:09.820]   we'll sometimes get the jitters.
[00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:12.880]   Those jitters are really the sympathetic
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.760]   as it's called nervous systems bias toward movement.
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:18.240]   And our pupils will dilate.
[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:19.480]   They actually get broader.
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:23.880]   Now, somewhat paradoxically when our pupils get bigger,
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:25.980]   the pupils of our eyes, that is,
[00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:27.820]   our visual world actually narrows.
[00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:29.340]   It becomes more tunnel-like.
[00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:30.280]   A lot of people don't realize this.
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:32.680]   When our pupils are really small, that means we are relaxed.
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:34.200]   So if you ever see someone with really tiniest
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:36.820]   or pin-sized pupils, they are very relaxed.
[00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:39.280]   If their pupils are very big, they're very dilated,
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:42.000]   well then they are very amped up.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.080]   They are very, very alert.
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:47.400]   Caffeine increases alertness by increasing epinephrine,
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:51.040]   adrenaline release both in the brain and within the body.
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:53.840]   And so that's another way that it facilitates focus
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:55.760]   and concentration.
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:58.120]   Now, there are other ways to increase epinephrine
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:01.000]   in the brain and body besides caffeine or other stimulants.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.900]   And in fact, that has been studied.
[00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:05.320]   There's an excellent study that was carried out
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:08.080]   not that long ago on how stress itself
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:11.160]   can increase our ability to focus and concentrate.
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:12.680]   That's right, how stress itself
[00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:14.600]   can increase focus and concentration.
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:15.860]   You know, most people think of stress
[00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:18.060]   as impairing our ability to focus,
[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:19.300]   but that's actually not true.
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:22.240]   When we are stressed, it involves the deployment,
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:24.640]   the release of adrenaline, epinephrine,
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:27.920]   and that adrenaline both changes our visual field.
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:29.700]   In other words, it narrows our vision
[00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:32.080]   to a more tunnel-like focus.
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:35.220]   That is, it makes the arrow in our metaphor
[00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:37.400]   of the arrow more sharp,
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:40.280]   and it improves our concentration.
[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:42.320]   This makes sense given what we know about stress.
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:43.520]   When we're stressed, we tend to be stressed
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:44.440]   about a specific thing.
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:46.940]   We start anticipating or wondering or thinking about
[00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:48.840]   what's going to happen next, what led up to this?
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:49.900]   How is this going to impact me?
[00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:51.360]   How do I feel right now?
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:53.840]   It really narrows the context of our thinking
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:55.120]   and our behavior.
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:57.120]   So one of my favorite studies that really illustrates
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:00.460]   how stress can improve concentration and performance
[00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:02.160]   is one that was published not that long ago,
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:04.560]   and I will provide a link to this in the show notes.
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:06.420]   It's a paper published in the journal
[00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:08.820]   Experimental Psychology in 2020.
[00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:11.040]   The title of the paper is, not surprisingly,
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:14.060]   "Acute Stress Improves Concentration Performance."
[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:18.320]   First author, DeGroote, D-E-G-R-O-O-T-E.
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:21.240]   And this study involved taking a number of subjects
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:25.320]   and stressing them out or not prior to a cognitive
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:27.000]   or concentration task.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.660]   And there are a lot of data in this paper,
[00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:31.760]   but I'm just going to hone in on one specific set of data.
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:34.200]   And I should mention as I go there that they measured things
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:37.320]   like cortisol, a stress hormone, they measured anxiety.
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:38.840]   It was a quite thorough study.
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:42.000]   And what they found was that concentration performance
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.720]   improved manifold, I should say,
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:48.080]   from there was a greater than doubling of concentration
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:50.480]   and performance in the stress group.
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:52.640]   And stress in this context was provided
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:55.200]   using a standard way of inducing stress.
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:56.720]   What they basically do is they bring subjects
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:55:00.680]   into the laboratory and they have to either do something
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:03.160]   fairly mundane in the control group,
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:06.400]   or they have to do a simulated job interview
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:07.560]   and arithmetic task,
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:09.360]   and they're being evaluated as they're doing this.
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:12.560]   So this isn't intense psychosocial stress.
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:14.140]   They're not watching anything disturbing.
[00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:16.000]   They're not being traumatized in any kind of way.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.400]   This is fairly low levels of stress
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.680]   that rates their levels of epinephrine,
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:22.560]   and we know this from this study,
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:25.220]   and other levels of cortisol and other stress hormone
[00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:28.240]   modestly within their brain and blood.
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:31.360]   But that even modest increase in these stress hormones
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:34.600]   and their reported psychological levels of stress
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:37.500]   really enhance their focus and concentration.
[00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.720]   This may come as surprising 'cause you,
[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:40.560]   like many people think,
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:42.800]   "Gosh, stress really diminishes cognitive performance,"
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:44.080]   but that's absolutely wrong.
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:46.480]   Stress improves cognitive performance.
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:48.600]   Now, of course, there are other ways to increase
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:50.600]   stress levels and to do that in healthy ways
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:52.760]   to improve concentration and performance,
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:54.820]   and one of the best ways to do that,
[00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:58.060]   because it's so sure fire and it's generally safe,
[00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:01.700]   provided you do it safely, is deliberate cold exposure.
[00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:04.440]   This is something I've talked about on the podcast before,
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:06.280]   but deliberate cold exposure can be achieved
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:09.320]   by getting into a cold shower for one to five minutes.
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:10.200]   If you're not used to it,
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.960]   you probably want to start with one minute,
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:13.660]   or you can get into an ice bath,
[00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:15.040]   or nowadays there are a number of different
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:17.160]   commercial sources of circulating cold water,
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:19.840]   or if you have access to a body of cold water,
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:22.240]   like a lake or a pool or an ocean,
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:26.320]   we know that getting into cold water or under cold water
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:28.720]   greatly increases epinephrine levels
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:31.320]   and dopamine levels in the brain and blood.
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:32.920]   There's a beautiful study that was published
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:35.020]   in the European Journal of Physiology
[00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:37.720]   that showed that the increases in dopamine are massive,
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:40.760]   you know, near doubling or more of dopamine levels
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:42.960]   that are very long-lasting for hours,
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:46.120]   and epinephrine and indeed cortisol levels
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:49.800]   are also increased, and in ways that support
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:53.760]   not just immune system function, because they do that,
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:55.360]   and mood, because it does that,
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:57.980]   but they can really improve concentration and focus.
[00:56:57.980 --> 00:57:01.200]   I touched on this a little bit in an episode about memory,
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:03.960]   that there is an age-old practice,
[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:06.040]   really dating back to medieval times,
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:08.520]   of putting people into cold water
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:10.200]   right after they learn something
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:12.800]   in order to spike, to increase their epinephrine,
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:14.820]   as a way to consolidate those memories.
[00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:16.360]   For the sake of today's discussion,
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:18.920]   if you're interested in ways to improve focus
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:23.040]   and concentration, you need to increase your epinephrine,
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:24.920]   your adrenaline levels.
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:28.580]   Cold water exposure is one of the most efficient ways
[00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:29.920]   to do that.
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:31.600]   This is not a biohack.
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:34.380]   I don't like the word hack, I know it's commonly used,
[00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:36.720]   but a hack is something where you're using one thing
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:38.900]   for a different purpose than it was originally intended for.
[00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:40.480]   And here, I'm not referring to the shower
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.520]   or the cold bath, I'm referring to epinephrine.
[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:43.880]   Epinephrine is a neurochemical
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:47.520]   that will place your vision into more of a tunnel mode,
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:49.440]   which will allow you to focus on cognitive work
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:51.480]   or physical work in a more specific way.
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:53.080]   You're not going to be as distractible.
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:56.480]   And it's very easy to achieve by getting into a cold shower
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:58:00.020]   or a cold body of water for a brief period of time.
[00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:04.760]   People always ask how long to get under or into cold water
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:05.920]   and how cold to make it.
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:07.900]   Here's the thing, it should be uncomfortably cold,
[00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:11.060]   but safe to stay in for one to five minutes, okay?
[00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:13.060]   So uncomfortably cold that you really want to get out,
[00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:13.900]   but safe to stay in,
[00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:15.880]   not so cold that it's going to give you a heart attack
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:17.680]   and not so warm that it's comfortable
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:20.060]   that it doesn't create that adrenaline release.
[00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:22.500]   Cold water exposure, I should say deliberate cold water
[00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:25.000]   or non-deliberate cold water exposure
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:28.060]   reliably increases epinephrine levels.
[00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:31.180]   It is incredibly useful as a tool for this.
[00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:35.840]   And it is in fact zero cost or even negative zero cost.
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:37.120]   How could it be negative zero cost?
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:39.200]   Well, you can certainly save on your heating bill
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:40.480]   by taking a cold shower.
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:41.640]   So that's one way.
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:44.160]   And for those of you that have access to devices
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:46.120]   or locations where you can get into cold water,
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:48.440]   you can submerge, well, then that can work.
[00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:51.120]   For those of you that don't, maybe you take a cold bath,
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:52.080]   you get in up to your neck,
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:53.200]   that's going to be most efficient.
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:54.640]   For those of you that can't do that,
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:55.740]   you'll get under a cold shower.
[00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:59.380]   Again, it should be uncomfortably cold
[00:58:59.380 --> 00:59:00.800]   to the point where you want to get out,
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:04.120]   but that you can safely stay in for one to five minutes.
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:06.000]   How long should you do it before a work about?
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.640]   Well, if you get into really cold water,
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:09.620]   it's uncomfortably cold
[00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:11.000]   and get out after about three minutes,
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.400]   you're probably good to go, dry off and get to work.
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:16.480]   Some of you might think this is a little bit silly
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:18.540]   as a tool for focus and concentration,
[00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:21.600]   but if you look at the data on epinephrine
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:24.100]   and how powerfully it can increase focus,
[00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:26.040]   I think you'd be very impressed.
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:28.480]   I mean, it certainly can increase one's ability
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:30.280]   to attend to specific visual stimuli.
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:32.720]   So for reading or math work, et cetera,
[00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:34.160]   it's going to be very useful.
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:35.480]   And of course, you don't want to make it so cold
[00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:37.960]   that you're shivering and chattering the whole time.
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:39.040]   And of course you could,
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:41.320]   if you like combine this with 40 Hertz binaural beats,
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:42.860]   there's no reason why you couldn't combine
[00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:44.060]   the two protocols.
[00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:46.880]   But the point here is that a lot of people would love to,
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:50.260]   and I think ought to leverage the health promoting
[00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:52.600]   and powerful effects of increasing epinephrine
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:54.540]   on focusing on concentration
[00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:57.000]   and running out and getting stressed by a life event
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.200]   or getting into an argument or something like that,
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.480]   simply as a way to increase focus and concentration
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:03.060]   doesn't seem that adaptive to me.
[01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:04.300]   So deliberate cold exposure
[01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.840]   is a straightforward way to do that.
[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:07.300]   It doesn't involve anyone else.
[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:08.580]   I suppose you could do it with somebody else,
[01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:10.280]   but it doesn't require anyone else.
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:12.740]   And again, there are zero low
[01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:14.960]   and even negative cost ways to approach that.
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:17.800]   If you'd like to know how long the positive effects
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:21.580]   of epinephrine last toward improving focus and concentration,
[01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:23.540]   well, if we look to that study from DeGroote et al,
[01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:26.260]   the acute stress improves cognitive performance study,
[01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:29.560]   they measured concentration before and 30 minutes
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:32.400]   after the stress was induced.
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.760]   And there does appear to be a quite long lasting,
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:37.240]   really up to an hour or more effect
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:39.440]   of increasing epinephrine.
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:42.200]   So how might you apply these sorts of protocols
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:44.560]   early in the day or later in the day?
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:47.180]   Well, one suggestion or one potential protocol
[01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:49.600]   would be if you're going to sit down and do some work,
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:51.400]   if you're already feeling alert and focused,
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:52.720]   no need to reach to this tool,
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:55.120]   but if you're feeling like your focus and alertness
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:56.760]   isn't quite where you'd like it to be,
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:59.000]   you could take a three minute very cold shower
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.040]   or submerge yourself in cold water for three minutes.
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.760]   You might have a cup of coffee as well
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:04.060]   and then sit down and do that work,
[01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:06.660]   maybe even throw in the 40 Hertz binaural beats.
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:09.800]   All of that would be layering in the different systems,
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:11.340]   the different neurochemicals,
[01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:15.060]   such as acetylcholine, epinephrine and dopamine
[01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:17.180]   that are going to lend themselves to a really terrific
[01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:19.320]   90 minute or less workout.
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:22.160]   Now I'd like to discuss some of the purely behavioral tools
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:24.220]   that quality peer reviewed science say
[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:27.880]   can improve focus and concentration significantly.
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:29.700]   At the beginning of today's episode,
[01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:32.420]   I talked about the study from Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab,
[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:35.220]   where they explored a 13 minute meditation
[01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:38.160]   done every day for a period of eight weeks.
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:40.660]   That meditation led to significant improvements
[01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:42.840]   in focus and concentration ability,
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:45.480]   as well as other aspects of cognitive performance.
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:48.540]   It also improved mood and reduced stress.
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:51.300]   So you might be wondering what exactly is this meditation?
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:52.960]   The meditation is very simple
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:55.220]   and it's one that anyone can perform.
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:57.400]   What you would want to do is set a timer
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:58.860]   for about 13 minutes.
[01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:00.820]   I don't think it has to be exactly 13 minutes,
[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:03.340]   but since that's what they included in the study,
[01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:05.760]   you would set a timer for 13 minutes,
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:09.100]   you would sit or lie down, close your eyes,
[01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:12.240]   and you would simply focus on your breathing.
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:13.480]   Most people are going to benefit
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.900]   from only doing that breathing through their nose,
[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:18.100]   but if you have some sort of obstruction
[01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:19.720]   or inability to breathe just through your nose,
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.140]   you could probably also do it by breathing
[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:23.420]   through your nose and mouth or just your mouth.
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:25.900]   But ideally you would do just nasal breathing
[01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:27.180]   for a period of 13 minutes,
[01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:30.060]   concentrating on that breathing and concentrating,
[01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:32.220]   meaning bringing your awareness,
[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:34.380]   your so-called interoceptive awareness,
[01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:37.040]   if you wanted to get really technical about it,
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.340]   your interoceptive awareness to a point
[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:42.220]   just about an inch inside of your forehead.
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:44.020]   Now, of course, that might sound kind of gory
[01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:45.940]   to some of you who've never actually been
[01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:47.860]   inside your forehead,
[01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:50.200]   but just about an inch behind your forehead
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:52.340]   is where you would want to place your concentration
[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:54.820]   while also concentrating on your breathing.
[01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:56.980]   Now, here's the thing about meditation
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:59.820]   that all studies of meditation show,
[01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:04.080]   which is that unless you are a very experienced meditator,
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:07.020]   your concentration, your focus will drift
[01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:10.460]   away from your breathing and away from that location
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:14.160]   about an inch inside your head, inside your brain,
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:16.480]   about just behind your forehead.
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:20.140]   That will happen maybe every 10 seconds,
[01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:22.660]   every 20 seconds, maybe even every five seconds.
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:25.700]   But an important part of such a meditation practice
[01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:27.640]   to improve concentration and focus
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:31.180]   is that you are continually refocusing
[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:32.720]   back to that specific location
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.420]   and refocusing back on your breath.
[01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:37.900]   This is something that, again, is not often discussed.
[01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:39.540]   People think that if you do a meditation
[01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:41.420]   and you're supposed to concentrate on your breath,
[01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:42.440]   that if your mind drifts,
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:44.340]   that somehow you failed in that meditation,
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:46.160]   but actually that's not the case.
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:49.640]   A huge component of improving your ability
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:52.740]   to focus and concentrate by way of neural plasticity,
[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:55.860]   rewiring of the circuits for focus and concentration
[01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:59.520]   is the repeated return to a state of focus
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:03.220]   from a state of non-focus or diminished focus.
[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:06.600]   So think about it like trying to drive down the freeway
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:09.520]   and staying between the lane lines, excuse me,
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:10.560]   and every once in a while,
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:13.020]   because there's a bit of drift on the vehicle,
[01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:14.500]   maybe the wheels aren't aligned correctly
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.320]   or there's something else wrong with the chassis
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.360]   or the steering device,
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:19.080]   it starts to drift right a little bit.
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:21.440]   Then you hit the rumble strip and then you pull back
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:22.380]   to the center.
[01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:25.880]   That's really what a focused meditation practice is about
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:28.360]   as opposed to expecting yourself
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:31.360]   to stay between the mental lane lines, so to speak.
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:33.440]   So if you're somebody who's going to do a practice
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:34.800]   of the sort that I described,
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:37.340]   13-minute meditation practice every day,
[01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:39.360]   you'd want to sit or lie down, close your eyes,
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:40.760]   start to concentrate on your breath,
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:42.980]   focus your attention on a location
[01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:45.280]   about an inch behind your forehead,
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:48.120]   and then fully expect that at some point
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.820]   you'll be thinking about something else,
[01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:52.820]   and that's a cue to focus back to that location
[01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:54.280]   just about an inch behind your forehead
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:56.200]   and back to your breath.
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:57.780]   By doing that repeatedly over and over,
[01:04:57.780 --> 01:04:59.400]   what you're really training up
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:02.160]   is the network within your brain
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:04.520]   that indeed includes that prefrontal cortex
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:06.600]   that you're focusing on, as well as some other structures,
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:09.240]   the infratemporal cortex, indeed the hippocampus,
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:10.880]   a structure associated with memory,
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:13.220]   and other components of the neural circuit
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:16.060]   that are involved in directing our mental focus
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:17.120]   and concentration.
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:20.360]   Again, I can't emphasize the importance of this practice
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.860]   being one of focusing and refocusing.
[01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:25.180]   In fact, I would prefer to call such a practice
[01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:29.620]   a refocus-focused meditation or a constantly refocusing,
[01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:31.940]   or maybe you all can come up with a better name for it.
[01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:33.880]   I'm certainly not that good at naming things.
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:36.020]   But this sort of meditation practice
[01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:38.400]   has been shown in the study by the Suzuki Lab
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:42.720]   and other studies to really improve people's ability
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:45.300]   to focus and remain focused,
[01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:49.120]   so much so that in the beautiful book, "Altered States,"
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.460]   they describe a number of different meditation practices,
[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:54.720]   some a little bit longer than the one that I described,
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:57.000]   one that's 17 minutes, another one that's 30 minutes.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   Some people meditate as long as 60 minutes a day,
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.080]   although that's quite a long time in my opinion.
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:03.840]   The point here isn't how long you focus
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:06.840]   or somehow trying to achieve total focus
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:09.720]   for the entire 13-minute or 17-minute
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:12.400]   or 60-minute bout of meditation.
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:13.740]   While that would be wonderful,
[01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:15.840]   and I think many people aspire to do that,
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:17.320]   that's a lot of hard mental work.
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:19.720]   I think for most people out there, including myself,
[01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:24.200]   a relatively short meditation practice of about 13 minutes
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:26.720]   in which you fully expect
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.720]   your focus and concentration to drift,
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:30.640]   but that you are continually refocusing
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:33.320]   is going to be the most effective, yes, indeed,
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:36.040]   the most effective at teaching yourself
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:37.720]   to focus and stay concentrated.
[01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:40.540]   In fact, I invite you to interpret every time
[01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:43.840]   that you focus off that location about one inch
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:46.340]   behind your forehead as an opportunity to refocus
[01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:49.320]   and think about the refocusing as the trigger
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:51.000]   for teaching your neural circuits
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.600]   how to focus for extended periods of time.
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.340]   And as a bonus to that sort of meditation practice,
[01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:58.880]   the study from Wendy Suzuki's lab also showed
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:01.160]   that people experience improvements in sleep
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:02.600]   and improvements in memory.
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:05.040]   So not just improvements in mood and reduction in stress
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:07.460]   and improvements in focus and concentration,
[01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:09.120]   but all these other positive benefits
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:12.240]   from just doing that 13 minute a day meditation practice.
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:14.060]   It's one that I've started to adopt
[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:15.760]   and have felt tremendous benefit from
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:18.180]   and that I encourage many of you to try as well.
[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:20.060]   The one cautionary note is the one that I mentioned
[01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:21.160]   at the beginning of the episode,
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:24.760]   which is because the refocus, as I'll call it,
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:28.520]   meditation does involve a significant amount of effort
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:31.100]   and engagement of these prefrontal cortical circuits,
[01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:35.040]   it is disruptive to sleep if performed too closely to sleep.
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:36.640]   So if you are going to do that practice,
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:39.500]   I recommend that you not do it within the four hours
[01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:40.780]   prior to your bedtime.
[01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:42.640]   Earlier, I mentioned that I would talk about ways
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:45.440]   to improve focus if you are sleep deprived.
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:47.760]   This is something that I'm all too familiar with.
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:50.240]   I put a lot of effort into optimizing my sleep.
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:51.800]   That's something that with each passing year,
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.640]   I put more and more effort into again,
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:55.720]   because sleep is so vital for mental health,
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:58.080]   physical health, and performance of all kinds.
[01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:00.840]   But certainly in my role as a student,
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:03.940]   in my role as a professor, and in my role in life,
[01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:06.860]   I've had numerous times in which I simply
[01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:09.800]   did not get enough sleep or my sleep was terrible
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:12.540]   for whatever reason, and yet I still had work demands
[01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:14.240]   and social demands, et cetera.
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:17.060]   One practice that is very effective
[01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:20.960]   at allowing you to focus better than you would otherwise
[01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:23.020]   under conditions of sleep deprivation
[01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:26.280]   is so-called non-sleep deep rest or NSDR.
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:29.100]   This is also referred to sometimes as yoga nidra.
[01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:31.100]   Yoga nidra actually means yoga sleep.
[01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:33.280]   Yoga nidra is a practice of lying down
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:37.280]   for about 10 to 30, sometimes even as long as 60 minutes.
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:39.720]   You listen to a script, it's an audio script,
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:42.400]   that takes you through a progressive deep relaxation.
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:45.220]   It involves a body scan, some long exhale breathing.
[01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:48.040]   It is very restorative in the sense that one tends
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:52.320]   to emerge from yoga nidra or NSDR feeling greatly refreshed
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:54.900]   compared to how you felt prior to it.
[01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:57.240]   There is also terrific neuroimaging data
[01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:00.640]   from laboratories in Denmark showing that there's
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:02.280]   a restoration of dopamine levels
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:06.500]   in the so-called basal ganglia after NSDR, AKA yoga nidra.
[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:09.220]   Whether or not you call it yoga nidra or NSDR,
[01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:11.840]   which is what I refer to it as, non-sleep deep rest,
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:15.400]   you can find these scripts at zero cost, multiple places.
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:17.180]   You can find, there are certain apps
[01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:20.040]   that are NSDR or yoga nidra apps.
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:24.420]   There is a NSDR protocol that was put out there by Made For,
[01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:27.140]   which is on YouTube that you can access for free.
[01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:31.040]   There is a NSDR, or I should say a number of NSDR protocols
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:32.860]   through the Virtusan app.
[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:34.720]   There are, again, a number of different places
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:38.000]   that one can access NSDR protocols.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.240]   I do NSDR for 10 to 30 minutes per day every single day,
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:44.520]   not just on days where I'm sleep deprived.
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:45.820]   If I happen to be sleep deprived,
[01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:49.280]   I would extend that NSDR to 30 or 60 minutes.
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:51.200]   And when you do that NSDR will depend
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.400]   on when you have time for that NSDR.
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:55.180]   When I haven't slept well, what I'll try and do
[01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:57.660]   is find a quiet place where I can do NSDR
[01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:00.240]   for 30 or ideally 60 minutes.
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:02.580]   Sometimes I will fall back asleep during that NSDR.
[01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:04.760]   That's fine if you do that,
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:07.900]   but most people will stay awake during the NSDR.
[01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:10.260]   And then I'll emerge from that and go about my day.
[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:12.400]   If in the afternoon I'm very fatigued
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:15.440]   because of lack of sleep, I might do another NSDR
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:18.840]   of 10 to 30 or 60 minutes, and then another workout.
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:21.420]   Again, NSDR is something I do every day.
[01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:24.240]   I talk a lot about this in the episodes related to sleep
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:25.560]   because it can help you get better
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:28.020]   at falling and staying asleep at night,
[01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:31.000]   in addition to feeling restorative
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.700]   in that immediate timeframe of the day
[01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:33.960]   in which you do NSDR.
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:35.960]   So it's immensely beneficial at various times
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:37.540]   and for various purposes.
[01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:40.100]   But here within the context of trying to concentrate
[01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:42.260]   and focus when you're sleep deprived,
[01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:46.940]   NSDR, AKA yoga nidra, is an immensely beneficial practice.
[01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:49.420]   There's growing amounts of quality science
[01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:52.780]   pointing to the neurochemical replenishing effects,
[01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:54.460]   as I mentioned before, dopamine,
[01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:58.360]   but also the potential for NSDR to replace sleep
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:10:59.300]   that you've lost.
[01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:01.380]   I would never want anyone to try and use NSDR
[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:03.100]   as a total replacement for sleep,
[01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:05.740]   but under conditions in which you cannot control your sleep,
[01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:08.660]   NSDR is going to be the best way that I am aware of
[01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:11.680]   to restore your ability to focus and concentrate
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:13.060]   for whatever purpose.
[01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:14.860]   And if you emerge from your NSDR
[01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:15.940]   and then drink some caffeine,
[01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:18.940]   you'll notice an even greater capacity
[01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:20.180]   for focus and concentration
[01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:22.700]   for all the reasons directly related to caffeine.
[01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:25.720]   So again, NSDR is a general tool
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:28.260]   for enhancing your ability to sleep.
[01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:31.820]   And it's a tool that you can use in order to compensate for,
[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:34.740]   at least to some degree, compensate for lost sleep
[01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:36.660]   when you need to focus and concentrate.
[01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:39.860]   One thing that really contrasts NSDR and yoga nidra
[01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:41.700]   with the sort of focus meditation
[01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:42.960]   that I talked about a few minutes ago,
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:44.760]   the 13-minute meditation,
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:46.660]   is that during the 13-minute meditation,
[01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:48.920]   you're actively trying to refocus and focus,
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:50.660]   whereas during NSDR and yoga nidra,
[01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:52.780]   you're actually trying to defocus.
[01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:54.800]   So you can think of the 13-minute meditation
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:59.220]   for refocusing and focusing as directly tapping into
[01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:01.700]   and mediating improvements in the circuitry
[01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:02.940]   for focus and concentration,
[01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:05.960]   whereas you can think of NSDR and yoga nidra
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.780]   as modulating your brain and body state
[01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:12.220]   to allow you to focus and concentrate better.
[01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:14.060]   Now, another tool that you can use
[01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:17.260]   to directly tap into the circuits for focus and concentration
[01:12:17.260 --> 01:12:20.380]   and to greatly accelerate neuroplasticity,
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:23.160]   the improvements, or I should say the changes
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:24.820]   in those circuits that will allow you to focus
[01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:27.220]   and concentrate better is hypnosis.
[01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:28.500]   A lot of people hear hypnosis
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:29.820]   and they think stage hypnosis,
[01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:31.020]   people squawking like chickens
[01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:32.620]   and doing things against their will,
[01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:35.940]   but actually hypnosis is a atypical
[01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:37.500]   but highly accessible brain state
[01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:40.520]   that's been studied with a lot of rigor
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:42.620]   at Stanford University School of Medicine
[01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:44.340]   by my colleague, Dr. David Spiegel.
[01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:46.540]   He's been a guest on this podcast previously.
[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:48.200]   Hypnosis is a unique brain state
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:51.100]   because it's one in which you are deeply focused
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:52.640]   and yet deeply relaxed.
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:55.180]   So to just sort of set up the array of practices here
[01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:56.920]   so you can think about them logically,
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:13:00.260]   the focus refocus meditation is based on
[01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:02.620]   and focused on focus, no pun intended.
[01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:06.820]   NSDR and yoga nidra are aimed at deep relaxation.
[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:10.400]   Hypnosis is this atypical, very powerful brain state
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:13.300]   in which you combine high levels of focus
[01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:15.660]   and deep relaxation.
[01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:16.920]   Now, it's a little bit of a tough one
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:18.540]   to just take oneself into,
[01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:20.060]   but fortunately there's a tool
[01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:22.220]   based on a lot of quality peer-reviewed research
[01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:23.740]   from the Spiegel Lab and other labs,
[01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:26.660]   and that is the Reverie app, R-E-V-E-R-I.
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:30.260]   The Reverie app is available for no cost,
[01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:31.360]   at least for a period of time,
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:33.500]   and then I think they place certain elements of it
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:37.100]   behind a paywall, but you can try at zero cost.
[01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:38.820]   It's available for Apple soon, I think,
[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:40.700]   also to be available for Android,
[01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:43.340]   and they have specific hypnosis protocols
[01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:46.500]   that you listen to, and these are very brief protocols,
[01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:48.020]   follow the instructions,
[01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:49.780]   you're listening to a particular audio script
[01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:53.040]   of David Spiegel himself, and some progressive breathing,
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:54.620]   and actually some eye movements
[01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:56.840]   that are directly linked to the neural circuits
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:59.820]   that allow for these highly focused, deeply relaxed states,
[01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:02.200]   and there are components within the Reverie app
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:03.440]   specifically geared towards
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:06.020]   improving focus and concentration.
[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:08.980]   So again, there's meditation for focus,
[01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:12.040]   there's deliberate decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.540]   which take you into deep relaxation,
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:16.300]   and then hypnosis is this very special,
[01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:20.900]   very directed state of highly focused and highly relaxed,
[01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:22.500]   or I should say deeply relaxed,
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.660]   that allow access to the neural circuits
[01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:26.340]   for focus and concentration,
[01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:29.180]   and allow you to tune those up and to improve those
[01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:32.060]   very significantly in a very brief amount of time.
[01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:33.900]   And again, some of those hypnosis scripts
[01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:35.140]   are as short as eight minutes,
[01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:36.860]   some are as long as 13 minutes.
[01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:38.660]   So what we're really talking about here
[01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:41.140]   are zero cost tools that directly tap
[01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:44.140]   into the neural circuits, the components within your brain,
[01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:45.940]   that allow for deep relaxation,
[01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:49.260]   allow for deep focus, and improve your ability
[01:14:49.260 --> 01:14:53.020]   to focus and concentrate over time simply by repeating these.
[01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:56.700]   How often do you need to repeat the Reverie hypnosis
[01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:58.940]   for focus and concentration before you see benefits?
[01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:01.420]   Well, that will vary from person to person.
[01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:04.000]   I tend to use it once every third or fourth day,
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.580]   and I've experienced tremendous benefits from it.
[01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:08.060]   I don't think I'm unique in that sense,
[01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:10.860]   they have a lot of data to support this Reverie app
[01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:13.280]   and the protocols within it.
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:15.220]   How long do you have to do NSDR
[01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:16.660]   before you experience those benefits?
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:18.340]   There, I would say the first time and every time,
[01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:20.580]   because it's so deeply relaxing that you emerge from it
[01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:23.980]   feeling quite restored relative to how you went into it.
[01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:26.980]   And as I mentioned earlier in the study on meditation,
[01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:28.780]   it took about eight weeks to see the effects
[01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:30.460]   that they observed in that study,
[01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:32.460]   but they didn't observe shorter time points.
[01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:36.020]   So I highly encourage people to explore meditation
[01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:37.420]   geared towards focus and refocus,
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:40.580]   also NSDR, non-sleep deep rest, aka yoga nidra,
[01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:43.120]   and the Reverie app, specifically the hypnosis
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:45.660]   within the Reverie app that's geared towards
[01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:47.320]   improving focus and concentration.
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:49.740]   All of these have terrific science to support them.
[01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:52.100]   This is not woo science or hacks
[01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:53.860]   or just something that people came up with.
[01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:55.460]   This is all grounded in work
[01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:58.180]   from some of the best universities in the world,
[01:15:58.180 --> 01:15:59.980]   from excellent groups who've looked
[01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:01.440]   at underlying neural mechanisms
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:03.160]   and measured things with a lot of rigor,
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:04.140]   et cetera, et cetera.
[01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:05.380]   These tools are available to you.
[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:07.500]   I highly recommend that you use them.
[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:09.860]   And if you're interested in the optimal time of day
[01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:11.380]   to do these, we already mentioned
[01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:14.400]   that the focus, refocus meditation
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:16.440]   shouldn't be done too close to sleep.
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:20.320]   The Reverie hypnosis app can be done at any time.
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:21.960]   Really, in fact, there's a component
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:23.720]   of falling back asleep in there.
[01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:25.400]   In other words, a hypnosis specifically geared
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:27.960]   toward helping people teach themselves to fall back asleep
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:29.420]   when they wake up in the middle of the night.
[01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:31.880]   NSDR, I always say, can be done first thing in the morning,
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:33.520]   in the afternoon, or any time of day.
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:34.880]   And in fact, I'll sometimes do that
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:36.420]   in the middle of the night if I happen to wake up
[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:38.100]   and need to get back to sleep.
[01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:40.020]   So really these tools can be applied
[01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:42.800]   most any time of day, except for that one caveat
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:44.580]   about the focus, refocus meditation
[01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:46.540]   not being done too close to sleep.
[01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:48.480]   Now there's another set of behavioral tools
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:51.400]   that can really help enhance one's ability to focus.
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:54.180]   And those are visual-based tools.
[01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:55.840]   In fact, the tools I'm about to describe
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:58.760]   are actually being employed in a number of schools
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:01.660]   in China and elsewhere in order to teach children
[01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:04.740]   to focus better and for longer periods of time.
[01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:08.340]   The key principle here is that
[01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:10.620]   much of our cognitive focus,
[01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:13.120]   our ability to think about something in a very specific way
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:16.660]   and stay focused on it, to read or to follow a
[01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:20.240]   line of conversation or math or music, et cetera,
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:24.020]   is going to be directed by our visual system.
[01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:26.540]   Our visual system has two forms of attention and focus.
[01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:29.440]   One is overt focus, which is very straightforward.
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:30.780]   If I'm looking at the tip of my pen,
[01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:31.820]   for those of you who are listening right now,
[01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:33.860]   I'm looking at the tip of my pen, that's overt focus.
[01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:35.780]   I'm focusing on it with my eyes.
[01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:38.220]   And of course, the rest of my brain then will follow
[01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:40.700]   and start to analyze the details of what I'm seeing,
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:42.620]   the contours of the pen, et cetera.
[01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:44.660]   It seems sort of obvious when you first hear it,
[01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:47.220]   but our cognitive focus tends to follow
[01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:49.540]   our overt visual focus.
[01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:51.760]   That's also why they put blinders on horses.
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:54.960]   That's also why sometimes wearing a hoodie or a hat
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:57.940]   or limiting your visual field in some way
[01:17:57.940 --> 01:18:00.320]   can help you enhance your cognitive focus.
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:01.660]   It can help limit distraction.
[01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:03.860]   You're just not seeing as much.
[01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:06.180]   It's also why when we ingest caffeine or any kind of
[01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:08.860]   stimulant or we are stressed and our pupils dilate
[01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:10.540]   and our vision becomes more tunnel-like,
[01:18:10.540 --> 01:18:12.620]   less panoramic, but more tunnel-like,
[01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:14.220]   they say a soda straw view of the world,
[01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:16.220]   or you're looking through a tunnel,
[01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:18.140]   your focus, your visual focus,
[01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:19.920]   is actually driving your cognitive focus.
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:23.100]   Your cognitive focus is narrower than it would be
[01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:24.980]   if you were seeing the whole scene that you're in.
[01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:26.420]   So when you hear this, it sounds obvious,
[01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:28.600]   but for many people, including many scientists,
[01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:30.420]   it's just not obvious that this would be the case.
[01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:31.880]   However that is the case,
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:34.780]   your visual focus drives your cognitive focus.
[01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:38.160]   So what is a practice that has been studied
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:40.420]   in various laboratories and that's being employed
[01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:44.100]   in various schools is to have children or adults
[01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:48.560]   visually focus on one location for a given period of time.
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:49.580]   How long?
[01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:52.300]   Anywhere from 30 seconds to three minutes.
[01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:53.940]   And believe it or not, three minutes is a long time
[01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:57.040]   to maintain visual focus at one location.
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:58.140]   If you were to try that right now,
[01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:00.160]   you'd probably find it to be a bit of a strain,
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:01.800]   but if you want to try it, you can.
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:05.100]   Keep in mind, you, yes, are allowed to blink,
[01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:08.700]   but also keep in mind that meditation refocusing practice
[01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:10.280]   that we talked about earlier,
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:13.560]   that the refocusing is the key component
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:16.260]   of teaching yourself or your brain.
[01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:17.420]   You are your brain, your brain is you,
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:19.860]   but to teach yourself how to focus better.
[01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:23.180]   So if you're going to incorporate this practice,
[01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:25.360]   what you would want to do is pick a location.
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:26.460]   It could be on a wall,
[01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:28.220]   it could be on your computer in front of you,
[01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:30.140]   although I would encourage it to not be the contents
[01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:31.020]   of your computer screen.
[01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:32.660]   You might just want to blank your screen.
[01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:33.860]   You might want to put a piece of paper
[01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:36.660]   with a cross hatch there, any sort of visual target,
[01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:38.140]   or you can imagine a visual target,
[01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:40.540]   and then focus your visual attention on that target
[01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:43.040]   and try to breathe normally, try and stay relaxed,
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:44.420]   and certainly allow yourself to blink
[01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:45.880]   so that your eyes don't dry out.
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:49.240]   This is not a test of how long you can go without blinking.
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:51.920]   By focusing on that particular location
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:54.460]   and by forcing yourself to refocus on that location,
[01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:58.740]   anytime your gaze, your vision drifts from that location,
[01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:02.140]   you are encouraging the circuits for focus
[01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:04.340]   to get better at focusing for longer and longer
[01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:06.840]   and at refocusing when your focus drifts off
[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:08.060]   of that location.
[01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:09.600]   This is incorporating neural circuits,
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:11.040]   including the prefrontal cortex,
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.580]   things like the frontal eye field.
[01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:15.080]   For those of you curious about the underlying biology,
[01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:18.000]   this practice is recruiting certain elements
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.500]   of your so-called prefrontal cortex,
[01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:21.460]   also the frontal eye fields,
[01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:24.140]   which are locations not far from the prefrontal cortex
[01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:26.620]   that are involved in deliberately directing your gaze
[01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:30.100]   to particular locations in space, not outer space,
[01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:32.820]   although you could do this by focusing on stars, I suppose,
[01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:35.100]   but in visual space.
[01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:39.040]   Now, I mentioned before that this is overt visual focus
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:39.880]   and attention.
[01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:42.020]   You are overtly looking at that location,
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:44.380]   but one also very powerful practice
[01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:48.080]   for improving focus and concentration
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:50.620]   is to use covert focus.
[01:20:50.620 --> 01:20:53.180]   Covert focus is where my gaze,
[01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:56.300]   my eyes are focused on one location, such as my pen,
[01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:59.740]   but my focus is actually directed elsewhere
[01:20:59.740 --> 01:21:01.500]   in the room or location that I'm in.
[01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:04.060]   My mind and to some extent,
[01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:07.380]   my peripheral vision is focused in this case on the door,
[01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:09.340]   just to my left in the room that I'm in.
[01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:10.740]   That takes a little bit more effort.
[01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:12.760]   This is something that all old world primates,
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:15.620]   of which we are old world primates, are able to do.
[01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:18.040]   And it probably evolved as part of the mechanism
[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:21.860]   by which animals could evaluate their scene,
[01:21:21.860 --> 01:21:25.820]   evaluate predators, evaluate other primates,
[01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:28.620]   while not necessarily staring at them directly
[01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:30.340]   so they can obtain information.
[01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:31.460]   We can obtain information
[01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:32.860]   without having to direct our gaze
[01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:34.220]   specifically to one location.
[01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:37.120]   Maybe we can obtain information from multiple locations.
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:38.780]   Indeed, we can.
[01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:41.460]   Without getting too far down the rabbit hole
[01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:44.660]   of how vision and cognition relate,
[01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:47.220]   because we've done episodes on that previously,
[01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:51.700]   and simply focusing on the tools that can be incorporated
[01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:53.380]   to improve focus and concentration,
[01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:55.140]   here's what I recommend.
[01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:57.860]   Set yourself a low bar at first,
[01:21:57.860 --> 01:22:00.060]   and set a timer,
[01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:03.560]   and try to focus on one location for 30 seconds,
[01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:05.140]   and that's it for that day.
[01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:07.160]   The next day, you might add five seconds,
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:09.300]   and then the next day, five seconds after that.
[01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:11.180]   If you miss a day, no big deal.
[01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:14.520]   Simply do the practice for the same amount of time
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:16.700]   that you did the last time that you did the practice,
[01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:19.800]   and then gradually try and increase the amount of time
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:23.100]   that you can focus on one visual location overtly
[01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:24.940]   by looking directly at that location.
[01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:28.020]   If you like, and if you feel you have the ability,
[01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:30.860]   you can try and do this through covert attention and focus
[01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:32.780]   by looking straightforward, for instance,
[01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:34.580]   and attending to something in the corner of the room,
[01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:36.800]   and trying to do that for 30 seconds.
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:38.460]   You'll find that that's quite a bit harder,
[01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:40.580]   and then extending that by five seconds
[01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:42.360]   every time you do the practice.
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:44.260]   This is something that I don't think you necessarily
[01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:46.340]   have to build up to being able to do for a full hour
[01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:47.740]   in order to extract the benefits.
[01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:50.520]   In fact, the best way to think about this practice
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:53.400]   is as a means to get into a focused state.
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:56.640]   If you remember back about an hour or so ago,
[01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:59.040]   I was talking about how focused states
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:03.500]   are not a drop all the way in and then exit type phenomenon.
[01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:05.160]   We don't just drop into a focused state
[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:07.200]   the same way we don't drop into the peak performance
[01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:08.860]   of a workout, we warm up.
[01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:12.440]   So what I recommend is having a 30 second
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:17.440]   to three minute period at the beginning of about a focus
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:19.600]   where you're going to do work or physical work,
[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:23.500]   and anchoring your vision to one location
[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:24.800]   somewhere in the room,
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:26.880]   or if you want to do it covertly, you can do that.
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:28.520]   Setting a timer and trying to do that
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:30.720]   for anywhere from 30 seconds to three minutes.
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:34.960]   What you're doing when you exercise that practice
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:38.160]   is you are ramping up neural activity
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:39.680]   within the neural circuits
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:41.920]   that create focus and concentration.
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:44.520]   Then I would stop looking at that location
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:45.720]   or that covert location,
[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:47.520]   and then I would move to the work that you're trying to do,
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:49.720]   either mental work or physical work.
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:52.480]   And if about halfway through your 90 minute bout
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:55.200]   or at some point in your 90 minute bout of work or exercise,
[01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:57.080]   you feel that your concentration is drifting,
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:58.360]   rather than look at your phone
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:01.080]   and scroll through the thousands of contexts
[01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:03.400]   that exist within social media or your phone,
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:05.800]   try just picking a location again on the wall,
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:07.680]   focusing back on that location,
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:10.840]   using that as a ramp up to then direct your focus
[01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:13.200]   back towards if your weight training sets and reps
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:14.100]   that you might be performing.
[01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:16.420]   If you're running, you might do this,
[01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:18.020]   or cycling, you might do this
[01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:19.700]   by focusing on a particular location
[01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:23.000]   and really homing in on that location physically.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.680]   And this is a practice that a lot of athletes use in fact.
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:28.520]   And if you're say doing musical practice or math,
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:30.200]   well then you'd want to focus on something
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:32.520]   other than the task that you're trying to perform.
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:35.960]   But again, using visual focus as a way to ramp up
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:39.720]   and increase your overall ability to focus and concentrate,
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:41.460]   and then applying that to whatever it is
[01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:43.480]   that you're trying to learn or perform.
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:45.080]   Next, I'd like to talk about compounds
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:47.720]   that can improve concentration and focus.
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:50.140]   And these are most often consumed as supplements,
[01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:51.720]   although some of them I should mention
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:54.000]   can also be derived from food.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.920]   Again, I just want to remind you that there are things,
[01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:58.000]   in this case compounds,
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.660]   that can modulate a biological mechanism,
[01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:03.440]   that is can modulate focus and concentration.
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:06.760]   And there are compounds that can mediate,
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:11.380]   can directly contribute to concentration and focus.
[01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:14.480]   One of the key compounds that supports concentration
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:17.880]   and focus because it generally supports mood concentration
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:20.800]   and focus and brain function in general
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:23.340]   are the omega-3 essential fatty acids.
[01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:25.920]   I've talked about the omega-3 essential fatty acids
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:27.840]   in a variety of contexts, in particular depression,
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:31.320]   but also ADHD, there are interesting data on that.
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:33.160]   And it's really clear that getting somewhere
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:36.400]   between one and three grams of EPA,
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:39.840]   that is one to three grams of EPA essential fatty acid
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:43.000]   per day can improve outcomes,
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.740]   that is can improve mood and can improve cognitive function.
[01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:48.680]   And while there's some debate about
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:50.680]   whether or not I can improve cardiac function,
[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:52.720]   it's very clear, at least to me,
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:54.840]   that ingesting one to three grams
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:58.000]   of EPA essential fatty acids per day is beneficial.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.920]   But again, in the context of focus and concentration,
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:04.840]   it's in modulating the neural circuits and brain function
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:07.160]   that are going to support focus and concentration.
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:09.760]   It's not as if taking one to three grams
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:12.100]   of EPA essential fatty acids per day
[01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:15.480]   is going to tap directly into only the circuits
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:17.000]   for focus and concentration.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.720]   That said, and as discussed on the episode
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:23.580]   of the Huberman Lab podcast with Dr. Rhonda Patrick,
[01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:26.660]   and on the episode on ADHD that I did,
[01:26:26.660 --> 01:26:28.600]   and on the episode on depression that I did,
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:30.280]   I make it a point to ingest
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:33.580]   one to three grams of EPAs per day.
[01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:36.720]   You can get those EPAs from other sources
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:39.000]   besides supplements, of course,
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.240]   but supplements are going to be the easiest way to do that.
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:42.640]   You could do that through liquid form,
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:44.260]   fish oil, cod liver oil.
[01:26:44.260 --> 01:26:47.260]   Some people who are vegan opt for other sources of EPAs.
[01:26:47.260 --> 01:26:48.840]   You can find those out there, certainly.
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:50.720]   Some people even use prescription EPAs
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:53.120]   to get the dosage really high.
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:55.740]   Dr. Rhonda Patrick talked about this in the episode with me.
[01:26:55.740 --> 01:26:57.180]   That's actually something that she does.
[01:26:57.180 --> 01:26:58.480]   I don't take the prescription form.
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:00.440]   I get them through pill form
[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:03.640]   through our supplement affiliate, which is Momentus.
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:05.980]   But there are a number of different quality sources
[01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:07.840]   of EPAs out there.
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:09.940]   And some of those quality sources also include things
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:12.660]   like fatty fish, algae, and things of that sort.
[01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:14.920]   So I'll leave it to you as to whether or not you supplement
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:16.340]   with omega-3 fatty acids
[01:27:16.340 --> 01:27:17.960]   in order to get that one to three grams per day,
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:19.480]   or whether or not you do it through food.
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:22.640]   But I would encourage you to try and reach that threshold
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:25.440]   because there are a number of known positive effects
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.700]   for mood and brain function generally.
[01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:31.080]   The other thing that can positively modulate brain function,
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:35.120]   and that actually works as a fuel for neurons to function
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:36.760]   and can improve cognitive performance,
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:38.900]   and particularly within the brain circuits,
[01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:40.840]   such as the prefrontal cortex that are involved
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:43.340]   in concentration and focus, is creatine.
[01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:45.900]   I know many people are familiar with creatine monohydrate
[01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:48.960]   for its effects on muscle growth and strength
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:50.840]   and performance, but it's quite clear
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:53.880]   that the bulk of scientific studies have examined the role
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:55.700]   of creatine in the clinical context
[01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:58.520]   and as its role in improving cognitive performance.
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:00.720]   So my read of the literature has led to a practice
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:03.080]   in which I ingest five grams per day
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:04.680]   of creatine monohydrate,
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:07.520]   the sort of standard form that's available in.
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:09.420]   This is generally available as a powder.
[01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:10.520]   That's certainly how I take it.
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:11.960]   I take the creatine powder.
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:14.300]   I'll mix it with water or with my athletic greens
[01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:16.060]   or some sort of electrolyte drink.
[01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:18.940]   Whatever liquid happens to be convenient to ingest that in,
[01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:20.820]   the time of day doesn't really seem to be important.
[01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:22.000]   Some people are strong believers
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.140]   in consuming creatine post-workout.
[01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:26.460]   While that might be beneficial,
[01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:29.740]   I simply take it in the morning or post-workout.
[01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:32.300]   It sort of depends on when I remember to take it.
[01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:34.740]   But that five grams of creatine per day,
[01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:37.260]   in my case, really isn't geared towards muscle growth
[01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:38.740]   or strength or performance
[01:28:38.740 --> 01:28:40.760]   as much as it's geared toward tapping
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:43.620]   into the creatine phosphate system within the brain
[01:28:43.620 --> 01:28:46.940]   and specifically the benefits of creatine
[01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:48.300]   for prefrontal cortical networks.
[01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:50.740]   Again, modulating, not directly mediating,
[01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:54.880]   but modulating and generally supporting the brain networks
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:57.160]   that are going to allow me to generate focus
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:28:58.240]   and concentration.
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:01.960]   So much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:04.000]   creatine monohydrate, five grams a day,
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.180]   seems to generally support brain function,
[01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:09.760]   which will generally support concentration and focus.
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:11.300]   Now, in terms of compounds
[01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:14.640]   that more specifically mediate concentration and focus,
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:16.760]   we have to go back to that aero metaphor model
[01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:18.760]   that we talked about at the beginning of the episode
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:22.940]   that included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,
[01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:24.980]   which acts as this attentional spotlight.
[01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:28.280]   In fact, acetylcholine and elevated levels of acetylcholine
[01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:30.040]   have been shown over and over again
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:33.120]   through beautiful work from Mike Merzenich's lab at UCSF
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:36.100]   and the Kilgard lab down in Houston
[01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:37.320]   and a number of other labs,
[01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:41.320]   including Norm Weinberger's lab at UC Irvine again,
[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:46.320]   to improve or even directly gate neuroplasticity
[01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:49.400]   by increasing focus directly.
[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:50.440]   That's a lot of word soup,
[01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:51.760]   but basically what happens is
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:54.260]   if acetylcholine transmission is increased
[01:29:54.260 --> 01:29:56.060]   even transiently within the brain,
[01:29:56.060 --> 01:29:57.600]   there's a greater opportunity
[01:29:57.600 --> 01:29:59.520]   for neuroplasticity to take place.
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:01.880]   And the reason there's a greater opportunity
[01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:05.180]   for neuroplasticity, AKA learning, to take place
[01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:08.080]   is by way of the increased focus
[01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:11.000]   that spiking acetylcholine can provide.
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:11.840]   As I mentioned earlier,
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:14.040]   there are a number of different foods which contain choline.
[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:15.560]   You can look those up online.
[01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:18.840]   Choline acting as an amino acid precursor to acetylcholine,
[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:19.960]   but of course there are compounds,
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:21.520]   there are supplements that can further
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:23.400]   and more acutely increase acetylcholine,
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:25.080]   and indeed I use these myself.
[01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:28.640]   The most effective one I've found is alpha-GPC.
[01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:33.060]   Alpha-GPC consumed at dosages of 300 milligrams
[01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:35.880]   to 600 milligrams prior to a workout
[01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:38.880]   or prior to a workout greatly increase
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:40.600]   one's ability to focus and concentrate,
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:42.000]   at least that's been my experience.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.260]   And there are some good data in humans.
[01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:46.240]   So how would I use alpha-GPC?
[01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:49.960]   I would use alpha-GPC by taking it about 10 to 20 minutes
[01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:52.600]   prior to any time I want to focus
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:54.700]   or concentrate very deeply.
[01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:57.860]   I've taken as much as 600 milligrams at one time,
[01:30:57.860 --> 01:31:00.100]   although I find that 300 milligrams is enough for me
[01:31:00.100 --> 01:31:02.700]   and I tend to be quite sensitive to supplements
[01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:04.060]   and caffeine in general.
[01:31:04.060 --> 01:31:07.460]   So I'll sometimes take it alongside yerba mate
[01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:10.800]   or with yerba mate or with coffee prior to a workout
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:12.800]   or prior to a bout of work
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:15.260]   in which I'm focusing on mental work.
[01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:17.220]   So it could be reading, writing, could be math,
[01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:18.900]   could be data analysis, could be anything
[01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:21.020]   where I need a lot of focus and concentration.
[01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:22.620]   Now, a number of people have contacted me
[01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:26.900]   about a recent study suggesting that alpha-GPC
[01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:28.660]   when taken chronically over many years
[01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:32.180]   could increase one's vulnerability to stroke.
[01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:35.700]   I've looked at those data and my read of the data
[01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:37.620]   is that they're not very conclusive,
[01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:40.500]   although anytime you see something like that,
[01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:42.240]   you know, a study that's pointing to the fact
[01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:44.180]   that a given compound might increase
[01:31:44.180 --> 01:31:45.780]   the propensity for stroke,
[01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:47.380]   you obviously want to be concerned.
[01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:50.700]   So we have to ask ourselves how, by what mechanism that is,
[01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:54.740]   could alpha-GPC be increasing the susceptibility to stroke?
[01:31:54.740 --> 01:31:57.960]   And it seems to be related to increases in TMAO,
[01:31:57.960 --> 01:32:01.860]   which is a marker related to the cardiovascular system.
[01:32:01.860 --> 01:32:06.180]   And one known way to offset increases in TMAO
[01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:08.480]   that are associated either with alpha-GPC
[01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:11.540]   or increases due to other things,
[01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:13.900]   so ingestion of particular food compounds
[01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:15.680]   actually can increase TMAO,
[01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:20.160]   is to offset that by taking 600 milligrams of garlic.
[01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:23.080]   Now, I've been taking alpha-GPC pretty consistently
[01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:23.940]   for a number of years.
[01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:25.260]   I do not take it every day.
[01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:27.360]   I would say I take it about four days per week,
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:30.420]   again, prior to workouts or bouts of cognitive work.
[01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:33.020]   I have not seen my TMAO spike,
[01:32:33.020 --> 01:32:36.420]   and I've evaluated that by way of blood tests,
[01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:39.380]   but nonetheless, I take 600 milligrams of garlic
[01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:42.500]   in capsule form anytime I eat anyway,
[01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:44.660]   and I do that for general cardiovascular function,
[01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:45.660]   and there's some interesting data
[01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:48.660]   on immune system function, et cetera, for garlic.
[01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:52.600]   So I've been consuming 600 milligram capsules of garlic
[01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:53.740]   for some period of time.
[01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:56.580]   Some days, I'll ingest just one 600 milligram capsule.
[01:32:56.580 --> 01:32:57.880]   Other times, I'll take two.
[01:32:57.880 --> 01:33:02.460]   But based on this recent study and the concerns about TMAO,
[01:33:02.460 --> 01:33:05.900]   I make it a point to always ingest a 600 milligram capsule
[01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:09.100]   of garlic anytime I take alpha-GPC,
[01:33:09.100 --> 01:33:11.660]   which, again, for me is about four days per week.
[01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:14.540]   So in our model of attention and focus,
[01:33:14.540 --> 01:33:16.940]   you can now clearly see why taking alpha-GPC,
[01:33:16.940 --> 01:33:19.100]   which increases acetylcholine transmission,
[01:33:19.100 --> 01:33:21.560]   would be beneficial for concentration and focus
[01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:24.340]   and why taking it with a double espresso
[01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:26.700]   or why taking it with yerba mate
[01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:29.780]   would further increase concentration and focus
[01:33:29.780 --> 01:33:31.660]   because, as I mentioned earlier,
[01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:34.580]   caffeine is going to increase epinephrine.
[01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:36.320]   It's also going to increase the density
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:37.980]   of dopamine receptors,
[01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:40.140]   and the alpha-GPC is going to increase acetylcholine,
[01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:41.620]   this spotlighting for cognition,
[01:33:41.620 --> 01:33:44.520]   this ability to really amplify the activity
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:45.940]   of specific neural networks,
[01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:47.600]   which is largely what's happening
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:49.260]   when you're trying to focus
[01:33:49.260 --> 01:33:51.660]   and pay attention to something specifically.
[01:33:51.660 --> 01:33:53.660]   So if one wants to increase the amount
[01:33:53.660 --> 01:33:56.460]   of dopamine transmission in the brain and body
[01:33:56.460 --> 01:33:59.400]   for sake of increasing concentration and focus,
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:01.400]   one of the most efficient ways to do that
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:04.420]   is by ingestion of the amino acid L-tyrosine.
[01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:06.820]   Again, L-tyrosine can be derived from food sources.
[01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:08.720]   I invite you to look up those various food sources
[01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:09.560]   on the web.
[01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:11.100]   Simply go to a web browser and put in foods
[01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:12.420]   that contain a lot of L-tyrosine,
[01:34:12.420 --> 01:34:15.460]   and you'll get a rich array of choices to select from.
[01:34:15.460 --> 01:34:19.480]   But in my case, I use L-tyrosine in capsule form.
[01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:22.100]   I will take 500 milligrams of L-tyrosine,
[01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:25.140]   300 milligrams of alpha-GPC, and a cup of coffee.
[01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:27.220]   I'm careful to do this early in the day,
[01:34:27.220 --> 01:34:28.900]   certainly not after two or 3 p.m.
[01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:31.020]   because I don't want to diminish my ability
[01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:33.020]   to fall and stay asleep that night.
[01:34:33.020 --> 01:34:34.740]   Do this early in the day before a workout
[01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:39.060]   or before a bout of concentrated mental work.
[01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:41.740]   Again, I tend to do this about four days per week,
[01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:45.740]   so certainly not every time I sit down to do work.
[01:34:45.740 --> 01:34:47.720]   And I should also mention
[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:49.660]   that I still tend to do the behavioral tools.
[01:34:49.660 --> 01:34:51.780]   I'll tend to use five minutes of binaural beats
[01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:53.980]   or binaural beats throughout the work session,
[01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:56.820]   sometimes do an ice bath or a cold shower before.
[01:34:56.820 --> 01:34:58.320]   I don't want to give the impression
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:01.740]   that I combine every tool that I've talked about today
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:02.900]   for a given workout.
[01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:04.900]   I mean, that would be pretty wild too.
[01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:07.060]   Take a cold shower, pop an L-tyrosine,
[01:35:07.060 --> 01:35:09.260]   take an alpha-GPC, drink two espresso,
[01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:10.360]   listen to binaural beats.
[01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:13.440]   That to me seems like a very inefficient way
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:14.820]   to go about life.
[01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:18.920]   In fact, I make it a point to try and use tools
[01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:21.800]   to increase my ability to concentrate and focus,
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:24.060]   but not to combine more than two or three of them
[01:35:24.060 --> 01:35:24.900]   at any one time.
[01:35:24.900 --> 01:35:25.800]   And when I say two or three,
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:27.180]   what I mean is I will use supplements
[01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:30.060]   like alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine, and caffeine together
[01:35:30.060 --> 01:35:31.800]   before certain work bouts.
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:33.700]   I might use the visual practice
[01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:35.500]   of focusing on a given location for a minute
[01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:37.640]   before I begin that work bout.
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:38.940]   I might combine those.
[01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:41.720]   Then another time I might take a cold shower
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:43.100]   prior to doing some work.
[01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:45.800]   Other days, I confess, I've slept very well,
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:48.700]   or my enthusiasm about what I'm about to work on
[01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:51.480]   is such that I don't require any of these tools.
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:53.820]   Again, there's no requirement,
[01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:55.780]   there's no pressure to use any of these tools,
[01:35:55.780 --> 01:35:59.040]   behavioral, supplement-based, or otherwise.
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:02.000]   It's simply a matter of using the tools
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.740]   that are going to allow you to achieve the states
[01:36:03.740 --> 01:36:06.620]   you want to achieve and to improve your ability
[01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:09.260]   to go into those states without any help at all.
[01:36:09.260 --> 01:36:11.760]   And this is what I find particularly attractive
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:12.600]   about supplements.
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:15.180]   It's not so much that they put you into the ideal state
[01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:18.140]   for that work, and then you accomplish that work,
[01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:20.460]   and then you always rely on those supplements.
[01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:22.700]   I prefer to look at supplements of the sort
[01:36:22.700 --> 01:36:24.700]   that I just described as a route
[01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:28.060]   into a deeper trench of focus and concentration
[01:36:28.060 --> 01:36:30.780]   that I use as a tool to teach myself
[01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:32.380]   to focus and concentrate more deeply,
[01:36:32.380 --> 01:36:35.540]   such that I don't need those tools every single time
[01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:37.260]   I try and focus and concentrate.
[01:36:37.260 --> 01:36:39.380]   I think this is an important point
[01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:41.860]   because I think that many people think of supplements
[01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:46.860]   as a crutch or a way of simply getting into a state
[01:36:46.860 --> 01:36:50.840]   for which no other tool will suffice or replace.
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:53.340]   But in that context, I want to remind you
[01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:55.180]   of the larger context of pharmacology,
[01:36:55.180 --> 01:36:58.660]   which is the vast landscape of prescription pharmacology
[01:36:58.660 --> 01:37:01.880]   for ADHD, for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:05.380]   Now, I covered that landscape in intense detail
[01:37:05.380 --> 01:37:08.420]   on the episode on ADHD and focus.
[01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:11.860]   And just to summarize, there is, of course,
[01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:16.000]   Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse, Modafinil, R-modafinil,
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:17.660]   a number of different compounds,
[01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:21.100]   all of which generally increase dopamine transmission
[01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:22.700]   in the brain, so increasing dopamine,
[01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:25.260]   and all of which generally increase epinephrine,
[01:37:25.260 --> 01:37:27.940]   adrenaline transmission in the brain and body.
[01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:32.520]   And many of those compounds have been of tremendous benefit
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:35.480]   to children and even some adults who suffer from ADHD.
[01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:38.900]   So properly prescribed at the appropriate dosage,
[01:37:38.900 --> 01:37:41.920]   those compounds can really help people
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:44.760]   with clinically diagnosed ADHD.
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:48.260]   The way they help those people is a bit surprising, however.
[01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:50.820]   You might think, well, they turn on the brain chemicals
[01:37:50.820 --> 01:37:53.380]   that allow those people to concentrate and focus.
[01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:56.600]   That's true, but they also have the benefit
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:00.500]   of teaching those brain circuits how to engage.
[01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:04.160]   And that's one of the reasons why somewhat paradoxically
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:07.460]   giving a stimulant like Ritalin or Adderall
[01:38:07.460 --> 01:38:09.960]   to a kid that legitimately needs it,
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:12.700]   obviously you don't want to do this without the oversight
[01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:15.820]   and careful evaluation of a psychiatrist,
[01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:19.540]   but giving that to a kid who has severe ADHD,
[01:38:19.540 --> 01:38:22.220]   you would think would make them more rambunctious,
[01:38:22.220 --> 01:38:24.780]   less able to focus, and more distractible overall.
[01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:28.340]   After all, Ritalin, Modafinil, R-modafinil,
[01:38:28.340 --> 01:38:29.480]   all these things are stimulant.
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:30.680]   So you take a kid who has
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:33.320]   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:36.220]   and give them these drugs that increase transmission
[01:38:36.220 --> 01:38:37.880]   of dopamine and epinephrine, and you think,
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:39.760]   wow, it's going to make them even more distractible
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:42.220]   and hyperactive, and indeed it has the opposite effect.
[01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:44.440]   It doesn't necessarily make them feel calm,
[01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:47.460]   but it makes them feel that they can focus.
[01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:49.460]   They really can anchor their attention.
[01:38:49.460 --> 01:38:52.660]   And the idea is that it's teaching those neural circuits,
[01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:55.320]   or those neural circuits rather, are teaching themselves
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:57.700]   to engage and to focus and concentrate.
[01:38:57.700 --> 01:38:59.580]   And the ideal situation is one in which
[01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:02.480]   the total dosage of those compounds, those drugs,
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:04.700]   can be reduced over time as those circuits
[01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:07.220]   learn to come online through purely behavioral tools.
[01:39:07.220 --> 01:39:09.700]   Now, oftentimes there's a maintenance of those drugs
[01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:10.900]   over long periods of time,
[01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:12.720]   although there is a common practice nowadays
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:15.360]   of trying to diminish the dosage overall.
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:18.020]   That's in the context of ADHD and prescription medication,
[01:39:18.020 --> 01:39:21.220]   and I acknowledge that a lot, indeed,
[01:39:21.220 --> 01:39:25.940]   80% or more of college students, say the statistics,
[01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:29.460]   are using prescription drugs when they are not,
[01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:32.040]   in fact, prescribe those prescription drugs.
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:34.380]   So basically what I'm saying is there are a lot of people
[01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:37.300]   using drugs designed for ADHD and narcolepsy
[01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:40.340]   because those drugs will effectively
[01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:41.940]   increase focus and concentration,
[01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:45.060]   but I strongly discourage the use
[01:39:45.060 --> 01:39:46.980]   of powerful prescription drugs
[01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:48.220]   that have not been prescribed to you.
[01:39:48.220 --> 01:39:49.100]   First of all, it's illegal.
[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:50.820]   Second of all, it's quite dangerous
[01:39:50.820 --> 01:39:53.800]   to hit the accelerator of those neural circuits
[01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:57.240]   with such vigor because it can increase dependency
[01:39:57.240 --> 01:39:58.860]   and they can have a number of other side effects
[01:39:58.860 --> 01:40:01.040]   outside the context of clinically diagnosed
[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:04.800]   and prescribed ADHD medication.
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:07.360]   But in the context of supplementation,
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:12.360]   the increase in dopamine, acetylcholine, and epinephrine
[01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:14.080]   that one can achieve from, say,
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:15.640]   500 milligrams of L-tyrosine,
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:20.200]   300 milligrams of alpha-GPC, and a cup of coffee
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:22.360]   is going to be substantially less
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:24.060]   than one would see for prescription drugs.
[01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:26.500]   So you're getting a modest effect
[01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:29.860]   that can similarly teach those brain circuits
[01:40:29.860 --> 01:40:33.020]   for focus and concentration, how to engage better.
[01:40:33.020 --> 01:40:35.820]   But as a general backdrop to all of this,
[01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:38.380]   I always say, and I'll say it again and again,
[01:40:38.380 --> 01:40:39.940]   probably until the day I die,
[01:40:39.940 --> 01:40:41.320]   which hopefully is a long time from now,
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:43.920]   but regardless, it'll be the same message,
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:47.380]   I always believe that behavioral tools should come first.
[01:40:47.380 --> 01:40:48.660]   Behavioral tools should come first.
[01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:50.240]   Then focus on nutrition.
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:52.500]   In fact, I would say behavioral and nutrition tools,
[01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:55.140]   and of course, get excellent sleep.
[01:40:55.140 --> 01:40:57.560]   Then focus on supplementation.
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:01.820]   And then, and only if those are failing
[01:41:01.820 --> 01:41:04.580]   to bring your brain and body to the state you need to be in
[01:41:04.580 --> 01:41:07.980]   to perform well in school and work and life, et cetera,
[01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:12.220]   do I recommend that people lean on prescription drugs.
[01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:13.280]   Now, there's a caveat to that,
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:17.220]   which is under conditions like severe eating disorders,
[01:41:17.220 --> 01:41:21.380]   obsessive compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, depression,
[01:41:21.380 --> 01:41:25.520]   where people are truly at risk of suicide
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:27.480]   or severe mental health effects
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:29.140]   or behavioral health effects,
[01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:31.920]   and they're really, their lives are at risk
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:34.400]   and their overall mood and wellbeing is at risk.
[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:37.040]   It's often the case that people cannot access
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:40.340]   the brain states required to shift themselves purely
[01:41:40.340 --> 01:41:42.180]   with behavioral tools, nutrition, et cetera.
[01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:45.840]   So again, for the typical person who's not suffering
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:48.780]   from one of the psychiatric disorders that I mentioned before
[01:41:48.780 --> 01:41:51.960]   or other psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, et cetera,
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:56.760]   I strongly encourage you to look to behavioral tools first,
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:41:59.600]   nutrition, then supplementation,
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:02.920]   then and only if there's a remaining need
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:04.800]   to prescription drugs.
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:07.400]   This contrasts very much with the typical scenario
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:09.860]   I hear about these days where college students
[01:42:09.860 --> 01:42:10.800]   or other people will say,
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:13.400]   "Oh yeah, I hear that there's this drug, you know,
[01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:15.760]   Ritalin or Vyvanse that can immediately put me
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:17.880]   into a state of heightened focus and concentration."
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:21.000]   Now, listen, if you have ADHD, by all means,
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.440]   talk to a physician, talk to a great psychiatrist
[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:25.280]   and figure out whether or not that's right for you.
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:27.640]   But if you don't, again, behavioral tools,
[01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:31.880]   nutrition, supplementation, and in particular,
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:33.840]   those behavioral tools are going to be the ones
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:36.660]   that are going to allow you to teach your neural circuits
[01:42:36.660 --> 01:42:38.120]   how to focus and concentrate better.
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:40.240]   And I cannot overstate the importance of that,
[01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:42.160]   that the behavioral tools, and to some extent,
[01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:45.360]   the supplementation combined with behavioral tools
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:48.620]   really allow you to train up your neural circuits
[01:42:48.620 --> 01:42:51.160]   so that you can focus and concentrate
[01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:53.520]   to the depth and the degree and the duration
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:56.440]   that's going to best serve your mental and physical goals.
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:57.680]   Now, there's one other compound
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:00.920]   that I've used from time to time and that I continue to use
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:03.880]   in order to increase focus and concentration.
[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:06.120]   And I will use this in combination
[01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:08.000]   with the other supplements that I talked about before,
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:09.760]   and that's phenylethylamine.
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:12.800]   Phenylethylamine is in the dopamine synthesis pathway,
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:14.720]   so it increases dopamine transmission
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:16.560]   and tends to function a little bit differently
[01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:17.780]   than L-tyrosine.
[01:43:17.780 --> 01:43:20.840]   So every once in a while, I'll swap out L-tyrosine
[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:23.860]   and put in 500 milligrams of phenylethylamine.
[01:43:23.860 --> 01:43:27.200]   Or sometimes, if I really want to push a little bit harder
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:28.880]   on the dopamine system,
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:32.180]   and I'm going to be doing a long bout of intense work,
[01:43:32.180 --> 01:43:35.040]   I will take the 300 milligrams of Alpha-GPC,
[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:37.360]   the 500 milligrams of L-tyrosine,
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:39.840]   I'll generally take that with some caffeine.
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:40.760]   And I should mention,
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:43.560]   I don't go past about 100 or 200 milligrams of caffeine
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:45.340]   'cause I don't really like feeling too jittery.
[01:43:45.340 --> 01:43:46.320]   That's not really my goal.
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:48.360]   It's the goal to be alert,
[01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:51.320]   but not so alert that I really can't focus on anything.
[01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:54.480]   I'm not interested in having an anxiety attack after all.
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:56.780]   But I'll sometimes either swap in,
[01:43:56.780 --> 01:44:00.080]   or I will add that 500 milligrams of phenylethylamine.
[01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:03.380]   Phenylethylamine is in the PEA pathway.
[01:44:03.380 --> 01:44:05.140]   I've talked about this in a previous podcast
[01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:07.800]   on dopamine motivation and drive.
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:10.520]   And it's a very short-lived compound,
[01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:12.880]   so what I'll tend to do is take it once
[01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:13.940]   at the beginning of the work bout,
[01:44:13.940 --> 01:44:15.920]   and sometimes in the middle of the work bout,
[01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:18.120]   I'll take another 500 milligram capsule.
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:19.160]   But what I just described
[01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:21.200]   with combining all of those compounds,
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:24.860]   Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine, phenylethylamine, and caffeine,
[01:44:24.860 --> 01:44:28.280]   that's a fairly rare occurrence that I'll combine all four,
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:30.440]   and really only under conditions in which I have to do
[01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:34.820]   an intensely challenging bout of mental or physical work.
[01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:36.600]   I would say the frequency at which I combine
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:38.200]   all four of those things
[01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:40.840]   is probably about once every two weeks,
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:43.120]   and typically more like once a month.
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:45.240]   Again, being careful to do that
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:46.280]   in the early part of the day,
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:48.400]   certainly before the noon hour,
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:50.960]   so that I am in no way going to disrupt my sleep.
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:53.120]   I realize that many of you are probably wondering about,
[01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:55.960]   or hoping that I'll discuss things like lion's mane,
[01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:59.500]   or the racetams, or some of the other compounds
[01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:01.440]   that are known to powerfully modulate
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:04.360]   the dopamine, epinephrine, and acetylcholine systems.
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:06.080]   To be quite direct,
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:08.000]   there are far too many of these compounds
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.800]   to review in a single episode,
[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:13.560]   and they all generally tap into the same set of processes.
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:16.520]   Again, epinephrine, that shaft of the arrowhead
[01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:18.360]   that we're thinking of as focus,
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:20.520]   acetylcholine, which is the arrowhead itself,
[01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:21.980]   and then dopamine,
[01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:24.640]   which is the sort of propeller behind the arrow
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:26.900]   that allows it to continually drive forward
[01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:29.560]   through a bout of mental or physical work.
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:31.720]   There is a wonderful site,
[01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:34.260]   I've mentioned it several times before on this podcast,
[01:45:34.260 --> 01:45:36.540]   that is examine.com.
[01:45:36.540 --> 01:45:39.120]   That wonderful site, that is examine.com,
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:40.560]   has recently been updated.
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:42.460]   They've changed their format.
[01:45:42.460 --> 01:45:43.920]   It was terrific before.
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:46.700]   It provided links to relevant studies.
[01:45:46.700 --> 01:45:48.220]   It talked about specific compounds.
[01:45:48.220 --> 01:45:49.800]   It talked about the magnitude of effect.
[01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:51.320]   It talked about the human effect matrix.
[01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:52.680]   It really focused on human studies
[01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:55.380]   with links to those studies, and on and on.
[01:45:55.380 --> 01:45:59.000]   The new revamped version of examine.com is even better.
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.640]   It's really next, next level.
[01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:03.480]   I really applaud them for doing such a terrific job
[01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:04.720]   in organizing the information.
[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:06.920]   There are a lot of interesting pages
[01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:08.780]   that you can read there about different compounds,
[01:46:08.780 --> 01:46:10.040]   so you can put in any compound,
[01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:14.120]   ginkgo biloba, phosphatidylserine, alpha-GPC,
[01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:16.160]   and you're going to get a rich array of information
[01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:17.360]   about those compounds,
[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:19.900]   and if you were to put in a specific goal state,
[01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:23.760]   that is focus or concentration or sleep
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:26.180]   or hormones like testosterone, et cetera,
[01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:30.900]   you're going to get a rich array of compounds, supplements,
[01:46:30.900 --> 01:46:33.000]   as well as links to the studies on those compounds,
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.960]   and some details about those particular studies.
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:36.720]   It's an absolutely phenomenal site.
[01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:39.280]   It's one that I rely on and that I know thousands,
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:41.420]   if not millions of other people rely on,
[01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:42.780]   and I encourage you to check it out.
[01:46:42.780 --> 01:46:46.000]   Again, the URL is examine.com.
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.560]   So today we've talked about a number of different tools,
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:50.240]   and to some extent, some mechanisms
[01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:52.720]   involved in concentration and focus,
[01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:54.700]   and really the goal has been to provide you
[01:46:54.700 --> 01:46:56.740]   an understanding of the neurochemical systems
[01:46:56.740 --> 01:46:58.580]   and a little bit about the neural circuits
[01:46:58.580 --> 01:47:03.040]   that can allow you to achieve states of attention and focus.
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:04.480]   In contrast to previous episodes
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:05.640]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:08.740]   where I've covered these topics in tremendous depth
[01:47:08.740 --> 01:47:11.880]   as it relates to mechanism and also focused on tools today,
[01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:14.640]   I largely focused on tools.
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:16.760]   We talked about behavioral tools,
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:20.400]   like a meditation that's 13 minutes long,
[01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:23.140]   done daily specifically to improve your ability to focus,
[01:47:23.140 --> 01:47:25.680]   and in fact, there are data to support that it will.
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:26.740]   Talked about hypnosis.
[01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:29.680]   We talked about visual focus, overt and covert.
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:31.380]   We talked about various supplements,
[01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:35.080]   such as Alpha-GPC, phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,
[01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:37.640]   supplements that I use to directly modulate
[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:40.200]   the neural circuits for concentration and focus.
[01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:42.480]   We also talked about creatine, the Omega-3s.
[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:43.800]   Talked about the importance of sleep,
[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:46.900]   which modulates our ability to function mentally
[01:47:46.900 --> 01:47:50.520]   and physically overall, so optimize that sleep.
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:52.940]   And we talked about a number of other protocols
[01:47:52.940 --> 01:47:54.160]   that you can incorporate.
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:55.860]   My hope in giving you all this information
[01:47:55.860 --> 01:47:59.120]   in one single location is that you will be able to pick
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:01.340]   and choose which of these protocols
[01:48:01.340 --> 01:48:03.920]   you would like to incorporate into your attempts
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:05.920]   to improve your focus and concentration.
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:09.440]   Again, I don't recommend doing all of these protocols
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:10.600]   all at once.
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:12.600]   What I recommend is picking a handful of them,
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:14.880]   maybe one or two, maybe three or four,
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:17.200]   and trying them in different combinations
[01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:19.220]   at different times of day and for different purposes,
[01:48:19.220 --> 01:48:21.040]   for mental work, for physical work, et cetera,
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:22.800]   and find what is best for you.
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:26.820]   Once again, the goal is to teach your brain, that is,
[01:48:26.820 --> 01:48:30.160]   to increase neuroplasticity in the neural circuits
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:31.800]   that allow you not just to focus,
[01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:33.840]   but to refocus your attention.
[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:36.460]   And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention
[01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:39.300]   that it's also critical to be able to defocus.
[01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:43.000]   I highly encourage people to take a period of time each day
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.840]   to daydream, to walk down the hall
[01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:46.620]   without looking at your phone,
[01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:49.940]   to not have to incorporate more sensory information,
[01:48:49.940 --> 01:48:52.720]   to not place increasing demands on yourself to focus,
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:55.760]   and see and realize how having a period
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:58.760]   of deliberate decompression and defocusing
[01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:01.320]   can allow your brain to focus so much better
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:04.740]   when you do decide to return to about a focused,
[01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:07.200]   concentrated work or physical work.
[01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:09.600]   So I want to thank you for joining me for this discussion
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:12.800]   about tools for focus and concentration.

[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:45.960]   at the beginning of today's episode.
[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:48.200]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:50.440]   During today's episode and on many previous episodes
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:53.180]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements.
[01:49:53.180 --> 01:49:55.300]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[01:49:55.300 --> 01:49:57.460]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[01:49:57.460 --> 01:49:59.560]   for things like sleep and enhancing focus
[01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:01.760]   and hormone augmentation and so forth.
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:03.700]   As mentioned at the beginning of today's episode,
[01:50:03.700 --> 01:50:05.400]   the Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered
[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:06.540]   with Momentous Supplements
[01:50:06.540 --> 01:50:08.940]   because they are of the very highest quality,
[01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:10.160]   they ship internationally,
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:13.200]   and they have single ingredient formulations in dosages
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:15.840]   that will allow you to construct the best,
[01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:17.640]   most biologically and cost-effective
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:19.940]   supplementation protocol for your needs.
[01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:21.480]   If you're interested in the supplements
[01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:23.460]   covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:50:23.460 --> 01:50:26.200]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:29.000]   so livemomentous.com/huberman.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.160]   If you're not already following us on social media,
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:32.600]   we are Huberman Lab on Twitter
[01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:34.720]   and we are also Huberman Lab on Instagram.
[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:37.760]   Both places, I talk about science and science-related tools,
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:40.760]   some of which overlap with the contents and topics
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:42.240]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:44.240]   much of which is unique from the content
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:45.600]   and it's certainly the format covered
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:46.720]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:48.520]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on Instagram
[01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:50.200]   and Huberman Lab on Twitter.
[01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:52.480]   The Huberman Lab Podcast has a newsletter
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:55.560]   in which we provide summaries and essential protocols
[01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:57.840]   from the Huberman Lab Podcast episodes.
[01:50:57.840 --> 01:50:59.800]   You can access it totally free of charge
[01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:01.680]   by going to HubermanLab.com,
[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:04.940]   go to the menu and click on newsletter, provide your email.
[01:51:04.940 --> 01:51:06.900]   We do not share your email with anybody
[01:51:06.900 --> 01:51:08.640]   and you'll receive our monthly newsletter.
[01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:10.960]   There are also examples of previous newsletters there
[01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:12.920]   that you can download as PDFs right away
[01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:14.500]   without even having to sign up.
[01:51:14.500 --> 01:51:15.960]   So thank you once again for joining me
[01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:18.220]   for today's discussion all about the mechanisms
[01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:19.600]   and especially the tools
[01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:22.200]   for enhancing concentration and focus.
[01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:24.380]   And last, but certainly not least,
[01:51:24.380 --> 01:51:26.320]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:28.900]   (upbeat music)
[01:51:28.900 --> 01:51:30.500]   (upbeat music)
