[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.240]   >> What's the difference between math and physics to you?
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.280]   >> To me, very, very roughly, math is about the logical structure of all possible worlds
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.600]   and physics is about our actual world.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.520]   >> And it just feels like our actual world is a gray area when you start talking about
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.600]   interpretations of quantum mechanics or no.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.520]   >> I'm certainly using the word world in the broadest sense, all of reality.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.320]   I think that reality is specific.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.000]   I don't think that there's every possible thing going on in reality.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.080]   I think that there are rules, whether it's the Schrodinger equation or whatever.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.740]   So I think that there's a sensible notion of the set of all possible worlds and we live
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.000]   in one of them.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.240]   The world that we're talking about might be a multiverse, might be many worlds of quantum
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.520]   mechanics, might be much bigger than the world of our everyday experience, but it's still
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.640]   one physically contiguous world in some sense.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.800]   >> So if you look at the overlap of math and physics, it feels like when physics tries
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.160]   to reach for understanding of our world, it uses the tools of math to sort of reach beyond
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.880]   the limit of our current understanding.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.920]   What do you make of that process of sort of using math to, so you start maybe with intuition
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.200]   or you might start with the math and then build up an intuition or, but this kind of
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.760]   reaching into the darkness, into the mystery of the world with math?
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.280]   >> Well I think I would put it a little bit differently.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.480]   I think we have theories, theories of the physical world, which we then extrapolate
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.960]   and ask, you know, what do we conclude if we take these seriously well beyond where
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.680]   we've actually tested them?
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.960]   It is separately true that math is really, really useful when we construct physical theories.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.560]   And famously Eugene Wigner asked about the unreasonable success of mathematics and physics.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.680]   I think that's a little bit wrong because anything that could happen, any other theory
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.240]   of physics that wasn't the real world, but some other world, you could always describe
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.240]   it mathematically.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.720]   It's just that it might be a mess.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.200]   The surprising thing is not that math works, but that the math is so simple and easy that
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.080]   you can write it down on a t-shirt, right?
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.200]   I mean, that's what is amazing.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.560]   That's an enormous compression of information that seems to be valid in the real world.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.880]   So that's an interesting fact about our world, which maybe we could hope to explain or just
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.400]   take as a brute fact, I don't know.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.600]   But once you have that, you know, there's this indelible relationship between math and
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   physics.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.240]   But philosophically, I do want to separate them.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.160]   We don't extrapolate math because there's a whole bunch of wrong math that doesn't apply
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.600]   to our world, right?
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.080]   We extrapolate the physical theory that we best think explains our world.
