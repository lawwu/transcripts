[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740]   Welcome back to the all in podcast, the number one business
[00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.360]   technology and political podcast in the world. I am your host,
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.540]   Jake out, Jason Calacanis. And with us today, three of my
[00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.060]   besties, you got David Freeberg cackling over there. He is your
[00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.620]   sultan of science previously known as the Queen of Qinhua,
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.520]   but he sold the Qinhua business made a killing in Qinhua. Also
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.220]   with us back from Italy back from Italy, Chamath Palihapitiya
[00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.260]   he's at 67% button. And he's not happy about it. But the hair
[00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.300]   looks great. You still got a little sea salt from the yacht.
[00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.140]   I think I'm going to try to keep my hair long. Let's see what
[00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.260]   happens. Did you bring any of the sea salt back with you from
[00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.020]   the Mediterranean? Put it in a little bottle to spray or no?
[00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.360]   No, but I do. Oh, okay, great. And have you showered in the
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.660]   last week? Or is it still you got the Mediterranean glove
[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.340]   every day? I showered since I've gotten back. See, that's the
[00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.740]   problem. You don't have you don't have the sea to use as a
[00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.660]   natural, you know, disinfectant and deodorant. Exfoliant.
[00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.140]   Exfoliant also.
[00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.180]   Look how many buttons he's got going. I know it's just tragic
[00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.940]   beginning. I feel uncomfortable for your neck. I mean, it's like
[00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.340]   creeping all the way up. Your neck looks like a prisoner.
[00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.140]   Rain Man David Satterthwaite.
[00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:33.340]   I walked here but I had it totally unbuttoned and I thought
[00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.820]   this is completely inappropriate for Menlo Park in August. So I
[00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.420]   buttoned two buttons back in business mode. He's in business
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.180]   casual mode. He went from casual to business. Okay, and
[00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.180]   with us, of course, the Dark Knight himself. Yeah, the Rain
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.700]   Man David Sachs. And we have a bestie guest before you folks
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.780]   friend of my other pod this weekend startups Reid Hoffman is
[00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.940]   here. And you know him as a venture capitalist board member
[00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.780]   at Microsoft. And you were the co founder or the founder of
[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.900]   LinkedIn. I don't know if you had a co founder, co founder, co
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.780]   founder of LinkedIn, now owned by Microsoft. He's got his own
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.260]   podcast masters of scale. And he and David Sachs work together at
[00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.740]   PayPal. Reid, give it welcome to the program and give us a little
[00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.860]   story. What is your fondest memory? Or the most quirky
[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.980]   memory? David Sachs, and that all those weirdos I'm sorry, I'm
[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.900]   not supposed to use the word weird anymore. I get banned on
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.860]   X. All of those unique personalities at PayPal. Tell us
[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.260]   about that moment in time. And do you remember the first time
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.060]   you met David Sachs? Yeah, I met David, because Peter Dunham from
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:49.260]   Stanford and hired him in. And, you know, David, very quickly,
[00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.340]   because he, you know, has a strong learning curve as he
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.300]   plays these things kind of got the instinct of what the game we
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.180]   were playing with PayPal was. And it's part of the reason why
[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.060]   I think, you know, each of the execs have had, you know, kind
[00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.020]   of key contributions to making, you know, kind of PayPal
[00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.740]   successful. And David's was this kind of like, maniacal focused
[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.740]   on the kind of the cycle of how the product worked on eBay. And
[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.380]   like, like, there was just a whole bunch of stuff I learned
[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.460]   from him. It's part of how I track, you know, kind of, you
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.020]   know, people I respect, is what do I learn from them. And that
[00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.820]   was one of the things that I would say I learned from David
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:34.980]   at PayPal. That's nice.
[00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.220]   David, tell us your first memory of meeting read Hoffman. Would
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.940]   you remember where you were? Do you remember the conversation?
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.580]   Yeah, I think when we met through Peter, you know, and
[00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.300]   read, I think read was on the board of this confinity back
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.580]   then and then joined full time.
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.820]   Were we like 2827 29?
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.940]   No, I mean, let's see. This would have been 1000. I guess
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.940]   it would have been 27. When I first joined PayPal 2728. I
[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.620]   guess something like that. Yeah. 99. So whatever that was, in any
[00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.820]   event, I mean, I'll just return the compliment, you know, PayPal
[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.220]   had all these existential issues, where you had these
[00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.140]   larger entities trying to kill us visa, MasterCard, eBay, who
[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.620]   else?
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.100]   Oh, the list goes on Citibank.
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.340]   Yeah. And read was was kind of our emissary who kept all these
[00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.420]   dogs at bay and managed to, I guess, be friends with them, I
[00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.740]   guess, to some degree, even though they wanted to kill us.
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.820]   And re was kind of in charge of making sure that these
[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.820]   existential issues didn't blow up on us. And they didn't. So we
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.020]   got pretty lucky there.
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.300]   It's it's the Will Rogers line. It's politics is the art of
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.820]   saying nice doggy while you hunt for a stick. Tell us like a
[00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:55.060]   moment read. That is incredibly memorable to you from that PayPal
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.140]   era, you know, some existential moment or one or more difficult
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.980]   or funny moments, late night moments, that would be
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.060]   indicative of that era and whatever was in the water that
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.020]   drew all that talent to one place.
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.900]   Well, part of it is that, I mean, this is, you know, among
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.420]   the things I was learning from from Peter, was that Peter and
[00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:24.940]   Max recruited just a tremendous focus on on like intense
[00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.500]   learning curves. So, you know, it's one of the things that
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.820]   Peter later is like, okay, I guess you have to interview for
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.420]   being on sports teams and so forth, because this teamwork
[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.220]   thing does matter. But like high performers, and it was kind of
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.140]   like a, like, and that was part of the reason why there was such
[00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:44.980]   intense, you know, kind of innovation and capability. You
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.500]   know, probably the most stunning memory I had it at PayPal is we,
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.140]   you know, we're all young, we're all first time we're, we're kind
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.540]   of doing a startup that matters, you know, kind of making this
[00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.740]   stuff happen. And we do this merger with x.com. And, and, you
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.620]   know, like, pre the merger closing, you know, Elon is
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.340]   saying, Oh, I got the CEO, Bill Harris, he's best ever, that's
[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.140]   part of the reason why you give so much percentage of the
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.740]   company to x.com and the merger, you know, dah, dah, dah, dah. And
[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.180]   then after the merger, literally, the first meeting I
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.340]   had with Elon is Bill Harris, a complete disaster, we need to
[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.820]   fire him right away. Before we get to the first board meeting,
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.860]   we need him fired. And I'm like, uh, Elon, you need to talk to
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:30.820]   Peter about this.
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:37.700]   Well, I mean, he is decisive. That's for sure. Yes. All right.
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.500]   Well, let's get into we want, you know, we're gonna go a
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.780]   little bit mullet here, Friedberg, we're going to start
[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.860]   with business. And then maybe we had a fun meeting about that
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.140]   topic at a place in Palo Alto that no longer exists called a
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.140]   Antonio's nut house. Yes, exactly. Yes, the legendary
[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.380]   Antonio's done. And when Bill eventually did meet his demise,
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.500]   at PayPal, it was called the nut house coup.
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.860]   He got whacked at the nut house. We're at school tables in the
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.940]   back. We're in the books in the front.
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.620]   Well, it was he wasn't whacked. He was whacked at a board
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:15.220]   meeting, not at the house. But certain plans were formulated
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.460]   at the back of Antonio's nut house.
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:24.420]   It's Antonio's that house is, yeah, the most unhygienic bar in
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.700]   the Bay Area. And then that's, that's a pretty low benchmark.
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.420]   Let's just leave it at that. We will start with some business
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:34.220]   here, talk a little AI. And then since two of our panelists have
[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.340]   a passion, we'll do the party political parties at the end.
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.260]   Everybody knows that re was a co founder of inflection AI and as
[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.500]   a general partner at Greylock and one of the founding
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.780]   investors also in open AI. There's a good story there, I'm
[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:55.380]   sure. And we just got results read from Nvidia results were
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:59.060]   good. They beat across the board. Stock was down after
[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:03.420]   hours. Analysts said probably profit taking putting that
[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.900]   aside. We've never seen a chart like this in the history of
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:12.940]   business. I would say data center revenue 26.3 billion 87%
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.100]   of their revenue. Now you remember Nvidia started
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.820]   obviously with, you know, video games and, and didn't have a
[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:23.580]   major data center business that has exploded net income 16.6
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:30.460]   billion gross margin 75%. And here's your chart. On a total
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:34.540]   basis in videos, revenue scale up is basically unlike anything
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:38.260]   we've seen. But if you look their queue quarter of a quarter
[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.900]   revenue over the past couple years, things are starting to
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:45.300]   cool off significantly after that giant boom. Re what's your
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:49.660]   take on Nvidia is just incredible run here? Is it
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.500]   sustainable? Will they have competitors? And do you think
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.660]   this build out this massive bill that we're seeing from startups
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.740]   to sovereigns? You know, to Microsoft, which are on the
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:03.580]   board of Google, Apple, etc? Is this sustainable? And is this
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:04.300]   going to keep going?
[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:08.500]   Well, I got asked that question, unsurprisingly, by many public
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.700]   market investors over the year. Yeah. And I said, basically told
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.860]   them and say, Hey, look, it's sustainable for two years, which
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.180]   for you guys means forever.
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.300]   Yeah. Eight full quarters.
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.700]   Yes, exactly. So that that's infinity, right? In terms of
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:27.420]   time. You know, Nvidia has a very sharp, you know, kind of
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.140]   lead on the importance of the the chips for the training
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:35.060]   clusters. You know, they're, they're effective on inference.
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.780]   But I do think that as you kind of scale the demand, there'll be
[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:43.820]   a lot of inference chips coming in. You know, I think Chamath
[00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:47.580]   you're invested in one of those. Oh, yeah. And I think there's
[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.740]   going to be a bunch of those kind of coming in and and and
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.420]   the bulk of the demand will be on the inference side. And then
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:58.300]   Nvidia will have this challenge of, do I try to keep my prices
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:02.820]   and my margin? Or do I do what why we like competition? Do I
[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.820]   have to respond to the competitive market? And then
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:08.020]   that I think will will play out, you know, start playing out
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:12.660]   probably in a year, two at the latest, and then kind of go. So
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:16.260]   I think it's not sustainable. The the pure heat is not
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.380]   sustainable. But I think it's, you know, Nvidia has got a very
[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:23.580]   strong position. And, and, you know, I definitely, I would
[00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.900]   recommend people not be short on Nvidia.
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:30.820]   Yeah, so yeah, there's growth left competition is coming. And
[00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:34.060]   this is probably not the type of stock you would want to short at
[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.420]   this moment in time. Freeberg, what are your thoughts on this
[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:40.420]   build out, as well as the software build out that's
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.860]   occurring? And when do you think we're going to see some
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.660]   competition come into the space?
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.460]   I don't know if there's competition in the build out. I
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.180]   think we talked about this in the past. And I don't know if
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:53.340]   you guys saw these quotes this week, or recently on, we don't
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:58.100]   think about this build out in terms of ROI. Gavin Baker in
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.860]   conversation on invest like the best. Is that the name of the
[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.260]   podcast? Yeah, I think reference some conversations he's been
[00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.940]   having with the leaders of these companies, regarding the build
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.940]   out is so important, because ultimately, if you create this,
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:17.140]   quote, digital God, the, you know, return is how many
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.180]   trillions. So it doesn't matter how many 10s of billions you're
[00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.660]   spending each quarter right now, you have to get there, you have
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.260]   to make sure you don't miss the boat. I guess read a question
[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.620]   for you. You're on the board of Microsoft still, right? Like,
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.460]   yes, indeed. As Microsoft or Satya publicly talked about how
[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:36.060]   they rationalize the investing principles associated with
[00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:40.180]   building out AI infrastructure in the cloud. Is it ROI based
[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:41.820]   like, hey, in the next two years, we're gonna make this
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:46.100]   much additional incremental profit or, or we got to get this
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.260]   thing working. Right, right. To be more precise, is the
[00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.740]   investment driven by ROI? Or does everyone just say this is
[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.540]   so strategic, we just have to win it. And we'll throw all the
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.100]   resources we have to at this.
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:12:00.020]   Well, so what will one board members speaking for Microsoft
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:04.700]   is, you know, is forbidden. So I'm not speaking for me. Right.
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:09.100]   To all cloud computing platform companies. How are you? Yeah,
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.660]   what's your sense on how they're thinking? Just one of the
[00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.780]   principles and the Microsoft thing is the company speaks for
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.620]   itself, board members don't don't don't speak for him. But
[00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:20.340]   you know, I think Satya is like the best public market CEO of
[00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:27.260]   our generation. I think he is stunning in kind of blending
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.140]   common combination of strategic insight with also kind of being,
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:33.100]   you know, kind of return on capital, you know, sensible
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.780]   risk taking, etc. And so the actual thing between your guys
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.380]   questions in terms of because I can comment on how Satya things
[00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:41.860]   with this stuff is, he's both thinking about like, it's a
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.540]   platform change. And you have to be there for the platform
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:49.340]   change for productivity for cloud, etc. And, okay, let's
[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:52.420]   rationalize the capital to when are we expecting revenue? How
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.620]   do we get revenue sooner to have that as a good, productive
[00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:01.260]   cycle? How do we, you know, be not trying to, you know, just
[00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:05.620]   spend like drunken sailors, which is easy to do, right. But
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.740]   but to be targeting, you know, kind of business outcomes. And
[00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:12.140]   it's part of the reason why, you know, they're like, like, you
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.740]   know, he's very focused on what are we doing with office? What
[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.380]   are we doing cloud? What are we doing with, you know, as
[00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:22.860]   opposed to like, you rarely hear him talking about AGI or never
[00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:27.060]   digital gods, because it's kind of the question of, I am, I am
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.140]   focused on this on a business sense. And I think that's,
[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:30.620]   that's kind of the way he's doing it. But there is
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.860]   obviously a, you know, kind of a, it's hard to predict the
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.020]   future when it's novel and unknown and platforms. And it's
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:40.540]   part of the reason why you have all the hyperscalers. Now, you
[00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.300]   know, kind of fully engaged and intelligently engaged, because
[00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:47.460]   you say, well, if even it's just the new platform by which, you
[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.660]   know, kind of software everything with with with a
[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:54.940]   computer unit in it, whether it's a phone or a speaker or a
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:58.740]   computer or anything else, anything with a with a with a
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:03.500]   with a kind of a CPU or a GPU gets more intelligent. Like, you
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:07.420]   can't miss out on that platform. And so that's, that's, I think
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.940]   the the thing that's motivating everybody, but it's obviously,
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:13.820]   you know, how to do that smart is one of the things that, you
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:17.380]   know, everybody is, I'd say obsessing about every week.
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:21.740]   What do you think about the open source movement versus closed
[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:25.460]   source, you were one of the original donators to open AI,
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.220]   you were originally on the board. And there's a couple of
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.420]   ways to go with this question. But I just want to start with,
[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.020]   forget about the corporate structure over there, we'll get
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:36.660]   to that in a second. But I want to talk specifically about open
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:40.820]   source medicine, medicine, obviously far behind open AI far
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.220]   behind Google, Microsoft, so they went open source, when
[00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.220]   you're behind you go open source, I guess is the idea
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:50.300]   here. But they're making some big progress. Who do you think
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:54.780]   is going to win this ultimately, an open source provider of LLM
[00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:59.980]   or proprietary closed source, like open AI is, and it's
[00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:03.780]   confounding to say open AI is closed, but closed AI.
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:08.380]   Yeah, um, you look at from the very founding, open AI was
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:10.780]   never claiming it was gonna be open source was claiming it was
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:15.260]   going to be one safety open access, and not differential or
[00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.820]   controlling access for that. And I think that's they've stayed
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.940]   true to that principle, which is I think what the genesis of the
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:26.580]   word open is there. And, look, I think the key thing is going to
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.700]   be winners all over the place. I think there's gonna be winners
[00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.580]   in the open source side. And, you know, I don't, I don't know
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.020]   if llama is going to win from its open source thing as much as
[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:36.860]   it's just saying, hey, we're training these models. So we're
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:40.260]   gonna, you know, put them out there because our closed system
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.500]   closed loop, you know, doesn't require selling for tokens and
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.300]   so forth. But there's also, you know, Mr. All and other folks
[00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:51.620]   who are doing competent models. And then I think that the the
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.700]   but you know, there'll be wins in different ways. So it's not
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.460]   like I think, like, for example, you know, I think there's going
[00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.340]   to be a bunch of different startups, they're going to win,
[00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:03.100]   whether it's coding agents, or, you know, kind of very specific
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.500]   applications within medical or other kinds of things. And I
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.100]   think they will, you know, generate big companies. And I
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.940]   think large companies, like, you know, the hyperscalers are
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:15.100]   gonna, are gonna succeed as well. Now, in the pure model
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:20.460]   competition, the question is, when do we start seeing a
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:25.380]   asymptote to scale? And, in my guess is, and, you know, kind of
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:29.740]   the GPT landmarks is each order of magnitude, my guess is the
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:34.260]   soonest will be GPD six. And it might not even it may even be
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.620]   after that. And that's part of what the, the bet that open AI
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.580]   and anthropic and the hyperscalers are all making is
[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.700]   that that that return to scale, and then that has a lot of
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.940]   downstream effects. Because even if you say we can train smaller
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:50.180]   models, to do effective things, part of what's going to be
[00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.700]   really instrumental for training those smaller models is the
[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:56.020]   larger models. So, like, even if there's a bunch of smaller
[00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.580]   models that are specifically capturing other kinds of market
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.940]   opportunities, which is part of what I've been doing and
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:06.860]   investing in AI since, you know, 2014, 2015, you know, there's a
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:10.580]   there's a there's going to be a set of those things that are all
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:12.500]   a whole bunch of startup opportunities. So I think that
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:17.740]   that the the A versus B is is is a good dramatic framing. But
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.340]   it's really on which specific opportunities because there's
[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:22.060]   going to be wins and opportunities across them.
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.180]   Do you think you're sorry, just real quick, do you think there's
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:32.060]   one LLM or one foundational model read that effectively does
[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:35.220]   everything like a meta model that starts to take most of the
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:40.740]   market or does different versions of smaller models or
[00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.260]   small agents that kind of network together, end up being
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:47.340]   the best solution for specific applications and verticals?
[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:50.140]   Like, how does this evolve over time? Like, everyone's got this
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:52.660]   concept that there's a God model that does everything and wins,
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:56.500]   and whoever gets the God model wins everything. But the reality
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:00.420]   of software and principles of biology would indicate that
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.340]   you'll see like smaller network things that are better at doing
[00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:07.100]   things than any one big thing. And so I hear your point of view
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.300]   on the philosophy of that. Yeah,
[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:11.620]   I think the mistake that people make is they think precisely is
[00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:14.660]   like the one model to rule them all. It's like Sauron's ring.
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:20.740]   And actually, in fact, already today, like, for example, one of
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:24.100]   the things that happens with all the model providers at Microsoft
[00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:28.340]   and open AI, which I've seen is sometimes sub in like GPD 3.5,
[00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.900]   as opposed to four, to see what the answers are, because there's
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:34.100]   a cost of compute, even as you learn that bring the cost of the
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.740]   computer, the larger models down, the larger models are
[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.340]   always going to be a lot more expensive. And by the way,
[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.740]   they're going to be more expensive, kind of probably
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.300]   loosely on the order of magnitude, right? So it's like,
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:47.180]   well, it's 10x larger, it's 10x more expensive. Totally. And and
[00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.460]   so when you're trying to say, hey, I'm trying to make business
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:50.180]   models work,
[00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.180]   by language translation, right? If I just want to do language
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.260]   translation, I don't need a massive model, I just need a
[00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:56.940]   model that's really good at language translation.
[00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:00.300]   Exactly. And so what I think you're going to see is is is
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:04.140]   networks of models, and like kind of traffic control and
[00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.220]   escalation, all the rest and agents are not going to be one
[00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:09.820]   model, they're gonna be blends of models. And that's one of the
[00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:12.100]   reasons why you say, well, there's actually in fact, a lot
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.380]   of a lot of room for startups, because it's not like we say,
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:17.940]   well, we take GPD seven, and we just serve it for everything.
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.820]   It's like, well, it's gonna be super expensive. And there's a
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:23.100]   whole bunch of things about like serving it more cheaply. And
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.460]   like, for example, one of the the really great technical
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.820]   papers that I love for Microsoft is, you know, all you need is
[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:32.180]   textbooks. It's like you can you can train very specific models
[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:36.540]   on kind of like high quality data, along with, by the way,
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.580]   the larger model helping train it that all of a sudden, you
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:42.460]   have a functional smaller model. And you know, the question will
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:46.460]   be a blend of these things. So I think the the the multi model
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:50.340]   model approach is, I think, going to be, you know, quickly
[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:51.020]   universal.
[00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:55.580]   What is your take on IP in this new era, we see open AI, and
[00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:58.140]   you're not on the open AI board anymore, right? You're not so
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.980]   you're independent of that, even though you made a big donation
[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:01.540]   at some point.
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:05.900]   Donation and investment. I led the first commercial series for
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.820]   special. So you're an investor in it, and you donated to it.
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:13.580]   Actually, let's start there. What's up with that corporate
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:17.900]   structure? How do we make sense of that? Something's a
[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.180]   nonprofit, you donated to it, and then you invested in it, and
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.540]   everybody's making money and selling in secondary at 100
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:26.460]   billion. How does that work in the world?
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:31.500]   So, so it's, it's a five, one, two, three is the governor thing
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.580]   is what started and, you know, when, you know, kind of Elon and
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.180]   Sam were starting this and said, Look, we need, you know,
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:41.700]   philanthropic support. And we're trying to make sure that there's
[00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.220]   like open access to AI, which is going to be an instrumental
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.540]   technology. And we've got some great technologists who want to
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:50.580]   come do this. We started as a, as a, you know, kind of as a
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:54.740]   501 c three for doing it that that that persists, as far as I
[00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:59.340]   know, till today. Then, you know, one of Sam Altman's, you
[00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.980]   know, pieces of genius was that he kind of said, Look, we're
[00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:06.020]   going to need scale capital. And I'm trying to go out to raise
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:09.700]   and commercial round was 600 million. I'm trying to raise 600
[00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.940]   million philanthropy and is not working. Right. So, so I have
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.900]   this idea, which is the 501 c three, which is doing this kind
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:19.700]   of research mission of, you know, AGI for humanity is also
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:23.340]   producing commercial benefits. And we can create initially an
[00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:28.740]   LP, which has a kind of a revenue right on the commercial
[00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:33.580]   things that investors can invest in. And, you know, you know,
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:37.580]   read it'd be really helpful if you led this. Because, you know,
[00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.780]   and I was like, Oh, but you don't have a go to market plan.
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:44.580]   You don't have a product plan, you know, business plan. Yeah,
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:47.220]   but you know, like, we, we need to show that we're actually
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:49.500]   serious about the business. I said, Alright, fine, I will, I
[00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:53.420]   will lead it from my foundation. You know, because even though
[00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:56.580]   none of these things we like to see as investors were there, but
[00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.340]   I was like, Look, okay, I'll lead as investment, I'll manage
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.540]   it as an investment, but I'll do as an investment for my
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:07.460]   foundation, in order to do this. And, and what, you know, you
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:09.980]   know, kind of that was kind of as we were beginning to get into,
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:13.580]   you know, like, kind of, we, we hadn't seen anything, they were
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.940]   still doing Dota and, and robot hands and much of this. So it's
[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:20.380]   like, we're betting on the scale thesis of generating something
[00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:23.780]   magical. And so we hadn't seen GPT three yet. And of course,
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:25.940]   once that started coming, then it was like, well, we need a
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:30.300]   bunch more capital, let's do a strategic, you know, you know,
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:32.860]   connection, and let's talk to all the hyperscalers. And let's
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:36.460]   work out a deal by which one of them invest in us. And, and, and
[00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.700]   then, you know, the, the Microsoft OpenAI deal came
[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:42.780]   together with, you know, converting the LP into a
[00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:46.220]   subsidiary of the nonprofit, you know, kind of saying, Look,
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.540]   there's all kinds of benefits that both OpenAI and Microsoft
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:53.300]   can get from a business deal. And so that's, that's, that's
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:57.500]   what's led to, you know, the structure, you know, that I was
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:58.900]   familiar with before I left the board.
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:03.660]   Do you, what did you think of Elon's first lawsuit, and then
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:06.580]   he dropped it, and then he refiled, where, where do you
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:07.540]   think he's coming from?
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:16.660]   Well, what is the, you know, I'm not very charitable about those
[00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:19.980]   lawsuits. They know, I would like to be because, you know,
[00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.780]   Elon's one of the entrepreneurial heroes of our
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:26.940]   time and generation. But I think it's the, I think it's, you
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.060]   know, frankly, I think probably the most charitable thing to say
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:33.580]   is sour grapes. Because, you know, for example, I know, Sam
[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:36.620]   offered him as much of the investment round as he wanted,
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:38.820]   right? Like, he could have done the whole thing, he could have
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.900]   led it, you know, it was kind of like, Hey, look, we still love
[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:45.420]   you. And he was like, No, it's not a company that I control,
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:48.420]   it's gonna fail. So I'm not interested in investing. I was
[00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:51.500]   like, Okay, right. And so now you're getting these lawsuits
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:56.580]   that are like, you know, like, I was misled. And it was like, you
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:59.500]   were offered everything at every opportunity other than converting
[00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:02.860]   open AI into a company that you you completely owned. And so,
[00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:07.460]   you know, I think it's without without basis without merit.
[00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.980]   But why do you think he would have dropped it and then
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:12.660]   refiled? Where do you think that comes from? Is was it? Is there
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:13.980]   a new information? Do you think?
[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.100]   I think it was a jurisdiction? Jamal?
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:18.860]   Oh, that makes sense. I got
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:22.380]   buried. I mean, Elon put in the first what $44 million and he
[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:23.660]   doesn't have any shares.
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:27.820]   Yeah. I by the way, put in 10 million at the same time, and I
[00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:29.220]   don't have any shares from those 10 million.
[00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:32.180]   But do you think that he kind of got screwed because he doesn't
[00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.900]   have any shares? I mean, at the time he put in the 44 million,
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:38.620]   it was never going to be a for profit. Now it's a for profit. A
[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:42.060]   lot of people are profiting, you know, assuming the paper market
[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:47.020]   ends up being realized. So he doesn't own anything. I mean, if
[00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:50.260]   you were a seed investor, and put up 44 million and something,
[00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.260]   and then everyone's making money, and you don't have any
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:55.060]   shares, forget about the legal technicalities, wouldn't you
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:56.460]   have a feeling of being screwed?
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:00.660]   Well, look, I can understand the emotion of that. But like, it's
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:04.300]   not like Elon short of money. Right. And so if you go look,
[00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:07.500]   I'd like to have shares like I did invest in the other thing. I
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.420]   didn't get any shares for the 10 million that I put in. And by
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.860]   the way, it's not just legal technicalities. It's actually
[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.060]   really important that you're not doing private enrichment off
[00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:19.420]   philanthropic donations. And so, you know, it's, it's, but isn't
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:20.180]   that what's happened?
[00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:29.260]   No, from a viewpoint of, they're held separate, right. And so,
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:33.940]   you know, and the 501 c three continues to, to control the,
[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:38.420]   you know, kind of control the kind of the, the, the mission
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:41.460]   and destiny and so forth. And so the question about its mission
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:43.740]   is still is still guiding things. And you're essentially
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:46.900]   investing in that mission. And you recorded, you recruited
[00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:50.100]   people, you know, on that mission. And so, you know, I
[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:54.540]   think that the, you know, you know, I think, like I said,
[00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:55.380]   sour grapes.
[00:25:55.380 --> 00:26:00.780]   Okay, so let's get into some political stuff. First, I want
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:04.900]   to get the IP question, then I want to talk about Lena Khan. So
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.700]   how do you think about IP in this, you know, briefly in this
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:11.460]   new world, opening, I and New York Times can't come to terms,
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:14.780]   New York Times caught them red handed cookie jar, according to
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.980]   their lawsuit, having indexed a ton of their content, it's
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:20.700]   pretty crystal clear that their contents behind a paywall. And
[00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:23.900]   that's how they make money. I also subscribe to chat GPT, I
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.460]   give them 20 bucks a month, maybe 30 bucks a month for every
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:30.500]   employee in my firm. And I get New York Times content from
[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:33.540]   there all the time. I will ask it, what is the wire cut I think
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:36.700]   is the best choice in chat GPT, I get that. And then I get the
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.300]   answer. And I don't need my New York Times subscription, I don't
[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:43.220]   visit the New York Times anymore. feels pretty clear cut
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:48.140]   to me. But how do you think about IP? Should an LLM be able
[00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:51.300]   to ingest whatever they please? Or should they be required to
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:55.100]   get permission in advance and pay a royalty to content
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:55.740]   creators?
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:27:03.460]   Well, as a content creator to look, I think, I think that it
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:08.780]   tends to be a little bit of a, we do want content creators to
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:10.940]   benefit economically from the work. It's part of the reason
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:12.860]   why we have copyright, it's part of the reason why we have
[00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:16.220]   payrolls, you know, other kinds of things that I think are, are
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:18.380]   very important. And I think it's, it's a complicated thing
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:21.060]   that needs to be sorted out. Now, that being said, I think we
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:24.740]   also want to say that we can train these models, like, you
[00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:28.140]   know, like training is like reading, and like reading things
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.220]   is, you know, like when something's available to be read,
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:33.620]   and you've engaged in the right economic thing for reading it, I
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:36.580]   think that's a kind of a reasonable fair use thing. Now,
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:39.220]   maybe we update the terms of service, maybe we update, you
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.140]   know, copyright law or other things to say, well, okay, that
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:44.740]   now changes, you know, I think we don't want to forbid changes
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:48.780]   in the future. You know, this is one of the problems we get with
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.620]   it blocks innovation, when we do that, but blocks innovation, and,
[00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.780]   you know, kind of Hollywood blocks innovation and music, it
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:59.020]   blocks innovation. So you want to allow some new chain, you
[00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:01.340]   know, changing landscape. And I think this is a changing
[00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:04.380]   landscape that arguably is reading. So I think that, that
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:07.540]   both of those things are true in terms of what do we, what do we
[00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:10.980]   want to sort through? I think that one of the reasons why this
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:14.820]   is kind of like, you know, over, like, when I give advice to, you
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:16.980]   know, various news organizations, and so I say,
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.180]   look, don't try to hold out for money on the training side of
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:23.500]   things. Because, you know, we're going to create synthetic data,
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.220]   we're going to do all kinds of other things that are going to
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:28.980]   mean that no one's particular data is really going to matter
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:32.220]   what you should be is on freshness, on brand, on other
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:35.580]   things, and we should work out ongoing sustaining economic
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:38.780]   arrangements like that, that would be my two cents, you know,
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:41.140]   suggestion for it. And I do think we want to design an
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.860]   ecosystem that includes that. And, you know, when I was
[00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:47.180]   involved in those conversations at OpenAI, they, they agreed
[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:49.820]   with that, Microsoft certainly agrees with that in terms of,
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:52.380]   you know, how do we make sure that economics are fairly
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.700]   apportioned, and so forth, for, you know, what we're doing for,
[00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:59.620]   you know, this phase of, you know, and ongoing, but like, you
[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:02.380]   know, there's a current tech, new technological wave that's
[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:05.100]   coming, and how do you do that? So, you know, that's a messy
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.860]   answer. But unfortunately, it's a messy subject.
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:09.980]   It's pretty messy subject. Before we move to politics, I
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:14.260]   just wanted to actually ask you about inflection. So is it still
[00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:18.260]   running? Yeah. And so what basically happened, there was
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:21.620]   like some transfer payment from Microsoft and a couple of the
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:25.180]   people like, and then it seems like whatever that deal was, a
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.820]   little bit seems to have been copied by Google when they did
[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:30.700]   this character AI thing. So just trying to get a sense from you,
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:34.660]   are these deals to structurally avoid FTC scrutiny in terms of
[00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:38.140]   the building blocks of it? Or how, how did you think about it?
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:41.180]   And what is the, what is the pattern and the trend on these
[00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:41.700]   things?
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:45.860]   Well, the thing I think that's happened was, you know, very
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:48.620]   early days, you had things like, you know, we're doing an agent,
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:51.820]   and if Pi had launched before JATCPT, it'd probably be in a
[00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:56.380]   different circumstance. But like JATCPT got the, oh, my God,
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:57.580]   Pi is the inflection AI.
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:01.020]   Pi is the inflection agent. Yeah. And so, so by the time
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:05.780]   that Pi, we got the trend right, and the, and the interest of the
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:09.100]   market, right, but we got the timing, you know, too late
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:11.620]   happens with startups. So it's like, okay, we need to pivot, we
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:15.300]   need to pivot from a B2C model to a B2B. And we have a unique
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:17.340]   model, but let's sell that to other people who already have
[00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:19.580]   audiences, because we're not going to be able to easily grow
[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.900]   our audience. And then, you know, once we had that as a
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:23.980]   conversation, there were employees like, well, we want to
[00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:26.180]   do the direct agent thing. And that's what we want to do. And
[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:28.860]   we will go somewhere in order to do that. And we're like, okay,
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:30.940]   how do we fund this? And how do we make that work? And how do
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:33.380]   we make it work for investors? And we said, hey, there's a deal
[00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:36.860]   structure that could work, which is, you know, with a, you know,
[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:40.180]   kind of outside party, you can get paid enough in a non
[00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:43.660]   exclusive IP license and an ability to selectively hire
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:47.140]   folks. And then you can dividend some of that out to investors.
[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:49.780]   So investors, you know, get back a, you know, kind of a one
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:54.740]   X, and then kind of a ongoing position. So, you know, as
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:57.500]   investors, it's great to have a kind of optionality on its B2B
[00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:01.060]   business in order to play that out. And this is a structure
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:04.380]   that works for everybody in this pivot to B2B. And that's
[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:06.860]   essentially the structure that we did.
[00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:12.180]   I see. Great pivot Chamath into Lena Khan. I think one of the
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:16.780]   things that is quite paradoxical about your relationship with
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:19.660]   David Sachs, as you both agree on something in politics, which
[00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:25.100]   is Lena Khan, and her concepts around future competition, and
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:29.420]   maybe how she's running this issue for the United States is
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:33.780]   leading to basically a freeze on the market, we're seeing weird
[00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:36.500]   deal structures, like some of the ones we're talking about
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:41.300]   here that could have just been acquisitions. And I'm curious
[00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:45.420]   your thoughts on what she you know, this sort of breakup of
[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:50.300]   Google. Now we're seeing that emerge at the same time that
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:52.740]   they're facing the biggest existential crisis of their
[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:56.660]   career, which is language models competing with them. And then I
[00:31:56.660 --> 00:32:00.380]   would say half of my Google searches have already moved to,
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:04.340]   you know, you know, chat GPT, like services. So what's your
[00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:09.020]   take on Lena Khan's approach to M&A? And what impact if it's
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:12.940]   continued and sustained? Will that have on capital allocation?
[00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:15.140]   Because I don't know what happened to the single and
[00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:19.340]   double M&A market, but it seems to be completely gone.
[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:24.220]   Everything from Adobe and Figma, to other mergers that could be
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.900]   happening are essentially frozen. So what's your take?
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:31.700]   So it was funny, because I kind of made an off the cuff, you
[00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:34.220]   know, kind of remark about Lena Khan, which turned an all news
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:34.740]   cycle.
[00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:37.780]   I saw you on CNN, where they were like, Are you telling
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:40.380]   Kamala and Biden what they have to do? And
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:43.180]   I'm like, no, because I don't believe in that kind of
[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:46.580]   corruption of, of politics. The only way she's gonna learn about
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:49.100]   it is she asked me or she watched this television show.
[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:54.820]   And, and so, so she's done a good job on the price curtail.
[00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:56.580]   She did a good job on the anti-competes, both of which I
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:59.660]   think are very good for, you know, competitive markets. The
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.980]   problem is, I think she has a misunderstanding of these large
[00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:07.620]   tech companies. And, for example, on the M&A thing, you
[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:10.220]   know, her theory is, you got to prevent the aggregation of
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:13.260]   power. So you got to, you got to fight every acquisition of
[00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:16.660]   note. And the problem, of course, is that actually quells
[00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:19.980]   venture capital investment, because it's like, okay, part of
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:24.220]   the returns is, if I'm going to invest in something that might
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:27.940]   be competing with, you know, one or more of the large tech
[00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:32.300]   companies, I need to have acquisition exits as part of
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:35.380]   being able to fund enough capital to really make that
[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.700]   acquisition, you know, that, that, that, that investment
[00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:39.620]   possible, because if it doesn't work, I want to be able to at
[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:43.100]   least return, recover my capital by an investment. So the right
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:47.060]   way to look at it is, is there competition amongst the top tech
[00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:49.980]   companies? Because, you know, if one of them is like squashing
[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:53.500]   all the other ones, that's a problem. If we're, if we're five
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.660]   large tech companies heading to three, then I'm much more
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:58.300]   sympathetic to her point of view. But we're actually five
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:01.860]   heading to 10, right, or five to seven heading to 12. Because
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:04.980]   like NVIDIA is now in the mix, and others, I think, are coming
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:05.180]   in the mix.
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.380]   Tesla is, you know, now over 500 billion. Yeah.
[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:10.900]   Yes. And so you have this ability. So the thing is, is
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:13.620]   they're competing on the acquisitions, just like they're
[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:16.020]   competing in the market, in the marketplace. And if you're
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:20.060]   trying to quell the whole thing, because your theory is, like,
[00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:22.180]   like, they should just, you know, the startup should just be
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:24.980]   able to grow up to compete. That actually means that those will
[00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:27.700]   never get the capital that they need in order to do that, which
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:31.620]   means you're actually having the opposite of your intent, right?
[00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:34.340]   What you're doing is you're actually making there to be less
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:37.740]   competition. Because, you know, capitalists can't say if I'm
[00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:41.220]   going to put 100 million, 500 million, a billion dollars into
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:43.940]   this company, I at least have a chance of getting my capital
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:47.580]   back, or I can possibly create a competitor. And that's, that's
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:49.980]   the reason I was speaking out against it as an expert.
[00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:54.540]   It was like, interesting. I saw you, I think it was a Jake
[00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:58.140]   Taper, Tapper, who you kind of grilled you on, I thought you
[00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:00.180]   did an exceptional job of just saying, Listen, I made a
[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:02.700]   donation. This is how I feel about it. But obviously, she's
[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:06.620]   going to do what she wants to do. And that's just how politics
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:09.260]   works. So I thought that was actually pretty well done. And I
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:12.300]   actually appreciate you fighting for more M&A, because it'd be
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:16.580]   great for the industry. It's actually you want to throw up a
[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:17.940]   political topic here, you want me to
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:22.100]   just just just to stick on Lena Khan for a second. So I agree
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:26.020]   that her approach has been overly broad and has had a
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:30.180]   chilling effect on M&A. And so Jake, like you said, we've lost
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:33.940]   those base at acquisitions that I think are important to the
[00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:37.020]   venture capital market that help new startups get funded. I mean,
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:39.820]   if the returns on risk capital go down, there's going to be
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:40.540]   less of it.
[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:46.300]   Yeah, so I agree with read on that the area where I'm not sure
[00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:49.740]   we agree is, and where I do agree with Lena Khan is I do
[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:52.860]   think the big tech companies have too much power. I do think
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:56.740]   that they are monopolies or have monopolies. And I do think they
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:00.100]   need to be controlled. I just think that, you know, I
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:03.060]   wouldn't prevent them from doing any M&A whatsoever. I'm curious
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:06.180]   if read, like agrees with that, that the big tech companies have
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:10.260]   too much power, or agrees with Lena Khan on that. And I guess
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:12.260]   specifically, do you think any big tech companies should be
[00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:15.620]   broken up? If so, which ones? I mean, I, I would actually
[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:19.940]   entertain that idea of, of, of deconglomerating or breaking up
[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:21.940]   some of these big tech companies. Do you do you think
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:24.340]   do you agree that big tech is too much power or not?
[00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:32.100]   I think it's TBD. But the reason I'd say let's take the opposite
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:38.020]   point of view would say no. The thesis for no, is that they are
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:42.180]   very strong American companies that get, you know, in the most
[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:46.900]   cases, over half the revenue from overseas. They create
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:50.900]   technology platforms that beneficially differentiate the
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:56.420]   US versus, you know, many other countries and kind of global
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:59.700]   circumstances, like the internet and other kinds of things. I
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:02.100]   think that they are competing ferociously with each other. I
[00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:06.260]   mean, you know, Jason just mentioned that, you know, it's
[00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:08.740]   kind of like, look, we've already got like chat GPT
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:11.140]   competing with Google search, and other kinds of things. And I
[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:13.860]   think it's competitive pressure, right? This is, I think what
[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:16.500]   capitalism is about is competitive pressure, that
[00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.740]   essentially creates the thing. And that's the reason why, like,
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:23.300]   if it's, if we were shrinking, like it was Google, Uber, Alice,
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:26.100]   or actually, frankly, think that the, you know, everyone likes to
[00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:29.540]   talk about, you know, Google, you like, I think that the prime
[00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:32.340]   candidate is likely to be and I'm speaking as an individual,
[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:35.460]   and as a venture capitalist here is Apple with the App Store.
[00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:38.500]   Right. Okay, so wait, so that brings up an interesting point.
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.660]   One of the things we've talked about in this pod is that we
[00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:45.460]   shouldn't shut down M&A, but the the FTC should limit
[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:48.900]   anti-competitive tactics by these big tech companies.
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:53.300]   Apple, really good example, because they drive everything
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.780]   through the App Store, you're not allowed to do side loading,
[00:37:55.780 --> 00:38:01.060]   they want to take what is a 30% piece of any sales, you're not
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:03.940]   even allowed to have a link inside an application to drive
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:08.900]   accepting your website. Yeah, you're up now you can. So would
[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:11.860]   you at least want to crack down on those anti-competitive
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:15.620]   tactics? Yeah, no, for sure. And look, especially when, you
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:18.340]   know, we all know it's nonsense. It's like, look, you could just
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:22.340]   give the consumers the option to, to, to allow side loading,
[00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:25.220]   you could just say, it's technically very simple to do.
[00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:29.460]   And you can say, look, we, we don't want you to side load,
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:33.380]   because we view it to be safety and security. But we're giving
[00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:38.580]   you the option. Right? Fine. Give people the option. Right?
[00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:41.940]   Reed, were you surprised that then the first target where
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:45.060]   there was like some successful antitrust pushback was against
[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:48.260]   Google versus Apple? And then second, do you think that
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:52.100]   there's a chance like a meaningful chance that the
[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:54.980]   government tries to break Google up? Or do you think it
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:57.300]   looks something maybe more similar to what happened to
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:03.620]   Microsoft? So I think in mandating breakups, you know,
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:07.780]   like I think is a look, I think we should operate through
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:09.860]   competitive networks and competitive ecosystems. I think
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:12.180]   it's part of what's smart about capitalism. And I think
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:15.140]   mandating breakups is only when essentially capitalism is
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:19.700]   failing on specific things, you want to do the least, the least
[00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:23.540]   you can, to get back to competitive networks, in terms
[00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:26.820]   of how you're operating. And so, you know, you say, hey, look,
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:29.380]   I iOS has this kind of monopoly, and you say, there's no side
[00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:30.900]   loading, you have to use App Store, you have to use the
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.620]   payment mechanism, you know, etc, etc. It's like, well, that
[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:36.900]   quells a ton of startup innovation. We all know this as
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:40.020]   investors, because we look at anyone who's prospectively doing
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:43.220]   a business like this and say, no chance, it's you know, you're
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:46.500]   not going to succeed. And so so then you say, well, what's the
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:50.180]   least thing that we can do? Right? And you know, a classic
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:52.740]   and you're like, well, let's break off the App Store from
[00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:56.260]   Apple as well. Right? unclear that that would really fully
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:59.460]   work. You know, that's like socialism mandating how the
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:01.700]   thing should work. Let's try to get it so that we allow
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:05.620]   competition to determine these things. And like, for example,
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:09.060]   saying, hey, like, you have to allow consumers the option of
[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:11.140]   side loading, you have to allow consumers the option of
[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:14.740]   installing an alternative App Store, right? Like that kind of
[00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:16.900]   stuff. I think, you know, what's the minimal set? I think
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.540]   that's the kind of intervention we want to have. Because I think
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.700]   there's all kinds of benefits that come from
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:25.620]   what but why do you think that the case against Apple has made
[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:27.460]   less progress in the case against Google?
[00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:32.100]   I think it's kind of it's less politically easy, right? Like,
[00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:35.700]   it's kind of like, everybody loves our iOS phone. And, you
[00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:39.940]   know, there's, there's, there's less of a blue and red, you
[00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:44.420]   know, kind of combo tackle, where, you know, the, the blue
[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:48.340]   feet, people are like, big companies, less offensive,
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:51.380]   basically. Yes. Yes. More stylish. They're, they're
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:54.820]   prettier. I kind of like your approach, though, with the App
[00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:58.260]   Store, if you were to think of least harm to the ecosystem,
[00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:02.260]   Epic Games has their own App Store for games, they charge
[00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:06.020]   88%. They give a I'm sorry, they give developers 88%. They
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:10.980]   only take 12. And forcing Apple to allow, you know, a startup to
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:14.740]   do an App Store would solve the entire problem. And it seems
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:16.980]   like that's where it's going to go. And all five of us would
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:22.100]   invest instantly in an App Store that would say 0% take rate,
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:24.660]   and all advertising based. What a great idea that would be.
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:30.900]   Yeah, I have a question. A few weeks ago, you said something to
[00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:33.540]   the effect very publicly that you had had a one hour or
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:37.620]   multi hour lunch with Biden. And he just seemed like super on
[00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:43.220]   his game. And then he was kind of dumped. Was that just a
[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:47.940]   moment in time where he was really great with you? Or how do
[00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:51.300]   you reconcile that with Pelosi and all of these other folks?
[00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:56.980]   And what happened to Biden? Well, like most of us, I was
[00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:01.940]   pretty dismayed by the debate performance. Because when I
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:05.300]   talked to him, like detailed, thoughtful analysis with no
[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:09.540]   notes on Gaza questions about AI, you know, and what kinds of
[00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:12.180]   things, you know, what did I think about what the progress,
[00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:14.340]   you know, the thing they were doing with the voluntary
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:16.740]   commitments, the executive order, and, you know, what kinds
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:18.980]   of things should happen in the future, and all that kind of
[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:22.420]   stuff being on the game a little slower, right, then, then, you
[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:26.660]   know, a 50 year old would be but but, you know, like, cogent and
[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:31.140]   totally worth it. And then you kind of looked at the debate.
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:37.940]   Oh, my gosh, this is, this is, this is a disaster. And so it
[00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:40.420]   was like, look, is the debate a one off thing? Is it? Did you
[00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:44.020]   were you ill, you know, like trying to reconcile the two and,
[00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:46.420]   you know, spend a little bit of time trying to figure that out
[00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:50.820]   to to what was going on, because it was it was the first time I'd
[00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:56.100]   seen something like that. And, you know, you know, I don't, you
[00:42:56.100 --> 00:43:00.260]   know, I'm not enough of a DC insider to know exactly what the
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:03.540]   set of conclusions were other than I, you know, I plotted, you
[00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:06.340]   know, Biden for having the kind of integrity to go look, I'm
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:09.140]   maybe I'm ill, maybe I'm old, maybe I'm slower, but, you know,
[00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:12.660]   the it's about the country more than it's about me, because I'm,
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:16.100]   you know, not, you know, it's, it's, it's important to be about
[00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:18.900]   the country, not about yourself. I'll, I'll step aside. And
[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:21.460]   ultimately, his decision, there's nothing that anyone can
[00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:24.020]   force Pelosi couldn't force it anyone else. It's ultimately his
[00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:27.700]   decision. He came to that decision. So do you want that?
[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:30.660]   Do you think that they should have run an open primary after
[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:34.580]   that? And would Kamala have won an open primary?
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:37.940]   Well, it's hard to know. I mean, I think they were definitely
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:40.180]   leaning towards an open primary, and then all the people who
[00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:42.820]   would be the most natural contenders all endorsed Kamala.
[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:46.660]   So and by the way, you say, well, kind of democratic process
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:48.580]   was like, well, there was a democratic process that picked
[00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:50.660]   the Biden Harris ticket, which turned into the Harris waltz
[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:54.580]   ticket. And so that's not anti democratic. But I think if you
[00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:57.540]   look at the sequence of events, it was kind of like, well, you
[00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:00.020]   know, we're, we're going to sort out, you know, what we're
[00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:03.780]   going to do. And then, you know, all of the key folks, you know,
[00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:07.140]   Shapiro, and, and Whitmer, and everyone else all endorsed
[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:10.180]   Kamala was like, okay, let's just let's get back to, you
[00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:13.220]   know, kind of the, the choice of two candidates. And so I, you
[00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:17.220]   know, do you feel the voters felt? Do you think the voters
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:24.900]   felt left out? Um, the democratic voters? Well, I mean,
[00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:28.020]   from post fact seems not right with the level of kind of
[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:33.620]   energy and all the rest, it seems that that that, um, that
[00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:38.420]   the that, you know, like the with the pure polling and kind
[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:41.060]   of level energy and kind of what's going on. They're happy
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:42.580]   with what they got. Yeah, they're happy with what they
[00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:44.900]   got. I would have liked to have that speed run. Do you think it
[00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:49.700]   sets a bad precedent that there were these back room
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:56.100]   conversations, obviously, the staff of Whitmer, more Shapiro,
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:58.500]   their office speaks with Democratic Party leadership
[00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:01.140]   speak with big donors. And there was effectively a
[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:04.580]   coalescing that took place over a period of time that said, we
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:07.220]   should all stand behind and endorse one person instead of
[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:11.380]   infighting and creating a split in the party. And does that not
[00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:14.740]   set a bad precedent that there is a small group of people in
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:18.660]   either party that in a primary process effectively get to
[00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:21.620]   nominate their candidate, get their candidate to become the
[00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:24.500]   nominee. And therefore, there's only two people for the country
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:27.940]   to choose from. And as we have seen recently with RFK Jr. And
[00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:31.220]   the lawsuits against him in being on the ballot in different
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:34.180]   states, it makes it very difficult, maybe for the people
[00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:37.940]   to have their choice. And is that a bad way for democracy to
[00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:40.580]   work? And I just love your philosophical view on this. I'm
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:42.820]   like, what's the best way for democracy in the United States
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:47.860]   to work? So for the president, for the president, yes, we do
[00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:51.780]   live in a republic, right? And there is various, like, you
[00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:54.020]   know, some people have much more influence than others,
[00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:58.340]   whether it's media platforms, whether it's, you know,
[00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:01.940]   economics and ability to spend whether it's, you know, history
[00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:06.100]   and a brand and, and, and other things. And so, you know, this
[00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:10.180]   melee and, and, and kind of, you know, whole integration set
[00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:13.060]   of things. Now, ultimately, you know, voters are going to
[00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:16.500]   decide in November, right? So, you know, people do have a, you
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:19.780]   know, and I think that that that staying to our democratic
[00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:23.460]   process is what's really key, like, you know, people going to
[00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:25.860]   the polls, you know, I think we should want to live in a
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:28.820]   country where everyone does, you know, everyone who is who is
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:32.740]   legally allowed to vote does vote. And I think that that's,
[00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:35.220]   you know, ultimately a good thing. Now, you know, are there
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:38.180]   things that I would like to change? Sure. I'd like to change.
[00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:40.660]   I'd like to have rank choice voting. You know, I'd like to
[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:43.540]   have open primaries. There's a set of things like, like,
[00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:46.100]   actually, my principal frustration and all this stuff
[00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:48.740]   is, you know, what's, what's one of the fundamental things that
[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:52.900]   the two parties agree on that, that that that shouldn't be is
[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:56.020]   that there should be only two parties, right? And I think
[00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:59.380]   that's, I think that's something you you need to fix. And you
[00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:01.700]   can't fix it. Unfortunately, I think with independent
[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:04.580]   candidates, because because the whole system is really set up
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:07.620]   for, you know, kind of two parties and independent
[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:10.740]   candidates are almost always spoilers one way or the other.
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:13.300]   I mean, like on the RFK stuff, I understand it was a bunch of
[00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:16.740]   Democrats who were trying to, you know, prevent him from
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:18.260]   getting on the ballot. I actually prefer him on the
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:22.180]   ballot because I actually think his his his anti-vax stance,
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:25.860]   well, you know, really fit very well with with Trump. And so I
[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:28.500]   think he was more from trying to address that read because I
[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:31.860]   think there was a rumor that you were funding some of these
[00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:34.340]   lawsuits to keep him off the ballot or whatever. Like, have
[00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:38.020]   you spent any money to try to impact RFK one way or the other?
[00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:42.500]   I wouldn't be surprised if we look at all the money that goes
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:44.820]   to all the different organizations of organization x
[00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:49.700]   kind of had some kind of ballot thing. Mine's my voice
[00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:52.660]   instruction was always like, No, no, no, don't do that. That's
[00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:55.860]   anti democratic. But you know, you can't control everything,
[00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:58.740]   just like you invest in a company and CEO, sometimes the
[00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:00.980]   dumb ass that you can't do anything about.
[00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:04.180]   Because you give money, you give money to folks that then
[00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:07.940]   execute their own strategy. So you can't control on the ground
[00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:09.140]   tactics, right? Yeah.
[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:12.180]   So there's that happens that you're like, No, don't do that.
[00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:16.660]   Well, okay, that's a good, that's a good segue. Let's talk
[00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:20.420]   about the five cases against Trump. There are five lawsuits.
[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:23.540]   No, hold on, Jake. Can we just stay on this topic for a second?
[00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:26.820]   I think this is important. Okay, so in in Michigan and
[00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:32.340]   Wisconsin, you had democratic groups, they fought RFK juniors
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:36.180]   bid to get on the ballot. Okay, they failed. Now he wants to get
[00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:39.140]   off the ballot, but they won't take him off. Now that they
[00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:43.300]   think that his presence hurts Trump. And at the same time,
[00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:46.900]   Michigan's trying to remove Cornell West, and Wisconsin
[00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:49.700]   trying to remove Jill Stein. So I'm curious, do you think
[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:53.940]   there's any principle on display here besides naked partisan
[00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:59.300]   hackery? I mean, basically, the democrats fought having third
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:02.820]   parties on the ballot when they thought it would hurt Biden.
[00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:06.420]   And now they want to keep them on the ballot when they think
[00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:09.300]   it's going to hurt Trump, except for those third party
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:12.900]   candidates who they still think will hurt Harris. So what is
[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:15.860]   there any principle here? Or is this just partisan hackery?
[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:19.780]   I think it's, you know, I frankly, you know, think that
[00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:22.260]   everyone who follows the legal process to get on the ballot
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:24.420]   should be on the ballot. And, you know, we should follow the
[00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:28.580]   legal process. I'm very much of a legal process kind of person.
[00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:31.060]   What I'm opposed to is like, you know, calling Raffensperger
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:35.060]   and asking for 11,000 votes, right, which is not legal.
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:39.140]   Right. So, so like, yeah, sure. That is that is that bad? And
[00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:42.980]   do I advocate against that? The answer is absolutely yes. But
[00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:44.660]   it's, you know, follow the legal process.
[00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:47.860]   But if the Secretary of State of Colorado throws Trump off the
[00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:50.980]   ballot, for example, is that legal process if it's then
[00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:53.300]   overruled by the Supreme Court? Or can we just say,
[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:56.660]   substantively, that states shouldn't be removing candidates
[00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.340]   from the ballot? That's anti democratic.
[00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:02.500]   Well, but you want them to remove RFK from the ballot?
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:04.740]   No, that's not what I said.
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:06.980]   Oh, okay. I'm just trying to figure out.
[00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:10.740]   No, the rule is that, well, first of all, I don't think that
[00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:14.340]   Democratic groups should be suing RFK to keep him off the
[00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:17.380]   ballot. And that's what he said is that Democratic groups were
[00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:19.380]   suing to keep him off the ballot. And they were trying to
[00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:22.180]   exhaust his resources. So he couldn't mount an effective
[00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:25.460]   campaign. And some of those groups you funded, right? So
[00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:28.340]   maybe you don't know what they were doing. But in any event, I
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:30.980]   consider that to be anti democratic. RFK is now trying
[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:33.060]   to remove his name from the ballot. I think as a candidate,
[00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:36.660]   you're allowed to do that. And those same groups that once
[00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:39.700]   fought to keep him off the ballot are trying to keep his
[00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:42.660]   name on the ballot. Because now they perceive, yeah, because
[00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:45.060]   now they perceive the political calculation to be a little
[00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:49.300]   different. So I don't see any of this as being democratic. This
[00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:51.460]   to me is just partisan hackery, isn't it?
[00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:57.860]   Yes, fundamentally, from a viewpoint of like, for example,
[00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:00.980]   my direct actions, and yes, there was, you fund a whole
[00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:03.380]   bunch of different groups, and you have different groups doing
[00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:05.460]   different things, but you funded them to do this thing that you
[00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:08.980]   were thinking of, and things happen, just like companies. You
[00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:14.100]   know, my thing was actually, in fact, making people aware of, of
[00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:18.100]   RFK is anti vax, you know, statement is anti science stuff,
[00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:20.820]   because I thought that would be relevant in the polls in
[00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:24.340]   November, that that was the actual strategy that that I
[00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:28.260]   believe, and I think that would differentially, you know, hit
[00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:32.180]   Trump more. And so therefore would be a spoiler, right, as
[00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:35.220]   these are, I have no problem with drawing attention to
[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:37.460]   issues. But I do think fundamentally, it's anti
[00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:40.660]   democratic to sue third party candidates to the point where
[00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:43.940]   they can't be on the ballot. Okay, let me ask you directly,
[00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:48.820]   Cornel West. There's an effort right now to remove Cornel West
[00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:51.940]   from the ballot in Michigan. Do you support that? Or would you
[00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:54.020]   oppose that? I mean, is that democracy?
[00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:58.260]   By default, I would oppose it. I don't know any of the details.
[00:51:58.260 --> 00:51:58.980]   Okay, fair enough.
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:03.140]   Reid, I have a I have a question for you. It's more of a
[00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:05.300]   statement, actually, maybe I just love to get your reaction.
[00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:10.500]   One of the most divisive issues that we have right now is
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:17.700]   people's position on October 7, Israel, Palestine. There is a
[00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:22.180]   sense that there's a growing kind of like virulent strain of
[00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:25.620]   anti semitism in America. A lot of people point to the extreme
[00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:30.100]   left as where that's really gestating. There was thoughts
[00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:32.900]   that Josh Shapiro would have been an exceptional candidate.
[00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:36.980]   But one of the large reasons why he was not really meaningfully
[00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:41.140]   considered was his religion. I just want you to comment on the
[00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:44.180]   broad issue. And whether you see it in the Democratic Party,
[00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:46.100]   whether you see it in the Republican Party, whether you
[00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:49.220]   see it at all, just give us a sense of where we stand
[00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:50.340]   culturally on this issue.
[00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:54.580]   Well, so like I know, Josh Shapiro, I think he's great.
[00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:59.540]   You know, I've had I've broken bread with them. And, you know,
[00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:04.900]   he was meaningfully considered. You know, I think that the, you
[00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:07.620]   know, I think we should be so lucky that he would, you know,
[00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:12.500]   run for presidency someday, some year. You know, I actually
[00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:16.740]   didn't know Walt at all. And, and, and, you know, was
[00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:19.700]   initially kind of surprised because, you know, I was like,
[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:21.940]   Oh, I thought it was probably gonna be Shapiro. And I was
[00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:24.020]   like, Well, you know, I think it was, you know, probably a
[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:27.060]   close call down to those two. And, and it looks like, you
[00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:30.660]   know, you know, in making decisions, I think, you know,
[00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:34.500]   Harris, you know, made a good decision of Walt's. So, you
[00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:38.020]   know, I think it's a, you know, now on the, on the
[00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:42.980]   antisemitism topic, I do worry that, you know, broadly, we're
[00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:48.900]   seeing, you know, kind of more rise of antisemitism. And
[00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:52.980]   that's extremely important to fight. You know, because I
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:56.180]   think, and I think there are people on in the, you know,
[00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:59.620]   it's, it's a weirdly like, like, there's some lefties are
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:01.940]   doing it, and there's some righties are doing it's both a
[00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:05.300]   blue and a red issue in different, different shape. And
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:08.660]   I think it's very important that we, you know, we stand
[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:14.100]   against that as a country. And so, you know, I've been, you
[00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:16.340]   know, kind of mostly just trying to say, Hey, look, we
[00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:20.580]   gotta, we gotta be anti, anti racism, antisemitism, and also
[00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:22.820]   anti genocide. And we got to figure that out.
[00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:26.100]   What do you think of Kamala's handling of that issue in her
[00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:30.420]   speech? She basically seemed to, I don't know, say both sides
[00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:33.700]   it, but she said, Hey, you can believe that the people of
[00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:36.900]   Gaza should be treated more humanely. And that, you know,
[00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:39.300]   Israel has a right to defend herself. What do you think of
[00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:39.940]   her handling that?
[00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:42.340]   I think that's rational, right? Like, you should be anti
[00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:47.620]   genocide, both of Palestinians and of Jews, right? And, and
[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:51.540]   like, like, it's obviously a very, very thorny topic. Yes.
[00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:54.820]   Right. So. So I think, you know, saying that I'm going to
[00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:57.780]   try to protect civilians on both sides, anti genocide, I
[00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:02.420]   think that's a human, caring place to be looking out for
[00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:02.900]   people.
[00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:06.260]   Reed, do you think that, generally speaking, Marxist
[00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:11.220]   socialist principles are taking a firmer hold on the Democratic
[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:14.900]   Party, and kind of those principles are starting to
[00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:18.180]   showcase not just in the cultural phenomena that that
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:20.740]   Chamath is referencing, but also in some of the policymaking
[00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:27.780]   that's going on, and concepts of equity, rooted in concepts
[00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:31.300]   of social justice, ultimately rooted in Marxist principles
[00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:33.140]   emerging from the Industrial Revolution.
[00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:34.340]   What about price fix?
[00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:37.380]   So as an example, the price gouging, you know, price caps
[00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:42.580]   on food proposal, the concept of a wealth tax, not necessarily
[00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:45.140]   the unrealized capital gains tax, but separately attacks on
[00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:48.820]   wealth, all of these concepts of the degradation of power
[00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:54.420]   structure through policy. And in part, some have argued that
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:57.380]   the anti semitism arises from these principles and that the
[00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:00.900]   Jews are considered a privileged and powerful cultural
[00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:04.500]   class. Is that is that not being observed? Do you not do
[00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:06.580]   you not think that there's some tendencies that are emerging
[00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:10.020]   in the Democratic Party and may be influenced by a louder far
[00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:13.140]   left and that far left is becoming more loud and better
[00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:14.180]   represented in the party?
[00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:18.500]   Look, I think we should speak out against both the far left
[00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:21.940]   and the far right. I think it's important to do both. And so,
[00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:27.220]   you know, since, you know, I'm playing the Democrat here on
[00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:31.940]   this conversation, I'll ask you guys to play the or especially
[00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:36.020]   Sax play the Republican and speak out against the far right
[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:41.060]   too. But the short answer is yes, there are amongst the
[00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:43.060]   extreme left, that's not everybody in the Democratic
[00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:47.460]   Party, but the extreme left, there is some like, you know,
[00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:50.340]   misunderstandings about, you know, why it's important to do
[00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:53.460]   defend, you know, kind of anti genocide, like from the river
[00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:55.940]   to the sea. It's like, yeah, that's a genocidal statement.
[00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:58.820]   Don't use that one. Right. You understand what language
[00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:03.140]   you're using. And and to be like, look, you know, we've had
[00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:06.180]   a great genocidal moment with, you know, World War Two, and
[00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:09.540]   we're still trying to recover from it to, you know, questions
[00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:14.260]   around like, like what I think is a foolish wealth tax, even
[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:16.660]   though it's, by the way, narrowed to like 80%. And then
[00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:20.900]   on like the, the price gouging stuff, you know, one of the
[00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:22.900]   things is I started scratching at it, you know, it was
[00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:25.380]   interesting, I think this week, Kroger said, yes, we did
[00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:29.140]   actually artificially raise prices to profit from the
[00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:31.780]   pandemic. And, you know, and yeah, you should stop price
[00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:34.100]   gouging. It's not quite the same thing as price capping. And
[00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:37.700]   apparently there's laws that affect even in Florida, right,
[00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:42.420]   or in Texas, where some of, you know, you guys are living. So
[00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:45.860]   like, it's kind of, you know, it's like, okay, I need to
[00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:47.940]   understand this issue in more depth, but I don't think it's
[00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:51.060]   as simplistic as the political headlines are having it.
[00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:54.500]   - Well, but the reason why Kamala Harris proposed the
[00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:56.740]   price fixing proposal, price gouging, whatever you want to
[00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:59.700]   call it, was in response to inflation. In other words,
[00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:02.900]   we've had 20% erosion in purchasing power over the last
[00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:05.940]   four years, Harris needs a response to that. So she came
[00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:08.980]   forward with this new economic proposal. So it's in that
[00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:11.940]   context, this came up, and this wasn't some proposal by the far
[00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:15.380]   left of the party, unless you consider Kamala Harris to be
[00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:18.580]   far left, I actually do. But okay, fair enough. But my point
[00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:22.180]   is just, this is her proposal. And it's in response to
[00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:25.540]   inflation. I mean, you don't, you understand what causes
[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:27.540]   inflation, right? It's like the government printing too much
[00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:30.580]   money. It's not, it's not greedy corporations raising their
[00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:32.500]   prices too much. I mean, do you agree with that?
[00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:35.860]   - Look, I agree that you have to have good monetary policy. And
[00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:39.220]   so I think we probably agree on that. And I think some printing
[00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:41.780]   of money is part of the normal functioning economy, but too
[00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:46.820]   much is bad. And I don't think, look, I think price it, look,
[00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:48.740]   part of the reason why we just talked about antitrust stuff
[00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:53.220]   earlier, you do have to look at places where there's a
[00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:55.860]   possibility of kind of commanding stuff from your
[00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:59.620]   privileged position. And like, you know, the, like, I want to
[00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:01.620]   - We all agree, we all agree that monopolies have to be
[00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:04.500]   controlled. No, no, no debate there. But that's not what's
[00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:06.500]   caused the inflation, right? Because we've had inflation of
[00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:09.860]   commodities, not just monopoly products, but commodities, like
[00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:14.180]   just food staples, eggs, you know, chicken, stuff like that.
[00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:18.420]   - Driven by fuel and labor and all the other inflationary, you
[00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:22.260]   know, underpinnings of those markets. And I think we tried to
[00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:23.940]   highlight that. I don't know if you saw Elizabeth Warren's
[00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:26.820]   interview on CNBC where she got taken apart because she made
[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:30.420]   some claims about profiteering by Kraft Heinz and the CNBC
[00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:33.220]   anchors pointed out you were actually incorrect. Kraft Heinz
[00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:36.980]   has seen a reduction in profit over this period of time. And so
[00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:39.220]   like there were factual inaccuracies in these belief
[00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:42.180]   systems. But, you know, for me, it feels a lot like the
[00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:45.700]   government setting prices in free markets is one of those
[00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:48.500]   steps towards socialist principles that worry me the
[00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:48.740]   most.
[00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:52.260]   - Yeah. And look, I, generally speaking, as I was saying
[00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:56.260]   earlier, I'm like, like, make sure the network sets, sorts it
[00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:58.900]   out versus, you know, centralized control.
[00:59:58.900 --> 00:59:59.780]   - Totally, totally.
[00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:02.660]   - So, so it's kind of like, you have to look at, is there a
[01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:04.900]   place where you're like going, okay, that's the reason I like
[01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:08.020]   focused, her words were price gouging. And if you're focused
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:10.580]   on the kind of gouging side of it is like, oh, there might be a
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:14.180]   market inefficiency that you're essentially correcting, then
[01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:16.500]   that's, I think the same kind of thing we were talking about
[01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:19.940]   with like the FTC and the Apple app store and so forth. If
[01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:23.220]   it's like the, I'm just going to set a fixed price on eggs,
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:26.420]   right? That's a bad idea. And by the way, there's, there's bad
[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:29.300]   ideas, like the wealth tax thing that I, that I disagree
[01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:32.100]   with. Her, her economic thing also had housing, which I think
[01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:34.740]   is a, you know, a good, you know, kind of thing to kind of
[01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:38.820]   lower costs for Americans and, you know, kind of make that kind
[01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:42.660]   of stable work. Like, I think she's, she's been good on
[01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:46.260]   immigration. I think that's the, the Lankford cinema bill,
[01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:49.940]   which was from, you know, the, the, the Republican side was
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:52.980]   something they were fully prepared to endorse. And, you
[01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:55.060]   know, Trump killed it because he wanted to campaign on it.
[01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:57.300]   It's like, look, we care about the actual running in the
[01:00:57.300 --> 01:01:00.260]   country. And so you look, I think there's a bunch of good
[01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:02.900]   things, but if you said, do I defend price capping? The
[01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:06.500]   answer is not as an independent principle by itself. And by
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:09.220]   the way, are there people lefties, like, you know, a lot
[01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:11.860]   of what Elizabeth Warren says about capitalism, I disagree
[01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:14.020]   with, right. I mean, I could disagree with you on the
[01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:16.580]   border. I think, you know, Kamala Harris used to be
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:18.580]   considered the borders are that's gotten scrubbed. I don't
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:21.060]   think she's done a great job on that, but whatever that I want
[01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:24.340]   to go back to issues that affect Silicon Valley, 25%
[01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:27.940]   unrealized gains tax. It seems like most of Silicon Valley,
[01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:30.820]   almost all of it is either disagrees with this or is up in
[01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:34.020]   arms about this. I think J Cal, you would you said that this
[01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:36.820]   is disqualifying and disqualifying for me for sure.
[01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:41.060]   Yeah. So I mean, do you agree that a large unrealized gains
[01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:45.540]   tax 25% would be a disaster for Silicon Valley and the whole
[01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:48.420]   startup ecosystem? Or I mean, how do you come down on that?
[01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:53.300]   Well, as I understand it, on that taxes is proposed is you
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:58.180]   have to have 80% of your net worth. That's right. Liquid.
[01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:02.100]   Yeah, if 80% or more is illiquid, then
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:04.980]   no, you get to defer the tax, but there's a penalty.
[01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:07.940]   Yeah, you get to defer the tax as a penalty. That's right.
[01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:10.500]   Look, I think it's definitely a quelling impact. And it's
[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:12.340]   definitely stupid and definitely shouldn't happen.
[01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:16.900]   You know, so is it? Yeah, I think we got your position on
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:17.860]   it. It's stupid.
[01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:24.580]   Why isn't it? Why isn't it disqualifying? The way that J
[01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:28.660]   cow says, are we just supposed to hope that doesn't do what
[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:32.500]   she is going to do? I'll tell you why I think that both the
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:36.420]   republicans and the democrats have realized that there's
[01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:40.180]   actually very little difference on a lot of the major things
[01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:44.420]   that they actually talk about. So what they're both being
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:47.860]   forced to do is realize that because the centrality of a
[01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:50.820]   bunch of the things they say are the same, they each have to go
[01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:55.220]   to their flanks to get the end plus one vote. And so Kamala
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:58.580]   goes to the left and spouts all this stuff that seems so
[01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:02.420]   socialist or socialist or communist because she has to get
[01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:06.980]   those people to vote for her. Ultimately, I think what ends
[01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:10.260]   up happening is most of the stuff in the middle has a decent
[01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:13.380]   chance of happening. The stuff at the fringes, I think they
[01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:16.980]   get put up sacks almost as like a sacrificial lamb. A good
[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:19.540]   example, I think, is like all of the stuff that's happening
[01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:23.460]   with the student loan reform, a half a trillion dollar plan, it
[01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:26.660]   gets shot down by the Supreme Court, this new plan, another
[01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:30.580]   $100 billion, not even being heard yet by the Supreme Court.
[01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:33.780]   So I think they know this. I mean, it's not like the Biden
[01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:36.580]   administration is dumb. The Trump administration is not
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:38.820]   them either. So I think what they're doing is 10 million
[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:41.300]   people would be an example on the right and taking away a
[01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:44.180]   woman's right to choose would be the other one. Yeah. And by
[01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:46.420]   the way, one of the things you keep bringing that up, but
[01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:49.380]   Trump has said that he would veto he would not support a
[01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:52.260]   national ban. I'm talking about already doing he already he
[01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:54.980]   already overturned. I'm talking about that. Yeah. And by the
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:57.460]   way, just returning issue to the states. It's not outlawing
[01:03:57.460 --> 01:04:02.340]   abortion. And by the way, as the people in Austin, Texas,
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:07.540]   well, but that's a valid initiative. They have not had a
[01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:09.460]   valid initiative. They're just about everywhere. There's been
[01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:12.660]   a valid initiative. The pro choice forces have won. And
[01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:15.220]   besides, that's a state issue. Now, J Cal, not federal. Yeah,
[01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:17.220]   no, it's a state issue. And Trump succeeded in taking away
[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:19.940]   a woman's right to choose in Texas. But one thing, by the
[01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:22.580]   way, look, in the spirit of the all in podcast, I wanted to be
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:25.140]   clear about like, there's, there's this stuff on the on
[01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:28.420]   the Dems, and some of their economic policy for the far
[01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:30.580]   left people that, you know, kind of, you know, they're
[01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:33.300]   advocating for that I'm opposed to, you know, sax, I'd love to
[01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:37.060]   hear from you, what parts of Trump's thing you're opposed to?
[01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:41.140]   There we go. Well, I mean, I have been consistent on this pod
[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:45.860]   for years that I thought that the, let's call it the like,
[01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:49.380]   extreme pro life side was not good for the Republican Party,
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:52.580]   and I've been opposed to it. I don't think it's what J. Cal
[01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:55.780]   says, I think that overturning Roe v. Wade did not abolish
[01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:58.500]   abortion, it basically returned the issue to the states. And if
[01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:00.580]   you look at the referenda that have happened, they've pretty
[01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:04.260]   much all gone the pro choice direction. So I think that the
[01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:06.660]   overturning of Roe v. Wade has actually allowed the country to
[01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:09.860]   sort of sort out that issue, although it's not completely
[01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:13.780]   sorted out. But look, I would not support a national
[01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:17.940]   abortion, I would not support refederalizing the issue. I
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:21.620]   think there's a lot of issues about, you know, war and peace
[01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:25.460]   where I do not support the, you could say the establishment
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:28.900]   neocon strand within the party. I do not support all these
[01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:32.420]   interventions, I do not support these forever wars. And there
[01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:34.900]   is a big debate in the party about that. Now, one of the
[01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:38.260]   reasons why at the end of the day, I support Trump, is I know
[01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:45.060]   this will strike some people as counterintuitive, but I think
[01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:47.700]   he is the moderate within the Republican Party. He's a
[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:50.420]   moderate on abortion. I know, J. Cal, you're still bitter about
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:53.860]   that Supreme Court case. However, he's been very, very
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:56.980]   clear that he will not support national abortion ban. Moreover,
[01:05:56.980 --> 01:06:00.260]   he took the abortion language out of the Republican platform.
[01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:06.100]   I think he's the moderate on issues of war. He was the first
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:10.580]   Republican candidate to run opposing Bush's forever wars.
[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:14.260]   So I give him credit on those things. On style, he may not
[01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:17.300]   come across as a moderate, but those are style points. I think
[01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:21.060]   on issues, he is the moderate. The issue I have with Kamala
[01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:23.940]   Harris is I don't think she's a moderate, you know? So like,
[01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:29.060]   just to take this 25% unrealized gains tax first, when this issue
[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:31.780]   came up, we were assured, well, she doesn't really believe that,
[01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:34.340]   even though it was in the Democratic platform, and it was
[01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:38.740]   in the Biden-Harris budget. Then people said, well, maybe it's
[01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:42.420]   part of her platform, but it's not a priority for her. And we
[01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:45.620]   just had one of her, like, top economic advisors come out on,
[01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:50.260]   I think it was CNBC, defending it, and her campaign confirmed
[01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:54.260]   that she supports it, okay? So now the argument has become,
[01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:57.700]   well, she supports it. It is really part of the platform. She
[01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:59.860]   would do it if she could, but she's not going to be able to do
[01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:03.300]   it. I just don't think that's a ringing endorsement of a
[01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:05.540]   candidate. I don't think you want to support a candidate,
[01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:07.620]   because they're not going to be able to do what they really
[01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:08.180]   want to do.
[01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:12.420]   Do you think she's a moderate? Or do you think she's a socialist,
[01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:15.380]   you know, going to take the country very far left?
[01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:19.620]   By the way, yeah, but what Sachs didn't address is Trump's
[01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:23.220]   tariff policy, which is also inflationary, almost equivalent
[01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:25.940]   to the price gouging, you know, food price caps. I think that
[01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:28.580]   they're both inflationary, and they're both bad policy. That's
[01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:29.780]   my personal point of view.
[01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:31.380]   Tariffs is where I thought it was going to go.
[01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:32.900]   But yeah, anyway, yeah.
[01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:37.220]   Honestly, I'm not sure what I think of that proposal. You
[01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:38.580]   know, I guess it depends on the details.
[01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:39.380]   What do you think Reid is?
[01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:41.940]   I'm not endorsing it, but I'm not opposing it. But just back
[01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:45.620]   to this point that should we support Kamala Harris, even
[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:49.140]   though we oppose all the policies that her campaign says
[01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:53.140]   she supports? Because it seems like that's the argument now is
[01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:56.420]   that Silicon Valley is expected to support Harris, even though
[01:07:56.420 --> 01:08:00.500]   she wants, and her campaign has confirmed, she wants a 44%
[01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:04.740]   capital gains tax. She wants a 25% unrealized gains tax.
[01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:07.300]   These are things that I think the vast majority of Silicon
[01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:10.180]   Valley considers to be disastrous for the startup
[01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:13.540]   ecosystem. Should we support her in spite of those things?
[01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:18.900]   Well, look, the information did an actual data poll as opposed
[01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:21.700]   to us being talking heads saying, we say that Silicon
[01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:24.980]   Valley does X or Y. And, you know, the information's poll
[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:28.500]   showed that there was, you know, much broader support for the
[01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:30.420]   Democratic ticket than the Republican ticket.
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:32.900]   Is that the thing that Ron Conway just tweeted?
[01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:34.740]   He might have. I don't know.
[01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:39.140]   No, no, no, no, that's different. That's a subset.
[01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:42.660]   That's a different group. That's a group to counteract you and
[01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:45.700]   Chamath throwing a fundraiser for Trump.
[01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:53.540]   But the information, a news source that ran a poll, you
[01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:55.940]   know, did it objectively ran the whole thing to try to answer
[01:08:55.940 --> 01:09:00.660]   the question, came out with more folks in favor of, you know,
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:02.580]   the Biden-Harris ticket than I believe.
[01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:03.780]   Why do you think that is?
[01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:04.740]   I believe that is.
[01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:07.220]   Well, because, because look, taxes is an important issue.
[01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:09.540]   And I think if you ask any, any Silicon Valley business person
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:12.260]   to say, look, lower capital gains, promote long-term
[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:14.340]   investment, ask me, that's what I would say too.
[01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:17.220]   But, you know, you kind of go, well, what actually, in fact,
[01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:22.180]   you most need for business is stability, rule of law, not
[01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:24.740]   grifter capitalism, where it's like, you know, give me a
[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:28.580]   ability to launch my own NFT, you know, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:30.500]   You know, that's what they go.
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:31.700]   We want that.
[01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:34.420]   And by the way, we can navigate a higher tax rate.
[01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:36.980]   It'll be less fast on growth and everything else, but we can
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:40.660]   still invest, create businesses, you know, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:44.500]   But we can't do it with, you know, kind of a corroding the
[01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:46.020]   rule of law, right?
[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:49.940]   Like, you know, I think both David, both you and Chamath
[01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:51.620]   spoke out against the January 6th stuff.
[01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:53.380]   I'm curious where you're on that now.
[01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:55.300]   It's still top of mind for me.
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:57.620]   That's the reason why the kind of the rule of law thing is my
[01:09:57.620 --> 01:09:59.380]   red line, not a tax policy.
[01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:01.300]   Well, let me ask you about that formally here.
[01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:03.700]   There are five cases against Trump.
[01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:05.540]   You have the insurrection case.
[01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:06.900]   You have the New York taxes case.
[01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:08.340]   You have the hush money case.
[01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:09.780]   You have the E. Jean Carroll case.
[01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:13.540]   And what am I missing there?
[01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:15.540]   Oh, and the documents case.
[01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:18.740]   You funded, like Peter Thiel funded the Gawker case, the E.
[01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:21.540]   Jean Carroll case, which Trump lost.
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:26.180]   And just to ask you, why did you choose to fund that?
[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:29.300]   And do you believe Trump sexually assaulted E.
[01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:29.860]   Jean Carroll?
[01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:33.700]   Well, it's kind of not relevant whether or not I did or not.
[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:38.340]   What I funded was an ability to have, you know, kind of a woman
[01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:40.980]   who doesn't have power, who's being threatened by a rich man
[01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:43.940]   with a lot of money and power to try to silence her, to have
[01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:48.340]   her day in court where 12 everyday Americans, right, can
[01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:49.220]   come to a judgment.
[01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:52.660]   And their judgment was that there was an assault and there
[01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:54.340]   was slander about the assault.
[01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:56.340]   And they did it twice.
[01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:59.060]   And so that was the reason I funded it.
[01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:01.540]   And, you know, I think that that's important.
[01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:04.900]   We, you know, the laws apply more importantly to rich and
[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:07.620]   powerful people than it does to poor people.
[01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:11.300]   That's the important about, like, one thing I love about
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:13.220]   America is a rule of law system.
[01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:15.220]   And I think that's what's most important.
[01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:16.740]   And that's what's really fundamental.
[01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:19.620]   That's my red line relative to the kind of lines in the sand
[01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:20.340]   that we're talking about.
[01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:25.300]   And, you know, that's, you know, that's the reason why in
[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:28.340]   the various kind of lawsuits where that seemed to be that
[01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:30.180]   that's what's being emphasized.
[01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:32.660]   Then, you know, I'm happy to support them.
[01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:38.500]   I don't see how it's rule of law when you have a district
[01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:41.380]   attorney, Alvin Bragg, who's elected on a promise to get
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:48.500]   Trump, he then takes what are at most a bookkeeping misdemeanor
[01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:51.300]   that's past the statute of limitations that's expired.
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:55.380]   And he turns into 34 felony charges on a legal theory that
[01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:57.300]   was never explained to the jury.
[01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:03.140]   And then basically Trump is convicted in a sham trial by a
[01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:07.220]   hyper partisan New York jury system so that Democrats can
[01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:07.700]   then run.
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:08.420]   What do you think of that?
[01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:10.500]   On the branding, on the branding that he's a, quote,
[01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:11.540]   convicted felon.
[01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:12.900]   So there are there are four other trials.
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:15.860]   I don't think it's rule of law.
[01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:16.420]   Hold on.
[01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:18.420]   I don't want to get feedback.
[01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:19.460]   I want to get reach feedback too.
[01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:20.580]   But let me just finish my point.
[01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:24.260]   I don't think it's rule of law when Trump is prosecuted on a
[01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:26.660]   documents charge that Biden himself is guilty of.
[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:30.260]   He's got all these documents in his garage for decades, which
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:32.900]   the judge has thrown out.
[01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:36.420]   And we've seen a bunch of these lawfare cases where Trump has
[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:37.300]   ultimately prevailed.
[01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:40.100]   The judge has thrown it out or he's won it on appeal.
[01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:44.180]   So that seems to me like abuse of the legal system for a
[01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:46.740]   partisan political goal, not rule of law.
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:47.300]   OK, so read.
[01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:48.500]   There's four other cases.
[01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:50.260]   Two of them Trump's been convicted in.
[01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:51.380]   Two of them are outstanding.
[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:52.900]   What's your take on the four cases?
[01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:53.940]   You've heard Sachs estate.
[01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:56.580]   So what's the two that he's been convicted?
[01:12:56.580 --> 01:13:00.420]   Jake, how what's the other one besides the three days?
[01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:02.100]   Alvin Bragg was convicted.
[01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:07.620]   And then the Trump organization with the CFO committing tax
[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:08.180]   fraud.
[01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:10.900]   He was convicted in that one as well, or the Trump organization
[01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:11.540]   was convicted.
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:14.260]   And people say that's lawfare by Letitia James.
[01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:17.220]   So guilty, guilty, guilty in those three of five.
[01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:19.620]   So what's your take on the four that we haven't discussed yet
[01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:20.420]   and heard your opinion on?
[01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:26.580]   So look, I think it's, you know, it's definitely possible to
[01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:29.940]   have some versions of lawfare, although I think most people
[01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:33.060]   use the term when it's the legal process and the law
[01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:34.180]   enforcement that they don't like.
[01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:39.220]   You know, I think that in the Bragg case, you had, you know,
[01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:42.100]   you know, indictment and 12 jurors.
[01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:42.740]   There's jurors.
[01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:46.580]   I think, as I recall, one of the jurors said he got that
[01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:49.060]   juror got their principal news from Truth Social.
[01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:50.420]   It was a unanimous conviction.
[01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:56.900]   I think that, you know, you have Vice President Pence, you
[01:13:56.900 --> 01:14:00.420]   know, comes out and says, you know, Trump asked me to
[01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:02.660]   overturn the election illegally.
[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:02.900]   Right.
[01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:04.580]   That's your own vice president.
[01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:07.540]   So I don't think that that kind of suggests that there's
[01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:10.420]   this just rampant political persecution, that there's a
[01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:12.980]   lot of fire where there's all this smoke doesn't mean that
[01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:16.260]   every single thing, you know, kind of Democrats are trying
[01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:18.660]   to put Trump in jail for 700 years.
[01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:20.260]   These cases are still outstanding.
[01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:21.300]   They want to put him in jail.
[01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:21.860]   Read.
[01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:23.060]   Do you think he should go to jail?
[01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:27.380]   I think if he broke laws that says he should go to jail, I
[01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:30.180]   think the laws apply to powerful people as much as they
[01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:31.780]   apply to everyday people.
[01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:31.940]   Right.
[01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:33.940]   So I think why why why were these cases?
[01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:36.820]   Why did they wait for two years on these cases so they could
[01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:38.500]   bring them in an election year?
[01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:41.780]   Actually, I don't think if you look at the like, look,
[01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:44.420]   speaking factually, Trump's lawyers are always trying to
[01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:45.300]   delay the stuff.
[01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:45.540]   Right.
[01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:47.700]   I think they were trying to follow every legal process and
[01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:50.580]   Trump lawyers keep asking for a campaign this year instead
[01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:51.540]   of being stuck in a courtroom.
[01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:54.660]   Look, after this was this was last year and the year before
[01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:57.940]   asking for deferrals, setting out trial time, like all of
[01:14:57.940 --> 01:15:01.380]   the stuff was from his side trying to delay it.
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:04.420]   If it got delayed into this year, that's a bad judgment on
[01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:05.220]   his his part.
[01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:09.700]   Jack Smith just filed new charges, new charges, and all
[01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:11.140]   this stems from January six.
[01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:13.140]   In the wake of January six, Merrick Garland's Justice
[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:16.260]   Department did an analysis of whether Trump could be
[01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:19.620]   prosecuted for incitement, whether he incited that mob.
[01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:21.940]   And the legal memo came back and they said, no, we don't
[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:22.500]   have a case here.
[01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:24.580]   It does not meet the legal bar for incitement.
[01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:27.620]   Then it was reported by The New York Times that Biden
[01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:30.580]   thought that Merrick Garland was basically being a wimp and
[01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:32.180]   they need to go after Trump.
[01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:35.620]   So the hyper-partisan DA or prosecutor Jack Smith was
[01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:39.220]   hired and he came up with a novel legal theory that somehow
[01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:41.780]   Trump had perpetrated a fraud in the American people, never
[01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:42.900]   been seen before.
[01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:44.900]   And since then, he's been prosecuting Trump and seeking
[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:45.940]   to put him in prison.
[01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:48.580]   And when the Supreme Court just kicked the legs out from
[01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:51.700]   under his case with a recent decision, he just refiled
[01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:52.660]   charges.
[01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:54.420]   I don't understand how anyone can look at this and say,
[01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:56.580]   yeah, look, what happened on January six wasn't great, but
[01:15:56.580 --> 01:15:59.940]   the DOJ looked at it, it wasn't criminal, but yet they've
[01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:02.500]   been pursuing this guy, seeking to put him away for the rest
[01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:06.020]   of his life, seeking to interfere with this election,
[01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:07.860]   seeking to deprive the American people of a choice.
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:12.180]   On a separate track, you've got Democrats in states like
[01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:14.580]   Colorado literally removing Trump from the ballot.
[01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:16.420]   - Okay, Reid, your thoughts?
[01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:23.220]   - So look, the first thing is January 6th, I think is a
[01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:24.020]   red line.
[01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:26.740]   I think it's, you did incite a riot, whether or not the
[01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:26.980]   legal--
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:28.260]   - Then why not prosecute him for it?
[01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:29.620]   - Let's let Reid finish.
[01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:31.700]   - Yeah, you know, I was--
[01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:32.740]   - Fair enough, go ahead, sorry.
[01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:33.620]   - Right.
[01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:37.700]   So I think it was the, you know, there was an incitement
[01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:38.260]   of a riot.
[01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:42.900]   I think that the rioters went in and, you know, killed
[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:46.180]   police officers, were looking to kill Vice President Pence,
[01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:48.420]   you know, from the court testimony, courts are the best
[01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:51.060]   proxy that we have for finding truth in this stuff.
[01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:53.780]   It's one of the reasons why, you know, by the way, and when,
[01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:55.780]   for example, the Supreme Court says, no, that's great,
[01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:56.900]   that's legal process.
[01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:59.460]   - I just have to fact check that no police officers
[01:16:59.460 --> 01:16:59.940]   were killed.
[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:01.700]   Where are you getting that from?
[01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:05.780]   - I think there were, there was the one died from his
[01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:08.020]   injuries and, you know, very soon after, and then--
[01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:11.220]   - No, no, no, no, there was one cop who had a seizure later.
[01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:13.220]   It wasn't part of the riot.
[01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:15.460]   No police officers were killed as a part of the riot.
[01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:16.900]   I just have to fact check that.
[01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:17.700]   It's just not true.
[01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:20.740]   - Well, and then there's the one who committed suicide too,
[01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:22.100]   which is a question of, you know--
[01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:23.380]   - I don't know how you can attribute that.
[01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:29.700]   - Yeah, so anyway, so you got, you know, the storming
[01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:32.980]   of the Capitol, you know, he says these people
[01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:35.140]   are American heroes.
[01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:36.100]   He's going to pardon them.
[01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:39.060]   He's going to hire them into his administration, right?
[01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:40.980]   And if that's not encouragement for other people
[01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:42.500]   doing similar things, you know--
[01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:44.660]   - Wait, he's going to hire January 6th rioters?
[01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:45.460]   He's going to hire them?
[01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:50.660]   - Yeah, yeah, well, we'll get you the Trump speech.
[01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:52.500]   There's all kinds of wonderful things in Trump's speeches.
[01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:56.180]   - Let me just move to one thing.
[01:17:56.180 --> 01:18:00.020]   So, Reid, I think this has been an amazingly robust
[01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:02.020]   conversation, and I think you, as always,
[01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:05.300]   as long as I've known you now for 20 years,
[01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:06.980]   have been really intellectually honest.
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:10.420]   I want to ask you a favor, which is,
[01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:12.340]   can you stay for 10 extra minutes
[01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:14.500]   and talk with us to Bobby Kennedy?
[01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:16.340]   And the reason I want you to do that is,
[01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:18.820]   I think that there is a bunch of misinformation.
[01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:19.860]   I asked you about these things.
[01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:22.820]   I think it's important to hear maybe from Bobby,
[01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:24.820]   and just for him to know what you said,
[01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:25.940]   because I do think it's important
[01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:27.140]   to hear it from the horse's mouth.
[01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:28.580]   Can you just give us like five, 10 minutes
[01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:29.940]   so that we can do that?
[01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:32.020]   'Cause I think it would be an important thing to do.
[01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:32.900]   - Sorry, when is that?
[01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:33.860]   - No, just right now.
[01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:36.900]   - We're rolling into an interview with RFK Jr.
[01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:39.380]   - It wasn't designed this way at the last minute, RFK.
[01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:42.180]   - It's just the last minute RFK Jr., who's on vacation,
[01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:44.660]   said that he would talk to us about what it was like
[01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:46.900]   to kind of withdraw and all this sort of stuff.
[01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:48.740]   And so we booked it right after you,
[01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:50.340]   but he's in the waiting room.
[01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:51.380]   - I'm fine to do it.
[01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:53.540]   I mean, it's- - Oh, okay, totally your choice.
[01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:57.940]   - It's one of the things I like about your all-in podcast
[01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:01.540]   is kind of like, let's try to speak truth.
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:02.660]   - Okay. - Yeah, right, so.
[01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:04.660]   - Hey, Bobby Kennedy is here.
[01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:06.100]   Mr. Kennedy, it's great to have you
[01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:08.100]   on the all-in podcast for a second time.
[01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:11.220]   May I introduce you to Reid Hoffman,
[01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:12.420]   who you may know of,
[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:14.180]   but I don't think you two have ever met.
[01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:15.220]   - We have not.
[01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:16.660]   - Pleasure to meet you.
[01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:18.660]   - Likewise, pleasure.
[01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:22.260]   - Mr. Kennedy, you dropped out of the race.
[01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:23.620]   Perhaps you could tell us,
[01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:25.220]   and I was quite disappointed about it.
[01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:28.500]   I really wanted to see a third-party candidate
[01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:30.020]   get into double digits again.
[01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:31.860]   I just want to commend you on the effort
[01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:32.740]   that you put into it.
[01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:34.900]   Maybe you could tell the audience
[01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:37.940]   why you, as a reported never-Trumper,
[01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:39.460]   joined the Trump team and dropped out.
[01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:43.220]   - So, Jason, I, you know, I'm not actually,
[01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:46.260]   I haven't actually terminated my campaign.
[01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:48.260]   I suspended it.
[01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:50.180]   We've taken ourselves,
[01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:53.300]   or we're trying to take ourselves off the ballot
[01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:56.100]   in the, in about 11 states.
[01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:58.740]   So we'll remain on the ballot in 39 states.
[01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:03.460]   And all red, all blue states will be on the ballot
[01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:06.420]   in the states where we felt
[01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:10.340]   we were going to hurt President Trump
[01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:13.940]   with a polling show that we're getting off there,
[01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:15.380]   mainly the battleground states.
[01:20:16.180 --> 01:20:19.540]   Ironically now, the same people
[01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:21.460]   who've been trying to get me off the ballot
[01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:24.500]   a year or since October
[01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:28.260]   are now fighting to keep me on the ballot
[01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:29.140]   in those states.
[01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:31.940]   So that's one of the sort of ironies.
[01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:35.140]   I, you know, it became clear
[01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:39.860]   and about two months ago,
[01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:43.940]   when the, when it became clear
[01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:45.140]   that I was not going to be allowed
[01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:46.340]   on the debating stage.
[01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:50.500]   And I pretty much had a shutout
[01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:52.660]   in the mainstream media.
[01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:54.740]   So the mainstream media,
[01:20:54.740 --> 01:21:00.500]   ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC,
[01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:04.180]   in 60 or 17 months,
[01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:07.060]   I had only two live interviews.
[01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:12.020]   Ross Perot during his 10 month campaign
[01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:13.380]   had 34 interviews.
[01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:16.580]   And then, you know, all of them
[01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:18.660]   were very, very much aligned
[01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:20.740]   with the Democratic National Committee.
[01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:23.620]   And so when they did mention my name,
[01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:24.820]   which was pretty often,
[01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:27.700]   it was accompanied by a lot of defamations
[01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:32.660]   and pejoratives and mischaracterizations, et cetera.
[01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:35.060]   So I never really had a chance
[01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:37.140]   to reach those audiences.
[01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:38.980]   The audiences that I was reaching,
[01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:40.340]   I was dominating in.
[01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:42.900]   I was beating all the candidates
[01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:43.860]   among independents,
[01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:45.860]   which is now the largest demographic.
[01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:49.140]   I was beating them among young people.
[01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:52.180]   So your audience was supporting me.
[01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:55.460]   The audiences that were listening
[01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:57.060]   to long-form interviews,
[01:21:57.060 --> 01:21:58.340]   I was dominating.
[01:21:58.340 --> 01:22:00.900]   But in the older audiences,
[01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:02.900]   which is a critical baby boomers,
[01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:04.900]   people who really should have been for me,
[01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:08.180]   because they are people who,
[01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:09.460]   from my generation,
[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:12.340]   who remember the Kennedy administration,
[01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:13.620]   they were part of Camelot.
[01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:17.860]   They also, I was very, very popular with them
[01:22:17.860 --> 01:22:20.100]   for many years when I was
[01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:21.860]   the environmental champion alone.
[01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:25.300]   And I should have had good inroads,
[01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:27.540]   but I was never able to communicate with them
[01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:29.380]   because they watch,
[01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:32.340]   they get their news from the mainstream media.
[01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:36.260]   And if you're living in that information ecosystem,
[01:22:36.260 --> 01:22:39.620]   you're going to have a very, very low opinion of me.
[01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:42.420]   I mean, if I was getting my information
[01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:43.540]   from those networks,
[01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:44.820]   I wouldn't vote for myself.
[01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:52.900]   And then President Trump reached out to me
[01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:55.140]   through this guy, Kelly Maynes,
[01:22:55.140 --> 01:22:57.620]   who's a food advocate,
[01:22:57.620 --> 01:22:59.140]   a safe food advocate.
[01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:04.580]   About three hours after the shooting in Butler,
[01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:07.380]   I got a call from him.
[01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:12.180]   And he asked me if I was still interested
[01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:18.820]   in the, specifically in the VP slot.
[01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:19.620]   And I said, "No."
[01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:22.500]   Which I would not have taken
[01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:26.100]   out of the vice president slot.
[01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:31.140]   And he said, "Would I talk to,
[01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:32.980]   be willing to talk to the administration?"
[01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:35.940]   To President Trump, rather.
[01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:38.900]   And at first I said, "No."
[01:23:38.900 --> 01:23:43.860]   And I talked with some of my family members,
[01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:47.380]   including my kids.
[01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:50.820]   And I then sent Kelly Maynes a note saying,
[01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:53.220]   "You know, I'm interested in talking."
[01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:56.820]   And I got a call almost immediately
[01:23:56.820 --> 01:23:57.780]   from President Trump.
[01:23:57.780 --> 01:24:00.260]   I spent about, I don't know,
[01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:01.860]   30 minutes on the phone with him.
[01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:07.060]   And we met the next day in Minneapolis.
[01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:10.980]   And then we met again more recently.
[01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:13.220]   We had continuing talks with him.
[01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:16.180]   And we met again more recently
[01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:17.780]   for a very, very intensive
[01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:19.460]   and long meeting at Mar-a-Lago
[01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:21.060]   with some of his family members.
[01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:23.140]   And during those meetings,
[01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:24.340]   during the first meeting,
[01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:27.140]   we talked about the idea
[01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:28.500]   of having a unity ticket
[01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:31.380]   where I would remain on the ballot,
[01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:33.700]   where we would ally ourselves
[01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:36.740]   on certain critical issues.
[01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:39.380]   But we would be able to continue
[01:24:39.380 --> 01:24:41.700]   to criticize each other on the issues
[01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:44.500]   that we did not align on.
[01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:47.700]   And President Trump was very happy
[01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:48.740]   with that arrangement.
[01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:52.740]   And the issues, the critical issues
[01:24:52.740 --> 01:24:53.780]   on which we agreed,
[01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:56.740]   and I was really stunned to see
[01:24:56.740 --> 01:24:58.100]   the level of his commitment
[01:24:58.100 --> 01:24:59.540]   to those issues was one.
[01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:02.020]   And there were three issues
[01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:03.140]   that really got me
[01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:04.660]   into the presidential campaign.
[01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:08.660]   One was ending the war in Ukraine.
[01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:13.220]   The second issue was ending the censorship.
[01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:15.700]   And the third issue,
[01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:16.980]   and most important to me,
[01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:20.500]   was addressing the childhood
[01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:22.580]   chronic disease epidemic.
[01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:25.860]   And these connected issues
[01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:27.380]   about soil health
[01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:29.300]   and the corruption
[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:31.140]   in our regulatory agencies
[01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:35.220]   by USDA and FDA, NIH, CDC,
[01:25:35.220 --> 01:25:37.300]   and HHS,
[01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:39.060]   which have become sock puppets
[01:25:39.060 --> 01:25:42.180]   for the big pharmaceutical,
[01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:45.060]   big ag, big food processing industries
[01:25:45.060 --> 01:25:46.740]   that they're supposed to be regulating.
[01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:50.340]   He was very, very much aligned
[01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:51.380]   on those issues,
[01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:54.500]   and it gave us essentially a beachhead
[01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:57.860]   in which to construct,
[01:25:57.860 --> 01:25:59.780]   you know, this, an alliance.
[01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:01.380]   Bobby, let me ask you a question.
[01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:02.500]   I just want to go back a little bit
[01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:03.620]   because I just want to make sure
[01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:04.500]   I heard it properly.
[01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:05.700]   When Kelly called you,
[01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:10.020]   was it to be the VP
[01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:11.300]   on the Trump ticket?
[01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:14.340]   And did you, was that asked?
[01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:15.220]   And did you consider it?
[01:26:15.220 --> 01:26:17.220]   And why did you say no to that,
[01:26:17.220 --> 01:26:18.900]   but then said yes to this?
[01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:20.660]   Well, I had no interest
[01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:23.540]   in being a vice president.
[01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:25.220]   If you're a vice president,
[01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:26.180]   it's a, you know,
[01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:27.620]   I grew up in politics,
[01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:29.220]   and vice president is the worst job
[01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:29.940]   in Washington.
[01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:32.340]   You have no budget.
[01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:34.340]   You have no staff except what,
[01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:35.780]   your budget actually all comes
[01:26:35.780 --> 01:26:36.660]   through the White House.
[01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:39.700]   So if the, if you do something
[01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:41.860]   that offends the president,
[01:26:41.860 --> 01:26:43.620]   he can literally, you know,
[01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:44.820]   he can take away your plane.
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:47.220]   He can take away your staff.
[01:26:47.220 --> 01:26:49.540]   And he can, the only thing
[01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:51.780]   you really have is the Naval Observatory,
[01:26:51.780 --> 01:26:54.500]   which is the official residence
[01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:55.620]   of the vice president.
[01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:56.900]   And he can essentially put you
[01:26:56.900 --> 01:26:57.860]   under house arrest.
[01:26:57.860 --> 01:26:59.940]   And, you know, I have
[01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:01.940]   very strong views on issues.
[01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:03.940]   And I, you know, I felt like
[01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:04.900]   if I took that job,
[01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:06.260]   I'd be on house arrest
[01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:07.460]   probably on day three.
[01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:13.220]   So I, you know, I, I was not,
[01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:14.660]   I was never interested in that.
[01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:15.540]   - Reid had to run,
[01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:16.420]   but let's just thank him
[01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:17.860]   for appearing on the pod.
[01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:19.780]   And I thought it was a great conversation.
[01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:21.220]   - Yeah, thanks Reid.
[01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:23.460]   - But I thought he approached it
[01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:24.740]   in good faith and kudos to him
[01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:26.660]   for stepping into the lion's den.
[01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:27.300]   So he was great.
[01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:27.940]   - Yeah.
[01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:29.700]   - Sorry, Bobby, keep going.
[01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:31.380]   - So Bobby, let me ask you a question.
[01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:35.300]   You are reportedly a never Trumper.
[01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:38.500]   You, there's massive fallout.
[01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:40.500]   You cited personally for you
[01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:42.100]   as a resident of Malibu,
[01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:44.820]   the extremely talented woman
[01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:45.860]   you're married to.
[01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:48.100]   Based on everything I can tell,
[01:27:48.100 --> 01:27:49.300]   maybe not a fan of Trump.
[01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:50.340]   So this is maybe causing
[01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:52.820]   some domestic and some
[01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:54.180]   local town issues for you.
[01:27:54.180 --> 01:27:55.380]   Tell me about your journey
[01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:56.740]   from a never Trumper,
[01:27:56.740 --> 01:27:57.700]   all your friends are,
[01:27:57.700 --> 01:27:58.900]   I think never Trumpers
[01:27:58.900 --> 01:28:00.660]   to now joining with Trump.
[01:28:00.660 --> 01:28:02.740]   That's gotta be a hard decision, no?
[01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:05.860]   - Yeah, it was a very hard decision.
[01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:07.300]   But you know, I, I would,
[01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:08.580]   my whole kind of journey
[01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:12.980]   was over the past 17 months
[01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:15.060]   was, was just,
[01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:16.820]   it was kind of a series of,
[01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:21.620]   of very, very difficult
[01:28:23.380 --> 01:28:25.140]   transitions, you know,
[01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:26.660]   away from the Democratic Party.
[01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:27.940]   The Democratic Party was,
[01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:30.660]   you know, the party,
[01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:33.380]   my family is one of the central
[01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:35.220]   pillars of the Democratic Party.
[01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:36.980]   My family has been
[01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:39.380]   in the Democratic Party since 1848,
[01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:41.460]   since my great-grandparents came over.
[01:28:41.460 --> 01:28:44.580]   And my great-grandfather,
[01:28:44.580 --> 01:28:45.860]   Honey Fitz was the first
[01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:47.540]   Irish Catholic mayor of Boston.
[01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:51.220]   His contemporary, Patrick Joseph Kennedy,
[01:28:51.220 --> 01:28:52.340]   was a state senator
[01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:54.340]   and political boss in Massachusetts.
[01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:57.060]   My grandfather, Joseph Kennedy,
[01:28:57.060 --> 01:28:59.380]   was, you know, FDR's treasurer.
[01:28:59.380 --> 01:29:02.660]   He was the first head of the SEC.
[01:29:02.660 --> 01:29:03.860]   He was the ambassador
[01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:07.460]   to the court of St. James,
[01:29:07.460 --> 01:29:08.900]   deeply, deeply immersed
[01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:11.380]   in Democratic Party politics.
[01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:13.860]   All of my uncles, Joe Kennedy,
[01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:17.140]   who was a delegate to the 1940 convention,
[01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:18.980]   who spoke there,
[01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:20.100]   who was a featured speaker
[01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:21.700]   and then was killed in World War II.
[01:29:21.700 --> 01:29:23.780]   My uncle, John Kennedy,
[01:29:23.780 --> 01:29:25.620]   was the first Irish Catholic
[01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:29.940]   president of the United States.
[01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:33.380]   My other uncle, Ted Kennedy,
[01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:34.740]   who was one of the longest,
[01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:36.020]   I think the second or third
[01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:37.140]   longest serving member
[01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:38.980]   of the United States Senate.
[01:29:38.980 --> 01:29:42.420]   His name on more bills
[01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:43.460]   than any other senator
[01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:44.740]   in the United States of history.
[01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:46.820]   And then, of course,
[01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:48.740]   my father, who was attorney general
[01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:51.300]   and a sort of walk away
[01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:54.420]   from that party was,
[01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:57.060]   you know, I guess it was
[01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:58.900]   very, very difficult for me.
[01:29:58.900 --> 01:30:00.020]   And I was actually
[01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:01.860]   the last person in my campaign
[01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:04.900]   to see that, to understand
[01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:06.020]   the necessity of that,
[01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:07.380]   that the Democratic Party
[01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:08.740]   was not going to allow me
[01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:12.420]   to compete fairly,
[01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:13.460]   that they, you know,
[01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:15.780]   they had rigged the system against us
[01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:17.300]   in ways that were really
[01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:19.140]   quite extraordinary.
[01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:20.420]   They had just walked away
[01:30:20.420 --> 01:30:21.380]   from democracy.
[01:30:21.380 --> 01:30:23.140]   They were cancelling primaries.
[01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:26.580]   They had chosen their candidate
[01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:27.380]   and it was going to be
[01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:30.020]   President Biden and I was
[01:30:30.020 --> 01:30:31.380]   really a nuisance to them.
[01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:34.100]   And so my voice was not
[01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:35.780]   allowed out there.
[01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:40.340]   And so that was difficult.
[01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:44.980]   And then, and then leaving,
[01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:46.180]   you know, I declared
[01:30:46.180 --> 01:30:47.540]   independence in October
[01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:50.900]   and, and joining Trump,
[01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:52.660]   President Trump was,
[01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:55.940]   I burned a lot of bridges.
[01:30:55.940 --> 01:30:57.060]   I burned my boats.
[01:30:57.060 --> 01:30:58.100]   Let me put it that way.
[01:30:58.100 --> 01:31:00.580]   >>Clearly, clearly is definitely
[01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:03.060]   a challenging thing to go from
[01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:05.700]   your family being the bedrock
[01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:06.900]   of the Democratic Party
[01:31:06.900 --> 01:31:09.140]   and Trump being, you know,
[01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:10.820]   obviously seen as an existential risk
[01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:12.420]   by the Democratic Party.
[01:31:13.540 --> 01:31:16.340]   So what, what should Americans
[01:31:16.340 --> 01:31:19.620]   know about the state of politics
[01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:21.460]   and fairness in America
[01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:22.580]   based on what you've learned?
[01:31:22.580 --> 01:31:23.700]   What, what, what do you want
[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:25.300]   the American people to know
[01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:26.500]   about the process
[01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:27.620]   of selecting a president?
[01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:29.700]   >>Well, and, you know,
[01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:31.300]   I do want to say that I feel
[01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:34.180]   like I didn't really
[01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:35.220]   leave the Democratic Party.
[01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:37.460]   The Democratic Party left me
[01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:38.420]   and left the,
[01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:41.300]   and left the ruins of
[01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:45.620]   the, the infrastructure
[01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:48.340]   that I think my uncle and father had
[01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:49.940]   that had made them Democrats.
[01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:52.260]   If you went on a list
[01:31:52.260 --> 01:31:53.540]   of all of the priorities
[01:31:53.540 --> 01:31:54.580]   that Robert Kennedy,
[01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:55.940]   that John Kennedy had,
[01:31:55.940 --> 01:31:58.420]   I would check every box.
[01:31:58.420 --> 01:32:00.500]   You know, they were anti-war.
[01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:02.100]   They were anti-censorship.
[01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:04.820]   They were, they were against
[01:32:04.820 --> 01:32:06.500]   the corporate control of,
[01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:07.860]   of our country.
[01:32:07.860 --> 01:32:10.900]   The, this, this corrupt merger
[01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:12.180]   of state and corporate power
[01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:14.340]   that now has emerged
[01:32:14.340 --> 01:32:16.180]   as a dominant governing model
[01:32:16.180 --> 01:32:16.980]   in our country.
[01:32:16.980 --> 01:32:19.780]   The Democratic Party
[01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:21.380]   has changed demographically.
[01:32:21.380 --> 01:32:24.340]   When I, I grew up
[01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:25.540]   in a Democratic Party
[01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:26.420]   that was the party
[01:32:26.420 --> 01:32:28.260]   of the working class in our country,
[01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:32.340]   that was party of small businesses,
[01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:34.660]   that was the party of the poor.
[01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:37.460]   In the last election,
[01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:40.660]   President Biden got roughly half
[01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:42.740]   of the country voting for him.
[01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:46.900]   But that half controlled 70% of, of GDP.
[01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:50.260]   And President Trump got about
[01:32:50.260 --> 01:32:52.340]   half the country voting for him.
[01:32:52.340 --> 01:32:54.100]   And that half represents
[01:32:54.100 --> 01:32:55.860]   about 30% of GDP.
[01:32:55.860 --> 01:32:59.700]   So we've had this inversion
[01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:02.340]   where the Democratic Party
[01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:04.340]   has become the party of wealth,
[01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:05.380]   of elites.
[01:33:05.380 --> 01:33:09.860]   And I would say very insular elites.
[01:33:10.900 --> 01:33:13.780]   And the, and the Republican Party
[01:33:13.780 --> 01:33:15.220]   is now the party of the poor,
[01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:16.420]   the working class.
[01:33:16.420 --> 01:33:18.580]   And it's been, you know,
[01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:19.700]   for me to watch that,
[01:33:19.700 --> 01:33:21.460]   I've been on the front lines
[01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:23.780]   of watching it.
[01:33:23.780 --> 01:33:27.540]   And, you know, the values
[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:29.620]   that held the Democratic Party together
[01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:30.660]   are no longer there.
[01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:32.740]   It's held together by
[01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:36.260]   a sense of tribalism,
[01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:37.060]   a sense of,
[01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:38.820]   and a great, great sense
[01:33:38.820 --> 01:33:39.860]   of what I would say
[01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:42.980]   orchestrated fear of Donald Trump.
[01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:44.180]   It's the only value
[01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:45.460]   that really dominates
[01:33:45.460 --> 01:33:46.500]   any discussion.
[01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:49.380]   If I talk about censorship
[01:33:49.380 --> 01:33:50.260]   to a Democrat,
[01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:52.180]   they'll say, yes,
[01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:53.780]   but Donald Trump
[01:33:53.780 --> 01:33:55.140]   is going to become a dictator.
[01:33:55.140 --> 01:33:57.940]   If you talk about children's health,
[01:33:57.940 --> 01:33:59.700]   they'll say, nevermind that.
[01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:01.060]   Donald Trump is the only thing
[01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:02.100]   we can worry about.
[01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:02.980]   If you talk about,
[01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:05.380]   you know, about the history
[01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:06.740]   of the Democratic Party's
[01:34:06.740 --> 01:34:07.780]   opposition to war,
[01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:10.580]   they'll say, forget all that.
[01:34:10.580 --> 01:34:12.420]   The only thing we can focus on
[01:34:12.420 --> 01:34:13.700]   is Donald Trump.
[01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:17.140]   And that's a very, very
[01:34:17.140 --> 01:34:18.100]   dismaying,
[01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:18.820]   and I would say,
[01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:21.380]   dangerous form of
[01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:23.380]   orchestrated tribalism.
[01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:25.460]   And one of the other features
[01:34:25.460 --> 01:34:26.500]   of the Democratic Party
[01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:29.380]   is this need to control
[01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:33.300]   this mistrust of the plebiscite,
[01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:34.900]   mistrust of the demos.
[01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:36.100]   You know, demos is a
[01:34:36.100 --> 01:34:38.740]   Greek word for people.
[01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:39.780]   And the Democratic Party
[01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:40.740]   doesn't trust the people.
[01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:41.540]   That's why they have to
[01:34:41.540 --> 01:34:42.660]   get rid of elections.
[01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:43.460]   That's why they had to
[01:34:43.460 --> 01:34:44.340]   get me off the ballot.
[01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:48.260]   I did something everybody said,
[01:34:48.260 --> 01:34:49.460]   all the pundits said
[01:34:49.460 --> 01:34:50.340]   could never be done.
[01:34:50.340 --> 01:34:51.940]   So I got on the ballot
[01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:52.660]   in every state.
[01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:53.940]   I got a million people
[01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:56.340]   that signed their signatures
[01:34:56.340 --> 01:34:57.540]   petitioning me on the ballot.
[01:34:57.540 --> 01:35:00.500]   And the Democratic Party's strategy,
[01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:01.540]   rather than to use
[01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:03.220]   the $3 billion it had,
[01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:05.700]   amplify a message
[01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:06.820]   and inspire people
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:08.340]   and talk about a vision
[01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:10.340]   and the virtues of its candidates.
[01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:12.740]   Instead, use that money
[01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:14.660]   to try to get me off the ballot,
[01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:17.300]   to get Cornel West,
[01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:19.060]   to get Jill Stein,
[01:35:19.060 --> 01:35:20.820]   to use the courts,
[01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:23.620]   to use the enforcement agencies,
[01:35:23.620 --> 01:35:24.900]   including the Secret Service,
[01:35:24.900 --> 01:35:26.340]   the CIA, the FBI,
[01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:29.140]   to try to rig the election.
[01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:33.460]   And it ultimately comes down
[01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:35.140]   to this mistrust of the people,
[01:35:35.140 --> 01:35:37.620]   which we're seeing now
[01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:38.260]   all over.
[01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:39.380]   We're seeing the kind of
[01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:41.060]   two big forces emerge.
[01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:42.500]   One is a populist force,
[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:45.700]   and the other is a force of control,
[01:35:45.700 --> 01:35:46.820]   of ironclad control.
[01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:48.660]   We saw Europe has already fallen.
[01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:51.860]   You know, you saw the arrest
[01:35:51.860 --> 01:35:54.260]   of Pavel Durov last week,
[01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:55.780]   which was extraordinary.
[01:35:55.780 --> 01:35:57.940]   You know, the arrest of
[01:35:57.940 --> 01:36:01.780]   the guy who founded Telegram,
[01:36:01.780 --> 01:36:05.460]   because he was hosting
[01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:07.780]   political dissent.
[01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:11.540]   And, you know, the European Commission
[01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:14.740]   is already openly censoring content,
[01:36:14.740 --> 01:36:16.900]   so they did not need to arrest him.
[01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:19.300]   They can take off whatever they want.
[01:36:19.300 --> 01:36:23.300]   But they went through the trouble
[01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:24.100]   of actually,
[01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:27.460]   and probably with U.S. encouragement,
[01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:28.580]   you know, catching him
[01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:29.780]   when he happened to land
[01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:31.620]   for a refueling stop in France.
[01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:34.420]   France has this extraordinary tradition
[01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:35.540]   of free speech
[01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:36.580]   that, you know, began
[01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:37.940]   with the French Revolution.
[01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:39.620]   And then again, in the 1880s,
[01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:41.540]   they passed all these incredible laws.
[01:36:41.540 --> 01:36:44.180]   Their commitment to free speech
[01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:45.540]   is as robust as that
[01:36:45.540 --> 01:36:46.740]   in the United States.
[01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:49.060]   And yet now, you know,
[01:36:49.060 --> 01:36:51.460]   and then two weeks before that,
[01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:54.820]   you had this crazy European Commissioner,
[01:36:54.820 --> 01:36:56.500]   Thierry Breton,
[01:36:56.500 --> 01:37:01.220]   saying that ordering Elon Musk
[01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:02.820]   to not interview Donald Trump,
[01:37:03.620 --> 01:37:05.300]   a former President of the United States,
[01:37:05.300 --> 01:37:09.460]   the nominee of one of the two
[01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:10.900]   major political parties,
[01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:12.580]   and the world is not allowed
[01:37:12.580 --> 01:37:13.860]   to hear his point of view.
[01:37:13.860 --> 01:37:14.340]   >> Yeah.
[01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:15.780]   >> It's extraordinary.
[01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:17.700]   That is what's coming to this country.
[01:37:17.700 --> 01:37:18.500]   And you can already,
[01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:19.780]   and a Democratic Party
[01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:23.140]   is that party of control,
[01:37:23.140 --> 01:37:23.940]   and it's the party
[01:37:23.940 --> 01:37:25.380]   of not trusting the people.
[01:37:25.380 --> 01:37:28.260]   >> Bobby, let's talk about something then.
[01:37:28.260 --> 01:37:30.100]   Let's assume that this election
[01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:33.540]   goes in the direction of now
[01:37:33.540 --> 01:37:34.660]   your preferred direction,
[01:37:34.660 --> 01:37:36.420]   which is Donald Trump wins.
[01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:39.620]   What role would you play?
[01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:42.100]   And what is your agenda?
[01:37:42.100 --> 01:37:43.540]   What is it that you want to accomplish?
[01:37:43.540 --> 01:37:44.340]   And explain,
[01:37:44.340 --> 01:37:46.580]   make America healthy again
[01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:47.660]   in that context, maybe.
[01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:51.700]   >> I mean, it's the three issues,
[01:37:51.700 --> 01:37:52.980]   ending censorship,
[01:37:52.980 --> 01:37:54.420]   and that's pretty easy to do.
[01:37:54.420 --> 01:37:56.580]   You can do it with a series
[01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:57.700]   of executive orders,
[01:37:57.700 --> 01:37:59.380]   ending the Ukraine war,
[01:37:59.380 --> 01:38:01.220]   which is complex,
[01:38:01.220 --> 01:38:02.580]   but I think can be done
[01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:03.620]   very, very quickly.
[01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:07.380]   And then the food issue.
[01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:09.300]   Now, it's the food,
[01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:10.180]   it's medicines,
[01:38:10.180 --> 01:38:10.980]   it's corruption
[01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:12.500]   in the regulatory agencies.
[01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:14.020]   >> But would you be a secretary
[01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:15.300]   in that administration?
[01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:17.060]   Would you be a special advisor?
[01:38:17.060 --> 01:38:23.380]   >> There is no deal
[01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:24.420]   in terms of me
[01:38:24.420 --> 01:38:25.700]   getting a particular post.
[01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:28.660]   So there's just an understanding
[01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:30.420]   that there would be
[01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:31.940]   some kind of co-governance.
[01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:34.420]   And the Trump people
[01:38:34.420 --> 01:38:36.180]   have already demonstrated
[01:38:36.180 --> 01:38:37.300]   their good faith
[01:38:37.300 --> 01:38:40.660]   by inviting me to be
[01:38:40.660 --> 01:38:41.780]   on the transition team
[01:38:41.780 --> 01:38:44.340]   as one of the co-chairs.
[01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:45.380]   And they've done something
[01:38:45.380 --> 01:38:46.260]   really wonderful,
[01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:50.420]   which is to bring Tulsi Gabbard in,
[01:38:50.420 --> 01:38:53.060]   who shares a lot of my views
[01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:53.700]   on this issue
[01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:54.980]   as the other co-chair.
[01:38:54.980 --> 01:38:57.700]   And I think that's a signal
[01:38:57.700 --> 01:38:58.740]   that they're sending
[01:38:58.740 --> 01:39:00.180]   that they are sincere
[01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:04.180]   about making a commitment
[01:39:04.180 --> 01:39:04.900]   to these issues.
[01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:07.780]   >> What should parents know
[01:39:07.780 --> 01:39:09.620]   about your thoughts
[01:39:09.620 --> 01:39:11.620]   on how to raise kids
[01:39:11.620 --> 01:39:12.500]   in a healthy way,
[01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:13.940]   make America healthy again?
[01:39:13.940 --> 01:39:15.060]   Are there any vaccines
[01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:15.540]   that you would say
[01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:17.060]   you would advise parents
[01:39:17.060 --> 01:39:18.100]   to take for their kids?
[01:39:18.100 --> 01:39:19.700]   And how should they look at
[01:39:19.700 --> 01:39:21.860]   the industrial food complex?
[01:39:21.860 --> 01:39:24.020]   If you were sitting with us
[01:39:24.020 --> 01:39:27.460]   as parents just having lunch,
[01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:28.740]   what would you tell us
[01:39:28.740 --> 01:39:29.940]   we should do with our own kids?
[01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:31.780]   >> I mean, the big problem is
[01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:32.740]   you can't really trust
[01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:34.180]   the government to tell you the truth.
[01:39:34.180 --> 01:39:37.300]   The agencies are all compromised.
[01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:40.340]   They all have very, very bad conflicts.
[01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:41.940]   Almost all the people, for example,
[01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:48.580]   on the food recommendation committees
[01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:49.620]   at FDA
[01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:52.100]   are people who are
[01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:54.100]   part of the food industry.
[01:39:54.100 --> 01:39:55.220]   And the same is true
[01:39:55.220 --> 01:39:58.660]   on the pharmaceutical side.
[01:39:58.660 --> 01:40:01.300]   The people who are making decisions
[01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:02.580]   about what's good for you
[01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:04.900]   are actually people
[01:40:04.900 --> 01:40:07.140]   who are making huge amounts of profit
[01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:08.580]   on those recommendations.
[01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:09.940]   And so you can't really trust
[01:40:09.940 --> 01:40:11.140]   that the recommendations
[01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:14.740]   are in your best interest.
[01:40:14.740 --> 01:40:17.540]   And what we know is that
[01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:21.460]   there is no more profitable,
[01:40:21.460 --> 01:40:24.020]   there's no bigger profit center
[01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:26.420]   or industry in this country
[01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:27.460]   than a sick child.
[01:40:27.460 --> 01:40:31.780]   And a sick child is a lifetime customer,
[01:40:31.780 --> 01:40:33.460]   a lifetime consumer
[01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:35.300]   of very, very expensive products.
[01:40:35.300 --> 01:40:37.860]   And you have this alliance
[01:40:37.860 --> 01:40:39.380]   between the food industry
[01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:40.740]   and the pharmaceutical industry
[01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:42.980]   to keep our children sick,
[01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:43.860]   get them addicted.
[01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:46.100]   You know, in the '70s and '80s,
[01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:52.100]   the tobacco industry was under attack.
[01:40:52.100 --> 01:40:54.100]   And the two biggest tobacco companies
[01:40:55.060 --> 01:40:55.860]   went out
[01:40:55.860 --> 01:40:59.220]   and bought all the big food companies.
[01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:01.380]   - RJ Artubisco, you're referring to.
[01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:03.060]   - Yeah, and Kraft.
[01:41:03.060 --> 01:41:03.540]   And, you know,
[01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:06.660]   you had Philip Morris by Kraft.
[01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:09.700]   And they took a lot of the scientists
[01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:11.140]   from the tobacco industry
[01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:12.020]   who were experts
[01:41:12.020 --> 01:41:13.460]   on making products addictive.
[01:41:13.460 --> 01:41:15.540]   And they put them to work
[01:41:15.540 --> 01:41:16.820]   on making food addictive,
[01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:18.340]   on making ultra-processed.
[01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:19.700]   So adding ingredients
[01:41:19.700 --> 01:41:23.060]   that make food
[01:41:23.540 --> 01:41:27.620]   that destroy the satiability of food,
[01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:29.140]   so that food doesn't fill you up,
[01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:30.660]   so you're always craving more.
[01:41:30.660 --> 01:41:33.620]   And those products,
[01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:35.300]   many of them are products,
[01:41:35.300 --> 01:41:35.860]   you know, we have
[01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:38.980]   almost a thousand chemicals in our foods
[01:41:38.980 --> 01:41:40.180]   that are banned in Europe
[01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:41.540]   and banned in other countries.
[01:41:41.540 --> 01:41:47.620]   And those products
[01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:51.700]   are products that have been introduced
[01:41:52.820 --> 01:41:53.620]   by chemists
[01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:56.340]   that did not exist before
[01:41:56.340 --> 01:41:58.500]   and the body does not handle them well.
[01:41:58.500 --> 01:41:59.220]   And, you know,
[01:41:59.220 --> 01:42:00.900]   we're seeing this explosion
[01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:01.860]   in chronic disease.
[01:42:01.860 --> 01:42:04.660]   When my uncle was president,
[01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:06.900]   6% of Americans had chronic disease.
[01:42:06.900 --> 01:42:08.580]   You know what the budget was
[01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:10.020]   for chronic disease
[01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:11.940]   when my uncle was president?
[01:42:11.940 --> 01:42:12.740]   Zero.
[01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:14.180]   There wasn't any drugs for it.
[01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:17.860]   There was no expenditures
[01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:18.740]   on chronic disease.
[01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:21.860]   Today, it's $4.3 trillion.
[01:42:21.860 --> 01:42:23.620]   It's five times our military budget.
[01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:26.100]   And the people who are making money
[01:42:26.100 --> 01:42:29.300]   are the pharmaceutical companies,
[01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:31.380]   the insurance companies,
[01:42:31.380 --> 01:42:32.980]   which actually you would think
[01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:33.940]   insurance companies
[01:42:33.940 --> 01:42:35.140]   would want people to be,
[01:42:35.140 --> 01:42:36.820]   well, they actually make more money
[01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:37.460]   if they're sick.
[01:42:37.460 --> 01:42:42.020]   The hospital is the medical cartel.
[01:42:42.020 --> 01:42:44.500]   The people we trust
[01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:45.780]   and make advice to us
[01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:46.660]   about our health
[01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:48.580]   are actually compromised.
[01:42:48.580 --> 01:42:49.860]   And that's the difficult part.
[01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:51.540]   You've got to unravel
[01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:52.500]   that corporate capture.
[01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:54.100]   Freeberg, when you hear this,
[01:42:54.100 --> 01:42:55.140]   some people might say
[01:42:55.140 --> 01:42:57.780]   this sounds like a grand conspiracy theory.
[01:42:57.780 --> 01:43:00.500]   But much of it rings true
[01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:02.340]   to I think many of us who are parents
[01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:04.260]   watching kids, you know,
[01:43:04.260 --> 01:43:06.020]   and watching the prevalence of obesity,
[01:43:06.020 --> 01:43:08.180]   watching pharmaceutical drugs
[01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:09.380]   to counter that
[01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:10.660]   and all the money that's made from it.
[01:43:10.660 --> 01:43:12.020]   And then seeing when people eat clean
[01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:13.540]   and they're healthy,
[01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:15.780]   maybe there's less there.
[01:43:15.780 --> 01:43:16.740]   So Freeberg,
[01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:20.180]   when you hear Bobby's position here
[01:43:20.180 --> 01:43:21.300]   as a scientist
[01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:23.140]   who sold a company to Monsanto,
[01:43:23.140 --> 01:43:23.940]   climate.com
[01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:26.260]   and who's working on food today,
[01:43:26.260 --> 01:43:28.260]   what rings true about what Bobby's saying?
[01:43:28.260 --> 01:43:29.780]   And what do you disagree with,
[01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:30.260]   if anything?
[01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:31.620]   Yeah, there are aspects
[01:43:31.620 --> 01:43:32.580]   of industrialized food
[01:43:32.580 --> 01:43:33.380]   and processed food
[01:43:33.380 --> 01:43:34.580]   that are bad for people.
[01:43:34.580 --> 01:43:36.260]   And I do agree should be,
[01:43:36.260 --> 01:43:38.900]   it should be changed.
[01:43:38.900 --> 01:43:42.020]   I don't, I know a lot of people
[01:43:42.020 --> 01:43:43.060]   that work at the USDA,
[01:43:43.060 --> 01:43:44.340]   a lot of people that work
[01:43:44.340 --> 01:43:45.940]   in other government organizations
[01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:47.220]   that don't make a lot of money.
[01:43:47.220 --> 01:43:50.180]   They may or may not have worked
[01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:50.900]   at other companies.
[01:43:50.900 --> 01:43:52.740]   But I think that there's no economic
[01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:55.140]   incentive for them to do harm or wrong.
[01:43:55.140 --> 01:43:55.940]   I think that the real,
[01:43:55.940 --> 01:43:57.700]   so I don't think that there's
[01:43:57.700 --> 01:43:59.060]   a constructive design
[01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:01.140]   on doing bad things by any individual.
[01:44:01.140 --> 01:44:02.500]   I think that there is
[01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:04.340]   an unfortunate circumstance
[01:44:04.340 --> 01:44:05.700]   where people eat bad stuff,
[01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:07.780]   stuff that tastes better.
[01:44:07.780 --> 01:44:10.100]   They like it more, it sells better.
[01:44:10.100 --> 01:44:11.300]   And the economic incentive
[01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:12.660]   and capitalism is to make more
[01:44:12.660 --> 01:44:13.940]   of that stuff and sell more of it.
[01:44:13.940 --> 01:44:15.140]   And as a result,
[01:44:15.140 --> 01:44:16.180]   the stuff that people like
[01:44:16.180 --> 01:44:17.460]   that isn't good for them,
[01:44:17.460 --> 01:44:18.100]   they buy more of
[01:44:18.100 --> 01:44:19.220]   and the companies make more money.
[01:44:19.220 --> 01:44:21.060]   And so they continue to invest
[01:44:21.060 --> 01:44:22.420]   in selling more and more of that stuff.
[01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:24.020]   And this goes in most processed foods.
[01:44:24.020 --> 01:44:24.900]   It's terrible.
[01:44:24.900 --> 01:44:25.620]   It's not good.
[01:44:25.620 --> 01:44:26.500]   And so I do agree
[01:44:26.500 --> 01:44:29.460]   that much of this processed food industry
[01:44:29.460 --> 01:44:32.340]   is very adverse to health.
[01:44:32.340 --> 01:44:32.820]   But I don't think
[01:44:32.820 --> 01:44:34.260]   that there's a grand design
[01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:35.700]   by individuals that are malicious
[01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:36.980]   in their intent and trying to do it.
[01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:37.860]   I think that there are people
[01:44:37.860 --> 01:44:39.220]   that are doing their job on,
[01:44:39.220 --> 01:44:40.500]   "Hey, this is what the market wants,
[01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:41.220]   let's give them more."
[01:44:41.220 --> 01:44:41.860]   - In the government, right, yeah.
[01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:42.900]   - I'm talking about the government
[01:44:42.900 --> 01:44:43.700]   and private industry.
[01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:44.980]   - You don't think people
[01:44:44.980 --> 01:44:45.620]   in private industry
[01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:46.740]   are trying to make addicting foods?
[01:44:46.740 --> 01:44:48.180]   - No, no, I think that, yeah,
[01:44:48.180 --> 01:44:48.820]   the point is like,
[01:44:48.820 --> 01:44:49.780]   if people buy more of it,
[01:44:49.780 --> 01:44:50.980]   they're like, "Let's sell more of it."
[01:44:50.980 --> 01:44:51.780]   - Yeah, okay.
[01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:53.540]   - And if that were illegal,
[01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:54.580]   if it was illegal to say,
[01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:55.940]   "Hey, this sort of food product
[01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:56.740]   should not be made."
[01:44:56.740 --> 01:44:59.540]   But look, alcohol fits the bill too, right?
[01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:01.220]   And we keep making alcohol
[01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:02.180]   and sugar fits the bill.
[01:45:02.180 --> 01:45:03.220]   The more sugar...
[01:45:03.220 --> 01:45:04.820]   Coca-Cola did a study years ago
[01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:07.540]   where they kept increasing
[01:45:07.540 --> 01:45:09.300]   the amount of sugar in Coca-Cola
[01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:13.060]   until they maximally got sell-through.
[01:45:13.060 --> 01:45:15.460]   So some kids liked 60 grams of sugar
[01:45:15.460 --> 01:45:16.500]   in 12 ounces of Coke,
[01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:17.940]   some kids like 30,
[01:45:17.940 --> 01:45:20.660]   but the perfect level was at 42 grams.
[01:45:20.660 --> 01:45:22.260]   And so that study was done
[01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:24.180]   by the scientists that worked at Coca-Cola
[01:45:24.180 --> 01:45:25.140]   and then they said,
[01:45:25.140 --> 01:45:27.460]   "That's the product, it'll sell the most."
[01:45:27.460 --> 01:45:29.140]   And that's the incentive inside of that company.
[01:45:29.140 --> 01:45:30.340]   That's how that company operates.
[01:45:30.340 --> 01:45:31.940]   Now, you could ask yourself the question,
[01:45:31.940 --> 01:45:33.380]   "Is that evil? Is that bad?"
[01:45:33.380 --> 01:45:35.700]   We now know that sugar in general is bad.
[01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:36.900]   The executives at Coca-Cola,
[01:45:36.900 --> 01:45:38.100]   at AB InBev and other places
[01:45:38.100 --> 01:45:39.700]   are trying to make alcohol-free,
[01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:40.980]   sugar-free alternatives.
[01:45:40.980 --> 01:45:42.100]   So there's a lot of push
[01:45:42.100 --> 01:45:44.180]   by these people. Unilever has tried to
[01:45:44.180 --> 01:45:46.020]   make a big push towards good food.
[01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:47.060]   Nestle's tried to do the same.
[01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:48.420]   They've all made these stated commitments
[01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:49.620]   to improve the health of the food
[01:45:49.620 --> 01:45:50.420]   that they produce.
[01:45:50.420 --> 01:45:51.940]   But it is quite difficult
[01:45:51.940 --> 01:45:53.300]   to be successful in doing that
[01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:54.900]   and returning money to shareholders.
[01:45:54.900 --> 01:45:56.260]   The shareholders are like, "Where's the money?"
[01:45:56.260 --> 01:45:59.220]   - Oh, I think this is the key point
[01:45:59.220 --> 01:46:00.340]   you're making, Chamath.
[01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:02.340]   I think your clean food effort
[01:46:02.340 --> 01:46:04.420]   and it took me a decade to unravel
[01:46:04.420 --> 01:46:06.340]   me eating everything in sight
[01:46:06.340 --> 01:46:07.540]   and lose the 40 pounds.
[01:46:07.540 --> 01:46:09.060]   But Chamath, when you hear
[01:46:09.060 --> 01:46:11.700]   sort of this back and forth
[01:46:11.700 --> 01:46:13.220]   between Bobby and Friedberg,
[01:46:13.220 --> 01:46:15.940]   what's your take on it in terms of,
[01:46:15.940 --> 01:46:17.620]   and also the European lifestyle
[01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:19.940]   that you live for 10 weeks of the year,
[01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:21.620]   what's your take on what should happen here
[01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:23.380]   and how Bobby can be successful?
[01:46:23.380 --> 01:46:25.700]   - I think what Bobby says rings true
[01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:26.980]   in the way that I live my life
[01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:28.420]   and I just see it demonstrated
[01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:29.300]   on my own body.
[01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:31.060]   You're right, Jason.
[01:46:31.060 --> 01:46:32.420]   You know, my wife's Italian.
[01:46:32.420 --> 01:46:33.860]   She runs an Italian company.
[01:46:33.860 --> 01:46:38.660]   She works Italian and American hours
[01:46:38.660 --> 01:46:39.780]   for 10 months out of the year.
[01:46:39.780 --> 01:46:41.540]   And for those 10 weeks,
[01:46:41.540 --> 01:46:43.140]   we go there and we flip schedule.
[01:46:43.140 --> 01:46:44.020]   But when I'm there,
[01:46:44.020 --> 01:46:46.420]   I'm consuming Italian produce
[01:46:46.420 --> 01:46:47.860]   that isn't packed in plastic.
[01:46:47.860 --> 01:46:49.700]   I go to a local fruit store.
[01:46:49.700 --> 01:46:51.300]   I go to the local fish vendor
[01:46:51.300 --> 01:46:54.740]   and my body changes.
[01:46:54.740 --> 01:46:56.500]   And I know that because
[01:46:56.500 --> 01:46:58.260]   the people that see me when I get back,
[01:46:58.260 --> 01:47:00.180]   they always comment,
[01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:01.300]   "Oh, did you lose weight?"
[01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:02.980]   "Oh, do you look thinner?"
[01:47:02.980 --> 01:47:04.180]   Or this or that.
[01:47:04.180 --> 01:47:05.140]   And what's interesting is
[01:47:05.140 --> 01:47:06.980]   I actually do a body composition
[01:47:06.980 --> 01:47:08.180]   before I leave and after.
[01:47:08.180 --> 01:47:09.940]   I've done this for seven years now.
[01:47:09.940 --> 01:47:11.940]   And I can tell you that
[01:47:11.940 --> 01:47:13.860]   my weight doesn't change that much,
[01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:15.220]   but my body composition
[01:47:15.220 --> 01:47:16.500]   is completely different.
[01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:18.820]   And I don't know what it is
[01:47:18.820 --> 01:47:19.780]   except the things
[01:47:19.780 --> 01:47:20.900]   that I'm putting in my body
[01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:21.620]   that's different.
[01:47:21.620 --> 01:47:22.740]   And so I see it
[01:47:22.740 --> 01:47:24.980]   and I'm running an A/B test every day.
[01:47:24.980 --> 01:47:27.540]   - What's the price of the food, Chamath?
[01:47:27.540 --> 01:47:28.900]   Like, is it more in Italy?
[01:47:28.900 --> 01:47:30.020]   Like, you pay more, do you think?
[01:47:30.020 --> 01:47:31.460]   - Well, I've already commented on this.
[01:47:31.460 --> 01:47:33.860]   - The fishmonger is no joke.
[01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:36.820]   - But there are ways to eat
[01:47:36.820 --> 01:47:38.420]   at a materially lower price
[01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:39.380]   than there is here.
[01:47:39.380 --> 01:47:42.980]   And the access to the ultra-processed food
[01:47:42.980 --> 01:47:44.180]   is different there.
[01:47:44.180 --> 01:47:45.540]   You can't get the stuff.
[01:47:45.540 --> 01:47:48.660]   And when you do find that stuff,
[01:47:48.660 --> 01:47:51.300]   it doesn't have the same, you know,
[01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:53.380]   glycemic and metabolic load on your body.
[01:47:53.380 --> 01:47:55.140]   - I'm curious what you think of, you know,
[01:47:55.140 --> 01:47:57.380]   Ozempic and this category of drugs
[01:47:57.380 --> 01:47:59.620]   breaking the cycle.
[01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:01.300]   I think you've been against them
[01:48:01.300 --> 01:48:04.020]   or they certainly helped me
[01:48:04.020 --> 01:48:05.060]   with half of my weight loss.
[01:48:05.060 --> 01:48:06.660]   I know Sax had a good experience as well
[01:48:06.660 --> 01:48:08.100]   and he's been public about it.
[01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:09.140]   What are your thoughts on that?
[01:48:09.140 --> 01:48:10.420]   Because it does seem,
[01:48:10.420 --> 01:48:12.180]   when people take the GLPs,
[01:48:12.180 --> 01:48:13.220]   which exist in your body,
[01:48:13.220 --> 01:48:15.860]   that they, I'm sure there's more research
[01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:16.580]   that needs to be done,
[01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:18.500]   they do break this habit.
[01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:19.780]   I know anecdotally with me,
[01:48:19.780 --> 01:48:22.340]   I don't crave the foods I craved previously.
[01:48:22.340 --> 01:48:24.420]   And it did kind of rewire my brain
[01:48:24.420 --> 01:48:25.940]   in how I look at food,
[01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:27.460]   even when I'm off of it.
[01:48:27.460 --> 01:48:28.740]   So your thoughts on those
[01:48:28.740 --> 01:48:30.420]   and those potentially being a way
[01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:31.220]   to break the cycle?
[01:48:31.220 --> 01:48:35.060]   - Yeah, so, and this goes to David's point
[01:48:35.060 --> 01:48:36.500]   that, you know, this is,
[01:48:36.500 --> 01:48:37.700]   we need to have cheap food.
[01:48:38.660 --> 01:48:41.620]   And that that is kind of an outcome
[01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:44.660]   that is an admirable or virtuous outcome.
[01:48:44.660 --> 01:48:47.300]   The problem is that food isn't cheap.
[01:48:47.300 --> 01:48:49.620]   It's cheap on the shelf,
[01:48:49.620 --> 01:48:52.020]   but it imposes costs on the rest of us
[01:48:52.020 --> 01:48:54.660]   that were the externalities
[01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:55.860]   that we're paying elsewhere.
[01:48:55.860 --> 01:48:57.460]   So when I was a kid,
[01:48:57.460 --> 01:49:00.420]   the typical pediatrician
[01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:03.380]   would see one case of juvenile diabetes
[01:49:03.380 --> 01:49:04.340]   in its lifetime.
[01:49:04.340 --> 01:49:07.460]   Over a 40 or 50 year career,
[01:49:07.460 --> 01:49:09.940]   one case, it was essentially
[01:49:09.940 --> 01:49:11.220]   non-existent disease.
[01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:14.260]   Today, one out of every three children
[01:49:14.260 --> 01:49:16.180]   who walks through his office door
[01:49:16.180 --> 01:49:18.900]   is diabetic or pre-diabetic.
[01:49:18.900 --> 01:49:21.460]   When I was a kid,
[01:49:21.460 --> 01:49:23.620]   the autism rates were between
[01:49:23.620 --> 01:49:28.020]   one in 1,500 to one in 10,000 Americans.
[01:49:28.020 --> 01:49:30.340]   And that is still true in my generation,
[01:49:30.340 --> 01:49:31.300]   70 year old man.
[01:49:31.300 --> 01:49:33.620]   And my kid's generation,
[01:49:33.620 --> 01:49:34.660]   according to CDC,
[01:49:34.660 --> 01:49:36.660]   it's one out of every 34 kids
[01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:39.060]   some states like California,
[01:49:39.060 --> 01:49:40.660]   it's one out of every 22.
[01:49:40.660 --> 01:49:45.460]   77% of Americans are now,
[01:49:45.460 --> 01:49:47.620]   or 74% adults are obese.
[01:49:47.620 --> 01:49:50.180]   Half our kids, obesity,
[01:49:50.180 --> 01:49:53.540]   when, you know, 100 years ago,
[01:49:53.540 --> 01:49:55.620]   if you were obese,
[01:49:55.620 --> 01:49:57.700]   you could get a job in the circus.
[01:49:57.700 --> 01:49:58.740]   It was so unusual.
[01:49:58.740 --> 01:50:01.380]   So we're now,
[01:50:01.380 --> 01:50:03.220]   and who's making profit now?
[01:50:03.220 --> 01:50:04.100]   Ozempic.
[01:50:04.100 --> 01:50:05.540]   Ozempic's not going to,
[01:50:05.540 --> 01:50:08.260]   you can, obesity is absolutely,
[01:50:08.260 --> 01:50:09.940]   and diabetes are absolutely
[01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:11.460]   treatable by good food.
[01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:13.860]   That's the cause.
[01:50:13.860 --> 01:50:17.300]   Now, Ozempic is a good profit center
[01:50:17.300 --> 01:50:21.460]   for pharma.
[01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:23.300]   There's a bill now,
[01:50:23.300 --> 01:50:25.300]   which has been paid for by the company
[01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:25.860]   that makes it,
[01:50:25.860 --> 01:50:27.860]   which is the biggest company in Europe,
[01:50:27.860 --> 01:50:28.820]   Novo Nordisk.
[01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:31.540]   That, in Denmark,
[01:50:31.540 --> 01:50:32.660]   where that company is,
[01:50:32.660 --> 01:50:34.020]   they do not recommend it.
[01:50:34.580 --> 01:50:40.260]   It's, the treatment of diabetes,
[01:50:40.260 --> 01:50:41.300]   the standard of care,
[01:50:41.300 --> 01:50:44.100]   is diet and exercise.
[01:50:44.100 --> 01:50:47.860]   But that company's entire value
[01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:49.540]   is based upon the projections
[01:50:49.540 --> 01:50:50.420]   of what it's going to sell
[01:50:50.420 --> 01:50:51.460]   to the United States.
[01:50:51.460 --> 01:50:53.220]   And it has,
[01:50:53.220 --> 01:50:54.820]   and that company is pouring
[01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:56.340]   tens of millions of dollars
[01:50:56.340 --> 01:50:58.980]   into lobbying to pass this bill
[01:50:58.980 --> 01:51:00.980]   that will make Medicare pay for it
[01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:04.020]   for every American who's obese.
[01:51:04.020 --> 01:51:05.780]   That could be 74% of people
[01:51:05.780 --> 01:51:06.660]   are now eligible.
[01:51:06.660 --> 01:51:09.460]   I think it's $1,500 a week.
[01:51:09.460 --> 01:51:12.660]   The cost of that will be $3 trillion a year.
[01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:15.300]   If you took $3 trillion a year,
[01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:16.500]   a tiny fraction of that,
[01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:18.180]   you could buy organic food
[01:51:18.180 --> 01:51:19.220]   three meals a day
[01:51:19.220 --> 01:51:20.660]   for every human being
[01:51:20.660 --> 01:51:21.700]   in the United States.
[01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:23.540]   So wouldn't that be a better
[01:51:23.540 --> 01:51:26.020]   expenditure of our money?
[01:51:26.020 --> 01:51:27.460]   And, you know,
[01:51:27.460 --> 01:51:30.660]   what I would say is the,
[01:51:30.660 --> 01:51:32.340]   you know, the food producers,
[01:51:32.340 --> 01:51:33.620]   it's not a conspiracy,
[01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:35.860]   it's just people following
[01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:36.900]   perverse incentives.
[01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:39.060]   And there are conspiracies.
[01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:41.780]   I mean, when I sued Monsanto,
[01:51:41.780 --> 01:51:43.460]   we got emails that showed
[01:51:43.460 --> 01:51:45.460]   that the head of the pesticide division,
[01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:49.220]   Jess Roland, for a decade at EPA
[01:51:49.220 --> 01:51:51.620]   was secretly working for Monsanto
[01:51:51.620 --> 01:51:52.500]   the entire time,
[01:51:52.500 --> 01:51:54.580]   sabotaging studies,
[01:51:54.580 --> 01:51:55.940]   creating false science,
[01:51:55.940 --> 01:51:59.540]   which hide the carcinogenic nature
[01:51:59.540 --> 01:52:00.340]   of Roundup.
[01:52:00.340 --> 01:52:02.820]   So there are those kinds of instances
[01:52:02.820 --> 01:52:04.100]   throughout the federal government,
[01:52:04.100 --> 01:52:06.020]   but mainly it's just perverse incentives.
[01:52:06.020 --> 01:52:09.380]   Almost all, almost close to 100%
[01:52:09.380 --> 01:52:13.940]   of our food agricultural subsidies
[01:52:13.940 --> 01:52:15.220]   go to processed food.
[01:52:15.220 --> 01:52:18.020]   I mean, go to commodity agriculture,
[01:52:18.020 --> 01:52:20.180]   which is the feedstock for processed food.
[01:52:20.180 --> 01:52:22.500]   So, and then if you look at--
[01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:24.340]   - Mostly for meat.
[01:52:24.340 --> 01:52:28.020]   - If the industry controls
[01:52:28.020 --> 01:52:30.100]   through lobbying
[01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:31.060]   and through, you know,
[01:52:31.060 --> 01:52:32.340]   all these other mechanisms
[01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:33.540]   for corporate capture,
[01:52:33.540 --> 01:52:36.100]   controls the expenditures
[01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:38.180]   in the food stamp program.
[01:52:38.180 --> 01:52:40.180]   So 70% of the food stamp program
[01:52:40.180 --> 01:52:41.380]   goes for processed food.
[01:52:41.380 --> 01:52:44.900]   10% goes for sugar drinks like Coca-Cola,
[01:52:44.900 --> 01:52:47.940]   which are just diabetes machines.
[01:52:47.940 --> 01:52:49.620]   So why are we poisoning
[01:52:49.620 --> 01:52:50.900]   poor kids in this country?
[01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:53.860]   The school lunch program,
[01:52:53.860 --> 01:52:55.300]   the same thing, almost 80%,
[01:52:55.300 --> 01:52:56.900]   I think 70% to 70% of food,
[01:52:56.900 --> 01:53:00.020]   the lunch program is terrible foods
[01:53:00.020 --> 01:53:02.420]   that are actually poisoning our children.
[01:53:02.420 --> 01:53:04.580]   And, you know, don't we, you know,
[01:53:04.580 --> 01:53:07.140]   don't we care enough about our kids to say,
[01:53:07.140 --> 01:53:09.540]   we need, you know,
[01:53:09.540 --> 01:53:11.380]   we want to care about them.
[01:53:11.380 --> 01:53:13.220]   We want to make sure that they're not sick.
[01:53:13.220 --> 01:53:16.980]   They are the most precious things in our country.
[01:53:16.980 --> 01:53:18.580]   Shouldn't that be the focus?
[01:53:18.580 --> 01:53:20.260]   And, you know, whatever we're doing
[01:53:20.260 --> 01:53:21.460]   to make them so sick.
[01:53:21.460 --> 01:53:23.700]   When I was a kid,
[01:53:23.700 --> 01:53:26.820]   6% of American kids had chronic disease.
[01:53:26.820 --> 01:53:27.540]   Today, 60%.
[01:53:28.580 --> 01:53:29.780]   Is that not an alarm?
[01:53:29.780 --> 01:53:31.460]   Is that not, you know,
[01:53:31.460 --> 01:53:33.300]   something that we should all be concerned about?
[01:53:33.300 --> 01:53:37.380]   - I will agree on an important point.
[01:53:37.380 --> 01:53:39.860]   You know, the food stamp program,
[01:53:39.860 --> 01:53:42.980]   the SNAP program provides food stamps
[01:53:42.980 --> 01:53:46.740]   to support 42 million Americans.
[01:53:46.740 --> 01:53:48.500]   42 million people rely on food stamps.
[01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:52.020]   It costs $120 billion of federal money per year.
[01:53:52.020 --> 01:53:55.060]   And as Bobby said,
[01:53:55.060 --> 01:53:56.660]   the number one product bought
[01:53:56.660 --> 01:53:58.260]   on the food stamp program is,
[01:53:58.260 --> 01:53:59.540]   soda, canned soda.
[01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:02.660]   And there was an important debate a few years ago
[01:54:02.660 --> 01:54:05.300]   about whether or not canned soda,
[01:54:05.300 --> 01:54:06.580]   by the way, Bobby,
[01:54:06.580 --> 01:54:08.020]   you and I probably agree on a lot of things.
[01:54:08.020 --> 01:54:09.700]   It's definitely a lot of things we don't agree on,
[01:54:09.700 --> 01:54:11.140]   but like these aspects,
[01:54:11.140 --> 01:54:12.820]   I think are just no brainers.
[01:54:12.820 --> 01:54:14.900]   There was a debate a few years ago
[01:54:14.900 --> 01:54:16.420]   about whether or not canned soda
[01:54:16.420 --> 01:54:17.940]   should be allowed as a purchase
[01:54:17.940 --> 01:54:18.900]   on the food stamp program,
[01:54:18.900 --> 01:54:21.380]   or whether it should be fresh fruits and vegetables
[01:54:21.380 --> 01:54:22.580]   and grains and other things.
[01:54:22.580 --> 01:54:26.260]   And ultimately there was a food lobbying effort made
[01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:29.940]   that kept canned soda on the food stamp program.
[01:54:29.940 --> 01:54:30.980]   And it is again,
[01:54:30.980 --> 01:54:33.620]   $120 billion of annual federal spend
[01:54:33.620 --> 01:54:36.660]   with the biggest line item going to canned soda
[01:54:36.660 --> 01:54:38.980]   to feed 42 million Americans.
[01:54:38.980 --> 01:54:42.020]   And the connection is completely direct.
[01:54:42.020 --> 01:54:44.340]   High sugar, high glycemic index,
[01:54:44.340 --> 01:54:47.060]   diabetes and other chronic health conditions
[01:54:47.060 --> 01:54:48.740]   arise from that connection.
[01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:51.300]   So I'm definitely aligned with you
[01:54:51.300 --> 01:54:54.340]   on the misincentives and the disincentives
[01:54:54.340 --> 01:54:55.860]   in these programs that have been created.
[01:54:55.860 --> 01:54:57.060]   And they only expand every year.
[01:54:57.060 --> 01:54:59.220]   - Bobby, can you comment on
[01:54:59.220 --> 01:55:02.180]   when people talk about revamping the food supply,
[01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:05.140]   one of the things that sometimes
[01:55:05.140 --> 01:55:06.260]   is not allowed to be said
[01:55:06.260 --> 01:55:10.260]   is that focusing on organic food and produce
[01:55:10.260 --> 01:55:13.220]   can exclude certain communities.
[01:55:13.220 --> 01:55:15.060]   And so there's like this DEI filter
[01:55:15.060 --> 01:55:17.540]   that preferring that is almost racist in some way.
[01:55:17.540 --> 01:55:20.020]   Like, can you just comment on that whole vein of thinking
[01:55:20.020 --> 01:55:20.900]   and your thought on that?
[01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:25.540]   - Yeah, I mean, I think feeding people poisonous food
[01:55:25.540 --> 01:55:26.420]   is racist.
[01:55:26.420 --> 01:55:30.340]   And by the way, the NAACP gets huge amounts of money
[01:55:30.340 --> 01:55:32.900]   every year from the food industry.
[01:55:32.900 --> 01:55:34.420]   It may be one of the biggest,
[01:55:34.420 --> 01:55:39.300]   I think Coca-Cola is the biggest supporter of NAACP.
[01:55:39.300 --> 01:55:43.940]   So a lot of the NGOs that are supposed to be concerned
[01:55:43.940 --> 01:55:47.300]   about the disproportionate impact
[01:55:47.300 --> 01:55:49.940]   on minority communities of federal policies
[01:55:49.940 --> 01:55:51.300]   have actually been bought off
[01:55:51.300 --> 01:55:52.820]   and bought into the process.
[01:55:52.820 --> 01:55:55.300]   And a lot of times those are the voices
[01:55:55.300 --> 01:55:57.060]   that you hear saying this is racist.
[01:55:57.060 --> 01:56:02.180]   What's really racist is poisoning black Americans
[01:56:02.180 --> 01:56:04.900]   because these are communities that are food deserts.
[01:56:04.900 --> 01:56:08.180]   The school lunch program is the,
[01:56:08.180 --> 01:56:10.180]   you know, oftentimes in those communities
[01:56:10.180 --> 01:56:13.060]   the biggest access that they have to food
[01:56:13.060 --> 01:56:14.580]   and we're giving them poison food.
[01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:18.580]   Many of these communities have no grocery stores.
[01:56:18.580 --> 01:56:21.780]   You know, they're no big,
[01:56:22.260 --> 01:56:24.900]   they definitely don't have whole foods.
[01:56:24.900 --> 01:56:28.180]   They don't have access to those kinds of foods.
[01:56:28.180 --> 01:56:30.020]   Shouldn't we have national policies
[01:56:30.020 --> 01:56:34.900]   that make sure our people are healthy?
[01:56:34.900 --> 01:56:39.140]   And, you know, they use of course market dynamics
[01:56:39.140 --> 01:56:40.500]   but also supports.
[01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:43.300]   We're giving billions of dollars
[01:56:43.300 --> 01:56:47.140]   in agricultural subsidies for farmers
[01:56:47.140 --> 01:56:51.220]   to addict farmers to growing commodity agriculture
[01:56:51.220 --> 01:56:52.740]   which is a bad food.
[01:56:52.740 --> 01:56:55.300]   It's low in nutrients, it's high in chemicals,
[01:56:55.300 --> 01:56:56.740]   it's high in pesticides.
[01:56:56.740 --> 01:57:01.460]   And, you know, we need to change these perverse incentives
[01:57:01.460 --> 01:57:04.100]   so that and feed America.
[01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:08.500]   How can anybody argue with this?
[01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:09.860]   How can anybody say that
[01:57:09.860 --> 01:57:12.020]   we should not have healthy children,
[01:57:12.020 --> 01:57:14.820]   that we should be giving people food that is hurting them?
[01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:16.580]   It's just, it doesn't make any sense.
[01:57:16.580 --> 01:57:20.020]   - Sax, any questions for you for Bobby
[01:57:20.020 --> 01:57:25.060]   about democracy, what went down with Biden,
[01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:26.980]   the fairness of the Democratic Party?
[01:57:26.980 --> 01:57:28.420]   I know you've got some strong feelings on it.
[01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:29.860]   So I just wanted to give you your red meat
[01:57:29.860 --> 01:57:30.980]   in your window here.
[01:57:30.980 --> 01:57:33.940]   I'm sure a lot of it's confirming for you what he's saying.
[01:57:33.940 --> 01:57:36.340]   And, you know, I'll be honest.
[01:57:36.340 --> 01:57:39.540]   I think what the Democratic Party did to you, Mr. Kennedy,
[01:57:39.540 --> 01:57:41.620]   was absolutely abhorrent and disgusting.
[01:57:41.620 --> 01:57:45.060]   And it really is infuriating to me,
[01:57:45.060 --> 01:57:46.740]   especially what the mainstream media did.
[01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:50.740]   And I'm glad that we got to have you on early
[01:57:50.740 --> 01:57:53.060]   on our podcast, at least to let some of your ideas
[01:57:53.060 --> 01:57:53.700]   get out there.
[01:57:53.700 --> 01:57:55.940]   But let's give Sax his red meat here
[01:57:55.940 --> 01:57:59.540]   because you joining Trump is a wild card.
[01:57:59.540 --> 01:58:01.140]   I don't think any of us saw it coming.
[01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:03.540]   - Well, let me pick up on those themes, Jay Cowell.
[01:58:03.540 --> 01:58:04.820]   First of all, I want to commend Bobby
[01:58:04.820 --> 01:58:06.900]   on running an upbeat and positive campaign.
[01:58:06.900 --> 01:58:10.660]   You know, you were, and still are,
[01:58:10.660 --> 01:58:13.700]   the most articulate and powerful champion
[01:58:13.700 --> 01:58:15.860]   of free speech over censorship,
[01:58:15.860 --> 01:58:18.340]   civil liberties over the surveillance state,
[01:58:18.340 --> 01:58:20.020]   peace over war.
[01:58:20.020 --> 01:58:22.660]   You've spoken about the issue of chronic health,
[01:58:22.660 --> 01:58:24.100]   which, to be honest, is an issue
[01:58:24.100 --> 01:58:24.980]   I didn't know that much about.
[01:58:24.980 --> 01:58:27.620]   But I think you've put it now on the political radar screen
[01:58:27.620 --> 01:58:28.980]   in a way that it's not going away.
[01:58:28.980 --> 01:58:34.980]   So I think you ran a very noble and effective campaign.
[01:58:34.980 --> 01:58:37.220]   And I think, like you said, it was a campaign
[01:58:37.220 --> 01:58:38.580]   for the soul of the Democratic Party.
[01:58:38.580 --> 01:58:42.900]   You know, I think you represented issues
[01:58:42.900 --> 01:58:45.220]   that in the days of your father
[01:58:45.220 --> 01:58:46.660]   and President John F. Kennedy,
[01:58:46.660 --> 01:58:49.620]   these would have been Democratic Party issues.
[01:58:49.620 --> 01:58:51.140]   How did the Democratic Party respond?
[01:58:51.140 --> 01:58:53.060]   They effectively ran you out.
[01:58:53.060 --> 01:58:54.180]   They did not give you the chance.
[01:58:54.180 --> 01:58:57.540]   They conducted lawfare to keep you off the ballot.
[01:58:57.540 --> 01:58:58.980]   They didn't let you debate.
[01:58:58.980 --> 01:59:00.100]   I heard your running mate say
[01:59:00.100 --> 01:59:02.980]   that you even tried to infiltrate your campaign.
[01:59:02.980 --> 01:59:05.060]   And all the while, this party was claiming
[01:59:05.060 --> 01:59:06.500]   to be the party of democracy.
[01:59:06.500 --> 01:59:08.980]   Find that incredibly hypocritical.
[01:59:11.060 --> 01:59:14.660]   I think that if they had given you the opportunity to debate,
[01:59:14.660 --> 01:59:17.220]   I think we now know what would have happened.
[01:59:17.220 --> 01:59:19.140]   I mean, we saw what happened
[01:59:19.140 --> 01:59:20.740]   when Biden actually debated Trump,
[01:59:20.740 --> 01:59:25.060]   is there's a complete implosion of Biden's campaign.
[01:59:25.060 --> 01:59:27.780]   We discovered that, indeed, the Democratic Party
[01:59:27.780 --> 01:59:31.860]   had been hiding his condition for a long time.
[01:59:31.860 --> 01:59:34.020]   And when he was finally forced to debate,
[01:59:34.020 --> 01:59:36.660]   didn't have a teleprompter or script,
[01:59:36.660 --> 01:59:38.580]   it became extremely obvious.
[01:59:38.580 --> 01:59:39.620]   What happened then?
[01:59:39.620 --> 01:59:42.580]   They basically put in a new nominee
[01:59:42.580 --> 01:59:44.900]   who's never been voted on.
[01:59:44.900 --> 01:59:47.780]   Kamala Harris has never received one primary vote.
[01:59:47.780 --> 01:59:50.420]   It was done through a process that was opaque.
[01:59:50.420 --> 01:59:52.340]   We still don't know how it went down.
[01:59:52.340 --> 01:59:54.260]   I have to disagree with Reed
[01:59:54.260 --> 01:59:57.140]   that Biden did it in a voluntary way.
[01:59:57.140 --> 01:59:59.060]   Biden went kicking and screaming.
[01:59:59.060 --> 02:00:01.300]   I mean, he basically said publicly over and over again,
[02:00:01.300 --> 02:00:02.420]   I'm not leaving the race.
[02:00:02.420 --> 02:00:03.460]   I'm in this race.
[02:00:03.460 --> 02:00:04.820]   He tweeted it, he said it.
[02:00:04.820 --> 02:00:07.220]   He said, only God Almighty could get me out of the race.
[02:00:07.220 --> 02:00:09.380]   And then it was reported that Nancy Pelosi went to him
[02:00:09.380 --> 02:00:11.300]   and said, we can do this the easy way or the hard way.
[02:00:11.300 --> 02:00:13.060]   - He said God Almighty.
[02:00:13.060 --> 02:00:15.380]   - She might be God Almighty.
[02:00:15.380 --> 02:00:16.660]   - He did say God Almighty.
[02:00:16.660 --> 02:00:17.860]   - But the point is,
[02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:19.380]   there was nothing Democratic about this.
[02:00:19.380 --> 02:00:22.420]   And now we have a new Democratic Party nominee
[02:00:22.420 --> 02:00:24.980]   who refuses to do press conferences,
[02:00:24.980 --> 02:00:27.540]   refuses to do solo interviews,
[02:00:27.540 --> 02:00:30.260]   refuses to take questions from the press,
[02:00:30.260 --> 02:00:32.020]   who's hiding herself effectively.
[02:00:32.020 --> 02:00:34.260]   And yet this party, again,
[02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:35.700]   claims to be the party of democracy.
[02:00:36.420 --> 02:00:40.740]   I find it just almost maddening or galling again
[02:00:40.740 --> 02:00:41.780]   in its hypocrisy.
[02:00:41.780 --> 02:00:44.580]   And I just, I don't see how everybody
[02:00:44.580 --> 02:00:45.620]   can't see through this.
[02:00:45.620 --> 02:00:49.460]   It's just not the way that democracy is supposed to work.
[02:00:49.460 --> 02:00:52.420]   And I certainly don't think that the people
[02:00:52.420 --> 02:00:55.380]   engaging these tactics can be cloaking themselves
[02:00:55.380 --> 02:00:58.420]   in all this high fluting rhetoric of democracy.
[02:00:58.420 --> 02:00:59.140]   It's just absurd.
[02:00:59.140 --> 02:01:02.420]   And so I feel like I'm in the place that you are, Bobby.
[02:01:02.420 --> 02:01:04.820]   You know, as viewers of this pod know,
[02:01:04.820 --> 02:01:08.020]   I did not start off supporting Trump in the primaries.
[02:01:08.020 --> 02:01:09.620]   I supported you in the Democratic primary
[02:01:09.620 --> 02:01:12.580]   and I did fundraisers for DeSantis and Vivek.
[02:01:12.580 --> 02:01:14.740]   And that was in large part
[02:01:14.740 --> 02:01:17.220]   because I think of the job that DeSantis did as governor.
[02:01:17.220 --> 02:01:19.140]   But when it came to the general,
[02:01:19.140 --> 02:01:21.300]   the realization that I came to
[02:01:21.300 --> 02:01:24.020]   is that Trump is the indispensable figure
[02:01:24.020 --> 02:01:25.460]   in our current politics
[02:01:25.460 --> 02:01:27.620]   for marshaling this populist energy
[02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:34.020]   to resist this hypocritical elite authoritarianism
[02:01:34.580 --> 02:01:37.220]   that wants to engage in censorship over debate,
[02:01:37.220 --> 02:01:40.420]   that seems to want to protect and defend
[02:01:40.420 --> 02:01:44.100]   this surveillance state over anything it wants to do,
[02:01:44.100 --> 02:01:45.860]   that wants to keep all these wars going,
[02:01:45.860 --> 02:01:47.700]   even when they don't make sense,
[02:01:47.700 --> 02:01:48.900]   when we could have found a way
[02:01:48.900 --> 02:01:51.060]   to negotiate a diplomatic end to them.
[02:01:51.060 --> 02:01:53.860]   And so I'm kind of delighted
[02:01:53.860 --> 02:01:55.380]   that you've kind of come around to this opinion too.
[02:01:55.380 --> 02:01:57.220]   I know you have your reservations about Trump.
[02:01:57.220 --> 02:01:58.500]   I'm not saying that Trump is perfect.
[02:01:58.500 --> 02:02:00.900]   I mean, I think he's a, he's human.
[02:02:00.900 --> 02:02:01.860]   I mean, he's a flawed vessel.
[02:02:01.860 --> 02:02:06.180]   But at the end of the day, he is the choice that represents,
[02:02:06.180 --> 02:02:09.380]   again, these populist forces resisting authoritarianism.
[02:02:09.380 --> 02:02:10.820]   Sorry, this is more of a statement than a question,
[02:02:10.820 --> 02:02:12.100]   but I'll let you react to all of that.
[02:02:12.100 --> 02:02:15.300]   - Well, let me react to the last thing
[02:02:15.300 --> 02:02:16.500]   you said about President Trump.
[02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:19.940]   I think if President Trump wins,
[02:02:19.940 --> 02:02:23.620]   that people are gonna see a very different President Trump
[02:02:23.620 --> 02:02:25.140]   than they did during the first term.
[02:02:25.140 --> 02:02:27.700]   I think he's changed as a person
[02:02:27.700 --> 02:02:31.140]   and I've known him for, you know, 30 years.
[02:02:31.140 --> 02:02:33.460]   I've sued him, I've litigated against him
[02:02:33.460 --> 02:02:35.300]   and had a friendship with him
[02:02:35.300 --> 02:02:37.060]   even when I was litigating against him.
[02:02:37.060 --> 02:02:40.500]   And by the way, successfully against him.
[02:02:40.500 --> 02:02:47.140]   But I think he is, he's focused on his legacy.
[02:02:47.140 --> 02:02:49.140]   He said many interesting things to me
[02:02:49.140 --> 02:02:51.140]   about what he did wrong the last time
[02:02:51.140 --> 02:02:54.340]   and about how he filled his, you know,
[02:02:54.340 --> 02:02:56.100]   he had no idea he was gonna win.
[02:02:56.100 --> 02:02:57.700]   He had no idea how to govern
[02:02:57.700 --> 02:03:00.900]   and people descended on him the day that he got elected.
[02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:03.780]   And said, you gotta appoint this guy, appoint this guy.
[02:03:03.780 --> 02:03:06.580]   And he said, you know, I appointed a lot of people
[02:03:06.580 --> 02:03:07.380]   I shouldn't have appointed.
[02:03:07.380 --> 02:03:08.500]   I know who they are now.
[02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:11.540]   He also said something interesting to me.
[02:03:11.540 --> 02:03:14.420]   He said, the Democrats,
[02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:18.180]   one of the big sort of fulcrums of their terror of Trump
[02:03:18.180 --> 02:03:22.340]   is that he's gonna implement this Heritage Foundation,
[02:03:22.340 --> 02:03:26.340]   you know, blueprint, which is called Project 2025.
[02:03:26.340 --> 02:03:29.380]   And he brought this issue up to me and he said,
[02:03:29.380 --> 02:03:32.420]   you know, they always telling me I'm for Project 2025.
[02:03:32.420 --> 02:03:34.340]   I never read Project 2025
[02:03:34.340 --> 02:03:36.340]   until they started accusing me of it.
[02:03:36.340 --> 02:03:40.580]   He said, I was written by a right-wing asshole.
[02:03:40.580 --> 02:03:42.660]   That's what he said.
[02:03:42.660 --> 02:03:44.500]   He said, there are left-wing assholes
[02:03:44.500 --> 02:03:46.500]   and there was, there are right-wing assholes.
[02:03:46.500 --> 02:03:48.820]   And it was a right-wing asshole who wrote that thing.
[02:03:48.820 --> 02:03:51.460]   And then he started going through it.
[02:03:51.460 --> 02:03:54.740]   So I, you know, I think there's a lot.
[02:03:54.740 --> 02:03:57.780]   And I think he's interested in his legacy now.
[02:03:57.780 --> 02:04:02.500]   He wants to leave behind some accomplishments
[02:04:02.500 --> 02:04:04.420]   and he wants to make our country better.
[02:04:04.420 --> 02:04:07.380]   And I think he's, you know,
[02:04:07.380 --> 02:04:10.100]   he's listening to a wider range of voices.
[02:04:10.100 --> 02:04:13.700]   And as he's preparing to govern right now,
[02:04:13.700 --> 02:04:16.820]   and, you know, I'm gonna be on the transition committee,
[02:04:16.820 --> 02:04:19.300]   picking the people who are gonna govern.
[02:04:19.300 --> 02:04:21.460]   Tulsi's gonna be there.
[02:04:21.460 --> 02:04:25.060]   There's gonna be a wide diversity of stakeholders,
[02:04:25.060 --> 02:04:26.980]   but he's listening to more than just
[02:04:26.980 --> 02:04:28.740]   that kind of narrow right-wing band
[02:04:28.740 --> 02:04:29.620]   that people are terrified of.
[02:04:29.620 --> 02:04:31.300]   - It would be great if you could get to him
[02:04:31.300 --> 02:04:33.860]   because, you know, he really did present well
[02:04:33.860 --> 02:04:36.100]   on this podcast and had like a very good moment
[02:04:36.100 --> 02:04:37.540]   in that first half of the RNC.
[02:04:37.540 --> 02:04:40.180]   And then he started defaulting back to,
[02:04:40.180 --> 02:04:42.260]   and I know a lot of it's like myself,
[02:04:42.260 --> 02:04:43.700]   hate this about him.
[02:04:43.700 --> 02:04:45.620]   And it's a big part of why we don't like him
[02:04:45.620 --> 02:04:47.540]   is he goes back to incel comics,
[02:04:47.540 --> 02:04:49.380]   goes back to race, goes back to gender.
[02:04:49.380 --> 02:04:51.700]   You know, and it's just like, dude,
[02:04:51.700 --> 02:04:54.580]   that Trump 1.0 is what people don't want.
[02:04:54.580 --> 02:04:56.180]   They don't want chaotic Trump.
[02:04:56.180 --> 02:05:00.180]   They want, you know, post-assassination attempt Trump.
[02:05:00.180 --> 02:05:02.180]   And it's just so infuriating.
[02:05:02.180 --> 02:05:04.980]   - Well, a lot of people feel that way, Jay Conn.
[02:05:04.980 --> 02:05:06.260]   I think at the end of the day,
[02:05:06.260 --> 02:05:08.020]   you and others are gonna have to decide,
[02:05:08.020 --> 02:05:10.260]   do you wanna support the candidate
[02:05:10.260 --> 02:05:11.300]   who has the right policies,
[02:05:11.300 --> 02:05:13.220]   but maybe there's style points
[02:05:13.220 --> 02:05:15.220]   that you don't like about him?
[02:05:15.220 --> 02:05:17.220]   'Cause I think that the things you're talking about,
[02:05:17.220 --> 02:05:18.820]   the mean tweets and so forth,
[02:05:18.820 --> 02:05:19.780]   are at the end of the day,
[02:05:19.780 --> 02:05:22.180]   I think they're stylistic things.
[02:05:22.180 --> 02:05:24.340]   I don't think they go deep to policy
[02:05:24.340 --> 02:05:25.620]   or how he would govern.
[02:05:25.620 --> 02:05:28.580]   Or do you wanna support a campaign
[02:05:28.580 --> 02:05:31.380]   that is running on vibes and joy,
[02:05:31.380 --> 02:05:34.980]   you know, that has the superficiality that you like,
[02:05:34.980 --> 02:05:36.420]   but there's nothing underneath it?
[02:05:36.420 --> 02:05:38.820]   And when we do learn something underneath it,
[02:05:38.820 --> 02:05:40.260]   when we actually learn a policy,
[02:05:40.260 --> 02:05:43.780]   then all the people who are supporting her
[02:05:43.780 --> 02:05:45.620]   have to say, oh, well, she's not really gonna do that.
[02:05:45.620 --> 02:05:47.220]   She's not gonna do that.
[02:05:47.220 --> 02:05:49.380]   So the best thing you can say about her campaign
[02:05:49.380 --> 02:05:51.700]   is that she's not gonna be able to accomplish
[02:05:51.700 --> 02:05:54.420]   the things that she says she wants to accomplish.
[02:05:54.420 --> 02:05:55.620]   - Good news is-- - There's no basis
[02:05:55.620 --> 02:05:57.220]   on which to vote for a president.
[02:05:57.220 --> 02:05:58.740]   - Good news is I'm in Texas,
[02:05:58.740 --> 02:06:01.060]   so I could put in my Bobby Kennedy vote
[02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:02.980]   as a protest vote and it doesn't make a difference.
[02:06:02.980 --> 02:06:05.940]   - Can I respond to the other part
[02:06:05.940 --> 02:06:07.380]   of David's question? - Sure.
[02:06:07.380 --> 02:06:11.460]   - And, you know, I think to me,
[02:06:11.460 --> 02:06:13.460]   the most troubling thing about what's happening now,
[02:06:13.460 --> 02:06:15.540]   you've had two Democratic candidates
[02:06:15.540 --> 02:06:19.380]   who have not been able to give unscripted interviews,
[02:06:19.380 --> 02:06:20.500]   which is extraordinary.
[02:06:20.500 --> 02:06:24.740]   I mean, my father and uncle were so proud of,
[02:06:24.740 --> 02:06:26.660]   you know, the United States for our capacity
[02:06:26.660 --> 02:06:29.620]   to engage in debate, to defend who we were in the world,
[02:06:29.620 --> 02:06:31.300]   to defend a vision of our country,
[02:06:31.300 --> 02:06:32.980]   to articulate it to the rest of the world,
[02:06:32.980 --> 02:06:34.740]   to be the leaders of the free world
[02:06:34.740 --> 02:06:39.300]   and have a command of the facts and of knowledge
[02:06:39.300 --> 02:06:40.260]   and to be eloquent.
[02:06:40.260 --> 02:06:44.660]   And how can you be a leader in the world?
[02:06:44.660 --> 02:06:47.540]   What does the rest of the world think of us right now?
[02:06:47.540 --> 02:06:49.380]   I mean, what could they possibly think?
[02:06:49.380 --> 02:06:51.700]   We have two Democratic Party candidates
[02:06:51.700 --> 02:06:56.740]   who are not able to explain themselves in an interview.
[02:06:56.740 --> 02:06:59.060]   - It's boggles. - Bill O'Neill said
[02:06:59.060 --> 02:07:03.060]   the other day something really, I think, poignant,
[02:07:03.060 --> 02:07:07.780]   which is if you want the job of handling the nuclear code,
[02:07:07.780 --> 02:07:09.700]   you gotta do an interview first.
[02:07:09.700 --> 02:07:13.780]   And, you know, how can you go 30, 39 days
[02:07:13.780 --> 02:07:15.860]   without talking to the press,
[02:07:16.660 --> 02:07:19.460]   without being able to defend your record,
[02:07:19.460 --> 02:07:21.940]   to explain who you are to the American people?
[02:07:21.940 --> 02:07:24.260]   And if you talk to Democrats about this
[02:07:24.260 --> 02:07:28.020]   and you can get past the anger and pass the vigil
[02:07:28.020 --> 02:07:32.180]   on this kind of wall of tribal resistance
[02:07:32.180 --> 02:07:37.940]   to any new knowledge coming in or any contrary facts,
[02:07:37.940 --> 02:07:39.620]   what they'll say is,
[02:07:39.620 --> 02:07:43.060]   "Well, we're not really voting for Kamala,
[02:07:43.060 --> 02:07:44.500]   we're voting for the apparatus."
[02:07:45.860 --> 02:07:47.140]   And you ask the next question,
[02:07:47.140 --> 02:07:50.740]   has that apparatus served you?
[02:07:50.740 --> 02:07:53.140]   You know, has the open border served you?
[02:07:53.140 --> 02:07:55.700]   Has the $35 trillion debt served you?
[02:07:55.700 --> 02:07:58.660]   Has all the endless wars served you?
[02:07:58.660 --> 02:08:00.980]   Has the destruction of the American middle class,
[02:08:00.980 --> 02:08:04.340]   the highest inflation rate in the generation,
[02:08:04.340 --> 02:08:07.700]   has any of that actually, you know,
[02:08:07.700 --> 02:08:10.020]   has that apparatus produced something
[02:08:10.020 --> 02:08:12.660]   for the United States that you're so proud of
[02:08:12.660 --> 02:08:14.020]   that you wanna blindly vote
[02:08:14.020 --> 02:08:15.620]   without knowing who you're voting for?
[02:08:16.420 --> 02:08:17.380]   Anyway, that's--
[02:08:17.380 --> 02:08:20.820]   - Well, I mean, and Kamala and Waltz
[02:08:20.820 --> 02:08:22.500]   will do an interview with Dana Bash tonight,
[02:08:22.500 --> 02:08:24.820]   the night we're taping this on Thursday.
[02:08:24.820 --> 02:08:27.940]   So we'll see, maybe she'll miraculously do 10 podcasts
[02:08:27.940 --> 02:08:30.100]   and she'll be dynamic,
[02:08:30.100 --> 02:08:32.020]   but it certainly doesn't look good
[02:08:32.020 --> 02:08:33.700]   that they filibustered with Biden
[02:08:33.700 --> 02:08:36.260]   and gave him only most favored nation interviews.
[02:08:36.260 --> 02:08:37.300]   I do respect the fact
[02:08:37.300 --> 02:08:39.940]   that we've had so many great candidates come on this pod
[02:08:39.940 --> 02:08:42.260]   and have 90 minute, two hour discussions.
[02:08:42.260 --> 02:08:44.100]   I'm very proud of the work we've done here.
[02:08:44.100 --> 02:08:46.020]   And Bobby, you are a key piece of that.
[02:08:46.020 --> 02:08:47.700]   And we really appreciate you coming on early
[02:08:47.700 --> 02:08:48.580]   and having these debates
[02:08:48.580 --> 02:08:50.180]   and coming here today to talk about it.
[02:08:50.180 --> 02:08:52.420]   Just means the world for you to come back
