[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   I now have a chief of staff. He's pretty great. He's worked for me for a while and
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.960]   he's doing a great job, but it's actually really helped. I will say that. And then I
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.200]   started a family office. Wow. Congrats.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.320]   What does that mean? You have a place in your home that you call an office?
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.360]   You don't like to break by your refrigerator and there's an office?
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.720]   That's a family office. Yes. The family goes in there to talk about office stuff.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.600]   Where does Jade put the stickies that say we're out of granola bars? In the family office.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:49.520]   Hey, everybody. Welcome to another episode of the All In Podcast, Episode 72, Part Deux.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.040]   With us today, again, the prince of panic attacks, the sultan of science, David Friedberg.
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.200]   The prince of panic attacks.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.640]   Ah, yes. And also...
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.080]   The Zephyr of Zoloft.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:10.000]   And also, as you're hearing, cackling, the Duke of Degeneracy, the dictator himself, Chamath
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.560]   Palihapiti. And of course, everybody's favorite, the Rain Man himself, the Drunk History Channel
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.680]   uncle, David Sachs. I mean, David, I follow you on Twitter. You're tweeting 50 times a day.
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.800]   Oh, I was thinking the
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.040]   same thing.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.000]   I was thinking the same thing. When do you work?
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.720]   What has happened to you? You won't meet with startups anymore. I bring you startups. You
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.560]   said, you know what, I'm no longer going to meet with your startups.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.000]   You're like Greg Gatsby. You're like stuck in your room tweeting.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.600]   I don't do first meetings.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.840]   That is the end of your career. Huge mistake.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.880]   No.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.680]   No more first meetings?
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.280]   It preserves my energy. There's nothing more draining than endlessly spending your day in
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.160]   first meetings.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.920]   No. Why don't you just have a short first meeting, like a 15-minute first meeting?
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.440]   Well, that's what we have a team for.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.240]   What if they have a bad judgment?
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.000]   I love it.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.800]   They don't. Because we're...
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.560]   Because we know exactly what we're looking for. SaaS investing is very metrics driven. And so the
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.040]   first meeting...
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.920]   Oh, that's fair. That's a good one.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.280]   Yeah, exactly. So it's like, you know, the first meeting, we just find out,
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.440]   do they meet our basic threshold for...
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.920]   Love it.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.960]   For growth and...
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.400]   Fantastic.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.200]   Yeah. So we run the numbers and then I will meet with them if they look good.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.720]   I love this. I would like all VCs to take the same approach. And I will let everybody know
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.560]   my DMs are open. Jason@Calacanis.com. I will take the first meeting.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.000]   Sax, I need to call you after this.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.640]   One of our businesses, which is not in SaaS, has started to sell SaaS software.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.960]   And we've already booked $40 million of fucking ACV by complete accident from zero.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.200]   Wow.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.920]   You stepped in it. And I need some advice.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.120]   Okay. Yeah, let's talk.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:47.040]   All right, everybody. It's been a bit of a crazy couple of weeks here. And we have to start with
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.120]   the war in Ukraine and do a bit of an update. It's been over 20 days. The death toll continues to
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.320]   climb. We don't know. We're not sure. But we're going to have to wait and see. We're going to
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.640]   see. We're going to have to wait and see. We're going to have to wait and see. We're going to have
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.880]   to wait and see. We're going to have to wait and see. We're going to have to wait and see. We're going
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.360]   to have to wait and see. We're going to have to wait and see. We're going to have to wait and see. We're
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.440]   going to have to wait and see. We're going to have to wait and see. We're going to have to wait and see.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.040]   It's very hard to get information. We're not experts. We don't have boots on the ground.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.280]   But according to the New York Times, 7000 Russian troops have been killed.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:12.880]   And Zelensky said on March 12, 1300, Ukrainian troops have been killed. I think we've got three
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.080]   or four angles we need to talk about here. One, I want to talk about food supply with Friedberg since
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.200]   you ran climate.com and have a lot of expertise in that. And of course, Ukraine and Russia are the
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.200]   breadbasket of the world. Tramath, I want to talk about markets, of course, but let's go to our
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.440]   History Channel uncle first, Sax. You have been going down the rabbit hole looking at the history
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:44.640]   of this. Let me just ask you just a point in question. Is Russia losing the war? And if they
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.840]   are losing the war, if that is a possibility, is that even a possibility that they'll
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.840]   losing the war? Are they losing the war? And then what is the exit ramp here? And what does
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.720]   it mean on a go forward basis? Right? I think great question. So here's where I think we stand
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.480]   three weeks into the war is that Putin clearly miscalculated. He thought this would be a cakewalk.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.240]   Obviously, it has turned out not to be the Ukrainians have put up very fierce resistance.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.880]   The Russians have taken very serious casualties and losses. And so the war is very much,
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.600]   you know, up in the air, the outcome is very much in doubt. So I think, you know, Putin,
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:24.560]   was overconfident, made a political, economic and obviously humanitarian mistake. But I think three
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.880]   weeks in here is where I would characterize things is it feels to me like the West might be making a
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:37.600]   similar mistake of sort of excessive overconfidence and triumphalism, meaning that we think the rest of
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.520]   this war is going to be a cakewalk. And the reason I say that, let me just give you some examples and
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.560]   then tell you why it may not be a cakewalk. So you've got Francis Fukuyama had a piece this week,
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.360]   basically,
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.440]   he's back with the end of history, he predicts that, you know, imminent Russian defeat,
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.160]   and that there's gonna be a new birth of freedom. For the West, it's going to be like the Bush
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.480]   doctrine and 20 years of failed policy in the Middle East never happened. You got David Frum,
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.320]   you know, all that predicting mission accomplished, just like the Iraq war.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.920]   He said the springtime is gonna be bad for anyone who bet on Putin,
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.440]   his words, which, in his view, is anyone who isn't a basically a neocon who favors regime change.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.120]   You had a piece get a lot of circulation over the last week in the US,
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:24.880]   China perception monitor by, I think, a former Chinese observer named Hu Wei.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.800]   And he basically predicted that China would be under so much pressure by what the Russians have
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.480]   done, you know, in terms of humanitarian losses that they would come out, basically,
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:42.640]   denouncing Russia and support the West. And then, of course, I think the final example of what you
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.880]   might call Western triumphalism right now is that absolutely no one in Washington seems to be
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.640]   pushing for a ceasefire. They're all, you know, they're all paying lip service, at least to this
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:59.200]   no-fly zone idea. Biden and the squad seem to be the last holdouts for the idea of not imposing
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.680]   no-fly zone. So, I would say right now, the West seems to be very confident about the way this
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.920]   war is going and not inclined to make any compromises or concessions.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:13.360]   I just want to flag quickly why, you know, why there might be some clouds on the silver lining.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.640]   So, you had a Washington Post article, first of all, warning. It
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.520]   was very interesting that Ukrainian military progress may not be as great as their, quote,
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.960]   "stratcom," their strategic communications, you know, aka propaganda. So, in other words,
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.880]   the Ukrainians are very effective at fighting the information war,
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.640]   but the Russians are still making progress on the ground. You also had this Washington Post story
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.760]   about neo-Nazis flocking from all over Europe to Ukraine to fight for the cause. Again,
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.400]   that story got, it's very troubling, and it got no likes or retweets because it just doesn't fit
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.520]   the great narrative here. You've got the slow-motion humanitarian…
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.640]   Is that true? Like, this…
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.760]   Yeah, let's come back to it. Let me lay out all the issues, and we can come back to it.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.160]   You've got the slow-motion humanitarian disaster of, you know, a billion people across the world
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.160]   potentially starving if the spring planting doesn't happen, which we should let Freiburg
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.320]   speak to more. You've got the fact that Russia can still escalate this war. I mean,
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.800]   they could still rubble cities. Belarus could enter the war, and, you know,
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.160]   God forbid, they could even use WMD. And then, you have this idea, this dream of toppling Putin,
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:22.160]   probably, look, it could happen, but probably a fantasy. You had 200,000 protesters, pro-war
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.200]   protesters turn out in Moscow today. Nationalism is still strong in Russia. Yes, there's anti-war
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:33.520]   protesters there, but the Russian people at the moment seem to be still behind Putin.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:39.200]   And then I think you had today the foreign minister of China came out with a statement
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.720]   really throwing cold water on the idea that they support the West.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.920]   They basically denounced the West for NATO expansion. So, this
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:51.120]   whole idea of the Chinese bowing to Western media pressure, which they, in other contexts,
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.680]   call the Baizhou influence, I think that's a fantasy that is not going to happen.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:02.960]   So, look, I think that, you know, we all support the Ukrainian cause. We all support their desire
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:09.840]   for freedom, their freedom from domination, from this Russian war of aggression. But what I wonder
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:15.680]   about is whether this would be the opportune time for Washington to try and push for a
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:20.400]   ceasefire instead of a no-fly zone, and we should talk more about what that might look like.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.800]   Can I give you a psychological assessment of, I think, what's happening right now?
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.760]   Yes, great.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.360]   Just as somebody who, as you know, you guys and I were just joking, but
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.760]   six days just being mostly off the grid with my notifications off,
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:40.400]   I was really like, honestly, like you kind of like go through this dopamine fast,
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:45.440]   and what it actually helps you do is pick out better signal. And, you know, with all
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.440]   the things that we've been talking about, I think that, you know, with all respect,
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:55.680]   Sachs, I think like a lot of what you said is not really as meaningful signal as the following,
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:01.120]   which is the most important thing that happened was both sides basically said the surface area
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.680]   of a deal was very much in sight, and that they were down to three or four points. And I think
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.560]   that that didn't get reported nearly as much as it probably should have. And what I thought was
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.200]   psychologically interesting was that as soon as that was said, the next few days was when
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:20.800]   the deal was going to be up, extremely aggressively on both sides. And the way that I interpret that
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.880]   typically is having done deals, that's typically when you're closest to a deal, and you're trying
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.840]   to get the last few Ts and Cs. And in that same construct as applied to Ukraine and Russia,
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:34.400]   I suspect what's happening is they both put out the trial balloon, it was well received on both
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:39.840]   sides, the surface area is now down to a few points. I'm not saying that those are justifiable
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.760]   in the end. But I think that if both of these two parties want to come to a ceasefire, which I think
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:44.160]   it does,
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.880]   much, much closer than anybody thinks. And right now, all of this rhetoric is meant to basically
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:53.600]   try to get the other side to budge a little bit more. And so I suspect and you know, I could be
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:59.200]   completely wrong, is that we're much closer to ceasefire than anybody thinks. And I suspect that
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:03.760]   you could see something in the next two to three weeks. And I think that that's really hopeful,
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:08.240]   because you want this thing to come to an end. The thing I'm trying to parse here,
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:14.720]   and I don't know if anybody here can even answer this is how did how did we
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:22.800]   either underestimate or overestimate depending on the time, Russia's ability to invade another
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.440]   country, I think I think the thing is, we have we can't even estimate correctly. So for example,
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:33.280]   there was something that said there was 100 out of 100 Russia has 170 battalions, apparently,
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:37.920]   I don't know if that's true or not, right? Of which 100 were sent in, we don't know if that's true or
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:42.640]   not, of which Ukraine apparently destroyed 50 of which we don't know if that's true or not.
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:47.520]   So we're left to guess. And unfortunately, what that does is that people psychologically then fit
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:52.960]   as David has used in the past your priors, what are your biases? Right? What narrative fallacy
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:57.120]   do you want to believe, and then you're going to fit so the pro Russian factions will say that's
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:01.760]   entirely not true. The pro Ukrainian factions will say actually, it's even greater than that
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.080]   huge sustained military losses. The truth is somewhere in the middle that will only get
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:12.400]   accounted for after a ceasefire is in place. So I think we almost need to again, we can get caught
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:18.480]   in this fog of war, and talk about this stuff in ways which we don't accurately know. Or we can
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.800]   level up and say the thing that we both know is there was on the record statements by the foreign
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.760]   minister of Russia and the President of Ukraine, that a ceasefire and the surface area of that
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:33.840]   ceasefire is within sight. And unless something is materially changed, and then in the last three
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.480]   days, which it hasn't, it means we are really, really close to this being done.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.160]   So I agree with a lot of what Jamal said, I don't think contracts anything I said
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.480]   before, I agree that there was a big piece of news this week that caused markets to rally for
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:52.560]   three days, which is the announcement of a proposed 15 point peace deal. And the we do know sort of
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:59.440]   the key features of that deal. It means that the three big features are you Ukrainian neutrality.
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.040]   So they don't become members of NATO, you had Zelenskyy saying that NATO membership was off
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.520]   the table. Ukraine can't host foreign troops, bases or weaponry, there'd be limits on Ukraine's
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.920]   military, but they would get security guarantees from the allies. So it wouldn't be a complete demilitary
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:19.280]   ization. And then the other pieces of it were Ukraine recognizing Russia's control of Crimea,
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.440]   recognizing that's not coming back, and then some sort of independence recognized for the disputed
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:30.480]   territories in the Donbas. So I think you're right, Chamath that everybody now knows the broad
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:37.600]   contours of what a peace deal would look like. And the markets are starting to price in them
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.680]   getting to that peace deal. But I'm worried that if you look at it from the
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:48.480]   point of view of what people in Washington say, that there's no pressure here, coming from
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:54.320]   Washington, for Zelenskyy, who's basically our client, he's an American client to make a deal.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:13:01.440]   You know, if you compare this to say, the 1973 Yom Kippur War, where the US was on the side of
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.720]   Israel, but still acted as a peacemaker, and got a ceasefire done, you know, Kissinger got that
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:11.440]   deal done, even though we were on the Israeli side, you don't really hear anyone in Washington
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.560]   saying, let's get a deal done. So I hope you're right.
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:18.320]   But because you're not, we're not talking about the elephant in the room,
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:24.160]   which is that in the Yom Kippur War, the unitary resolve and the military dominance of America was
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:30.160]   undisputed. And so as a result, its ability to be the mediator was also undisputed. We've already
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.800]   talked about this when Biden called the UAE in Saudi, they wouldn't even pick up the phone. The
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:41.200]   people that are negotiating this peace treaty right now are Naftali Bennett, and Emmanuel Macron. So we're not
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.600]   at the table. So I think a lot of what we're hearing as well, is just a lot of the rejection
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:50.320]   and the psychological, you know, kind of anger that we have to not being even part of the process.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:54.480]   Maybe the world doesn't want us to have such an outsized role.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:58.960]   The point is, we've moved past that, whether you wanted us to be involved in it or not,
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:04.000]   we're not involved. And we are not the principal mediators in this. And we I hope to God,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.840]   that Israel and France and whoever else is at the table gets this done.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.960]   Yeah, I agree with that. But here's my concern is,
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.360]   I think everyone knows the broad contours of the deal. But if you're Russia, or you're Ukraine,
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:19.200]   you're getting daily reports of what's happening on the battlefield. And if you think you're
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:24.000]   winning, you have an incentive to stall the peace process to cement greater gains and get more
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.680]   leverage for those remaining details and negotiating points. And so if Zelensky thinks
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:34.400]   that the Ukrainians are making progress on the battlefield, he's gonna wait. And so neither one
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:40.720]   of them, I think, left to their own devices can be fully trusted to make a deal. I think you need the
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:48.320]   the US applying some pressure or acting in a pot in a constructive way towards the process. And I
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:53.920]   think it's a huge problem that the US is not viewed as a peacemaker. We're basically viewed as so
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.120]   partisan, and on the side of Ukraine, no one's involved.
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:02.560]   David, we've talked on this pod about us not being the global police officer of the world,
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.520]   and that other people need to stand up. So maybe the lesson here is,
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:10.480]   you know, maybe strategically, it's not like we were called on and we didn't stand up. We weren't
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.200]   called on.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:15.120]   Well, okay, that's what we assume that I mean, we don't have perfect information either. But let's,
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:19.600]   let's get to free break here. I think the other wrinkle in all of this, and I think it's quite
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:26.320]   positive, is sanctions are seeming to have a profound impact here. And people are looking
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:34.000]   at them as potentially, maybe cyber warfare. And just, you know, actual tactical warfare
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.240]   on battlefields is less important than economic warfare. And Russia has been essentially cancelled
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:46.320]   from the global economy from visa to McDonald's, to exports. And these sanctions are not just
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:51.600]   government sanctions. These are people opting into them, whether it's corporations,
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.600]   and other entities saying, we're just not going to do commerce with Russia.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:01.600]   Unfortunately, and this is something you have great expertise on. And so we're lucky to have
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.200]   you here to talk about it. People may or may not know this. I'm happy to be here.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:10.000]   This is the breadbasket of the world, they export more wheat than anybody.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.600]   And they also export fertilizer, soybeans and some other inputs,
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:23.040]   which we've talked about previously, that provide meat for the world. So what can you tell us about
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:30.720]   the downstream effects of there not being potentially or half as much crops coming out next
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:37.360]   year? And what would happen in places that are the beneficiaries or dependent on wheat and fertilizer
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.760]   from Russia? So there's an
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:43.920]   There's a number of first order and then second order effects
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:49.760]   that are not just about sanctions, but also about export controls by Russia
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:57.040]   that are creating swings in food markets like we've never seen, and will almost certainly lead
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:04.000]   to widespread famine by the end of this year at this point. So the first important point to note
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.200]   is about 15% of the world's calories come from wheat. About a third of that wheat comes from
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:16.640]   Russia, Ukraine, Russia has banned export of wheat. And the wheat spring planting season is like now
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:21.680]   this week. And there's not a lot of planting going on, you know, a lot of commodity folks are in the
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:27.040]   field trying to figure out who's actually going to go to field and plant. But no one's making,
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:32.560]   you know, the concerted effort that they normally would under normal circumstances. So not only is
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:38.960]   the current wheat supply in Russia, Ukraine blocked up and cannot make its way to countries in Africa,
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:45.120]   Africa and elsewhere. But the future planting season is now significantly at risk. And again,
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:51.440]   that's 15% of global calories. And I just to take a step back, the whole planet Earth operates on a
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:57.280]   90 day food supply. So once we stop making food, humans run out of food in 90 days.
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:02.800]   So another way to think about that is our food supply excess, our capacity in excess is about
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:08.960]   25% of our global production. So if our global production goes down by 12%, we've lost half of
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:13.440]   our global food supply. And that's not just linearly across all nations, what happens is
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:18.480]   the most vulnerable nations lose their food supply first, and the richer nations buy that food supply
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:24.160]   to secure their populations, calories. And so you very quickly see a bifurcation happen
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.120]   when you have a shortage in a food supply like this of just a few points,
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:33.360]   where suddenly famine is a real risk. And we already have about 800 million people on Earth
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:38.720]   that are subsisting on below 1200 calories a day. So this very quickly tips the bucket,
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.080]   and we're going to get to that in just a few minutes. But before we do that,
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.200]   I want to remind you that we're going to be talking about a problem that's going to be
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:50.320]   in a significant way in a number of countries that's going to be really awful. And that's just
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:56.400]   on the wheat supply and wheat planting problem. The bigger problem is the energy price plot problem
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:02.000]   and the phosphorus and potassium problem. All fertilizer is made up of nitrogen, phosphorus,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.480]   or potassium. Those are the three major types of fertilizer that farmers around the world have to
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.480]   use every year in order to grow that crop without fertilizer plants don't grow.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.480]   So the first thing that we're going to talk about is the phosphorus. And phosphorus is
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:14.480]   a very important element in the production of natural gas. Natural gas prices, as you guys know,
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:19.600]   have doubled and the futures market looks like in some places, natural gas prices going up like 4x.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:24.960]   As a result, the price of ammonia fertilizer, nitrogen based fertilizer has gone from $200
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:31.200]   a ton to $1,000 a ton. So it's five times as expensive to buy basic ammonia fertilizer
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:36.240]   today than it was a few weeks ago, or a few months ago. And so this is now leading a lot of farmers
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.240]   around. And then the other big problem is phosphorus.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.480]   So the first thing that we're going to talk about is phosphorus. And phosphorus,
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:44.320]   you know, by some estimates, I mean, you know, there's a little variation around here,
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:51.360]   but about 10% of the world's phosphate comes out of Russia. And about, you know, call it
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:57.280]   25% of the world's potassium comes out of Russia, potash. Both of those markets are blocked up,
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:01.600]   they are they are sanctioned, and they have banned exports Russia has through the rest of 2022.
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:06.480]   So around the world, the cost to make nitrogen fertilizer has skyrocketed because of natural gas
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.000]   prices, because of the Russia problem.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.960]   So Russia is not exporting potassium and phosphorus. And as a result,
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:16.400]   the price of nitrogen has gone from 200 1000, the price of potassium has gone from 200 to 700.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:22.880]   And the price of phosphorus has gone from 250 to 700. So now it's so expensive to grow a crop
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:27.520]   that a lot of farmers around the world are pulling acres out of production. And they're actually
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:31.760]   going to grow less this year than they would have otherwise, because it is so expensive,
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:36.960]   and they cannot access fertilizer locally to plant crops. So not only do we have the wheat problem,
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:42.480]   we now also have the fertilizer problem, and the acres coming out of production problem.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:46.240]   And so food supplies are going to go down even further, and this is going to become even more
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:50.640]   catastrophic. And so there's a scrambling going on right now, you know, food prices around the
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.400]   world. As a result, everyone starts buying up all the commodities, they buy up all the corn,
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.480]   they buy up the soybeans, they buy up the wheat, and the price for corn has nearly doubled,
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:03.120]   whereas, you know, from where it was in July of 2020, the price of soybeans,
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:07.520]   the price of wheat are all skyrocketing. And in a lot of countries, they cannot afford
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:14.960]   to acquire and individuals cannot afford to, to buy food with the skyrocketing commodity prices.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:19.920]   Can I ask you a question? I think it's estimated that the US food supply,
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:25.600]   if you could X out the waste would actually feed most of the developing world, because I think 30
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.800]   to 40% of all of our food is wasted. Can you do something with that?
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:33.760]   Yeah, that is actually true. A lot of that happens at the point of consumption. So it's
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:37.280]   in people's homes. So it's a reverse supply chain problem.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:43.120]   Where you know, we throw away a lot of like stale bread and cereal that goes bad or whatever.
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:47.680]   There's some in the fresh vegetables market, but generally the core
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:54.080]   calorie producing commodities are rice, wheat, potatoes, and corn.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:59.120]   Those commodities don't go bad in the supply chain, they end up getting tossed out at the end
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:02.640]   of the supply chain, which is at the point of consumption at home. So, you know, I'm not sure
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:07.040]   there's a real solution there right now. The bigger issue is like, how do you get both commodities
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:09.440]   together? And how do you get them together? And how do you get them together? And how do you get
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.320]   them together? And how do you get them together? And how do you get them together? And how do you
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.360]   get them together? And how do you get them together? And how do you get them together?
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.800]   So, you know, I think that's a big question. And I think that's a big question.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.680]   So, you know, I think that's a big question. And I think that's a big question.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:13.680]   So, you know, I think that's a big question.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.400]   There's strategic reserves that are getting opened up and being released.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:22.880]   As that starts to get the plenish diminished, and as the production kind of numbers start to come
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:27.760]   out, it looks like less acres are in production. You know, and God willing, we have a good weather
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:32.080]   year everywhere this year, because you know, a bad weather year in some markets could completely
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:36.480]   decimate the remaining supply that's coming out this year. Regardless, it is going to be a
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:42.000]   humanitarian disaster within a year. And we will see hundreds of millions of people go starving.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.600]   And there will be potentially, I think you said hundreds of millions of people,
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:50.800]   hundreds of millions of people will never happened in the history of people already
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.200]   live on below 1200 calories a year right now.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:57.440]   This is predicting that 100 over 100 million people will die because of this.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:01.040]   I don't know about death, famine, like famine is this like, you know, short of calories, you know,
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:01.840]   within that within a market.
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:05.360]   It's not like, hey, there's no food, like, you know, there will be strategic reserves
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.800]   released, there will be stuff, but it won't be enough. We just don't have enough in the
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:13.840]   way supply chains are set up. There just isn't enough. And so once again, we found another
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:20.240]   supply chain weakness, like we did in COVID over and over again, and supplies will be released.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:26.400]   But then hoarding is starting. So David, you take it after this. But the one question I had was maybe
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:31.600]   talk to me about this concept of hoarding, because there seems to be a cascading effect. And you
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:36.160]   kind of Well, yeah, it's not just talking about it a little bit as with any market guys, as you know,
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:41.360]   when there's scarcity, people come in and buy at a faster pace, you know, everyone.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:45.920]   And so this is a market dynamic. It's not like people are physically hoarding loaves of bread.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:51.200]   But commodity traders, countries, strategic reserves, they start buying up what they can get
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:55.120]   you to prepare for the famine that's coming, then prices go even higher. And then it kicks
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.400]   other people out of the market that couldn't afford to buy it. And the whole thing gets
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.360]   really ugly, really. And there's no off ramp here. There's no way to solve this.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:05.440]   Well, what freebird? Yeah, the thing I want to ask you is if we had a peace deal right now,
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:09.920]   a ceasefire, would we avoid this outcome? I mean, like, how long? How long do we have to avoid
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:17.200]   Russia to reopen fertilizer export markets now, we need natural gas prices to come down now. And we
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.960]   need them to plant the spring wheat. Those are three things that need to happen to solve this
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:26.160]   problem. If those three things don't happen, we're going into spring right now. So around the world
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:30.320]   in the northern hemisphere, farmers are making plans or planting, they're deciding how much
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.360]   fertilizer to use. They're planting, they're deciding how much fertilizer to use. They're
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.080]   planting, they're planting, they're planting, they're planting. And so as this market starts to
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:39.440]   kind of work itself out over the next few months, a lot of the commodity traders and the the ag
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.200]   departments, they publish these planting reports, and they talk about how many acres of what were
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.880]   planted, and then everyone forecast how much the supply will be. And we're going to start to see
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.800]   these uglier numbers come out over the next few weeks and months. Meanwhile, we're seeing supplies
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:56.320]   dwindle, and Russia's holding all this stuff. So you know, they're holding hostage, phosphorus,
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:01.360]   potassium, and the natural gas pricing is just what it is. Remember, there was a
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:05.680]   there are ammonia plants everywhere. There are ammonia plants and I and all ammonia plants use
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:09.440]   natural gas to create, you know, to create this nitrogen based ammonia.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.840]   Let me make a statement and I'd love your reaction.
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:20.880]   We're finding out all of these externalities that was made with underlying poor scientific
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:25.680]   rat reasoning that has caused these issues to be exacerbated. So we know, for example,
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:31.360]   that our over reliance on Russian hydrocarbons could have been mitigated with nuclear, but we fell for
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:38.720]   shoddy science and we fell for a bunch of uninformed people who ran this banner of like,
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:44.480]   environmental protection, right? So they screwed us. Okay. And those people now have meaningfully
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:49.920]   less credibility. Let me give you another cohort, freeberg. And you tell me, all the people that
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:57.040]   pushed back on GMO, and said GMO was unacceptable, it could never happen. It has to be x, y and z way.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:01.360]   And there are ways where we could have been working on,
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:27.820]   you know, the
[00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:31.360]   plants that had different mechanisms of action in order to actually absorb and retain nutrients from
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.580]   the soil. And yet, you know, we're all in this together. And we're all in this together. So, you
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.020]   know, it's a very, very strong, very strong bond. And I think that's a very, very strong bond. And I'm
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:35.400]   gonna go back to the question of, you know, the idea of what you're trying to do with the natural
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.400]   gas. And I think that's a very, very strong bond. And I think that's a very, very strong bond.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:40.780]   Just to get a single GMO trait approved in the United States today and get it to market can take
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:45.860]   seven to 13 years. And even then, you have to still go get China to approve it because they're
[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:50.220]   the biggest importer. And you have to, you know, get all these other market participants to approve
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:55.300]   it. And there are multiple agencies to get to approve it. Europe is finally the EU is finally
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:59.780]   coming back to the GMO problem. And saying, you know what precision gene editing can actually be
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:04.420]   beneficial to growing that more stuff. Now, would it have solved this particular crisis?
[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:09.860]   Sorry, can I just say what's so ridiculous about this? The fact that we have a modern agrarian
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:15.460]   economy is because we actually did figure out a way to do GMO except we used upon its square and
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:20.340]   we use successive iterations. But the minute that you try to scientifically scale it in a lab,
[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:25.300]   all of a sudden, that same process is not does not make any sense to me that
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:30.020]   it's just intellectually so inconsistent. Yeah, the thing that really scares people
[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:34.420]   about GMO. Look, I mean, I've spent a lot of time on GMOs. And the reason people are upset,
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:37.780]   I have a broader philosophical point, believe in that do you believe in that inconsistent,
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:42.260]   that intellectual inconsistency? Like, how do you think somebody from, you know, pre BC to today,
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:47.380]   I think that agriculture iterated on our No, I think agriculture itself is technology. Think
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:51.860]   about it. Humans, humans used to go out and just eat whatever was lying around what nature gave us,
[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:55.300]   then we started making rows in the ground and putting seeds and
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.420]   the ground and putting water on the ground. We engineered the earth to make
[00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:02.260]   them started to breed and then we did plant breeding and traditional plant breeding
[00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:04.740]   through normal, normal, normal, save the world.
[00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:07.300]   That genetically modifying things.
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:10.660]   It is. And then what we did with GMOs, which is the distinction, just to be really clear about
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:14.980]   the definitional distinction between GMO and traditional plant breeding. GMO is when you take
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:20.100]   DNA from another organism, and you put it in the plant's DNA to get that plant to do something very
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:25.300]   specific. And Jason, you came with me to Monsanto. I mean, you should be cautious, we should be
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:28.020]   cautious about anytime we're doing stuff like that. Right. But
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:31.940]   and then there's generally like a very visceral reaction when I make that statement,
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:35.700]   and people like wait, you're taking the DNA from bacteria and putting it in plants. And
[00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:40.100]   how do I know that's going to work? And so there's these layers of concern, which, you know, are
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:44.900]   deeply psychological layers, but we can, you know, scientifically resolve this over time. But look,
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:49.540]   at the end of the day, humans today, you guys remember last year, how much I was talking about
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:55.300]   that starch synthesis paper, and how important it was, we don't need to grow plants to make the stuff
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:29:00.580]   we need to consume. If every city around the world had a starch synthesizer, and it took CO2 from the
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:06.020]   atmosphere and water from the ocean, and had this technique developed out, it could synthesize its
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:11.620]   own calories in a physical device without needing to rely on the ammonia supply chain and the
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:16.660]   phosphate supply chain, and all of the systems that we rely on that are super outdated,
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:21.380]   that are all a scaled up industrialized version of old school agrarian techniques.
[00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:25.300]   Humans today, I think have the ability to synthesize and print food. And over the
[00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:29.220]   next couple of decades, particularly catalyzed by what's going on in Russia, Ukraine today,
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.820]   we're going to see these technologies accelerate. It's obviously where I spent a lot of my time,
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:38.420]   but I'm super excited about it. Yeah, I think we suffer from a very insidious kind of plague
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:44.820]   in the world, which is the plague of overeducated dumb people. And it's almost as if, you know,
[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:50.580]   because of their degree in the school, you give them inordinate power to make value judgments
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:55.300]   that really put the world in a very difficult position. And so when you have something like a war
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:30:01.140]   in Ukraine, it just lays everything bare. And you find all these things like, you know,
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:06.500]   another version of this example, how did an entire continent and specifically, I mean, Europe,
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:14.020]   abdicate their entire energy security to a group of environmentalists and to, you know,
[00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:19.460]   to a 16 year old girl without even thinking about what the right answer was for themselves from
[00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:25.300]   first principles. That's really crazy that that happened. And you need a war, you know, where tens
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:28.980]   of thousands of people have to die to realize that that was a really bad set of decisions that have
[00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:33.380]   been compounding for decades. Here's another example where food security is yet another one
[00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:37.940]   where, you know, we weren't able to think cleanly from first principles. And so depending on who had
[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:44.020]   more money, or who was able to create more psychological guilt or fear was able to get
[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:49.620]   an outcome that fundamentally puts the world at 100 million person plus famine.
[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:54.180]   So somehow we need to rethink how our institutions work, because we are giving folks,
[00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:01.060]   who haven't proved that they can handle power, the ability to influence outcomes,
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:06.020]   for the wrong sets of reasons. Well, it's even worse from these people you're talking about,
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:10.340]   who are smart, dumb people. They're so privileged that they're living in some
[00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:15.540]   bubble making decisions for people who have food insecurity, or energy insecurity. And it's only
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:20.660]   when COVID showed, hey, oh, semiconductors, I can't get my car that I want, because it
[00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:25.300]   doesn't have the chip in it. Or I can't get drugs, or I can't get PPE, then all of a sudden,
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:30.180]   they see the value and redundancy and supply chain. But when they were living high on the hog
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:34.740]   and had nothing to worry about in 20 different flavors of Captain Crunch, you know, they can't
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.420]   even think about people in Africa.
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:40.260]   J.K., I think it's really important to speak to the capitalist incentive and how you get there.
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:46.660]   So okay, we've globalized supply chains, because as a business, it doesn't make sense for me to do
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:51.940]   every step of the thing that I want to do, because you can get better utilization out of capex,
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:55.300]   if a system is running all the time to make stuff. So if we're going to make a lot of money, we're
[00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:58.340]   going to have to make a lot of money. And if one step of the system doesn't need the other system
[00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:03.220]   running 24/7, it's going to outsource that. And that's kind of think about like semiconductors,
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:06.820]   think about food manufacturing, right? It doesn't make sense for a farmer today
[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:11.620]   to make his own ammonia. So there's an ammonia plant that centrally makes that stuff 24/7,
[00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:15.620]   distributes it out to a bunch of farmers, that brings the cost down per unit of production.
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:21.220]   And so these systems have existed because we've had less capital with a higher ROI on capital
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:25.300]   invested at every point in the system, by, you know, distributing and have it having a
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:30.740]   you know, centralized supply chain system like this. Now, what we're looking at today
[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:35.860]   is what happens when one part of that system fails. And now I think the big trend for the
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:40.580]   next decade or two, everyone's going to have like a institutional memory of this.
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:44.260]   And you're going to see companies that are going to start to vertically integrate supply chains,
[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:48.180]   they're going to vertically integrate their, their manufacturing, we're going to see a lot
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:51.540]   of businesses make what traditionally would have been really, quote unquote,
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:55.300]   bad capex decisions and bad investment decisions. And they're gonna say, you know what, we're going
[00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:58.580]   to have redundancy because we need to have redundancy because we cannot face the cataclysmic
[00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:02.260]   kind of circumstance that we faced in the past. I also think those are, by the way, the easy
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:09.220]   decisions. I also think that there are some more complicated ones of morality that we may have also
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:13.620]   misappropriated. I'll give you one example. So if you think about energy independence of America,
[00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:19.380]   I think there's not going to be many who think that it's not critically important. Well,
[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:25.300]   then you go and say we have a short term bridge with hydrocarbons and the long term solution is
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:30.500]   renewables. But underneath renewables is the idea that you have to store these things, right? You have
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:34.580]   to store the energy you make, whether it's from wind or solar, even if it's from nuclear, okay.
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:39.220]   And all of that results in us needing batteries, while batteries need lithium.
[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:42.740]   There's enormous lithium deposits in the United States that today
[00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:49.860]   can never get access because we've decided that the you know, the upper land grouse of a state
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:55.060]   is more important than America's energy independence, right? So when push comes to shove, a
[00:33:55.060 --> 00:34:00.180]   small rat like creature is prioritized more importantly than America's energy independence.
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:04.580]   The downstream implications of that are now obvious rising costs, inflation, unemployment,
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:11.860]   potential recession, war, death, famine, is the upper land growths that fundamentally more
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:17.060]   important than all of these systemic risks to humankind. And the thing is, for a long time,
[00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:21.700]   we would never even think about the trade offs to actually think about why that decision should be
[00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:25.060]   made that way. And now we actually have the ability to read the history of the world. And
[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:27.780]   we're going to be able to make these decisions. So it's going to be really interesting to see
[00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:33.220]   whether we upend all of these existing frameworks, you know, and there's enormous
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:37.940]   environmental lobbies that have been created that have raised hundreds of millions, billions of
[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:43.780]   dollars to fight these battles systematically wherever they come up. And in some ways, now what
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:48.020]   people will say, well, you've really prevented progress, and you've actually done more damage.
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:52.500]   That's going to be a really interesting point in our good intent evolution,
[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.820]   good intent, save the environment, and then there are
[00:34:54.820 --> 00:35:01.700]   downstream impacts. Let's go to Sacks about the sanctions, we saw a level of sanctions we didn't
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:09.620]   expect. They were ferocious, they were unilateral, they they're, you know, undeniably having an
[00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:13.780]   impact. Do you think Putin would be at the table? Do you think these sanctions are
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:19.300]   really having a dramatic impact? And do you think that there'll be a tool that we should use in the
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:23.860]   future? Or do you think maybe we need to be more thoughtful about them? In other words,
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:28.980]   cancel culture comes up as a, an analogy here, people are saying, oh, it's like cancel culture
[00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:35.060]   for a country. I think it's pretty great that a country that is murdering their neighbors doesn't
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:40.980]   get to participate. But obviously, you can have some serious concerns if fertilizer and supply
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:46.020]   chain issues, as we just discussed, are going to cause famine. So what's the balance here?
[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:52.900]   Yeah, I think it's a great another great example of, you know, we're not thinking through the
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:54.340]   second and third order consequences.
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:36:01.140]   Of what we're doing, we're just reacting. And so to freeberg's point. So, you know, first of all,
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:05.460]   we have to realize this was more than just sanctions. This was a complete severing of
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:11.860]   economic ties. I mean, basically, every Western country pulled up stakes out of Russia. They did
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:16.500]   it on their own, too. I mean, they did it because for the reasons you said, because they wanted to
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:21.460]   make a statement that what Putin did was wrong. So every Russian who was working for one of these
[00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:24.100]   companies basically got fired, and all the stores closed and
[00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:30.180]   so on. So I think I think it is the repercussions of it are going to be severe. However, these
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:35.700]   things, the economics of it take time to play out. And so do I think it creates pressure on
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:42.020]   Putin to make a deal? Yes. But, you know, if the if this is going to be determined on the battlefield
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:47.140]   one way or another in the next month, do I think it has time to operate in that timeframe?
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:53.860]   Probably not. And I think what's likely to happen here is that
[00:36:53.860 --> 00:37:00.100]   in the same way that the real repercussions of this war are going to be felt in grain production
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:06.420]   in six months, you know, there is an economic tsunami headed for our own economy as a result
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:14.020]   of the blowback from basically severing, you know, 144 million Russians from the global economy.
[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:17.780]   There's also going to be geopolitical blowback. I mean,
[00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:23.620]   you know, I think it's very likely that the way this is going to play out geopolitically,
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:28.900]   is that Russia will become a Chinese client. And, you know, all of those natural resources
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:36.420]   that China produces, the gas, you know, all the mineral wealth, that those resources are going
[00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:42.100]   to flow on a conveyor belt on a belt and road conveyor belt from Moscow to Beijing, and they're
[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:46.660]   going to fuel the Chinese economy. Yeah, yes and no, because the reality is,
[00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:53.060]   the thing we have to remember is China is still a fundamentally export driven economy, of which 35%
[00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:59.060]   just alone goes to the United States. When you add in Europe and other OECD countries,
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:05.220]   it's almost 60%. So I think the idea that all of a sudden you, Russia will be able to backdoor all
[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:09.700]   of these things through China into the rest of the world, I think is not really realistic. And
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:14.820]   this is actually why I think the rhetoric is so high. Because those two countries specifically
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:18.500]   are put in a very difficult situation. Like what do you think the China calculus on Taiwan is
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:23.140]   looking what's happening to Russia? Hasn't completely what do you think it is? It's completely
[00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:28.420]   off the table, completely off the table, they would never consider invading to Taiwan, knowing
[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:32.900]   that it would put Apple in a position or other companies that are entwined in the Chinese
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:37.780]   economy. I think they would have to again, I've said before, everybody has was always, you know,
[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:42.900]   sort of like lamb busting economic sanctions, you know, even on this pod people, it's never going to
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:47.620]   work, it doesn't do anything. And it turns out it's just not true. To be clear, I think
[00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:52.900]   sanctions are an appropriate way to create economic pressure so that we can get a ceasefire and a peace
[00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:58.980]   deal made. Okay, so I do believe in the same way that I believe we should arm the Ukrainians so they
[00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:05.140]   can defend themselves while I'm against a no fly zone. The issue is just are we actually using the
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:12.260]   leverage that we're creating to drive this process to a success? I'm trying to ceasefire process
[00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:18.740]   to a successful resolution. Because if we just make this the new normal, which is, you know, a,
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:22.660]   basically an insurrection in Ukraine that drags on forever,
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:28.660]   and the China and Russia cut off from the global economy and becomes a client of China.
[00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:33.620]   I think there's a parade of horribles that flow from that and freebird just outlined one of them,
[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:37.300]   which is hundreds of millions of people across the world potentially starving. So
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:43.540]   my point about sanctions is not that we shouldn't have done them. But there are going to be big
[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:48.900]   repercussions for our economy if we don't resolve the situation in Ukraine.
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:52.420]   Let's do best case worst case with these new this new economic order,
[00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:58.820]   here an economic sanction ability that the West has now demonstrated, you know, quite effectively.
[00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:05.140]   For me, the best case scenario here is, if you want to participate in the global economy and
[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:13.380]   globalism to global globalization 2.0 means you're going to have to be hit some base behavior level
[00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:17.780]   of being a good actor in the world if you want to participate in the wider economy.
[00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:22.180]   Therefore, as Chamath just pointed out, I think quite correctly, Taiwan's off the
[00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:29.620]   table. I mean, China does already is having massive economic downturn and headwinds. The idea
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:33.700]   that they would face what Russia is facing right now in terms of sanctions globally would be
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:39.620]   cataclysmic for them. So do we think what's the what's the best case in your mind, freebird,
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:44.420]   the worst case of this new economic sanctions that we've just outlined best case worst case,
[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:51.940]   much of this is driven by Russian decision making, not just our decision making. And
[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:56.260]   so you know, there's a lot of question marks around what they're gonna they've said,
[00:40:56.260 --> 00:41:05.300]   definitively, we are banning all fertilizer exports through 2022. Okay, so like, does changing
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:10.340]   a sanction model at this point, get enough resolve for them to kind of come back to the table?
[00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:16.260]   Do we need to kind of weave that into some discussion peace discussion that they're having
[00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:21.700]   with Ukraine, I think there's going to need to be this multilateral, like global, either support,
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:26.500]   or partnership model, that's going to have to kind of emerge for this to all get resolved
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:30.740]   positively. I don't think that it's just about Russia and Ukraine agreeing to a bunch of terms,
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:36.420]   we're all going to be affected by what's going on and what Russia has chosen to do back to us. And
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:40.980]   we all think we're in the power and we've blocked them and destroyed the ruble and, you know, knock
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:46.420]   them back to the Stone Age, yada, yada. But like, we're hurting ourselves far more than we realize.
[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:49.380]   And we have to go get something back from Russia in order to resolve this.
[00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:51.460]   So nuanced, I'm not sure I totally agree with you.
[00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:57.780]   I actually think that, you know, necessity, what is it? Necessity is the mother of invention.
[00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:02.420]   I think that this has the ability just circling back to what we said before,
[00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:08.740]   for us to rewrite all of these other decisions that were frankly not necessarily rooted in
[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:13.220]   either first principles or long strategic thought, in a way that can actually improve
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:18.180]   the state of play for everybody, not just including us for the next 50 or 100 years.
[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:21.220]   So I'm not completely convinced that it's as catastrophically bad as you
[00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:26.740]   think. Well, what about this, Friedberg, if we were thinking about food stability,
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:31.380]   you mentioned your slurry and, you know, being able to make these calories without actually
[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:36.900]   planting any food. If we are not going anywhere, if you call it a slurry, but yeah, okay,
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:43.300]   let's call it a protein bar. Like, like, ultimately, Jason, we can actually create pasta,
[00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:47.060]   bread, great rice. I mean, that's where this all goes. Perfect. By the way,
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:50.980]   just so you guys know, I want to frame this up. It's super important. 60% of the world's
[00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:57.060]   calories come from carbohydrates, which are basically two molecules, amylose and amylopectin.
[00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:01.060]   Okay, that's what makes up starch. So if we can synthesize amylose and amylopectin, we can
[00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:04.980]   make it into any plant. How long would it take? How long would it take? What would it cost
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:11.380]   to build your pasta making machine and rice making machine, you know, to have more food?
[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:15.780]   These are decades long scale up problems, right? This is not like this is like, hey, we got to follow a moon mission.
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:20.740]   So it's similar to nuclear or solar and batteries? Exactly. Yeah, yeah. Got it. Okay. But there are
[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:25.540]   solutions to this. Look, I mean, this is why I keep coming back to saying like, we're evolving
[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:32.900]   the global economy and planet Earth away from this model of centralized industrial manufacturing
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:36.820]   into a production system that looks more distributed, more decentralized
[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:42.180]   with better technology. And that's really a big trend for the century for our global economy.
[00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:46.660]   And that's why right now I think the near term trend is in de-globalization, people making less
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:50.500]   capital efficient decisions that create redundancy in supply chains. And there's a lot of ways to
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:56.580]   as investors to play that, by the way, Sachs, what are your thoughts on maybe the high order
[00:43:56.580 --> 00:44:03.540]   bit for the West being a race to resiliency or a race to redundancy in energy in semiconductors,
[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:08.500]   this race to resiliency in food supply? Yeah, I mean, look, trade creates economic wealth,
[00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:12.180]   but it also creates dependency. And we're realizing the downsides of having that
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:16.980]   dependency for dependent or Europe is dependent on Russian Cass. Or you know,
[00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:20.260]   you saw during COVID, we've become dependent on Chinese
[00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:24.260]   pharmaceuticals, all the pharma companies have moved their manufacturing over there.
[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:29.300]   And then you know, that got when China was rattling the saber, because we were blaming them
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:34.020]   for COVID. This was back in 2020. They all of a sudden started implying we might not get access
[00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:38.340]   to pharmaceuticals. So look, we are gonna have to rethink all those trade relationships. You can't
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:45.940]   have trade without trust. Because, again, if you are empowering the producer to cut you off when
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:50.020]   you make yourself dependent on that. So look, I think we're gonna have to rethink all of that. But
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:54.420]   I go back to your best case, worst case question. Yes, I was trying to get somebody in there.
[00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:58.660]   I think it's a good question. And you know, I hear it lay out the best case and then the worst.
[00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:05.140]   So the best case, look, the best case is this sort of the Fukuyama argument, the sort of the
[00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:09.940]   from argument is this Western triumphalism, which is like sanctions are going to drive
[00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:14.820]   the Russians into submission, they're going to topple Putin, the people are going to rise up,
[00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:19.780]   they're going to lose this war, we are going to strike a great blow against autocracy.
[00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:23.860]   And liberal democracy is going to win. Okay, I understand that argument. Okay, now,
[00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:27.940]   what's the worst case scenario? Worst case scenario is,
[00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:32.420]   Freeburg's right, we end up with hundreds of millions of people starving, the war
[00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:39.300]   drags on because Russians aren't going to give up. So the sanctions, you know, while hurting the
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:43.860]   Russians, don't end the war, and in fact, drive them into the arms of the Chinese. You know, the
[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:48.180]   Russians have been called a big gas station with nukes. That gas station will now fill up the
[00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:49.540]   Chinese economy, henceforth.
[00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:50.740]   Kevin Kennedy :
[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:55.940]   Worsening the balance of power in Cold War Two. And then there's a big, you know, tsunami or
[00:45:55.940 --> 00:46:01.540]   boomerang headed for the US economy. We have a recession later this year as gas prices go
[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:11.620]   to $7 and $10 a gallon. And so it ends up hurting us. And so I certainly see the case for sanctions.
[00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:19.300]   But I wonder if people are really thinking through the downside scenarios. And what I do think is
[00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:25.220]   that if that the removal of sanctions should be certainly something we're affirmatively putting
[00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:30.980]   on the table in these ceasefire negotiations, and that sounds obvious, but I saw a tweet from
[00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:33.940]   Ian Bremmer, who's sort of part of the foreign policy establishment.
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:34.500]   Ian Bremmer : Think tank guy.
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:37.220]   Kevin Kennedy : Think tank guy, who has been pretty good on like-
[00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:37.620]   Ian Bremmer : He's smart.
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:40.420]   Kevin Kennedy : He's smart, and he's been good on no-fly zone. He's been
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:43.460]   saying the same things I've been saying, like, guys, this is tantamount to a declaration of war,
[00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:48.740]   we're not going there. Also basically saying that, listen, no matter what the Russians do, we are not
[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:53.380]   going to get into war three here. He's been cool-headed about that. But he also tweeted that,
[00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:58.980]   listen, as long as Putin's in control of Russia, we can't ever do business with them again.
[00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:04.100]   Sanctions are sticking around basically forever. And I just wonder if that is
[00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:11.060]   an overreaction. If we're going to make that policy, I'd rather see us as America be willing
[00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:18.500]   to put economic relations back on the table in this peace process, as opposed to saying the
[00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:23.060]   Russians are cut off forever. Because otherwise, they're just going to become a Chinese client
[00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:26.020]   state. I don't see how that benefits us long term. Kevin Kennedy :
[00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:30.420]   Well, again, I did, but again, David, what do you think they do with China? What are they going to
[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:35.700]   do? Take 60% of their goods and still export them to us, even though it just contains Russian
[00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:41.460]   materials that are now considered contraband? So they can't absorb it economically, is my point.
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:44.900]   There's not enough demand outside these OECD countries to absorb all of that.
[00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:47.380]   Kevin Kennedy : Well, here's what I think-
[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:47.940]   Kevin Kennedy : It's just math. It's just math. It's just math.
[00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:49.540]   It's just mathematically not possible.
[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:53.140]   David Schawel : I think, so look, I think you make a point,
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:56.740]   but I think if you're going to look at this from like a 50,000 foot level, I think there's like two
[00:47:56.740 --> 00:48:00.900]   grand narratives about what is happening in the world. One narrative, sort of the
[00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:06.660]   neocon sort of liberal hegemony narrative is that we're in a great battle between democracy
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:12.420]   and autocracy. The other narrative is that we're in Cold War II, is that it's more of a great power
[00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:17.380]   rivalry between the US and China. I tend to think that the latter is where we're really at in the
[00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:22.900]   world. And the reason why I say that is you look at, there's a lot of autocracies who frankly,
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:26.020]   we support because we want them on our side. For example,
[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:34.340]   you know, Turkey is run by an autocrat. You know, Erdogan is becoming more autocratic. In Egypt,
[00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:41.140]   we had sort of democracy there for a brief moment when Mubarak got overthrown. Guess what? They
[00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:46.660]   elected the Muslim Brotherhood. And we didn't like that too much. And now we got General Al-Sisi
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:53.860]   in charge. We like that a lot better. You know, we are still allies with the Saudis, and they're
[00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:59.140]   a more autocratic government. And so, I tend to think that, you know, the better way to describe
[00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:03.780]   what's happening in the world is a balance of power rivalry between the US and China,
[00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:10.100]   which is only going to pick up momentum in the coming decades. And we have to think about who's
[00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:16.100]   on our side of the ledger, and who's on their side of the ledger. And, you know, I think, at this
[00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:21.780]   point, it's, we've pretty much driven Russia completely onto the Chinese side of the ledger.
[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:25.380]   And I think it's gonna have like very bad consequences for us.
[00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:31.540]   All right, let's segue from here into the economy, inflation, and markets.
[00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:39.300]   In a previous episode, Chamath, you talked about the psychological cycle of, you know,
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:44.100]   ignoring good news, then accepting it, being outraged by it, and then maybe not taking the good
[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:45.540]   news.
[00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:52.100]   In the bad news column, obviously, inflation continues. Last six months of CPI numbers,
[00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:58.660]   year over year, obviously. September 5.4. I'll fast forward to November 6.8, January 7.5,
[00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:06.740]   February 7.9. Excluding food and energy, core inflation still rose 6.4%. That being said, we
[00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:14.180]   have 11.x million jobs available for Americans, 5 or 6 million people unemployed who are looking for
[00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:15.540]   work. Obviously, there will be some unemployment, but that's not the case. There will be some
[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:21.700]   mismatch in terms of geography and skills there. And then corporate earnings, great,
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:27.620]   but a recession possibly looming. Where are you on this? And obviously, the markets bottomed out. So
[00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:31.380]   where are you at with the economy? Hope, fear, and otherwise?
[00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:39.140]   Well, I think that we're in the midst of what I would call a melt up. So, you know,
[00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:43.700]   probably the next month, month and a half. There really isn't much quote, unquote, "melt up" in the
[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:43.700]   economy. There really isn't much quote, unquote, "melt up" in the economy. There really isn't much, quote,
[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:43.860]   unquote, "melt up" in the economy. There really isn't much quote, unquote, "melt up" in the economy. There really
[00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:43.860]   isn't much quote, unquote, "melt up" in the economy. There really isn't much quote, unquote, "melt up" in the economy. There really
[00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:48.140]   there really isn't much "bad news" that hasn't been priced
[00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:52.300]   in. The thing that I've learned over the last few years is that
[00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:58.600]   markets don't actually care what the news is. They can process
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:03.100]   good news and bad news equally well. What they despise is the
[00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:07.800]   uncertainty of what the news could be. So this week was
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:13.380]   really important because we had two huge buckets of uncertainty
[00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:16.320]   taken out of the market. So the one we've already talked about,
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:20.220]   which is when the market saw that there was a surface area of
[00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:22.980]   a deal between Ukraine and Russia, that was really
[00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:26.280]   constructive. Because neither side would have signaled
[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:30.300]   something if both parties were very far apart. So that meant to
[00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:33.360]   the markets, we're a few weeks out from something getting done.
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:36.420]   And then the second thing was Jerome Powell and the Federal
[00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:40.620]   Reserve. They finally had their meeting, they raised rates 25
[00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:43.020]   basis points. But even more importantly,
[00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:46.320]   they gave you a very prescriptive forecast of what the
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:50.340]   next year will look like at a minimum, and possibly even two
[00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:54.960]   years. And once you could have that, you were able to then go
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:58.200]   and redo all of your expectations. And what people
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:02.940]   realized was, okay, you know, inflation may actually start to
[00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:06.120]   get tamed in the back half of the year, the economy is still
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:09.660]   quite strong. And we could actually support two, two and a
[00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:12.780]   half percent interest rates, and still actually have a very good
[00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:12.960]   market.
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.780]   And the economy is going to actually grow really well. And so
[00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:18.240]   what you've seen in the last three or four days is a reaction
[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:26.100]   to the loss of uncertainty. And so there really isn't now. The
[00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:29.940]   only thing the flying the ointment could be if the war all
[00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:32.760]   of a sudden escalates, not that it gets dragged on, because at
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:35.880]   that point, that's also I think, been priced in. But if something
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:39.540]   very meaningfully different, and some and Russia, in this case,
[00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:41.220]   ratchets up the intensity.
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:46.980]   I mean, I think that's a very long tail, chemical weapons
[00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:49.620]   seems a possibility, or corporate bombing. I think these
[00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:52.620]   are all very, very low probability events. But in the
[00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:55.560]   absence of these things, you basically have really
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:58.560]   constructive dynamics right now for at least the next month and
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:52:59.880]   a half, maybe even two months.
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:05.460]   How much of this has to do with retail investors who were Yolo
[00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:10.320]   hodlers, speculators, stimmy checks, getting super active for
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:12.360]   two years, and then maybe getting super spooked right now,
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:12.480]   and maybe needing to do something else.
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:14.760]   And then maybe needing the money to deploy in their lives.
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:19.080]   Look, the thing to remember, and I hate to be this blunt, but it's true.
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:29.700]   Retail is not a very good signal of anything. In fact, if you actually look at retail flows,
[00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:35.640]   typically, you will make money by doing the exact opposite of what retail does. And I posted this in
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:42.240]   the group chat to you guys, you know, every single day of since the beginning of this year, retail was
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:48.420]   a net buyer. In all of those days, the market got punched in the face. Finally, at the beginning of
[00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:54.660]   March, retail capitulated. Right. And I posted that same day. And I said, guys, this is the
[00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:58.860]   moment to buy. And it lo and behold, what happened, the markets rallied meaningfully
[00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:04.620]   from that point. And the reason is because they were going into the end of q1, you have a huge
[00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:09.900]   tax bill due in April 15, people were starting to just finally give up, they were buying every
[00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:12.000]   single day, and they finally gave up. But that could be a huge tax bill. And that's why I'm so happy to be here.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:17.280]   But that capitulation was the moment that you buy. So if anything, retail is is the you know,
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:22.080]   you know, I've said before you fade your faith list. You know, retail flows are something you
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:26.280]   typically will make money by fading by doing the exact opposite of whatever retail is doing.
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:30.420]   And you just need to have access to that information. If you have access to it,
[00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:36.900]   you can kind of, you know, profit from it. So where are we going from here? Probably up,
[00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:41.760]   David, you've been pessimistic. We're seeing a lot of changes in the private market,
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:46.860]   funding rounds taking longer, a lot of funds getting closed, you know, venture funds, that is,
[00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:53.400]   but seems like a lot more diligence is being done the time meantime to closing a deal has definitely
[00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:57.900]   extended massively. What's your betting strategy now as a venture capitalist,
[00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:02.220]   I think that there's going to be a trickle down effect of what's happened in the market to
[00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:08.040]   privates and the valuations are going to go back to their pre COVID levels. I mean, AR multiples
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:11.520]   pre COVID were like 20, not 100. So we're seeing a massive, massive, massive, massive, massive, massive,
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:17.220]   massive repricing of deals. And that's going to continue. And I don't think it's just going to be
[00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:22.620]   this like transient effect, everything's going to bounce back in a few weeks. On the public markets,
[00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:26.400]   the defining characteristic of these markets is volatility. I mean, the VIX, which is the measure
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:33.060]   of volatility is at one of its all time highs. And so it's true that over the past week, we saw a nice
[00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:40.680]   sort of melt up or rally. Because there was speculation about this peace deal, the Financial
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:41.280]   Times had that.
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:48.060]   article on the 15 point plan. Chamath is right that if that peace deal gets signed, I think the
[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:54.720]   market rally strongly because, you know, it went up considerably just on hopes that it might be
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:59.700]   signed. But on the other hand, if this peace process falls apart, I think the market will
[00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:05.580]   give back all those gains. And then some I think we are nowhere near out of the woods on all the
[00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:11.040]   risky scenarios that could develop from this war. I think that if there is no peace deal,
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:17.640]   I think you can almost expect Russia to escalate in the war. They have said this is an existential
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:23.940]   issue for them. I think that would mean at a minimum, you know, heavy bombing of Ukrainian
[00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:29.520]   cities, and then they'll step up the pressure even more on Biden and Washington to get militarily
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:34.440]   involved. This situation could still spin out of control. So, you know, I think in the absence of
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:38.940]   peace deal, and then finally, we have all the risks of recession, we definitely are seeing a
[00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:43.740]   slowdown in the economy right now. And I think if this war continues, and we don't get the spring
[00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:50.100]   planning and things keep deteriorating, I think we're headed for a very serious recession in this
[00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:54.240]   country. I think we'll go from slowdown to recession. So, if I were advising Biden,
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:59.220]   of course, no one's listening to me. But if I were advising Biden, I would be telling Biden,
[00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:04.200]   listen, Mr. President, we are going to have a horrible midterms in November. And, you know,
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:08.700]   we are going to have a really hard time in 2024 if this war continues. And
[00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:12.840]   you know, we head down into recession, or any of the other catastrophes that could happen,
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:18.600]   we need to push for a peace deal right now. And the US should be playing a constructive
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:25.020]   role and we should be applying pressure wherever we can to make a deal because the broad contours
[00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:30.960]   of this deal to my point have been set. I don't think any of the details now that we know, look,
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:35.940]   it's about Crimea, it's about Donbas, it's about neutrality. None of the details that we're still
[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:38.400]   fighting over are more important than getting a peace.
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:42.720]   Right now. And if I were in the White House, I'd be singly pushing for that.
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:51.060]   Yeah, it's a complicated there. The counter to that obviously, is this could be you know,
[00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:55.500]   the beginning of the end for Putin. And you know, even if that's a 10% chance or 20% chance,
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:58:01.440]   the possibility that in our lifetime, you know, Russia could have a leadership change could be
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:05.760]   tremendous. Obviously, it's a coin toss, which way it goes. But change could be phenomenal.
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:08.220]   So look, that's certainly in the cards.
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:12.900]   And, and look, if somehow magically Putin got toppled and replaced with a Democrat,
[00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:18.240]   that would be a wonderful thing. However, before it's rare, but it happens. Yeah.
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:19.920]   Well, tell me when it when does it happen?
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:23.880]   East Germany, right? We tore down the wall.
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:30.240]   Yeah, I mean, that was a reunification. Here's the basic problem is we understand the Russians
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:34.740]   in the Russian system, you've got all these oligarchs are basically like bosses or mob bosses.
[00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:39.180]   And then Putin's like the boss of bosses, right? So what are the odds if you take out the boss of
[00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:45.300]   bosses, that he's replaced with someone who's a Democrat versus the next biggest, baddest boss?
[00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:51.060]   I think, you know, look, that that's certainly a possibility. But my concern is that when you play
[00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:55.800]   for maximalist upside like that, you're also taking maximalist downside. And a lot of people
[00:58:55.800 --> 00:59:00.720]   have made this point that look, if Putin's life is on the line, he's gonna be more willing to do
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:06.060]   anything. And I think the the better approach and you've heard people mention this idea of the
[00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:11.580]   Golden Bridge from Sun Tzu, which is give your enemy a golden bridge to retreat. I mentioned it
[00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:17.700]   so that he's not fighting for his life. That was a really clever framework, J.K.
[00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:23.280]   I think. I mean, there must be an offer. If you guys went and created a tally, and I'm not trying
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:27.840]   to be Debbie down here. But, you know, since the advent of the CIA, the number of times that we
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:30.240]   have tried to incite regime change,
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:33.780]   and then the number of times it's been successful, what is that percentage?
[00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:36.780]   I mean, we don't know, because we don't know how many times we've tried.
[00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:41.160]   Well, we know, we know of many attempts. And yeah, I mean, we've chased a lot of two outers.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:44.880]   J.K., every time we try it, we either get the same or worse. So for example,
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:49.380]   Syria, we tried to get rid of Assad, he's still there. And now it's worse. Afghanistan,
[00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:52.980]   we tried it, the Taliban are back in power. Well, no, but hold on, we finished.
[00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:55.560]   To take it to the calculation is what if it does change?
[00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:59.580]   Hold on, Iraq, we got rid of Saddam. And now we've handed that country to
[00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:03.000]   Iran on a silver platter, the ayatollahs control it.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:09.660]   Qaddafi in Libya, we got rid of him because he was so horrible. And now that country is in chaos.
[01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:11.520]   You've got to try open air slave markets.
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:19.800]   We tried in Ukraine, we tried in Ukraine in 2014. So our track record is not super good.
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:26.880]   Yeah, no, I mean, I think regime change is like chasing someone out or something.
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:29.520]   You know, if we were a company, at some point, we would have been pipped for
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:34.980]   our ability to do regime change. I don't think it's a great strategy. I'm not necessarily
[01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:39.000]   advocating for it. But I'm not saying that I'm saying whether or not it's a good strategy. I
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.020]   think that we are particularly not good at it. Yeah, we need a performance improvement plan on
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:47.160]   that front. We should just I think we should just stop trying that we shouldn't be going for a regime
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:50.820]   change. We should be this is good. Quite that you and I had this thing where I said, you and I are
[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:55.500]   in sync that we both want to contain dictators, and maybe isolation and you're like, I'm not into
[01:00:55.500 --> 01:01:01.320]   isolation. So I think a definition of like, what is the strategy for containment, going forward,
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:07.380]   post a peace deal with Russia? And isolationism, you know, I guess is a bit of a trigger word is
[01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:12.360]   loaded. But well, yeah, I'm not an isolationist next person, I would describe my strategy as
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:16.920]   selective engagement, meaning that we still engage internationally on behalf of vital American
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:21.600]   interests and our core interests. But we don't stick our fingers in the pie of the internal
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.900]   affairs of all these countries all over the world to try and ferment regime change.
[01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:29.580]   So for example, like what's an example of a vital American interest, I would say,
[01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:36.300]   standing up to China in the sense that we do not want them dominating Asia and becoming a
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:39.840]   peer competitor to the United States that can then challenge us all over the world. So
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:43.980]   some more pragmatist on it. And I would be more proud of we can be isolationist with North Korea,
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:49.260]   because there's literally nothing they can do for us. And look, I would not be throwing countries
[01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:54.660]   like Turkey and Egypt and Saudi Arabia out of our coalition in Cold War Two, because
[01:01:54.660 --> 01:02:01.260]   we don't like the the nature of their governments. And I'm not saying I support autocracy. I don't know.
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:06.660]   But the reality is dialogue is reasonable, because if you don't, then the other side will,
[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:13.740]   the foreign policy playbook is going to get fundamentally rewritten after this Russia Ukraine
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:22.140]   war, in large part because of the effectiveness of government sanctions plus corporate social
[01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:24.180]   responsibility, whatever you want to call that CSR.
[01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:28.920]   public sentiment, wokeism, culture, whatever you want to call it. Yes, I agree.
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:35.580]   But the combination of these two things has proved to be incredibly effective at setting the stage for
[01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:41.280]   some sort of compromise or regime change, the spectrum of outcomes is there. But the point is,
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:45.720]   that's an incredibly unique set of circumstances where before we never would have thought an
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:52.020]   economy that large or a country that important on the world stage would ever have compromised
[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:53.700]   in the absence of military intervention.
[01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:58.680]   And I think that that's important to think about as we think about what our forward going China policy
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:05.280]   looks like, I think really, like the, the importance of like the OECD, right, the importance
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:11.520]   of all these organized nations that consume from China, becoming more organized now probably makes
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:16.680]   more sense. I said this before in a tweet, but the importance of the US dollar has become completely
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:22.080]   primary, which has been an incredible benefit, you know, benefit of what has happened because of this
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:27.060]   war, you know, very small silver linings in the grand scheme of all this humanitarian crisis,
[01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:31.260]   but those are going to be really important things that the United States can seize on. So,
[01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:36.480]   you know, we may in some ways have have had some diminished power in order to facilitate peace in
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:42.540]   this in this conflict. But the downstream capital that we could accumulate by organizing these
[01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:45.960]   countries more effectively, I think could be really important. And then separately,
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:51.180]   we have to have a moral conversation in the United States about all these things, like
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:55.560]   environmental laws, like our approach to agriculture that may have been underwritten.
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:56.460]   Absolutely. Yes.
[01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:57.780]   With faulty logic.
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:59.820]   A little more pragmatism would go a long way.
[01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:04.380]   Yes, it would. I'm a little more pessimistic about our foreign policy establishment. And
[01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:07.920]   part of the reason I say this is because I'm very disappointed in the Republicans,
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:13.020]   the Republicans used to be the party of vital national interest, meaning America did not get
[01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:17.520]   involved all over the world, unless we had a vital national interest. You just never hear
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:21.120]   them making that case anymore. It's all the way back to sort of Bush doctrine.
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:26.220]   And, you know, as an example, they're all pushing for the no-fly zone. They're all pushing for the
[01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:28.500]   delivery of the MiGs despite- They want war.
[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:30.720]   Just say the words.
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:34.920]   They're weird. I mean, those right wingers are crazy. Why are they so-
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:35.520]   They want war.
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.020]   I've been very critical. I mean, I've been-
[01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:39.060]   Why do they want to go to the war on this? I don't understand their end game.
[01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:40.020]   Well, I think there's two possibilities.
[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:41.820]   Is it just machoism? Machismo?
[01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:43.380]   Anxiety.
[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:46.020]   I think there's two possibilities. I think-
[01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:46.980]   What is it, Freebrook? What is it?
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:47.640]   Anxiety.
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:48.660]   Yeah.
[01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:50.640]   And this is why I predicted war.
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:54.240]   I think that turned out to be a great prediction.
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:54.780]   You got that one right.
[01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:58.200]   Look, I've been very disappointed in the Republicans. And I think here's what I
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:02.700]   think is going on. I think if any of those Republicans, like say Mitt Romney or something,
[01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:07.440]   and look, I think Lindsey Graham is just a crazy sort of warmonger. But you take someone
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:13.800]   like Mitt Romney who's basically saying all of these sort of more bellicose and escalatory things,
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:20.400]   if he was actually in Biden's shoes, I bet he'd be making the same decisions as Biden.
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:27.240]   Because he would not want to risk war three. But it's such a cheap, easy, partisan political attack
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:31.020]   to say that Biden is being weak and he's not doing everything he can.
[01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:34.140]   I don't think he's being weak at all. I think history will look back and think two things
[01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:40.500]   about this whole thing with the American lens. The first thing was, for whatever set of reasons,
[01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:45.540]   we lost it and we diminished some stature in the world as a perceived arbitrator and
[01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:50.160]   mediator in these kinds of conflicts. But separately, I do think Biden has done a very good
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:55.620]   job in seeing the forest from the trees. He held the line on military intervention, and he has
[01:05:55.620 --> 01:06:00.960]   really ratcheted up the ability for others to impose economic sanctions beside and behind the
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:05.460]   United States. And I think that will turn out to be a masterstroke. I give him credit. And I think
[01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:09.480]   that he deserves to be acknowledged for that. I'm going to agree with you on that because I think
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:15.480]   the Biden has done an amazing job of just saying outright, we're not going to war. We are not
[01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:19.920]   starting a war with free, full stop. That takes a lot of courage. That takes a lot of courage.
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:24.000]   I mean, and Sachs, you've lauded him. I think that shows some intellectual honesty on your part. And
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.560]   to your point, Chamath, there's a reason why we lost our credibility. These misadventures,
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:34.680]   as Sachs calls them, in the Middle East have been disastrous. We made huge mistakes, and we need to
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:39.600]   take a different approach. I'll give Trump a compliment. He didn't start any wars. And if you
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:44.280]   look at every president who came before him in our lifetime, every time they start two or three
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:47.880]   conflicts, and he was like, we're going to have a no war policy. And now you got Biden say,
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:49.680]   we're not going to go to war either. This could be a disaster. And I think that's a great way to
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:53.700]   think about it. This could be a tipping point. And our focus, I think the ultimate checkmate
[01:06:53.700 --> 01:07:00.000]   should be Biden coming out and the EU coming on saying, we are going to start a race to resiliency.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.480]   And here's how it's going to look. Jason, it's an incredible point that you just made. I just
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:12.240]   want to reiterate it. Since Reagan, I can explicitly point out incremental conflicts that
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:17.400]   the President of the United States has approved and greenlit to get us into since Reagan.
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:19.440]   We've been at seven wars.
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:19.980]   We've been alive.
[01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:23.640]   We've been in seven wars since the end of the Cold War. It's amazing. The American people.
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:26.940]   Trump was the only one that did not start a new war. And so far Biden.
[01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:30.660]   You want to know why? Because he was a populist. And the people of the United States of America
[01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:36.180]   don't want these crazy wars. They are sick of all these wars. It is the foreign policy
[01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:41.820]   establishment that is pushing for all of these wars. And listen, why? And Obama the same way.
[01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:48.240]   Obama beat Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination because he was against the Iraq War,
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:49.200]   and she was for it.
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:49.980]   Yeah.
[01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:54.720]   Obama had the right instincts on Ukraine. He did not want to escalate the situation. Remember
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:08:00.240]   in 2014 when they took Crimea, he said America does not have a vital national interest that
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:02.580]   justifies us going to war. He was right.
[01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:05.820]   It was the President that tried to incite regime change. It's plausible that he didn't know.
[01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:11.460]   Right. And you want to know why? You want to know why? Because the State Department lifers,
[01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:18.960]   you know who incited that? Our Under Secretary of State for Russian Affairs was Victoria Nuland,
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:24.480]   who was a foreign policy advisor for Dick Cheney. And these people bullwevel their way into the foreign
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:27.660]   policy establishment. They're in the think tanks. They're in the State Department.
[01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:28.920]   Wait, what word did you just use?
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:29.640]   Bullwevel.
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:31.860]   That's a great word.
[01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:37.140]   They are the permanent, hold on a second, they are the permanent establishment of Washington.
[01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:45.180]   The President's come and go. They stay forever. She was caught on a phone call basically picking
[01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:48.720]   the new leader of Ukraine after a coup in 2014. Yeah, I remember that. I remember that.
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:53.880]   Is she the one that had that famous quote that said, Putin, fuck Putin? Was that?
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:58.740]   No, he said, he said, yeah, she said, yes, is our guy basically picking Yatsenyuk to be the
[01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:04.860]   new leader. And she said, fuck the EU, when the EU wanted to take a more temperate approach. Okay.
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:07.140]   Okay. Look at William F. Buckley. Here you go in sacks.
[01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:12.300]   I think the mistake Biden made, listen, I think Biden has good instincts on this. I think he had
[01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:18.120]   good instincts last year in June, when he called for basically an emergency summit with Putin to
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:18.480]   dial down the
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:24.660]   tensions. And I think that summit was successful. So what happened? Okay. The Intercept just had a
[01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:29.220]   great article talking about how tensions ratcheted down after that June summit, but they picked back
[01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:33.960]   up in October, November. What happened between June and October? I'll tell you what. On September
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:39.960]   1st, Zelensky met with Biden in the White House and the State Department issued a joint statement,
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:45.660]   basically reaffirming that Ukraine would be part of NATO. They would reaffirm military ties,
[01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:48.240]   economic ties. And then on November 10th,
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:53.460]   they published a giant charter agreement between the United States and Ukraine that was signed by
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:59.160]   Blinken. Now look, did Biden know about this? Yes, but this is the State Department agenda. And it
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:04.320]   was on the heels of this charter agreement that the Russians basically said they had reached the
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:10.320]   boiling point. They basically delivered the ultimatum to the US in December and precipitated
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:15.900]   the crisis that preceded this war. So my point is just listen, we have a State Department with its
[01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:22.500]   own agenda. It loves regime change. It loves having clients all over the world and inserting
[01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:28.740]   its fingers in the pie. And unless Biden, hold on, unless Biden stands up to his own State Department,
[01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:32.700]   we will not get a ceasefire and we will not get a peace deal. And that will be disasters
[01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:39.840]   for his presidency. What I will say is I think Biden has done a very good job. And I know Tony
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:43.320]   really well. And I think Tony's trying to do the best job he can. I think he's done a pretty good
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:45.660]   job, all things considered as well. That's awesome. That's pretty brilliant. Any final thoughts?
[01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:52.140]   Any final thoughts here on, you know, a very difficult time period we're living through?
[01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:59.640]   The global order is being restructured. It's predictable. I think again, if you read Ray
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:05.340]   Dalio's book, which I recommended heavily last year, it's surprising how much of that simple
[01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:14.700]   rubric is playing out today, exactly as that rubric kind of estimated it would. And you know,
[01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:19.560]   by the way, one way to think about the China, Russia, US dynamic, you know, you got a one,
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:24.540]   two and three player game theories. Number one wants two and three to be at it because then
[01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:28.620]   they'll, you know, end up diminishing value. Number two wants one and three to be at it.
[01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:34.260]   Number three wants one and two to be at it. And so we're seeing that that multi-party game theory
[01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:39.240]   play out right now. And, you know, again, based on that rubric, you could probably predict where
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:42.420]   this is all going to end up. Brilliant point. Listen, if you were to look at this from the
[01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:45.180]   Chinese standpoint, they must be loving what's going on. Right.
[01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:50.340]   What's going on. Loving it. Old saying, I think Napoleon said it, never interrupt your enemy when
[01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:57.240]   he's making a mistake. Why is China so quiet right now? Well, yeah. Because they love their dream.
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:01.200]   Their dream is the US and Russia attacking each other.
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:09.120]   Yeah. Perfect. We have to implement energy independence writ large. And we have to make
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:14.940]   sure that it is very clear we have influence amongst all these OECD countries. Because if
[01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:20.160]   China takes one foot over the line, we have to have the ability to do to them what we've done
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:25.920]   to Russia economically. It's the only way in which we can ratchet down all this tension and find
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:32.340]   peace. Yes, the new war is the war on our dependency on dictators. We must must must have a
[01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:39.300]   race to resiliency. We're going to talk about this and more at the all in May 15, 16, 17. No more.
[01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:43.080]   May 15, 16 and 17. All in Summit, Miami.
[01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:49.020]   The 700 tickets are gone. If you want to apply for a scholarship, you can apply tell us how much you
[01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:52.620]   love the show at the website, just do a Google search for all in summit. Really excited to
[01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:57.660]   announce Keith raboi will be joining us. One of Sax's besties a very iconic classic person,
[01:12:57.660 --> 01:13:02.100]   we're going for iconic class. Next up, Brian Peterson, friend of the pod from flexport,
[01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:06.420]   talking about all these supply chain issues. The number of speakers we're going to have is going
