[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.460]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.180]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.300]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.280]   Today, we are going to talk all about
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.660]   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.300]   We are also going to talk about normal levels of focus,
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.380]   what are normal levels of focus,
[00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.860]   and how all of us, whether or not we have ADHD or not,
[00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.420]   can improve our ability to focus,
[00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.580]   our ability to rule out distraction,
[00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.000]   turns out those are two separate things,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.180]   as well as remember information better.
[00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.700]   We are also going to talk about
[00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.740]   how we can learn to relax while focusing,
[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.140]   which turns out to be a critical component
[00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.160]   of learning new information,
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.840]   and for coming up with new creative ideas.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.100]   So whether or not you have ADHD or know someone who does,
[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.620]   or if you're somebody who feels that they do not have ADHD,
[00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.940]   but would simply like to improve their ability to focus
[00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.700]   or to be more creative,
[00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.240]   this episode is definitely for you as well.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.920]   We are going to talk about drug-based tools
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.820]   that are out there,
[00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.000]   we are going to talk about behavioral tools,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.220]   we will talk about the role of diet and supplementation,
[00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.420]   and we will talk about
[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.780]   new emerging brain machine interface devices
[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.520]   things like transcranial magnetic stimulation.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.080]   If you don't know what that is, don't worry,
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.600]   I will explain it to you.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.660]   These are non-invasive methods for rewiring your brain
[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.540]   in order to make focusing more natural for you,
[00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.860]   and to teach you how to increase your depth of focus.
[00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.340]   Now, just a quick reminder
[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.080]   that anytime we discuss a psychiatric disorder,
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.080]   it's important that we remember
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.040]   that all of us have the temptation to self-diagnose
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.960]   or to diagnose others.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.580]   So as I list off some of the symptomology of ADHD,
[00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.660]   some of that symptomology might resonate with you.
[00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.860]   You might think, oh, maybe I have ADHD,
[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.800]   or you might decide that someone you know
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.180]   definitely has ADHD.
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.200]   However, it is very important that you don't self-diagnose
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.280]   or diagnose somebody else.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.420]   The clear and real diagnosis of ADHD
[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.620]   really should be carried out by a psychiatrist, a physician,
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.540]   or a very well-trained clinical psychologist.
[00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.540]   There are clear criteria for what constitutes full-blown ADHD.
[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.040]   However, many of us have constellations of symptoms
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.980]   that make us somewhat like somebody with ADHD.
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.840]   And if you're struggling with focus nowadays,
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.040]   as a lot of people are,
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.080]   because of stress, because of smartphone use,
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.880]   which turns out can induce adult ADHD,
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.280]   we'll talk about that,
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.900]   well, then pay attention to the symptomology.
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.180]   You may actually require professional treatment.
[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.300]   You might not.
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.560]   Equally important is to remember
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.960]   that some of the terms that we cover,
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.740]   like impulse control and attention and concentration,
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.460]   are somewhat subjective and they can change over time.
[00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.940]   Sometimes we have a better level of attention than others.
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.280]   Maybe it depends on how we slept
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.000]   or other events going on in our life,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.500]   or something that we're entirely unaware of.
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.940]   The important thing to remember
[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.000]   is that we can all improve our attentional capacity.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.220]   We can all rewire the circuits
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.140]   that make heightened levels of focus more accessible to us.
[00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.020]   We can do that through multiple types of interventions,
[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.640]   and we are going to cover all those interventions today.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.080]   Before we march into the material,
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.120]   I'd like to remind that this podcast is separate
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.320]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.480]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.280]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.240]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.360]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.280]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.280]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.460]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.920]   that are of the utmost quality.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.200]   I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system,
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.820]   and I can tell you that there are many features
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.440]   built into our visual system
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.380]   that allows us to see things clearly,
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.780]   whether or not we are in shade or bright sunlight, et cetera.
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.600]   A lot of sunglasses have the problem
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.720]   that you have to constantly take them off
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.720]   and put them back on again
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.700]   because of changes in background luminance, as we call it.
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.680]   Roca sunglasses have solved this problem.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.120]   It doesn't matter if you're standing in tree shade
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.400]   or a bright light or what have you,
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.720]   you can always see things with perfect clarity,
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.600]   and that shows that they really understand
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.540]   the way that the visual system works,
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.640]   and their eyeglasses are built accordingly.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.320]   I wear readers at night,
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.960]   so I wear eyeglasses to read at night
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.120]   or when I drive at night,
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.560]   and their readers and eyeglasses are terrific as well.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.640]   One thing I like so much about their eyeglasses
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.020]   and their sunglasses is that,
[00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.220]   despite being quote unquote performance glasses,
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.360]   meaning you can wear them while running
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.320]   or swimming or biking, they don't fall off your face
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.240]   even if you get sweaty, they're very lightweight,
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.920]   you don't even notice that they're on,
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.360]   is that the aesthetic is really good.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.840]   You know, a lot of performance glasses,
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.600]   they look kind of ridiculous, frankly.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.480]   They make people look like cyborgs,
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.720]   but their aesthetics are terrific.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.080]   They have a lot of different styles you can select from.
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.100]   The company was founded by two All-American swimmers
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.320]   from Stanford, and everything about their sunglasses
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.820]   and eyeglasses were designed with optical clarity
[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.280]   and performance in mind.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.880]   If you'd like to try Roca, you can go to roca.com,
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.360]   that's R-O-K-A.com, and enter the code Huberman

[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.320]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Belcampo.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.300]   Belcampo is a regenerative farm in Northern California
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.980]   that raises organic grass-fed
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.980]   and finished certified humane meat.
[00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.000]   I tend to eat meat about once a day.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.680]   So typically I'll fast until about noon or one,
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.040]   and then my lunch consists of a small piece of steak
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.960]   or chicken and some salad,
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.360]   and then I tend to eat my carbohydrates in the evening
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.640]   before I go to sleep.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.320]   Sometimes, and especially lately,
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.480]   I'm eating my protein earlier in the day
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.920]   'cause I'm playing around with some of the findings
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.820]   related to protein intake early in the day.
[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.320]   But regardless, I'm eating meat about once a day.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.640]   For me, it's extremely important that any meat
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.040]   that I consume come from humanely raised animals
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.720]   and that the meat be of the very highest quality.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.740]   So with Belcampo meats, the animals graze on open pastures
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.960]   and seasonal grasses, which results in meats
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.040]   that's much higher in nutrients and healthy fats,
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.120]   including omega-3s,
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.440]   which I've talked a lot about on this podcast,
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.020]   the importance of omega-3s for heart health,
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.320]   for brain health, for mood, et cetera.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.200]   Personally, I love their ribeye steaks,
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.200]   their New York steaks, their chicken is terrific,
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.040]   and I also like the organic meatballs.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.600]   All the old meat is organic and grass-fed and grass-finished.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.000]   If you'd like to try Belcampo,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   first-time customers can get 20% off
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.780]   by going to belcampo.com/huberman
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.220]   and using the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.920]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.480]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.480]   that are absolutely second to none.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.200]   I started sleeping on a Helix mattress
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.980]   about eight, nine months ago,
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.500]   and I've never slept better in my life.
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.680]   If you go to the Helix site,
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.760]   they have a short two-minute quiz,
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.660]   and that quiz asks you questions like,
[00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:52.720]   do you sleep on your back?
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.560]   Do you sleep on your side?
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.420]   Do you sleep on your stomach?
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.440]   Do you tend to run hot or cold in the middle of the night?
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.280]   Maybe you don't know,
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.440]   and they actually have an option to select I don't know.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.000]   And Helix will match you to a mattress
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.960]   that's specific to your sleep needs.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.180]   This turns out to be really important.
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.840]   Some people have the tendency to run hot
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.680]   and sleep on their stomach.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.000]   Other people lie on their back
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.440]   and they're waking up cold in the middle of the night.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.480]   So you really need a mattress
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.440]   that's matched to your sleep needs.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.320]   I did that, and I matched to the Dusk mattress, D-U-S-K,
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.240]   and it turns out to be perfect for me and my sleep needs.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.960]   As well, their pillows are really terrific.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.800]   So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.880]   go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.080]   take their two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.240]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress.
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.240]   And you'll get up to $200 off any of their mattresses,
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.660]   and you'll get two free pillows with your order.
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.100]   They have a 10-year warranty.
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.380]   You get to try it out for 100 nights risk-free.
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.440]   That's more than three months.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.640]   And if you don't like it, they'll pick it up for you,
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.280]   and they'll take it away, and you get all your money back.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.640]   So if you're interested, go to helixsleep.com/huberman

[00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.220]   So let's talk about ADHD,
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.920]   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.240]   Let's also talk about focus and attention
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.080]   and everybody's ability to focus and attend,
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.520]   not just people with ADHD.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.120]   We are also going to talk about tools
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.800]   that would allow anyone,
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.920]   whether or not they have ADHD or not,
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.920]   to enhance their level of concentration and focus.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:21.640]   Now, ADHD used to be called ADD,
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.340]   attention deficit disorder.
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:27.880]   We have record of ADD in the medical literature
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.600]   dating back to as early as 1904.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.640]   Now, there's nothing special about 1904.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.080]   That's just the first time that it showed up
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.720]   in the standard medical literature.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.580]   We have to believe that ADD, which we now call ADHD,
[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:46.440]   existed before 1904 and probably long before 1904.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.280]   Why?
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.220]   Well, because it has a strong genetic component.
[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.800]   If you have a close relative that has ADHD,
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.240]   there's a much higher probability that you will have ADHD.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.320]   And that probability goes up depending on
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.040]   how closely related to that person you happen to be.
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.460]   So for instance, if you're an identical twin
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.760]   and your twin has ADHD,
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.840]   there's a very high concordance, as we say,
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.840]   a very high probability that you will have ADHD,
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.200]   up to 75% chance.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.120]   If you have a fraternal twin with ADHD,
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.600]   that number goes down a bit in the 50 to 60% range
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.520]   and so on.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.560]   If you have a parent with ADHD,
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.820]   that number ranges anywhere from 10 to 25% likelihood
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.700]   that you will have ADHD if you have two parents
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.000]   and so on and so on.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.720]   Okay, so there's a genetic component.
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.400]   That genetic component, it turns out,
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.280]   relates directly to how specific neural circuits
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.280]   in the brain wire up, the chemicals they use,
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.200]   and the way they use those chemicals,
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.220]   a topic that we are going to discuss in depth today.
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:48.080]   Now, if you have a close relative with ADHD,
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.460]   that does not mean that you are fated to have ADHD.
[00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.800]   And if you happen to have ADHD,
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.640]   there are ways to overcome those symptoms
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.100]   of lack of attention, impulsivity, and so on.
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.440]   Another important point about ADHD
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.420]   is that it has nothing to do with intelligence.
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.100]   Whether or not we're talking about intelligence
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.440]   measured by a standard IQ test,
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.020]   a rather controversial issue, as many of you probably know,
[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.340]   there are lots of forms of intelligence
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.380]   that a standard IQ test just wouldn't pick up.
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.180]   Emotional intelligence, musical intelligence,
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:23.260]   spatial intelligence, all sorts of intelligences,
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:27.860]   none of them are related to ADHD.
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.520]   Being very high functioning doesn't make you more likely
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:34.360]   to have ADHD, and being ADHD doesn't necessarily mean
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.280]   that you have a low IQ.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.840]   So there are people with ADHD who have low IQs,
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.880]   people with ADHD with high IQs,
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.280]   people with ADHD with high emotional IQ,
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.440]   or with low IQ in the emotional scale,
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.600]   it's all over the place.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.000]   The important point is that your ability to attend and focus
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.600]   does not relate to how smart you are,
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:57.000]   or your IQ of any type, not just a standard IQ.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.280]   The renaming of ADD to ADHD
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.280]   took place in the mid to late 1980s,
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.020]   when the psychiatric community
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.880]   and the psychological community
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.080]   started taking better notice of the fact
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.800]   that so-called hyperactive kids also had attentional issues.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.120]   This might seem obvious,
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.800]   but there's been extensive and ongoing revision
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.560]   of the criteria for designating a psychiatric disorder,
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.220]   and this is still an ongoing process, even today.
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.920]   So in the mid '80s, we started hearing about ADHD,
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.100]   and then gradually that term ADD has been dropped away.
[00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:37.660]   However, just the renaming of ADD to ADHD
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:43.520]   has led to much better diagnosis and detection of ADHD.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.420]   So right now, the current estimates
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.340]   are that about one in 10 children,
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:53.020]   and probably more, have ADHD.
[00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:56.780]   The current estimates are anywhere from 10%, one in 10,
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:58.780]   to as high as 12%.
[00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.860]   Now, fortunately, about half of those
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.700]   will resolve with proper treatment,
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.920]   but the other half typically don't.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.660]   The other thing that we are seeing a lot nowadays
[00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:13.340]   is increased levels of ADHD in adults,
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:14.620]   and there's some question
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.340]   as to whether or not those adults had ADHD
[00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:19.940]   that went undetected during their childhood,
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:24.020]   or whether or not ADHD is now cropping up in adulthood
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.540]   due to the way that we are interacting with the world.
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.080]   In particular, smartphone use,
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.520]   the combination of email, text, real-world interactions,
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:39.620]   multiple apps and streams of media and social media
[00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.060]   all coming in at once, trying to manage life,
[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.540]   all of the things that are going on
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:49.100]   are creating a kind of cloud of pulls on our attention.
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.740]   And so there is this question
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:54.100]   to whether or not we are creating ADHD in adults
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:58.100]   that never had ADHD prior to being an adult.
[00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.640]   So let's talk about attention.
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.220]   And first, let's just define what we mean by attention.
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.980]   Out there in the scientific literature
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.140]   and in discussions about ADHD,
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.780]   we will hear things like attention, and focus,
[00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.540]   and concentration, and impulse control.
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.760]   For sake of today's discussion,
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.780]   attention, focus, and concentration
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:20.060]   are essentially the same thing, okay?
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.180]   We could split hairs and the scientific literature
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.920]   does split hairs about these,
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.700]   but if we want to understand the biology
[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.080]   and we want to have a straightforward conversation
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.420]   about ADHD, if I say attention or focus,
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.620]   I'm basically referring to the same thing
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.080]   unless I specify otherwise, okay?
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:41.080]   So people with ADHD have trouble holding their attention.
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.660]   What is attention?
[00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:46.580]   Well, attention is perception.
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:50.520]   It's how we are perceiving the sensory world.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.620]   So just a little bit of neurobiology 101,
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.620]   we are sensing things all the time.
[00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.380]   There's information coming into our nervous system
[00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:57.200]   all the time.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.700]   For instance, right now, you're hearing sound waves,
[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:00.700]   you are seeing things,
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.700]   you are sensing things against your skin,
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:06.120]   but you are only paying attention to some of those.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.660]   And the ones that you're paying attention to
[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:09.780]   are your perceptions.
[00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.860]   So if you hear my voice, you are perceiving my voice.
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:15.820]   You are not paying attention to your other senses
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:17.020]   at the moment, okay?
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.820]   You might even be outside in a breeze.
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:19.860]   And until I said that,
[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.940]   you might not be perceiving that breeze,
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.900]   but your body was sensing it all along.
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:28.320]   So attention and focus are more or less the same thing,
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.000]   but impulse control is something separate
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.040]   because impulse control requires pushing out
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.860]   or putting the blinders on
[00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.340]   to sensory events in our environment.
[00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:40.120]   It means lack of perception.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.020]   Impulse control is about limiting our perception.
[00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:47.580]   People with ADHD have poor attention
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.000]   and they have high levels of impulsivity.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.500]   They are easily distractible.
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.700]   But the way that shows up is very surprising.
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.280]   You might think that people with ADHD
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.300]   just simply can't attend to anything.
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.060]   They really can't focus even if they really want to,
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:05.440]   but that's simply not the case.
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:09.620]   People with ADHD, yes, they are distractible.
[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.000]   Yes, they are impulsive.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.460]   Yes, they are easily annoyed by things happening in the room.
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.240]   They sometimes have a high level of emotionality as well,
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.960]   not always, but often.
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:24.280]   However, people with ADHD can have a hyper-focus,
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.040]   an incredible ability to focus
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:31.780]   on things that they really enjoy or are intrigued by.
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.560]   Now, this is a very important point
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.320]   because typically we think of somebody with ADHD
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.080]   as being really wild and hyperactive
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:44.240]   or having no ability whatsoever to sit still and attend.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.760]   And while that phenotype, as we call it,
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:51.540]   that contour of behavior and cognition can exist,
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:55.320]   many people, if not all people with ADHD,
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.680]   if you give them something they really love,
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.480]   like if the child loves video games
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.300]   or if a child loves to draw,
[00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:05.440]   or if an adult loves a particular type of movie
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.960]   or a person very much, they will obtain laser focus
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.640]   without any effort.
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.040]   So that tells us that people with ADHD
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.240]   have the capacity to attend,
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.200]   but they can't engage that attention
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.520]   for things that they don't really, really want to do.
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.680]   And as we all know, much of life,
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.560]   whether or not you're a child or an adult,
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.680]   involves doing a lot of things that we don't want to do.
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.320]   Much of our schooling involves doing things
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.400]   that we would prefer not to do
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.520]   and sort of forcing ourselves to do it,
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.360]   to attend even though we are not super interested
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.280]   in what we are attending to.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.560]   There are a couple of other things
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.720]   that people with ADHD display quite often.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:47.560]   One is challenges with time perception.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.060]   Now, time perception is a fascinating aspect
[00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.040]   of how our brain works.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.000]   And later we're going to talk about time perception
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.200]   and how you can actually get better at time perception.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.920]   It's very likely that right now you are doing things
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.960]   that get in the way of optimal time perception.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.000]   And I will tell you how to adjust your ability
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.820]   to measure time with your brain.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.040]   People with ADHD often run late.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.980]   They often procrastinate.
[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.660]   But what's interesting and surprising
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.920]   is that if they are given a deadline,
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.900]   they actually can perceive time very well.
[00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.420]   And they often can focus very well
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.160]   if the consequences of not completing a task
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.480]   or not attending are severe enough.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.920]   It's a little bit like the way that people with ADHD
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.280]   can really focus if they like something.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.780]   Well, if they're scared enough about the consequences
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.440]   of not attending, oftentimes, not always,
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.040]   but oftentimes they can attend.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.100]   If they're not really concerned
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.780]   about a deadline or a consequence,
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.740]   well, then they tend to lose track of time
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:52.200]   and they tend to underestimate how long things will take.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.140]   Now, many people do that, not just people with ADHD,
[00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:58.800]   but people with ADHD have challenges
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.540]   understanding how to line up the activities of their day
[00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.640]   in order to meet particular deadlines.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.400]   Even if it's just a simple thing like finishing
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.260]   one set of tasks before lunch.
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.780]   Oftentimes they will remember that lunch starts at noon,
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.940]   but somehow they aren't able to fill the intervening time
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.120]   in a way that's productive.
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.660]   And they can obsess about the upcoming deadline,
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:22.720]   for instance.
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.040]   We will talk about how to remedy this.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.960]   In addition, their spatial organization skills
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:31.600]   are often subpar, not always,
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.840]   but often you will find that somebody with ADHD
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.120]   uses what's called the pile system
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.220]   in order to organize things.
[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.220]   They will take many belongings,
[00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.420]   and this could be in the kitchen or in their bedroom
[00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:46.560]   or in their office or in any space,
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.160]   and they will start piling things up
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.020]   according to a categorization system
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.380]   that makes sense to them and only them.
[00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:55.620]   It doesn't really have any logical framework.
[00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.300]   Now, many people use the pile system,
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.380]   and if you use the pile system,
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.900]   that doesn't mean that you have ADHD.
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.540]   In fact, if you're unpacking a house
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.180]   or you've moved recently,
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.700]   or you've received a lot of presents recently,
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:09.440]   the pile system makes perfect sense to organize your space.
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.180]   But people with ADHD tend to organize things
[00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.660]   according to the pile system all the time,
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.660]   and that pile system doesn't work for them.
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:18.940]   Okay, so that's the key distinction,
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.400]   that they use a filing system, and it's not really files,
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.200]   they're piling things up in a way that makes sense to them,
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.760]   but then it doesn't work for them
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:29.040]   in terms of what tasks they actually need to perform.
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.520]   They can't find things,
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.360]   or if anyone moves one thing,
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.840]   then it's very disruptive to their overall plan
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:35.680]   because their overall plan
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.080]   doesn't really work in the first place.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.840]   So that's a common phenotype, as we call it.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.300]   A phenotype, by the way, is just an expression
[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:48.360]   of a particular set of underlying genetic
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.400]   or psychological components, okay?
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.520]   So we say the phenotype.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.420]   So a phenotype could be brown hair and green eyes.
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.420]   Like for me, a phenotype could also be
[00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.620]   that somebody uses the piling system, okay?
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:04.740]   The other thing that people with ADHD have real trouble with
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.900]   is so-called working memory.
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.440]   Now, you might think that people with ADHD
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.860]   would have really poor memories,
[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.380]   but in fact, that's not the case.
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:14.840]   People with ADHD often can have a terrific memory
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.140]   for past events.
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:19.120]   They can remember upcoming events quite well.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.140]   Their memory is clearly working.
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.240]   However, one aspect of memory in particular
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.740]   that we call working memory is often disrupted.
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:30.100]   Working memory is the ability to keep specific information
[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.180]   online to recycle it in your brain over and over again
[00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:36.580]   so that you can use it in the immediate or short term.
[00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:39.020]   A good example of this would be you meet somebody,
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:40.400]   they tell you their name,
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.200]   they give you their phone number verbally,
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.860]   and you have to walk back to your phone
[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.020]   and enter it into your phone.
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:49.400]   People without ADHD might have to put some effort into it.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.720]   It might feel like a bit of a struggle,
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.060]   but typically they would be able to recite that phone number
[00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.740]   in their mind over and over and then put it into their phone.
[00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.640]   People with ADHD tend to lose the ability
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.860]   or lack the ability to remember things
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.340]   that they just need to keep online
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:07.120]   for anywhere from 10 seconds to a minute or two, okay?
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.340]   So a string of numbers like 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1
[00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.520]   for most people would be pretty easy.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.820]   6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1.
[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.140]   You could probably remember that a minute from now
[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.780]   without writing it down.
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:23.220]   But if you add one more number to that 6, 4, 3, 7, 8, 1, 3,
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.060]   it gets tougher, okay?
[00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:27.260]   So there's a reason why phone numbers
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.800]   typically have seven digits in them.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:30.980]   Of course, there's an area code,
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:35.500]   but remembering information that strings out longer
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:39.420]   than seven numbers or a sentence or two,
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:41.060]   that's challenging for most people.
[00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:43.180]   People with ADHD have severe challenges
[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:46.060]   even with much smaller batches of information
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:49.420]   over even much smaller batches of time.
[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:51.400]   Deficits in working memory are also something
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.420]   that we see in people who have frontotemporal dementia,
[00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:56.080]   so damage to the frontal lobes,
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.360]   or age-related cognitive decline.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.020]   And so it will come as no surprise
[00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:04.860]   that later when we discuss treatments, supplements,
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.140]   and other tools for ADHD,
[00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.040]   that many of those treatments, supplements,
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.940]   and tools for ADHD are similar to the ones
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:14.740]   that work for age-related cognitive decline.
[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:19.300]   Okay, so we've more or less established
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:23.120]   the kind of menu of items that people with ADHD tend to have.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.180]   Some have all of them, some have just a subset of them.
[00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:31.060]   Their severity can range from very intense to mild,
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:35.180]   but in general, it's challenges with attention and focus,
[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:36.980]   challenges with impulse control.
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.380]   They get annoyed easily.
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:39.760]   They have kind of an impulsivity.
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.140]   They can't stay on task.
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:43.680]   Time perception can be off.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.720]   They use the piling system or a system
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.720]   that doesn't work well for them
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:52.160]   in order to organize their things in physical space.
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:54.580]   And they have a hard time with anything that's mundane
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.860]   that they're not really interested in.
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:58.380]   But again, I just want to highlight
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.580]   that people with ADHD are able
[00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.380]   to obtain heightened levels of focus,
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:05.460]   even hyper-focus for things that are exciting to them
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.660]   and that they really want to engage in.
[00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:10.340]   So now you have the contour of what ADHD is.
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.720]   And if you're somebody who doesn't have ADHD,
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.580]   you should also be asking yourself
[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:18.420]   which aspects of ADHD are similar
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.600]   to things I've experienced before,
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.080]   because what we know about the healthy brain
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:27.420]   is that there's also a range of abilities to focus.
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:30.140]   Some people focus very well on any task.
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:33.700]   You give them a task, they can just laser in on that task.
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.640]   Other people, they have to kind of fight an internal battle.
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.860]   They have to convince themselves
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:39.180]   that it's important or interesting.
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.860]   They have to kind of incentivize themselves internally.
[00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:45.620]   Other people, doesn't matter.
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.900]   They could be bored to tears with the information,
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.060]   but they can do it just because they are quote unquote,
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.580]   very disciplined people.
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:53.000]   We tend to admire those people,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.660]   but as you'll see a little bit later,
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:56.000]   it's not clear that that's the best way
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.700]   to run your attentional system.
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.900]   There might be something to this business
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:02.020]   of having heightened levels of attention
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:05.280]   for the things that you are most interested or excited by.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:10.720]   So let's drill into this issue of why people with ADHD
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.860]   actually can focus very intensely
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:16.660]   on things that they enjoy and are curious about.
[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:21.320]   Now, enjoyment and curiosity are psychological terms.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.900]   They're not even really psychological terms.
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.520]   They're just the way that we describe our human experience
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.780]   of liking things, wanting to know more about them.
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:31.500]   But from a neurobiological perspective,
[00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:34.780]   they have a very clear identity and signature,
[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:36.240]   and that's dopamine.
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.940]   Dopamine is released from neurons.
[00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.140]   It's what we call a neuromodulator.
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:43.220]   And as a neuromodulator,
[00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:45.820]   it changes the activity of the circuits in the brain
[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:49.380]   such that certain circuits are more active than others.
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:52.500]   And in particular, dopamine creates
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.820]   a heightened state of focus.
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:57.540]   It tends to contract our visual world,
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:59.980]   and it tends to make us pay attention to things
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:04.060]   that are outside and beyond the confines of our skin.
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:06.420]   It's what we call exteroception.
[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:10.680]   Dopamine also tends to put us in a state of motivation
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:14.180]   and wanting things outside the confines of our skin.
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.540]   So whether or not we're pursuing something physical
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:20.180]   in our world, or whether or not we're pursuing information
[00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:23.620]   in our outside world, dopamine is largely responsible
[00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:26.520]   for our ability and our drive to do that.
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:30.780]   But dopamine as a neuromodulator is also involved
[00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:34.120]   in changing the way that we perceive the world.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.180]   So as I mentioned earlier,
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:37.180]   you have all these senses coming in,
[00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:39.140]   and you can only perceive some of them
[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:42.260]   because you're only paying attention to some of them.
[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:45.580]   Dopamine, when it's released in our brain,
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:47.860]   tends to turn on areas of our brain
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:51.740]   that narrow our visual focus and our auditory focus.
[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:54.320]   So it creates a cone of auditory attention
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:57.580]   that's very narrow, creates a tunnel of visual attention
[00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:00.680]   that's very narrow, whereas when we have less dopamine,
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.780]   we tend to view the entire world.
[00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:04.900]   We tend to see the whole scene that we are in.
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.420]   We tend to hear everything all at once.
[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:09.380]   So as I describe this,
[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.700]   hopefully you're already starting to see
[00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:15.540]   and understand how having dopamine release
[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:20.020]   can allow a person, whether or not they have ADHD or not,
[00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.820]   to direct their attention to particular things
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:24.460]   in their environment, right?
[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:27.700]   So now what we're doing is we're moving away from attention
[00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.340]   as this kind of vague, ambiguous term,
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:33.540]   and we're giving it a neurochemical identity, dopamine,
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:36.520]   and we are giving it a neural circuit identity.
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.800]   And just to put a little bit of flavor and detail
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.580]   on which neural circuits those are,
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.540]   I wanted to discuss two general types of neural circuits
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:46.960]   that dopamine tends to enhance.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.500]   So let's talk neural circuits.
[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.580]   And for those of you that love hearing
[00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:54.140]   neuroscience nomenclature, you're going to eat this part up.
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:56.300]   And for those of you that don't like a lot of names
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:59.200]   of brain areas, I invite you to tune out
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.900]   or just try and grab the top contour of this.
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:03.780]   I will describe it in pretty general terms,
[00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:04.920]   but I will give some detail
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.100]   because I know there are some of you out there
[00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:10.260]   who really want to dig deeper into what the exact structures
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.360]   and connectivities are, okay?
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.820]   So there are two main types of circuits
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:17.500]   that we need to think about with respect to ADHD,
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.020]   attention and dopamine.
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:22.100]   The first one is called the default mode network.
[00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:25.700]   The default mode network is the network of brain areas
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:28.500]   in your brain, in my brain, and in everybody's brain
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.820]   that is active when we're not doing anything,
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.260]   when we're just sitting there idle at rest.
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.520]   Now, it's very hard to not think about anything,
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:39.740]   but when you're not engaged in any type of specific task,
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.140]   so you're not driving, you're not playing a video game,
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.540]   you're not trying to study, you're not trying to listen,
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:45.460]   you're just sitting there,
[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:48.700]   letting your brain kind of go wherever it wants to go,
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:53.040]   your default mode network underlies that state of mind.
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:56.900]   The other set of circuits that we're going to think about
[00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:01.600]   and talk about with respect to ADHD are the task networks,
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.900]   the networks of the brain that make you goal-oriented
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:08.380]   or that are at least trying to make you goal-oriented.
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:11.300]   And those are a completely different set of brain areas.
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:16.300]   However, the default mode network and these task networks
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.460]   are communicating with one another,
[00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:21.200]   and they're doing that in very interesting ways.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.160]   So first, I want to describe how these two sets
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.060]   of brain areas, the default mode network
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:29.540]   and the task networks normally interact, okay?
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:30.960]   So little bit of naming here.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.260]   Again, feel free to ignore it
[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:34.340]   if you don't want this level of detail,
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:38.580]   but the default mode network includes an area called
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.300]   the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:43.500]   Frontal cortex, no surprises in the front,
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.660]   and you have a dorsal, the top, and side lateral part,
[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:49.020]   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:51.460]   You got one on each side of your brain, right?
[00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:52.480]   And then you have a brain area
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.780]   called the posterior cingulate cortex.
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.180]   And then you have an area called the lateral parietal lobe.
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.860]   Again, you don't need to remember these names,
[00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:00.260]   but these are three brain areas
[00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:03.180]   that normally are synchronized in their activity.
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:06.460]   So when one of these areas is active in a typical person,
[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:08.580]   the other areas would be active as well.
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.220]   So it's a little bit like a symphony
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:11.780]   or a band, like a three-piece band.
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:13.740]   It's like drums, guitar, and bass.
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:16.120]   They're playing together, okay?
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.860]   That's how it is in a typical person,
[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:19.780]   in a person with ADHD,
[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:22.500]   or even a person who has subclinical ADHD,
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.980]   or in any human being who hasn't slept well,
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.960]   what you find is the default mode network is not synchronized.
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.780]   These brain areas are just not playing well together.
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.620]   Now, the task networks
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.640]   include a different set of structures.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.660]   It still involves the prefrontal cortex,
[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:42.940]   but it's a different part of the prefrontal cortex, okay?
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:45.660]   Tends to be the medial prefrontal cortex.
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:47.240]   And there are some other brain areas
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.700]   that the medial prefrontal cortex
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.900]   is communicating to all the time,
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:53.220]   mainly to suppress impulses.
[00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:56.300]   It's shutting down the desire to stand up
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:58.580]   or to scratch the side of your cheek or your nose
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:29:59.900]   if you're trying not to do that.
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:01.860]   Anytime you're restricting your behavior,
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:05.600]   these task-directed networks are very active, okay?
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:10.220]   Now, normally, in a person without ADHD,
[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:14.020]   the task networks and the default mode networks
[00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:15.940]   are going in kind of seesaw fashion.
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:18.760]   They are actually what we call anti-correlated.
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.720]   So it's not just that they are not correlated.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.820]   They are actually opposing one another.
[00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:24.300]   They are anti-correlated.
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:28.340]   In a person with ADHD, the default mode networks
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:31.820]   and the task networks are actually more coordinated.
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:33.060]   That might come as surprising.
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:35.900]   I think that we all have this tendency
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:38.960]   to kind of jump to conclusion and assume that somebody
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:42.780]   who doesn't have an easy time paying attention or has ADHD,
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:45.500]   that their brain must be completely incoherent,
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:48.940]   that it's not working well because everything's out of whack.
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.580]   But there's something interesting about people with ADHD
[00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:56.320]   whereby the task networks and the default mode networks
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.380]   are actually working together in a way that's correlated,
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:01.740]   and that is what's abnormal.
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:05.080]   So this would be like the guitar, bass, and the drums
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:08.060]   playing together in a way where the bass
[00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:09.460]   isn't keeping the backbeat
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:12.100]   and the drums aren't keeping the backbeat,
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:13.300]   that they're playing together.
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:14.940]   They're all playing the melodies and harmonies
[00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:17.100]   in a way that just doesn't sound right.
[00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:21.500]   That's what's going on in the brain of somebody with ADHD.
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:23.300]   And we can now confidently say,
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:24.900]   based on brain imaging studies,
[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.820]   that when somebody gets better
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:30.540]   when they're treated for ADHD or when they age out of ADHD,
[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:32.300]   as sometimes is the case,
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:35.720]   that the default mode networks and the task networks
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.660]   tend to become anti-correlated again, okay?
[00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:41.420]   So that's the underlying neurobiology,
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:45.220]   but you'll notice that I didn't mention dopamine at all.
[00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:47.380]   What dopamine is doing in this context
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:50.540]   is dopamine is acting like a conductor.
[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:52.840]   Dopamine is saying this circuit should be active,
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.000]   then that circuit should be active.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.480]   It should be default mode network,
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.880]   and then when the default mode network is not active,
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.300]   then it should be the task network.
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.140]   So it's really acting as a conductor saying,
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:03.300]   you go, now you go, now you go, now you go.
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:07.040]   And in ADHD, there's something about the dopamine system
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:10.740]   that is not allowing it to conduct these networks
[00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:13.340]   and make sure that they stay what, you know,
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.260]   the engineers or physicists or mathematicians
[00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:18.700]   would say out of phase to be anti-correlated, okay?
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:19.780]   Out of phase and anti-correlated,
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:20.980]   essentially the same thing,
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:23.460]   at least for purposes of this discussion.
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:25.700]   So that raises two questions.
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:30.460]   Could it be that dopamine is not at sufficiently high levels
[00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:33.180]   or could it be that dopamine is just doing it all wrong?
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.140]   In other words, is there no conductor
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.540]   or is the conductor playing with like little tiny toothpicks
[00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:40.980]   and so the instruments can't see what they're supposed to do?
[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:42.600]   They can't get the instruction
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.040]   'cause it's just not loud enough, so to speak,
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.060]   or could it be that the information is getting out
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:49.100]   but the information that's getting out is wrong?
[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:49.980]   The conductor is there
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:52.700]   but the conductor isn't very good at conducting.
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:58.900]   Now we can gain insight into how this system works and fails
[00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.820]   and how to treat it by looking at some of the current
[00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:04.260]   and previous treatments for ADHD,
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.300]   as well as some of the recreational drugs
[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:09.840]   that people with ADHD tend to pursue and like.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:12.560]   Now I'm certainly not a proponent of people with ADHD
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:15.500]   taking drugs recreationally, that's not what this is about,
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.260]   but if you look at their drug seeking behavior
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:21.500]   and you couple that drug seeking behavior
[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:25.500]   to their desire to remedy their attention deficit,
[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:28.240]   you start getting some really interesting insight
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.620]   into how dopamine is regulating these circuits
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:35.900]   in normal circumstances and in people with ADHD.
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:38.400]   So what exactly is going on with the dopamine system
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.220]   in people with ADHD?
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.980]   And what's going on with the dopamine system
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:44.940]   in people that have terrific levels of attention
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:46.500]   for any task?
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:50.960]   Well, in the year 2015, an important paper came out,
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.780]   the first author is Spencer
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:55.860]   and it came out in a journal called "Biological Psychiatry"
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:59.940]   and it formalized the so-called low dopamine hypothesis
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:01.860]   of ADHD.
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:04.080]   The idea that dopamine was somehow involved
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:07.300]   or not at the appropriate levels in people with ADHD
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:09.820]   had been around for a pretty long time
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:14.780]   but a formal proposition of the low dopamine hypothesis
[00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:17.660]   led to some really important experiments and understanding
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:19.680]   of what goes wrong in ADHD.
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:24.340]   It turns out that if dopamine levels are too low
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:27.120]   in particular circuits in the brain,
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:31.220]   that it leads to unnecessary firing of neurons in the brain
[00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:35.340]   that are unrelated to the task that one is trying to do
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:37.920]   and that is unrelated to the information
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.880]   that one is trying to focus on.
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.060]   So if you think back before,
[00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:42.800]   you've got this default mode network
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.220]   and a task-related network
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:46.800]   and they need to be in this kind of concert
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:50.720]   of anti-correlation and in ADHD, they're firing together.
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:54.120]   Well, the problem seems to be that when dopamine is low,
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:57.660]   certain neurons are firing when they shouldn't be.
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.100]   This is like a band, right?
[00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:00.020]   We'll go back to our band.
[00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:03.300]   That's a guitar, a bass and a person playing the drums
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:06.620]   and it's as if one of those or several of those instruments
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:09.460]   are playing notes when they shouldn't be playing, right?
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:12.000]   The pauses in music are just as important
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.500]   as the actual playing of notes.
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:17.940]   When dopamine is too low,
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:20.880]   neurons fire more than they should in these networks
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.000]   that govern attention.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.260]   This is the so-called low dopamine hypothesis.
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:29.500]   And if you start looking anecdotally
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:33.640]   at what people with ADHD have done for decades,
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:36.620]   not just recently since the low dopamine hypothesis
[00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:38.280]   has been proposed,
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.200]   but what they were doing in the 1950s
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.500]   and then the 1940s and the 1960s,
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:47.500]   what you find is that they tend to use recreational drugs
[00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:53.060]   or they tend to indulge in non-drug stimulants.
[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:57.140]   So things like drinking six cups of coffee
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:59.220]   or quadruple espressos,
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:01.100]   or when it was more prominent,
[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:02.980]   smoking a half a pack of cigarettes
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:05.460]   and drinking four cups of coffee a day.
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:07.980]   Or if the person had access to it,
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:10.060]   using cocaine as a recreational drug
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:12.580]   or amphetamine as a recreational drug.
[00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:15.860]   All of those substances that I just described,
[00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:17.740]   in particular cocaine and amphetamine,
[00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:20.500]   but also coffee and cigarettes,
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:23.600]   increased levels of multiple neurotransmitters,
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.260]   but all have the quality of increasing levels
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:27.580]   of dopamine in the brain.
[00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:29.100]   And in particular,
[00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.840]   in the regions of the brain that regulate attention
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:35.780]   and these task-related and default mode networks, okay?
[00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:38.100]   Now, young children fortunately don't have access
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:41.180]   to those kinds of stimulants most of the time.
[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:45.660]   And those stimulants all have high potential for abuse
[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:46.500]   in adults.
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:48.300]   So we will talk about the potential for abuse
[00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:49.340]   in a few minutes.
[00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:51.540]   But if you look at children,
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:54.500]   even very young children with ADHD,
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:57.620]   they show things like preference for sugary foods,
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:01.760]   which also act as dopamine inducing stimulants.
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:05.860]   Now, of course, once they get access to soda pop
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:07.740]   and coffee and tea,
[00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:10.100]   they start to indulge in those more than other people.
[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:12.380]   For a long time it was thought that children with ADHD
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:15.620]   consumed too many sugary foods or drank too much soda.
[00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:19.820]   Or adults with ADHD would take recreational drugs
[00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:21.840]   like methamphetamine or cocaine,
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:24.040]   or would drink coffee to excess
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.860]   or smoke cigarettes to excess
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:28.220]   because they had poor levels of attention.
[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:31.180]   And because they couldn't make good decisions,
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:33.340]   they were too impulsive and so forth.
[00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:35.620]   And while that certainly could be the case,
[00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:37.900]   knowing what we now know about dopamine
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:41.900]   and the fact that having enough dopamine is required
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:43.580]   in order to coordinate these neural circuits
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:46.580]   that allow for focus and quality decision-making,
[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:51.140]   an equally valid idea is that these children
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:53.840]   and these adults are actually trying to self-medicate
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:56.140]   by pursuing these compounds, right?
[00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:59.060]   Things like cocaine lead to huge increases in dopamine.
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:03.260]   Well, what happens when somebody with ADHD takes that drug?
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:07.080]   It turns out they actually obtain heightened levels of focus.
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.420]   Their ability to focus on things other than things
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:13.640]   they absolutely care intensely about goes up.
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:16.480]   Likewise, children who consume anything
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:19.020]   that increases their levels of dopamine,
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:23.700]   if those children have ADHD, they tend to be calmer.
[00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.780]   They tend to be able to focus more.
[00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:27.460]   Now, this is very different
[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:29.780]   than children who do not have ADHD.
[00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:30.900]   When they consume too much sugar,
[00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.180]   they tend to become super hyperactive.
[00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:34.880]   When they consume any kind of stimulant,
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.260]   they tend to go wild and run around like crazy.
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:38.660]   I actually have an anecdote about this
[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:40.340]   just to illustrate it.
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:42.520]   I have a friend, he has two children
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.420]   that are now in their teens and 20s,
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:45.700]   but when they were little,
[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:48.220]   one time I brought them some chocolate just as a gift
[00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:49.740]   when I showed up at their house.
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:51.660]   And within 30 minutes,
[00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:53.700]   the kids were running around like crazy.
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.080]   I mean, they were pretty high energy kids,
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.740]   but they were going bonkers.
[00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:59.800]   And that's actually when the mother,
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:02.140]   my friend at the time, unfortunately still now,
[00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:02.980]   looked at the chocolate
[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:06.100]   and realized that it was chocolate with espresso beans in it.
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:07.520]   It was like dark chocolate espresso beans.
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:09.140]   So I was really at fault there.
[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:10.820]   You don't want to give kids dark chocolate
[00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:11.660]   with espresso beans,
[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:14.220]   but what you're really seeing in that hyperactivity,
[00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:15.740]   that is dopamine, okay?
[00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:18.680]   It's the sugar combined with the caffeine in this case,
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:21.340]   combined with a few other compounds that exist in chocolate
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.420]   that really increase our levels of alertness
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:25.880]   and our tendency to want to move around a lot.
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:31.200]   Okay, so dopamine and low levels of dopamine
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:34.940]   apparently are what's wrong in people with ADHD.
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:38.060]   That dopamine hypothesis is what led to the idea
[00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:41.700]   that treating people, children and adults included,
[00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:44.440]   with dopaminergic compounds
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:48.400]   would somehow increase their ability to focus.
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:51.380]   And if you look at the major drugs that were developed
[00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:53.960]   and now marketed by pharmaceutical companies
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:55.760]   for the treatment of ADHD,
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.800]   those drugs have names like Ritalin.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:03.580]   Nowadays, it's typically things like Adderall,
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:06.140]   Modafinil and some of the other derivatives,
[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:09.200]   they all serve to increase levels of dopamine,
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.300]   in particular dopamine in the networks
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.620]   that control task-directed behavior
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:16.700]   and that coordinate the default mode network
[00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:18.800]   and these task-related networks.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.860]   So many of you have probably heard of Ritalin.
[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:23.500]   Ritalin is a prescription stimulant
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:28.220]   that is prescribed for ADHD as well as for narcolepsy.
[00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:32.020]   Narcolepsy is a condition in which people tend to fall asleep
[00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:33.260]   during the daytime quite a lot.
[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:35.020]   It's excessive daytime sleepiness,
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:37.200]   not due to lack of sleep at night,
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.820]   but also tend to fall asleep when they get excited.
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:42.860]   If they're really emotionally excited or about to eat
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:44.260]   or any other kind of activity
[00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:47.420]   that would normally get somebody really aroused and alert,
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:49.380]   people with narcolepsy tend to fall asleep
[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:51.900]   or they tend to become what's called cataplectic.
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:54.460]   They tend to just sort of go limp in the muscles.
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:57.100]   So it's this invasion of sleep into the daytime.
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.000]   It's dysregulated by emotion.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.840]   You can imagine why a stimulant,
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:02.220]   something that would wake you up,
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:04.180]   make you very alert, focused, and motivated
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:07.380]   would be a good treatment for narcolepsy.
[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:12.380]   Adderall also is used to treat ADHD and to treat narcolepsy.
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:18.140]   Things like modafinil also used to treat ADHD and narcolepsy.
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:19.760]   So you're sensing a theme here.
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.980]   So what are the differences and similarities
[00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:25.020]   between these drugs and what can that tell us about ADHD?
[00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:29.380]   Well, Ritalin was one of the first-generation drugs
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:34.140]   that was prescribed for ADHD in order to deal head-on
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:36.140]   with this dopamine hypothesis,
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:40.300]   this idea that in ADHD, dopamine levels are too low.
[00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:43.440]   Nowadays, Adderall is the more typically prescribed drug
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.180]   for ADHD.
[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:47.780]   That has to do with some of the so-called pharmacokinetics,
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:50.740]   the rate at which those drugs enter the system
[00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:52.780]   and how long they last in the system.
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:56.100]   So for instance, Ritalin was a drug that was packaged
[00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:58.300]   into various time-release formulas,
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:02.120]   whereas initially Adderall was only released in a form
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.600]   that had a very short life.
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:07.300]   So meaning that it wasn't in the bloodstream very long
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:08.940]   and didn't affect the brain for very long.
[00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:11.460]   And so the dosages could be controlled
[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:13.000]   in a more typical way
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.900]   without going into a lot of tangential detail.
[00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:17.980]   As you all know, at different times of day,
[00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:19.860]   you tend to be more or less alert.
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:22.620]   So a long sustained release drug,
[00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:24.920]   while that might sound like a really terrific thing,
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:27.820]   if that drug is having an effect of making you more alert
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:31.140]   and it's released across very many hours of your day,
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:34.360]   there might be periods of your day when you feel too alert,
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:36.240]   periods of your day when you feel just right,
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.080]   and periods of your day
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:39.220]   when you wished that you were more alert.
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:41.580]   These are some of the pharmacokinetics,
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:44.400]   kinetics meaning movement of the different compounds
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.700]   within the bloodstream and brain that could,
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:49.140]   you could imagine in a very real way would impact
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:50.740]   whether or not someone would feel really good
[00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:52.460]   on one of these drugs or whether or not
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:55.120]   they would feel too anxious or too sleepy and so on.
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:57.940]   Let's take a step back for a second and just ask,
[00:42:57.940 --> 00:42:59.340]   what are these drugs?
[00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:03.180]   We know they increase dopamine, but what are they really?
[00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:07.660]   Well, Ritalin, also called methylphenidate,
[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:11.280]   is very similar to amphetamine, speed,
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:13.040]   or what's typically called speed
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:16.340]   in the street drug nomenclature.
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:20.940]   Adderall, which goes by various other names, okay?
[00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:25.940]   So Adderall, Adderall XR, Midiasis,
[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:26.920]   things like that.
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:30.980]   Adderall is basically a combination of amphetamine
[00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:33.260]   and dextro amphetamine.
[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:35.220]   Now, some of you probably realize this,
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:37.020]   that Adderall is amphetamine,
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:39.200]   but I'm guessing that there are a good number of you
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.220]   out there, perhaps even parents and kids
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:43.380]   that don't realize that these drugs
[00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:45.700]   like cocaine and amphetamine, methamphetamine,
[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:50.700]   which are incredibly dangerous and incredibly habit forming
[00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:53.580]   and have high potential for abuse.
[00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:56.180]   Well, the pharmaceutical versions of those
[00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:59.640]   are exactly what are used to treat ADHD.
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.900]   Now, they're not exactly like cocaine or methamphetamine,
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:05.080]   but they are structurally and chemically very similar,
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:07.860]   and their net effect in the brain and body
[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:08.860]   is essentially the same,
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:11.660]   which is to increase dopamine primarily,
[00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:14.140]   but also to increase levels of a neuromodulator
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:16.380]   called epinephrine or norepinephrine,
[00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:18.260]   also called noradrenaline and adrenaline.
[00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:19.540]   Those names are the same.
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:22.700]   And to some extent, to increase levels of serotonin
[00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:25.760]   in the brain and blood, but not so much serotonin,
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:28.400]   that's just kind of a small smidgen of effect, okay?
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:32.820]   So dopamine way up, norepinephrine and adrenaline way up,
[00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:36.800]   so that's motivation, drive, focus, and energy,
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:40.020]   and to some extent, a little bit of serotonin,
[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:44.660]   which is really more about feeling calm and relaxed,
[00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:46.640]   and you could imagine why that would be
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:50.620]   a good balancing effect for dopamine and norepinephrine.
[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:53.980]   So what I'm essentially saying is that the drugs
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:56.940]   that are used to treat ADHD are stimulants,
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:59.420]   and they look very much like, in fact,
[00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:01.780]   nearly identical to some of the so-called
[00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:05.820]   street drug stimulants that we all hear are so terrible.
[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:08.140]   However, I do want to emphasize
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:10.140]   that at the appropriate dosages
[00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:13.640]   and working with a quality psychiatrist
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:16.180]   or neurologist or family physician,
[00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:17.820]   does have to be a board certified MD
[00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:19.420]   that prescribes these things,
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:23.820]   many people with ADHD achieve excellent relief
[00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:26.260]   with these drugs, not all of them, but many of them do,
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:30.180]   especially if these treatments are started early in life.
[00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:31.980]   So now knowing what these drugs are,
[00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:36.420]   I want to raise the question of why prescribe these drugs?
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:38.520]   I mean, everyone has to make a decision for themselves
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:39.760]   or for their child as to whether or not
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.620]   they're going to take these things or not.
[00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:46.340]   I also want to acknowledge that many people out there,
[00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:49.800]   many, many people out there are taking these drugs,
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:52.220]   even though they have not been clinically diagnosed
[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:53.980]   with ADHD, and when I say these drugs,
[00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:56.240]   I'm specifically referring to Ritalin and Adderall
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:46:00.100]   and Modafinil, but more typically it's Adderall, okay?
[00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:01.960]   People using cocaine and amphetamine
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:03.240]   for recreational purposes,
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:05.340]   that's a completely different beast,
[00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:06.460]   and it is indeed a beast,
[00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:08.800]   and it's something that I strongly discourage.
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:15.100]   However, I am aware that up to 25% of college students
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:19.360]   and perhaps as many as 35% of all individuals
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:24.360]   between the ages of 17 and 30 are taking Adderall
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:28.780]   on a regular or semi-regular basis in order to work,
[00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:32.900]   in order to study, and in order to function and focus
[00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:36.100]   in their daily life, even though they have not been diagnosed
[00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:38.300]   with ADHD, there's a whole black market for this,
[00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:40.660]   they're getting it from people with prescriptions.
[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:41.860]   I'm not here to pass judgment,
[00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:44.700]   I just want to emphasize how these drugs work.
[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:48.180]   Some of the things that they do to enhance cognition
[00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:49.980]   and focus that actually serve the brain well
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:51.220]   in certain individuals,
[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:55.780]   and how they can be very detrimental in other individuals.
[00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:57.140]   I sort of blew right past it,
[00:46:57.140 --> 00:47:01.700]   but the fact that in upwards of 25% of young people
[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:03.780]   are taking things like Adderall,
[00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:08.340]   despite not having a clinical diagnosis of ADHD,
[00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:10.800]   well, that's a ridiculously high number.
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.580]   A few years ago, it was estimated
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:18.200]   that Adderall use and Ritalin use without diagnosis of ADHD
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:21.560]   was second in incident only to cannabis.
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:25.360]   But actually now the consumption of Adderall
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:29.940]   without prescription is higher than the consumption
[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:31.780]   of cannabis in that age group.
[00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:35.100]   So what that means is that there's a lot of stimulant use
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:36.220]   in that age group.
[00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:39.460]   And there are a lot of adults also using
[00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:42.140]   and abusing stimulants in order to gain focus.
[00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:43.800]   Now we could have a whole discussion about whether or not
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:45.660]   life is becoming more demanding,
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:48.140]   whether or not the need for focus is excessive,
[00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:50.060]   and that's why people are doing that.
[00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:51.580]   Frankly, it's an interesting discussion,
[00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:54.100]   but it's not one that would deliver us to any answers.
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:57.340]   Rather, I'd like to focus on the ways that people now
[00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:59.580]   and people have always been self-medicating
[00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:02.020]   to increase focus, right?
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:07.020]   Caffeine, which I indulge some, I don't think to access,
[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:10.380]   has long been used as a stimulant to increase dopamine,
[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:13.100]   increase norepinephrine, increase focus and energy.
[00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:16.340]   And in addition to that, it works through the so-called
[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:19.180]   cyclic AMP, phosphodiesterase pathway.
[00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:22.240]   Remember, anytime you hear an ASE, that's an enzyme,
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:25.300]   phosphodiesterase is involved in the conversion
[00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:28.380]   of things like cyclic AMP into energy for cells
[00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:29.220]   and so forth.
[00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:30.040]   Basically coffee gives you energy.
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:31.180]   It makes you feel good.
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:34.080]   And it increases focus because of the circuits
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:35.620]   that it engages in the brain.
[00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:38.580]   People have been taking caffeine
[00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:42.540]   and continue to take caffeine for ages.
[00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:45.980]   People also used to smoke cigarettes, nicotine,
[00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:47.560]   in order to gain focus.
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:50.720]   Nowadays, that's less common because of the concerns,
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:54.220]   quite valid concerns about lung cancer from smoking,
[00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:57.120]   but there's a lot of vaping out there.
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:59.900]   There are a lot of people now consuming nicotine,
[00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:02.460]   which is the active substance in cigarettes
[00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:06.900]   and in most nicotine vapes that stimulates the brain
[00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:09.300]   to be more focused and more alert.
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:12.420]   So the idea of taking stimulants of consuming things
[00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:15.620]   or smoking things in order to increase alertness
[00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:17.160]   is not a new idea.
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:18.960]   It's just that in ADHD,
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:22.580]   it's surprising that these things would work, right?
[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:24.700]   I mean, if the problem is attention deficit
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:26.580]   hyperactivity disorder,
[00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:30.160]   what we're really talking about here are children
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:33.340]   that are prescribed a drug that ought to be a stimulant.
[00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:35.540]   It ought to make them hyper hyperactive.
[00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:36.920]   And rather than doing that,
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:40.380]   it actually somehow serves to calm them a bit
[00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:42.620]   or at least allow them to focus.
[00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:43.780]   Here's the reason.
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:47.060]   Children have a brain that's very plastic,
[00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:50.620]   meaning it can remodel itself and change in response
[00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:54.460]   to experience very, very quickly compared to adults.
[00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:56.940]   Taking stimulants as a child,
[00:49:56.940 --> 00:50:00.060]   if you are a child diagnosed with ADHD,
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:04.520]   allows that forebrain task-related network to come online,
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:07.400]   to be active at the appropriate times.
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.680]   And because those children are young,
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:12.680]   it allows those children to learn what focus is
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:16.840]   and to sort of follow or enter that tunnel of focus.
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:20.300]   Now, by taking a drug, it's creating focus artificially.
[00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:21.940]   It's not creating focus
[00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:24.060]   because they're super interested in something.
[00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:27.200]   It's chemically inducing a state of focus.
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:30.180]   And let's face it, a lot of childhood and school
[00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:31.500]   and becoming a functional adult
[00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:32.660]   is about learning how to focus
[00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:34.060]   even though you don't want to do something.
[00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:35.140]   In fact, when I was in college,
[00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:37.180]   I had this little trick that may or may not work
[00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:39.300]   for some of you, which is,
[00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:42.320]   if I couldn't focus on the material I was trying to learn,
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:44.460]   I would delude myself into thinking
[00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:46.420]   that it was the most interesting thing in the world.
[00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:48.460]   I would just kind of lie to myself and tell myself,
[00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:50.860]   okay, this, I won't mention the subjects.
[00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:53.960]   I absolutely love this.
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:56.240]   I would tell myself that I loved it.
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:58.940]   And I noticed that just that selective
[00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:03.060]   or deliberate engagement of that desire to know circuit,
[00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:06.100]   whatever that is in my brain, no doubt involves dopamine,
[00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:08.340]   allowed me to focus and remember the information.
[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:11.620]   And somewhat surprisingly, or perhaps not surprisingly,
[00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:13.440]   I would often fall in love with the information.
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:15.100]   I find that that was my favorite class.
[00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:17.060]   It was what I wanted to learn the most.
[00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:19.820]   So that's one way you can do it artificially,
[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:21.960]   but kids with ADHD, they can't do that, right?
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:23.080]   They're told to sit still
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:25.260]   and they end up getting up 11 times.
[00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:28.420]   You know, they are told that they can't speak out in class
[00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:31.620]   or that they have to remain in their seats for 10 minutes.
[00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:33.760]   And they just, despite their best effort,
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:35.060]   they simply cannot do it.
[00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:37.140]   They're highly distractible.
[00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:39.340]   So what are we to make of this whole picture
[00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:42.660]   that we need more dopamine, but these kids with ADHD,
[00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:45.180]   they're getting their dopamine by way of a drug,
[00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:47.920]   which is for all the world, amphetamines, right?
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:48.760]   It's speed.
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:50.140]   That's really what it is.
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:51.460]   What are the long-term consequences?
[00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:53.940]   What are the short-term consequences?
[00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:57.080]   And what should we make of people taking these drugs
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.180]   without a clinical need?
[00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:00.060]   What are the consequences there?
[00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:02.340]   Well, in order to get to some of those answers,
[00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:04.260]   I went to one of my colleagues.
[00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:05.680]   This is a colleague that I've actually known
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:07.020]   for a very long time.
[00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:08.260]   I was their teaching assistant
[00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:10.100]   when they were an undergraduate.
[00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:12.940]   They went on to get an MD, a medical degree,
[00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:17.940]   as well as a PhD and have become a pediatric neurologist
[00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:21.900]   that specializes in the treatment of epilepsy and ADHD
[00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:25.680]   in kids of all ages, from age three to 21.
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:27.580]   That's the age range, pretty broad age range,
[00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:30.180]   and has extensive knowledge in this.
[00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:33.300]   And what makes them particularly interesting
[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:36.960]   for sake of this discussion is that they have a child,
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:40.780]   a young boy, who's now showing signs of ADHD,
[00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:43.940]   and they are on the threshold of trying to decide
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:47.220]   whether or not they will prescribe Adderall
[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:49.180]   or something similar.
[00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:51.300]   So we had a discussion about this,
[00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:56.180]   and prior to learning that their child may have ADHD,
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:57.780]   I asked the following questions.
[00:52:57.780 --> 00:52:58.860]   First of all, I asked,
[00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:02.220]   what do you think about giving young kids amphetamine?
[00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:06.420]   And their answer was, you know, on the face of it,
[00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:07.980]   it seems crazy,
[00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:12.020]   but provided that the lowest possible dose is used
[00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:15.780]   and that that dosage is modulated as they grow older
[00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:17.920]   and develop those powers of attention,
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:22.700]   their observation was that they've seen more kids benefit
[00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:25.500]   than not benefit from that.
[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:27.700]   Now, I'm certainly not saying what people should do.
[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:30.420]   You obviously have to go to a doctor because as I always say,
[00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:32.300]   I'm not a doctor, I don't prescribe anything,
[00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:33.980]   I'm a professor, so I profess things.
[00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:35.900]   And here I'm professing that you talk to your doctor
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:39.100]   if you're considering giving Ritalin or Adderall
[00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:41.460]   or any type of stimulant to your child, of course.
[00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:44.000]   What could be more important than the health of your child?
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.420]   But it was a very interesting answer
[00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:48.580]   because typically we hear yes, Medicaid or don't Medicaid.
[00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:51.560]   Rarely do we hear that the medication should be adjusted
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:54.620]   across the lifespan and in any particular kind of way.
[00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:56.340]   Now, the fact that this person,
[00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:58.540]   this now friend of mine and colleague of mine
[00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:02.780]   has so much expertise in the way that the brain works
[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:06.660]   and is considering putting their child on such medication,
[00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:08.840]   I said, you know,
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:11.460]   why wouldn't you wait until your kid reaches puberty?
[00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:14.660]   I mean, we know that in boys and in girls
[00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:16.620]   there are increases in testosterone and estrogen
[00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:19.820]   during puberty that dramatically change
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:21.400]   the way that the body appears,
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:23.020]   but also that dramatically changed
[00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:24.180]   the way that the brain functions
[00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:26.660]   in particular, we know this,
[00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:29.420]   that puberty triggers the activation
[00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:32.960]   of so-called frontotemporal task-related
[00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:33.980]   executive functioning.
[00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:37.220]   That's just fancy science speak for being able to focus,
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:38.580]   being able to direct your attention,
[00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:40.240]   being able to control your impulses.
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:42.420]   Look at a small child or look at a puppy
[00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:45.160]   and then look at an older child or look at a dog,
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:47.880]   very different levels, patterns of spontaneous behavior.
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.060]   Young children move around a lot.
[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:50.620]   They're, I don't want to say shifty
[00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:51.460]   'cause that makes it sound like
[00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:53.460]   they're up to something bad, which they might be,
[00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:55.480]   but they don't have to be up to something bad.
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:56.500]   They fidget a lot.
[00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:58.500]   So do puppies, everything's a stimulus.
[00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:00.460]   As animals and humans get older,
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:04.220]   they learn how to control their behavior and sit still,
[00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:07.540]   listen and focus, even if they don't want to.
[00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:11.140]   So giving a drug that allows a child
[00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:14.740]   to access that stillness early on,
[00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:18.060]   it's thought will allow them to maintain that ability
[00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:19.580]   as time goes on.
[00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:21.520]   But I decided to push a little bit further.
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:25.060]   I said, well, why would you do it now
[00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:28.420]   as opposed to during puberty or after puberty?
[00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:30.540]   And their answer was very specific
[00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:31.500]   and I think very important.
[00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:33.500]   What they said was, look,
[00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:37.180]   neuroplasticity is greatest in childhood
[00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:40.320]   and tapers off after about age 25,
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:42.980]   but neuroplasticity from age three
[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:47.980]   until age 12 or 13 is exceedingly high.
[00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:49.020]   And they're right.
[00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:49.860]   When you sit back
[00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:52.040]   and you look at the literature on neuroplasticity,
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:54.640]   you'd say childhood plasticity and young adult plasticity
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:56.960]   is much greater than adult plasticity,
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:00.280]   but that early childhood plasticity is far and away
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:03.420]   the period in which you can reshape the brain
[00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:05.380]   at an accelerated rate.
[00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:08.820]   So this lines up really well with the clinical literature,
[00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:10.720]   not surprisingly, they're a clinician,
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:13.480]   that early treatment is key.
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:16.520]   If you have the opportunity to work with a quality physician
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:18.400]   and treat these things early,
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:21.100]   these drugs can allow these frontal circuits,
[00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:23.040]   these task-related circuits,
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:26.040]   to achieve their appropriate levels of functioning
[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:27.800]   and for kids to learn how to focus
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:30.380]   in a variety of different contexts.
[00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:33.320]   Now, is that the only thing that they should be doing?
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:34.320]   Of course not.
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:36.620]   So the next question I asked was,
[00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:40.040]   what should we make of all this diet related stuff, right?
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:44.260]   I've heard before that the so-called elimination diet
[00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:48.820]   or ingesting no sugars or no dairy or no gluten,
[00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:50.980]   that all of these things have been purported
[00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:53.420]   to improve symptoms of ADHD.
[00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:57.540]   And people and parents with ADHD go to fanatic lengths
[00:56:57.540 --> 00:57:01.300]   to try and find the exact foods that are causing problems
[00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:04.820]   and the exact foods that the kids can eat
[00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:07.260]   in order to try and get their brain wired up right
[00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:11.940]   and correctly and to avoid lifelong ADHD.
[00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:14.060]   And their answer was really interesting.
[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:16.020]   But before I tell you their answer,
[00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:19.020]   I want to tell you the studies and the data related
[00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:21.700]   to this question of whether or not food
[00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:24.940]   and the constellation of foods that one avoids
[00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:28.100]   and will eat has anything to do with our levels of attention
[00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:30.140]   and in particular, whether or not that can be used
[00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:33.420]   as a leverage point to treat ADHD.
[00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:36.260]   So you can imagine the challenges of exploring the role
[00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:39.120]   of diet and nutrition in any study,
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:41.220]   but especially in a study on ADHD.
[00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:42.060]   Why?
[00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:43.580]   Well, because as I mentioned before,
[00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:47.020]   children with ADHD and it turns out adults with ADHD tend
[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:49.660]   to pursue sugary foods or any types of food
[00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:51.500]   that increase their levels of dopamine.
[00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:53.060]   They are naturally drawn to those foods,
[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:55.260]   whether or not they realize it or not,
[00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:58.300]   presumably as a way to try and treat their lack of focus
[00:57:58.300 --> 00:57:59.960]   and impulsivity.
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:03.300]   So in this study that I'm about to share with you,
[00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:04.740]   there was no drug treatment.
[00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:07.740]   It was just a study manipulating diet
[00:58:07.740 --> 00:58:09.240]   and involved a hundred children,
[00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:12.380]   50 in the so-called elimination diet group,
[00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:14.620]   the special diet where certain foods were eliminated
[00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:16.640]   and 50 in the so-called control group.
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:21.380]   However, being a well-designed randomized controlled trial,
[00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:23.740]   the study also included a crossover,
[00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:27.480]   meaning where the kids would serve as their own control
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:30.020]   or control group at a certain portion of the studies.
[00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:31.500]   They will be in one group where they eliminated
[00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:33.860]   certain foods and then after a period of time in the study,
[00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:35.220]   they would swap to the other group.
[00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:37.660]   This is a powerful way to design a study for reasons
[00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:41.260]   that you can imagine because you start to eliminate changes
[00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:43.500]   in effects due to individual differences.
[00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:45.700]   In any case, a hundred children total,
[00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:48.180]   50 in each group at any one period in time.
[00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:52.260]   And the effects that they observed were extremely dramatic.
[00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:54.980]   In the world of statistics and analysis of scientific data,
[00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:57.180]   we talk about P values, probability values.
[00:58:57.180 --> 00:58:59.200]   What's the likelihood that something could happen
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:00.060]   according to chance?
[00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:02.640]   And typically the cutoff would be something like P
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:04.340]   less than 0.05.
[00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:08.700]   That's less than 0.05 chance essentially
[00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:11.780]   of the effect being due to chance.
[00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:14.340]   However, in this study, every single one of the effects
[00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:17.480]   is P less than 0.0001.
[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:20.660]   Very, very infinitesimally small probability
[00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:23.320]   that the effects observed could be due to chance.
[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:24.240]   So what were these effects?
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:26.960]   These effects were enhanced ability to focus,
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:30.620]   less impulsivity, even less tendency to move
[00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:32.740]   when trying to sit still.
[00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:34.900]   So everything from mental focus to the ability
[00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:36.820]   to control their bodies improved when they were
[00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:38.680]   in the elimination diet group.
[00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:39.660]   What was eliminated?
[00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:44.100]   Well, the elimination diet in this particular study
[00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:47.520]   was a so-called oligoantigenic diet.
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:51.100]   It was a diet in which each kid took a test to determine
[00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:53.900]   which foods they had antibodies for,
[00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:56.800]   meaning that they were mildly allergic to.
[00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:58.300]   Now in this study, it was very important
[00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:00.620]   that the kids not be extremely allergic to any food
[01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:01.900]   because as I mentioned before,
[01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:05.320]   they actually served as a control at one point in the study
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:06.920]   where they were eating all sorts of foods,
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:08.860]   including foods that they had mild allergies to.
[01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:11.700]   So basically what this study said
[01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:16.300]   was that eliminating foods to which children have allergies
[01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:19.720]   can dramatically improve their symptoms of ADHD.
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:22.020]   And this study, not surprisingly,
[01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:24.280]   because it was published in such a high quality journal,
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:26.700]   Lancet, et cetera, large number of subjects,
[01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:28.800]   set the world on fire.
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:32.060]   People were extremely excited about these results
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:34.760]   because here in the absence of any drug treatment,
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:36.240]   there was a significant improvement
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.040]   in ADHD symptoms observed.
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:40.860]   And then came the criticisms.
[01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:44.580]   So many papers were published after this,
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:48.020]   specifically dealing with reanalysis of these data.
[01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:52.360]   And I want to be fair in saying that the data in the paper
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:55.060]   look good, but there are criticisms
[01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:57.660]   of the overall structural design in the study.
[01:00:57.660 --> 01:00:59.460]   I don't want to go into all the details exactly
[01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:02.420]   'cause it gets really nuanced about some of the statistics
[01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:05.700]   and the way that one examines these types of data,
[01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:07.580]   but there was skepticism.
[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:09.400]   And in science, skepticism is healthy,
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.460]   especially when making decisions about whether or not
[01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:14.300]   to treat or feed children one food or another,
[01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:16.000]   or give them one drug or another.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.560]   Now I want to return to the story of my friend
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:23.220]   who is a pediatric neurologist and treats ADHD
[01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:25.600]   and has a child who is on the precipice
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:27.900]   of perhaps starting to take drugs
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:29.400]   for the treatment of ADHD.
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:31.020]   I asked the simple question,
[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:33.740]   do you see an effect of diet?
[01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:37.660]   Meaning when parents control the diet of their children,
[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:41.100]   does it make a positive or negative or no difference
[01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:44.760]   in terms of the way that the kids respond to ADHD drugs
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:46.540]   like Ritalin and Adderall,
[01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:48.340]   or whether or not it can help them avoid
[01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:50.100]   treating with those drugs entirely?
[01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:52.140]   And her response was very straightforward.
[01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:54.900]   She said, "Elimination of simple sugars
[01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:56.940]   has a dramatic and positive effect."
[01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:59.340]   She's observed that over and over and over again
[01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:03.300]   in many dozens, if not hundreds of patients, okay?
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:04.820]   Now that's not a peer reviewed study,
[01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:07.100]   that's a statement that I'm conveying to you anecdotally,
[01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:09.120]   but it's a highly, highly informed one.
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:12.760]   I said, "What about these elimination diets?"
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.500]   She said, and I found other sources to support this,
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:18.500]   that these only go into genic diets are controversial.
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:21.100]   There are many people who really believe
[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:23.700]   in identifying all the things that you're allergic to
[01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:26.340]   and making sure that you and especially your kids
[01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:27.540]   avoid those foods.
[01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:30.580]   However, there's another camp that's starting to emerge
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.620]   in the peer reviewed scientific literature
[01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:37.540]   showing that when kids are not exposed to certain foods,
[01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:40.100]   in particular nuts and things of that sort,
[01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:42.660]   they develop allergies to those foods
[01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:44.240]   and then when exposed to them later,
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:45.360]   they cause real problems.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:48.940]   So there's a whole galaxy of discussion and controversy
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:51.560]   and outright fighting about allergies in kids
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:53.320]   and whether or not the oligoantigenic diet
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:54.160]   is the appropriate one.
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:58.400]   However, out of the four neurologists and psychiatrists
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:01.620]   that I spoke to about ADHD in preparation for this,
[01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:03.320]   every single one said,
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.720]   "Children with ADHD as much as possible
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:08.940]   should be encouraged to avoid high sugar
[01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:11.320]   and simple sugar foods of most kinds."
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:14.680]   And if they can find particular foods
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:16.360]   that exacerbate their symptoms,
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:20.360]   obviously eliminating those foods is beneficial.
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:24.160]   And the foods that exacerbate their symptoms change
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:25.800]   over time.
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:28.700]   So I don't like giving a complicated answer,
[01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:31.320]   but I also don't like giving an incomplete answer.
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:34.640]   What this tells me is that children,
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:37.880]   and especially young children who have ADHD
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:41.460]   should probably not eat much sugar,
[01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:43.220]   in particular simple sugars.
[01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:44.660]   In addition to that,
[01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:47.720]   exploring whether or not they have existing allergies
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:50.000]   to foods they already consume
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.180]   might be a good idea.
[01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:53.840]   At least that's what this paper,
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:56.560]   the Pelser et al. Lancet paper seems to speak to.
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:59.880]   And I should mention that that paper was published in 2011.
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:03.120]   Since then, there have been many dozens of studies
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:04.120]   exploring the same thing,
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:06.460]   as well as meta-analyses of all those data.
[01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:09.320]   And it does appear that diet can have
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:13.200]   a highly significant role in eliminating
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:15.320]   or at least reducing the symptoms of ADHD.
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:17.700]   So much so that some of the children
[01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:19.720]   are able to not take medication at all
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:22.960]   or eventually wean themselves off medication
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.680]   as young adults and as adults.
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:28.480]   One interesting question is whether or not adults
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.760]   should modify their diet
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:32.680]   in order to increase their levels of focus
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:35.520]   if they're already having normal levels of focus,
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:36.400]   but would like more,
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:40.280]   or would like to reduce existing adult ADHD.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:44.740]   That's an interesting and even more controversial topic.
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:46.520]   It brings us right into the realm
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:48.600]   of what are called omega-3 fatty acids.
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:50.120]   I've talked many times on this podcast
[01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:53.220]   about the known benefits of omega-3 fatty acids,
[01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:58.220]   in particular, getting one gram, 1,000 milligrams or more,
[01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:00.880]   even as much as 2,000 milligrams each day
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:05.880]   of the so-called EPA component of omega-3 fatty acids,
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:08.600]   known to have antidepressant effects,
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:09.640]   mood elevating effects,
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:13.080]   known to have important effects
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:15.560]   protecting the cardiovascular system.
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:17.080]   I think it's now clear
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.820]   that the immune system also benefits
[01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:20.720]   that omega-3 fatty acids
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:25.520]   that include a gram or more of EPAs are very beneficial.
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:27.080]   Typically, that's done through fish oil.
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.080]   Liquid fish oil is going to be the most cost efficient,
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:30.440]   but there are capsule forms.
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:33.040]   For those of you that don't like fish oil,
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:34.280]   you can ingest this through other means.
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.920]   You can get it from certain algaes or krill, et cetera.
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:40.680]   You have to make it compatible with your particular diet,
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:42.000]   whether or not you're vegan or vegetarian
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.220]   or omnivore, et cetera.
[01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:46.000]   Omega-3s have been shown
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.480]   to have all these positive health benefits.
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:52.260]   Do they have positive effects on focus and attention?
[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:53.680]   And the answer is,
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:57.320]   you can find studies that support that statement,
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.360]   and the effects are significant,
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:01.300]   but the effects are modest.
[01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:06.340]   You can also find studies that show no effect.
[01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:10.600]   However, much like with omega-3s and antidepressants,
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:16.360]   whereby ingestion of omega-3 fatty acids
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:18.320]   of a gram or more of EPA per day
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.140]   allows people with major depression
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:21.920]   to get away with taking lower doses
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:23.760]   of antidepressant medication,
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:28.640]   it does seem that ingestion of omega-3 fatty acids in adults
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:33.880]   that include EPAs of 1,000 milligrams or more
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:36.040]   can allow adults with ADHD
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:38.560]   or mild attention deficit issues
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:43.560]   to function well on lower doses of medication
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:47.340]   and in rare cases to eliminate medication entirely.
[01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:49.360]   So what this says is once again
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:51.600]   that the omega-3 fatty acids are beneficial.
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:54.760]   Will they cure or eliminate ADHD?
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:57.040]   I think it's safe to say no.
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:58.380]   They are playing a supportive
[01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:00.680]   or what we call a modulatory role.
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:04.320]   Just like good sleep plays a supportive and modulatory role
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:05.500]   for essentially everything,
[01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.100]   your immune system, your ability to think,
[01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:08.440]   your ability to regulate your emotion,
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.780]   it's modulating that process.
[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:12.960]   This component of modulation
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:14.840]   is extremely important to highlight.
[01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:16.880]   And I think I want to spend a moment on it
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:19.080]   because this is especially important
[01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:20.480]   in the context of ADHD
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:22.880]   and all the information that's out there.
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:26.160]   There are biological processes that are mediated
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:28.920]   by particular compounds like dopamine.
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:31.200]   So for instance, the ability to feel motivated
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.160]   and to attend, to focus,
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:35.860]   is mediated by the circuits in the brain
[01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:38.400]   that release dopamine.
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:42.680]   However, attention is also modulated by how rested you are.
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:45.760]   If you want to eliminate your ability to think well at all,
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:48.640]   just stay up for two nights and don't sleep at all, right?
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:51.760]   If you do that, you will have modulated the circuits
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:55.280]   in your brain that respond to various things
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.960]   and you will be highly distractible.
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:58.120]   You will be highly emotional.
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:07:59.600]   You will feel like garbage.
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:02.720]   But that doesn't mean that sleep mediates focus
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:05.800]   and attention, it modulates it indirectly.
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:08.540]   Likewise, I think these omega-3 fatty acids,
[01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:12.320]   in particular the EPAs, which are so beneficial for mood
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:14.680]   and apparently also for attention,
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:18.440]   they don't directly mediate attention and mood.
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:20.600]   What they do is they modulate those circuits.
[01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:23.120]   They make dopamine more available.
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:25.200]   They make whatever dopamine is available
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:28.480]   more likely to bind to the various receptors
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:30.640]   that are present on neurons and so forth.
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:33.100]   And I think this is very important because likewise,
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:35.260]   diet and any discussion about nutrition
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:38.440]   has to include this framework of is the diet,
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:41.420]   the elimination diet or whether or not it's some other diet
[01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:43.080]   or esoteric diet, ketogenic diet,
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:46.120]   is it modulating or mediating a process?
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:48.780]   And most likely in the context of ADHD,
[01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:50.960]   it's modulating that process.
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:54.340]   So if the ADHD is mild or if it's caught early enough
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:57.680]   or if it's in conjunction with pharmacology
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:59.280]   with a prescription treatment,
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:01.860]   well, then it might help guide the child or adult
[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:03.940]   to a better place of being able to focus.
[01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:07.120]   But it's not going to be the switch that flips everything.
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:10.780]   Now, that does not mean that consuming the wrong foods,
[01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:13.120]   sugary foods or foods that you happen to be allergic to
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.120]   is a good idea.
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:16.040]   It will still be detrimental.
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:18.000]   So I hope that conceptual framework helps
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.080]   'cause if you go online, if you're somebody with ADHD or not
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:24.460]   you are going to be bombarded with the ADHD diet,
[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:26.920]   the oligoantigenic diet, the elimination,
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:29.200]   this supplement, that EPA.
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:31.560]   And I think it's very important to understand
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:32.680]   whether or not you're talking about
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:36.280]   something mediating a process or modulating a process.
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:38.840]   Now, drugs like Ritalin, drugs like Adderall,
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:41.020]   they are tapping into the circuitries
[01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:45.320]   and the neurochemistries that mediate attention and focus.
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:47.400]   They are not the only alternatives
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:50.340]   or the only choices rather for treatment of these circuits
[01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:52.200]   and enhancement of the circuits for focus.
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.940]   I'm going to talk about other alternatives
[01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:55.980]   and some behavioral alternatives
[01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:57.420]   that are not very well known,
[01:09:57.420 --> 01:10:00.920]   but are very, very effective in a few minutes.
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:03.460]   But I really want to make this clear distinction
[01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:05.600]   between modulation and mediation
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:09.120]   because it's vital for anyone that's trying to modulate
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.600]   or mediate anything within their own brain.
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:14.360]   If any of you are interested in this oligoantigenic diet
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:16.080]   as it relates to ADHD,
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:19.680]   and you want to explore a more recent study
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:22.740]   besides that classic 2011 Lancet study
[01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:23.820]   that's rather controversial,
[01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:25.200]   there's a paper that was published
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:29.060]   in Frontiers in Psychiatry just last year, 2020.
[01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:31.580]   The title of the paper is Oligoantigenic Diet
[01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:35.780]   Improves Children's ADHD Rating Scale Scores Reliably
[01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:37.740]   in Added Video Rating.
[01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:39.540]   The added video rating is just that they're using
[01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:43.260]   an additional measure of focus and attention.
[01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:46.180]   Again, that's Frontiers in Psychiatry 2020.
[01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:48.260]   I'll put a link to it in the caption,
[01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:51.080]   and that's a more recent study for you to peruse.
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.100]   So we've talked about the neural circuits of focus
[01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:55.200]   and the chemistry of focus,
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:59.400]   but we haven't talked yet about what would make us better
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.960]   at focusing and what focusing better really is.
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:06.080]   So let's take a step back and think about how we focus
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:07.820]   and how to get better at focus.
[01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:10.040]   And I'm going to share with you a tool
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:13.280]   for which there are terrific research data
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:15.680]   that will allow you in a single session
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:20.080]   to enhance your ability to focus in theory forever.
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:24.520]   What I'm about to read you is from an excellent book
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:27.380]   that I recommend if any of you are interested in neuroscience
[01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:30.500]   and things like meditation and default mode networks
[01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:32.120]   and things of that sort.
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:33.900]   The book is called Altered Traits.
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:37.920]   Science reveals how meditation changes your mind,
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:39.220]   brain, and body.
[01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:41.760]   And no, I'm not going to try and convince you to meditate.
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:44.520]   I'm going to share with you a small passage in the book
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:47.380]   that relates some research data related to focus
[01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:48.680]   that are very important.
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:50.600]   If you want to meditate, that's your choice.
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:51.440]   That's a separate matter.
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:54.240]   This is a book by Daniel Goleman and Richard Davidson,
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:56.880]   and I should just mention that Goleman is a well-known
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:59.420]   author, he's written books on emotional intelligence
[01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:00.820]   and so forth.
[01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:04.200]   Richard Davidson is also a PhD.
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:06.500]   He's a professor of psychology and psychiatry,
[01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:09.520]   and he's at a University of Wisconsin, Madison.
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:12.280]   He's done terrific work on brain states
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:14.520]   and modulation of brain states and so forth.
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:19.440]   What we're about to talk about is when attention works
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:21.920]   and when attention falters.
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:24.080]   And what we are specifically going to talk about
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:26.780]   are what are called attentional blinks,
[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:28.040]   not actual eye blinks.
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:29.780]   We're going to talk about that in a few minutes,
[01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:32.180]   but we're going to talk about attentional blinks.
[01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:37.560]   I'm paraphrasing here because Goleman and Davidson
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:39.200]   wrote about this so beautifully.
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:41.700]   I'd rather paraphrase from them than try and just make up
[01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:44.960]   a new way to say it that is less interesting or less good,
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.880]   but I want to credit them.
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:48.840]   Attentional blinks are really easy to understand
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.760]   if you think about a where's Waldo task.
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:52.260]   You know this task, where's Waldo,
[01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:54.920]   where there are a bunch of people and objects
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.160]   and things in a picture.
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:58.580]   And somewhere in there is Waldo with the striped hat
[01:12:58.580 --> 01:13:00.680]   and the glasses and kind of a skinny dude,
[01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:02.360]   and you have to find Waldo.
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:05.220]   And so it's a visual search and it's visual search
[01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:07.300]   for an object that has distinct features,
[01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:10.660]   but is embedded in this ocean of other things
[01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:12.700]   that could easily be confused as Waldo.
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:14.860]   So you tend to look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.
[01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:16.560]   And then you find Waldo.
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:18.240]   Kids can do this, they enjoy doing this.
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:21.120]   Adults may or may not enjoy it, but they can do it too.
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:22.080]   They find Waldo.
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:26.120]   When you find Waldo or when you search for a target
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:28.160]   in some other visual search task,
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:31.920]   at that moment, your nervous system celebrates a little bit.
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:34.720]   And it celebrates through the release of neurochemicals
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:35.560]   that make you feel good.
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:38.260]   You found it and you pause.
[01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:41.780]   Now the pause is interesting because when you pause,
[01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:45.920]   what we know from many experiments is that in that moment
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:49.940]   of pause and mild celebration, however mild,
[01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:54.280]   you are not able to see another Waldo
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:56.140]   sitting right next to it.
[01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:59.360]   So what this means is in attending to something,
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:03.960]   in searching and in identifying a visual target,
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:07.180]   your attention blinked, it shut off for a second.
[01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:11.220]   And there's a more formal and more laboratory type way
[01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:12.260]   that we look at this.
[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:16.600]   The more typical way to do this is to give someone
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:19.480]   a string of letters or a string of numbers.
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:23.140]   And beforehand, you tell them be on the lookout
[01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:27.320]   for the letters R and Z, okay?
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:30.080]   You're just going to watch this string of numbers go by
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:31.840]   and there will be a letter R in there
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:33.760]   and there will be a letter Z in there
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:35.860]   and try and spot them both.
[01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:40.320]   And what you find is when you present that string of numbers
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:43.520]   and then they see the R, they see the R,
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:48.520]   they register it consciously and they tend to miss the Z,
[01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:51.400]   just like in the Waldo type example.
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:53.560]   Now, of course, the numbers are going by pretty quickly,
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:55.100]   but they can spot the R.
[01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:58.880]   They could also spot the Z if you told them beforehand,
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:02.060]   just spot the Z and the numbers are moving through
[01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:03.560]   at the same rate in both conditions.
[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:05.920]   So what that means is that in every case,
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:10.220]   you are capable of seeing the R or the Z.
[01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:13.960]   It's when you try and see both that seeing the first one
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:16.400]   prevents you from seeing the second one.
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:19.180]   It's what we call an attentional blink.
[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:23.720]   We do this all the time and people with ADHD
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:26.620]   tend to have many more attentional blinks
[01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:27.520]   than people that don't.
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:29.760]   And this is true for children and for adults.
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:32.060]   This is an important point.
[01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:34.040]   So important that I want to emphasize it twice
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:36.540]   in case you intentionally blinked.
[01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:39.060]   If you see something that you're looking for
[01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:40.860]   or you're very interested in something,
[01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:43.560]   you are definitely missing other information.
[01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:48.020]   In part, because you're over focusing on something.
[01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:50.300]   And this leads to a very interesting hypothesis
[01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:53.400]   about what might go wrong in ADHD,
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:56.520]   where we've always thought that they cannot focus
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:58.320]   and yet we know they can focus on things
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:00.420]   they care very much about.
[01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:03.020]   Well, maybe, just maybe,
[01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:06.140]   they are experiencing more attentional blinks
[01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:09.000]   than people who do not have ADHD.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.420]   And indeed there are data now to support the possibility
[01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:14.100]   that that's actually what's happening.
[01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:16.900]   And that should be exciting to anyone that has ADHD.
[01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:18.740]   It should also be exciting to anyone that cares
[01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:22.100]   about increasing their focus and their ability to attend.
[01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:23.740]   What this is saying is that these circuits
[01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:26.360]   that underlie focus and our ability to attend
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:28.540]   and our ability to eliminate distraction,
[01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:32.060]   they aren't just failing to focus.
[01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:35.420]   That's just a semantic way of describing the outcome.
[01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:37.580]   They are over focusing on certain things
[01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:39.580]   and thereby missing other things.
[01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:42.600]   And so our distractibility or the distractibility
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:45.560]   of somebody with ADHD could exist
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:49.400]   because they are over focusing on certain elements
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:51.880]   and they are therefore missing other elements
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:53.900]   that they should be attending to.
[01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:57.500]   So what they really need is this property
[01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.020]   that we call open monitoring.
[01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:01.440]   Now, open monitoring is something that's described
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:02.800]   in the book that I just referred to.
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:05.880]   And that typically is associated with people
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:07.540]   who have done a lot of meditation,
[01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:09.200]   so-called vipassana meditation,
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:12.540]   or have spent a lot of time learning how to do
[01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:15.280]   what's called open gaze visual analysis
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:16.300]   and open gaze thinking.
[01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:17.740]   But there's a simpler version of this
[01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:19.700]   that allows us to bypass all that.
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:23.820]   First of all, your visual system
[01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:26.740]   has two modes of processing.
[01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:28.880]   It can be highly focused, a soda straw view.
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:31.340]   So looking for the R in this string of numbers
[01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:33.020]   in the example that I just gave,
[01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:34.740]   or if you're very excited about something,
[01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:36.420]   you're in that soda straw view of the world
[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:37.960]   and you're missing other things, okay?
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:40.300]   That's high levels of attention.
[01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:43.340]   However, there's also a property of your visual system
[01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:45.040]   that allows you to dilate your gaze,
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:47.300]   to be in so-called panoramic vision.
[01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:49.360]   Panoramic vision is something you can do right now,
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:51.900]   no matter where you are, and I can do it right now.
[01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:53.220]   You won't know that I'm doing it,
[01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:56.380]   but even though I'm still looking directly at you,
[01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:58.340]   I'm consciously dilating my gaze
[01:17:58.340 --> 01:17:59.820]   so that I can see the ceiling, the floor,
[01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:01.140]   and the walls all around me.
[01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:03.520]   That panoramic vision is actually mediated
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:06.860]   by a separate stream or set of neural circuits
[01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:08.460]   going from the eye into the brain.
[01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:10.920]   And it's a stream or set of circuits
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:13.180]   that isn't just wide angle view.
[01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:16.240]   It also is better at processing things in time.
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:18.160]   Its frame rate is higher.
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:20.060]   So you've seen slow motion video
[01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:21.740]   and you've seen standard video.
[01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:26.620]   Slow motion video gives you that slow motion look
[01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:30.180]   because it's a higher frame rate, your thin slicing time.
[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:35.380]   You can use panoramic vision to access the state
[01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:36.680]   that we call open monitoring.
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:41.060]   When people do that, they are able to attend to
[01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:44.260]   and recognize multiple targets
[01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:46.100]   within this string of numbers.
[01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:48.200]   They can see the R and they can see the Z
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:50.140]   and they can see additional things.
[01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:52.660]   So this is something that can be trained up
[01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:53.980]   and people can practice whether or not
[01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:56.140]   they have ADHD or not.
[01:18:56.140 --> 01:18:57.560]   What it involves is learning
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:58.980]   how to dilate your gaze consciously.
[01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:01.420]   That's actually quite easy for most people.
[01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:03.380]   Whether or not you wear corrective lenses
[01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:06.260]   or contacts or not, you can consciously go into open gaze
[01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:09.640]   and then you can contract your field of view as well.
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:11.340]   There have also been studies done
[01:19:11.340 --> 01:19:15.940]   where people were taught to think in a particular way
[01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:17.760]   for a very short period of time
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:21.480]   and that forever changed their ability to limit
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:24.300]   or reduce the number of these attentional blinks.
[01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:26.020]   There are now published accounts in the literature
[01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:29.820]   of a simple practice done for about 15 minutes
[01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:32.220]   where subjects were asked to just sit quietly,
[01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:35.060]   eyes closed and do what is sort of akin to meditation
[01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:36.340]   but to not direct their mind
[01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:38.340]   into any particular state or place
[01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:40.380]   but simply to think about their breathing
[01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:42.640]   and to focus on their so-called interoception,
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:44.240]   focus on how their body feels,
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:45.940]   their mind drifted to bring it back.
[01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:50.200]   Okay, so it's basically meditation for about 15 minutes.
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:53.620]   That might not seem like a significant or unusual practice
[01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:55.900]   or that it would have any impact at all
[01:19:55.900 --> 01:20:00.900]   but remarkably just doing that once for 17 minutes
[01:20:01.820 --> 01:20:05.140]   significantly reduced the number of attentional blinks
[01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:06.560]   that people would carry out.
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:08.540]   In other words, their focus got better
[01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:12.360]   in a near permanent way without any additional training.
[01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:13.980]   There's something about that practice
[01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:17.140]   of reducing the amount of visual information coming in
[01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:19.580]   and learning to pay attention to one's internal state,
[01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:21.420]   what we call interoception,
[01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:23.100]   that allowed them an awareness
[01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:26.060]   such that when they needed to look for visual targets,
[01:20:26.060 --> 01:20:29.000]   when they need to focus on multiple things in sequence,
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.500]   they didn't experience the same number of attentional blinks.
[01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:34.980]   And I should mention not incidentally,
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:38.200]   as people age and their working memory gets worse
[01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:40.860]   and their ability to focus gets worse,
[01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:44.180]   the number of attentional blinks that they carry out goes up.
[01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:45.740]   And there are now studies exploring
[01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:48.900]   whether or not this simple meditation-like practice
[01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:51.620]   of 15 to 20 minutes or so of sitting
[01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:53.980]   and just quietly resting and paying attention
[01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:55.900]   to one's breathing and internal state
[01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:58.700]   can also offset some of that age-related,
[01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:01.380]   what is called cognitive decline.
[01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:04.300]   So what these data tell me is that regardless
[01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:07.100]   of whether or not you're a child or you're an adult,
[01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:09.900]   whether or not you have ADHD or not,
[01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:11.140]   whether or not you're experiencing
[01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:12.680]   age-related cognitive decline,
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:14.240]   or you would simply like to avoid
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:15.860]   age-related cognitive decline,
[01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:21.420]   a simple practice of taking 17 minutes sitting
[01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:23.740]   and paying attention to your internal state,
[01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:26.980]   just interocepting, registering your breathing,
[01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:29.140]   registering the contact of your skin
[01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:31.220]   with whatever surface you're on,
[01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:35.560]   can forever rewire your brain to be able to attend better
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:37.380]   and possibly even offset
[01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:40.120]   some of that age-related attentional drift.
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:44.900]   Now, I don't expect anyone to start meditating regularly.
[01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:47.500]   I don't expect anyone to do anything they don't want to do,
[01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:51.460]   but I think most of us could handle one meditation session
[01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:53.500]   of 17 minutes or so.
[01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:54.980]   And so if ever there was a tool
[01:21:54.980 --> 01:21:57.340]   that stood to rewire our attentional circuitry
[01:21:57.340 --> 01:22:00.700]   in a powerful way, this seems to be it.
[01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:05.540]   And in addition, the ability to engage in panoramic vision,
[01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:08.820]   to dilate our gaze, this so-called open monitoring
[01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:10.820]   that allows the brain to function in a way
[01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:13.200]   that it can detect more information faster,
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:14.660]   that's a powerful tool as well.
[01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:17.180]   And the beauty of that tool is that it works the first time
[01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:19.020]   and it works every time.
[01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:23.740]   Now, how exactly it works is a little bit unclear.
[01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:28.020]   Is it, for instance, orchestrating this synchrony
[01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:30.580]   or asynchrony between the default mode network
[01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:31.760]   and the task-related networks?
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:32.700]   We don't know.
[01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:35.340]   Those studies have not yet been carried out.
[01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:37.620]   Nonetheless, the effects are significant,
[01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:39.180]   they are long lasting,
[01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:42.460]   and they appear to exist after just one session
[01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:45.740]   of this quiet 17-minute interoception,
[01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:47.860]   which to me makes it seem like a very worthwhile thing
[01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:49.780]   to do for everybody.
[01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:51.940]   So we just talked about attentional blinks,
[01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:54.320]   which are essentially blinks of thinking.
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:56.480]   It's your mind shutting off for a moment
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:58.660]   and missing information.
[01:22:58.660 --> 01:23:00.740]   Now let's talk about actual blinks,
[01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:03.060]   the sort that you do with your eyelids.
[01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:05.500]   Now, this might come across as somewhat obvious,
[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:10.020]   but you can do fast, what are called spontaneous blinks,
[01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:12.800]   and they are always coordinated between the two eyes.
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:14.060]   Or you can do long blinks,
[01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:15.540]   like when you go to sleep at night,
[01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:19.460]   you do one very long blink, and I'm not being facetious.
[01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:20.460]   When you go to sleep at night,
[01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:23.740]   you are shutting your eyelids
[01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:27.480]   and you are limiting the amount of information coming in,
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:30.460]   and your perception of time starts to drift
[01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:31.660]   as you go into sleep.
[01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:35.820]   Your perception of time changes from very fast
[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:37.980]   at one moment to very slow,
[01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:40.140]   meaning the frame rate
[01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:43.100]   at which you are analyzing information,
[01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:46.700]   dreaming, et cetera, is variable when you are in sleep.
[01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:48.160]   Sometimes it's very fast,
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:49.820]   meaning you experience things in slow motion,
[01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:51.100]   sometimes it's very fast.
[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:52.960]   In waking too,
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:57.260]   your experience of time can sometimes be very fast,
[01:23:57.260 --> 01:23:58.540]   sometimes be very slow.
[01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:00.900]   Typically, the more alert you are,
[01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:02.020]   the higher the frame rate,
[01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:05.100]   your thin slicing your experience.
[01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:06.360]   You've probably had this happen.
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:07.460]   If you're ever very stressed
[01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:09.860]   and you're waiting for something or somebody,
[01:24:09.860 --> 01:24:12.260]   it seems like it takes forever
[01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:14.020]   because your frame rate is higher,
[01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:16.420]   you're analyzing time more finely.
[01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:21.060]   Conversely, if you are very relaxed or even sleepy,
[01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:22.660]   you wake up and you have to think about all the things
[01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:23.500]   you have to do,
[01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:25.680]   it will seem like the world is going by very, very fast
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:28.000]   and that you are moving very slow.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.320]   Time is going at the same rate,
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:33.580]   but your perception of time is what's changed.
[01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:35.020]   Believe it or not,
[01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:39.240]   your perception of time is also changed on a rapid basis,
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:43.200]   moment to moment basis by how often you blink.
[01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:46.780]   This is a well-established literature
[01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:48.140]   in the world of neuroscience
[01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:52.660]   that unlike the literature and claims about blinking
[01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:55.660]   and sociopathy, which have no basis,
[01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:59.020]   the science of blinking as it relates to time perception
[01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:01.220]   has some very good data to support it.
[01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:03.940]   I want to just emphasize one study in particular,
[01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:06.500]   which is quite appropriately titled
[01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:09.060]   Time Dilates After Spontaneous Blinking.
[01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:11.480]   This is a paper that was published in Current Biology.
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:15.400]   The first author is Terhune, T-E-R-H-U-N-E.
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:16.600]   It's a wonderful paper.
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:21.100]   They examined the relationship between fluctuations
[01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:23.960]   in timing and blinking.
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:26.180]   And to make a long story short,
[01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:29.920]   what they found is that right after blinks,
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:33.520]   we reset our perception of time, okay?
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:36.080]   So blinks in that sense are a little bit like
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:40.080]   the curtain coming down on a scene between scenes in a play
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:43.160]   or takes in a movie, you know, when they clap thing,
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:45.980]   they start it, take, you know, what do they say?
[01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:46.820]   Action.
[01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:48.720]   And then at the end, they do the thing
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:51.320]   and they click it down and they say, it's a take.
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:52.520]   That's one take.
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:55.040]   When you blink, it's a take, okay?
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:26:00.200]   Now what's interesting and will immediately make sense to you
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:02.720]   as to why this is important
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:07.720]   is that the rate of blinking is controlled by dopamine.
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:11.500]   So what this means is that dopamine is controlling attention,
[01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:14.240]   blinks relate to attention and focus,
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:16.880]   and therefore the dopamine and blinking system
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:20.680]   is one way that you constantly modulate
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:23.800]   and update your perception of time.
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:27.040]   And fortunately, it's also one that you can control.
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:29.120]   So the basic takeaway of this study
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:31.160]   was that blinking controls time perception,
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:33.800]   but also that levels of dopamine
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:38.280]   can alter your sense of time and, stay with me here,
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:42.880]   and that blinking and dopamine are inextricably linked.
[01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:46.020]   They are working together to control your attention.
[01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:48.440]   When dopamine levels go up,
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:53.120]   people tend to overestimate how long something lasted.
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:53.940]   Why?
[01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:56.240]   Because they are processing time more finely.
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:58.160]   It's slow motion mode.
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:01.040]   When dopamine levels are lower,
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:04.400]   they tend to underestimate time intervals.
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:07.200]   Let's remember back to the very beginning of the episode,
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:09.340]   what's going on in people with ADHD?
[01:27:09.340 --> 01:27:12.600]   They are not good at managing their time.
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:15.100]   They tend to run late or they are disorganized.
[01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:17.720]   They are not just disorganized in space,
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:20.080]   meaning in the physical space around them,
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:23.560]   they're disorganized in time.
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:25.280]   Their dopamine is low.
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:26.720]   We know that as well.
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:29.600]   And so they are underestimating time intervals.
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:32.120]   And so it makes perfect sense that they would be late.
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:34.460]   It makes perfect sense that they would lose track of time
[01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:36.620]   or the ability to focus.
[01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:39.680]   This is really exciting because what it means is that
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:42.320]   children with ADHD, adults with ADHD,
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:44.140]   or people with normal levels of focus
[01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:46.900]   that want to improve their ability to focus
[01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:51.040]   can do so through a training that involves learning
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:53.240]   how often to blink and when,
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:56.820]   and how to keep their visual focus on a given target.
[01:27:56.820 --> 01:27:59.880]   And it turns out this study has actually been done.
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:02.220]   There's a study, again, I'll link to this study,
[01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:05.320]   entitled Improvement of Attention in Elementary School
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:08.720]   Students Through Fixation-Focused Training Activity.
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:10.180]   I won't go through all the details,
[01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:14.260]   but what they found was a short period of
[01:28:14.260 --> 01:28:18.600]   focusing on a visual target allowed these schoolchildren
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:21.140]   to greatly enhance their ability to focus
[01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:23.600]   on other types of information.
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:25.520]   And a significant component of the effect
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:28.360]   was due to the way that they were controlling the shutters
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:31.680]   on their eyes, their eyelids, and controlling their blinks.
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:34.200]   So what they did in this study is they had these kids
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:36.760]   focus their visual attention on some object
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:39.160]   that was relatively close, like their hand,
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:41.920]   for a minute or so, which actually takes some effort
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:42.840]   if you try and do that.
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:45.080]   They were allowed to blink.
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:47.660]   However, it's known from other work
[01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:51.480]   that if people can consciously override the desire to blink,
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:53.980]   at least to the point where they feel like they have to
[01:28:53.980 --> 01:28:55.440]   or else their eyes would dry out,
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:58.520]   that actually can increase attention even further.
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:00.240]   And they had conditions where they would look
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:02.240]   at a point further across the room
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:04.580]   and even further across the room.
[01:29:04.580 --> 01:29:07.240]   It only took a few minutes each day to do this,
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:09.680]   30 seconds in one condition or maybe a minute,
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:11.560]   and then at another station of looking
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:13.720]   a little bit further out and a little bit further out.
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:16.380]   However, there was an important feature of this study
[01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:18.560]   that is definitely worth mentioning,
[01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:23.560]   which is before they did this visual focus task or training,
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:27.360]   they did a series of physical movements with the kids
[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:30.480]   so that the kids could sort of eliminate or move out
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:32.600]   some of their desire to move
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:36.360]   and would thereby enhance their ability to sit still.
[01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:38.740]   Now, it's long been known that kids need a recess.
[01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:41.400]   They need time to run around and play and roll around,
[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:42.440]   do whatever it is that they do
[01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:44.820]   in order to be able to sit still at all.
[01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:46.440]   Adults probably need this too, frankly,
[01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:49.700]   but kids need it more because the circuits in the brain
[01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:52.600]   that control reflexive movements
[01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:56.160]   and as we say, kind of rhythmic undulating behavior
[01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:58.800]   and things like that, that's an active suppression.
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:00.760]   And kids have less of that circuitry built up
[01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:03.920]   until they hit about age 15 or 16.
[01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:06.140]   So they had the kids move around a bit
[01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:08.500]   and then do this focus training.
[01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:10.560]   That brings me to another treatment
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:14.380]   that's actively used nowadays in schools for kids with ADHD,
[01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:18.380]   but also it's starting to be used by many kids
[01:30:18.380 --> 01:30:22.480]   and by parents in order to keep their kids focusing
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:27.320]   and not going crazy in the car or not acting out in general.
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:31.100]   And that's the prevalence of these so-called fidgeter toys
[01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:33.600]   or things that kids can do actively and repetitively
[01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:36.520]   in order to move out some of their underlying
[01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:39.280]   reverberatory activity in their nervous system.
[01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:43.000]   So what you will find is that some kids with ADHD
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.660]   are now given a rubber band on their desk,
[01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:47.440]   literally a rubber band that's attached to their desk
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:49.160]   and they're able to pull on it,
[01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:50.600]   even snap it against the desk.
[01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:51.640]   If I had done that when I was a kid,
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:53.380]   I think my teachers would have thrown me out of class,
[01:30:53.380 --> 01:30:54.880]   but I think it's great that they're allowing them
[01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:57.480]   to do this now as a way of moving
[01:30:57.480 --> 01:31:00.640]   some of their physical energy out
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:03.120]   or engage their physical energy rather,
[01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:04.760]   as opposed to trying to sit,
[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:06.900]   statue still all the time and attend.
[01:31:06.900 --> 01:31:08.840]   And it turns out that does enhance
[01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:11.320]   these children's ability to focus mentally
[01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:13.560]   when they have some physical activity to attend to.
[01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:16.940]   And it turns out it also can work for adults.
[01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:19.120]   I'll share with you a related anecdote
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:21.720]   because it illustrates the underlying mechanism.
[01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:24.400]   I've had the great privilege of being able to do
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:28.480]   a number of surgeries, brain surgeries during my career.
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:30.640]   So one thing you find when you do brain surgeries
[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:32.440]   is that the brain's pretty small,
[01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:34.260]   regardless of the species that you're working on
[01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:35.100]   and you're in there
[01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:36.880]   and you're trying to do something very specific.
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:40.420]   And the more you try and hold your hands really steady,
[01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:42.480]   the more they want to shake, all right?
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:44.600]   So it's not natural for any of our limbs
[01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:46.760]   to sit perfectly still.
[01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:48.140]   Depending on how much coffee you've had,
[01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:49.680]   how well rested you are,
[01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:52.040]   and your sort of baseline level of autonomic arousal,
[01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:54.240]   some of you may find that you can hold out your hand
[01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:55.680]   absolutely rock solid.
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:58.360]   Others will shake a little bit more.
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:31:59.840]   Doesn't mean you're nervous if you're shaking,
[01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:02.480]   doesn't mean you're calm if you're still.
[01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:05.120]   What it relates to is the amount
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:06.600]   of what we call premotor activity,
[01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:08.320]   the number of commands to move
[01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:09.680]   that are being sent through the system.
[01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:11.960]   And that's what I mean by reverberatory activity.
[01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:15.980]   And it does seem that kids with ADHD and adults with ADHD
[01:32:15.980 --> 01:32:18.440]   have a lot of reverberatory activity
[01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:19.540]   in their nervous system.
[01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:21.120]   And so that's that constant desire to move.
[01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:22.800]   It's hard for them to sit still
[01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:24.880]   and therefore it's hard for them to attend,
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:26.240]   to harness their attention.
[01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:30.360]   When you do a surgery and you find that your hands
[01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:33.840]   are shaking, what you learn from your mentors,
[01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:36.100]   which I did, and what works extremely well,
[01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:37.760]   whether or not you're doing a surgery or not,
[01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:39.520]   is that you simply tap your foot
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:40.920]   or you bounce your knee a little bit,
[01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:44.200]   which you might think would make your hand shake even more,
[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:45.920]   but provided that it's subtle,
[01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:49.200]   what it does is it actually shuttles some of the activity
[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:51.920]   from those premotor circuits to elsewhere in the body.
[01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:55.100]   And then you're able to sit much more still with your hand.
[01:32:55.100 --> 01:32:57.680]   You're able to perform the surgery with much more precision.
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:00.440]   You are able to write with much better handwriting.
[01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:03.560]   And for those of you who engage in public speaking,
[01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:04.800]   if you're ever too nervous,
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:06.980]   that's why pacing while you public speak helps
[01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:07.820]   if you're nervous.
[01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:10.100]   That's why bouncing your knee behind the podium
[01:33:10.100 --> 01:33:10.940]   works as well.
[01:33:10.940 --> 01:33:13.840]   That's why nodding your head and gesticulating can help.
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:16.560]   It's not a matter of quote unquote moving energy
[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:18.440]   out of the body that doesn't actually happen.
[01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:20.940]   What it is is you're engaging those premotor circuits
[01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:22.300]   that are sending through commands.
[01:33:22.300 --> 01:33:24.960]   It's like trying to stuff a bunch of stuff through a funnel
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:26.640]   and it creates this tension.
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:30.980]   So you're giving it an outlet for the neural circuitry
[01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:32.320]   to be able to move something
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:34.600]   so that you can keep other components of your body
[01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:37.480]   and your mental attention engaged
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:40.960]   and locked onto something, what we call focus.
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:43.240]   One thing related to this whole business of blinking
[01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:45.480]   and focus and training yourself to focus
[01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:47.440]   and not blinking, et cetera,
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:52.440]   is that most all of the drugs, ritalin, Adderall,
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:55.100]   and recreational drugs that increase dopamine,
[01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:58.300]   even coffee and tea and other forms of caffeine,
[01:33:58.300 --> 01:34:01.740]   they tend to make us blink less.
[01:34:01.740 --> 01:34:04.540]   And when we get tired, we tend to blink more.
[01:34:04.540 --> 01:34:07.220]   Now, this is sort of a duh, right?
[01:34:07.220 --> 01:34:10.540]   But being wide-eyed with excitement or fear
[01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:15.320]   or with your eyes barely being able to keep them open,
[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:16.740]   now it should make perfect sense
[01:34:16.740 --> 01:34:18.460]   that these shutters on the front of your eyes,
[01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:20.300]   they aren't just there for winking
[01:34:20.300 --> 01:34:22.940]   and they aren't just there for cosmetic purposes.
[01:34:22.940 --> 01:34:26.280]   They are there to regulate the amount of information
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:27.680]   going into your nervous system.
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:31.100]   And they're there to regulate how long
[01:34:31.100 --> 01:34:33.960]   you are bringing information into your nervous system
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:35.820]   and in what bins,
[01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:39.020]   how widely or finely you are binning time
[01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:40.940]   is set by how often you blink
[01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:45.720]   and how widely or specifically you are grabbing attention
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:47.340]   from the visual world is set by whether or not
[01:34:47.340 --> 01:34:48.880]   you're viewing things very specifically,
[01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:51.780]   like a crosshair or through a soda straw view like this,
[01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:54.000]   or whether or not you were in this panoramic
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.160]   sort of whole environment mode,
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:00.500]   this kind of fisheye lens or wide angle lens mode.
[01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:03.220]   And in fairness to the pharmacology and the circuitry,
[01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:07.740]   while dopamine and heightened levels of alertness
[01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:12.740]   and excitement tend to make us blink less and attend more,
[01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:14.380]   there's actually a study that's looked
[01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:17.760]   at the other neurochemical systems and drugs
[01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:19.400]   and how those relate to blinking.
[01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:22.160]   And so this will all be obvious by the title of the paper
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:23.060]   I'm about to share with you.
[01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:25.300]   This is a paper entitled
[01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:27.940]   Decreased Spontaneous Eye Blink Rates
[01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:29.920]   in Chronic Cannabis Users,
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:34.120]   Evidence for Striatal Cannabinoid Dopamine Interactions.
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:36.100]   Okay, I'm not going to go into all the details here,
[01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:38.980]   but one thing that is somewhat surprising
[01:35:38.980 --> 01:35:43.980]   is that many people with ADHD use or abuse cannabis.
[01:35:44.700 --> 01:35:47.080]   You might think, well, why would they do that?
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:50.520]   Because I thought that a increase in dopamine
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:51.520]   is actually what's going to lead
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:52.680]   to heightened levels of attention,
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:55.160]   and that's what these people and children crave.
[01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:58.680]   Well, it turns out that cannabis also increases
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:00.720]   dopamine transmission in the brain,
[01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:03.400]   but because of the other chemicals it increases,
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:05.280]   namely serotonin and some components
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:07.480]   of the cannabinoid and opioid system,
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:12.480]   it creates that kind of alert but mellow feel.
[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:15.480]   And again, here, I'm not a proponent of this.
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:17.980]   I personally am not a THC or cannabis user.
[01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:19.800]   It's just not my thing.
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:21.760]   And obviously it's illegal some places,
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:24.360]   and so you have to determine that for yourself.
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:25.800]   It does have medical purposes,
[01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:28.340]   and in some places it is legal,
[01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:32.200]   but THC increases dopamine and increases neurochemicals
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:34.100]   that can also create a state of calm.
[01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:35.920]   So it's that sort of middle ground.
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:38.460]   And this paper has a beautiful demonstration
[01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:42.480]   whereby not just while people are using cannabis,
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:45.280]   but depending on how long they've been using cannabis
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:49.120]   across their lifespan, the rates of eye blinking change.
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:51.880]   So if you look at the number of years
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:54.840]   that people have been using cannabis on a regular basis,
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:58.620]   either daily or up to, excuse me, weekly or up to daily,
[01:36:58.620 --> 01:37:00.640]   what you find is that for people
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:02.720]   that have not been using cannabis at all
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:05.480]   or have only been using it for about two years,
[01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:08.220]   their rates of eye blinks are much higher
[01:37:08.220 --> 01:37:10.600]   than people who've been using it chronically for 10 years.
[01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:12.420]   In other words, people who've been using cannabis
[01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:15.400]   for 10 years don't blink very often at all.
[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:19.480]   Now, cannabis has well-known effects in depleting memory,
[01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:23.560]   but it does seem to engage the focus and blinking system
[01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:25.580]   in a way that increases focus.
[01:37:25.580 --> 01:37:27.760]   So basically what I'm saying is marijuana
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:29.200]   seems to increase people's focus,
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:32.040]   but then they can't remember what they were focusing on.
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:33.920]   Something I'd like to discuss just briefly
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:37.480]   is the so-called interoceptive awareness
[01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:39.480]   that's present in people with ADHD,
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:40.800]   both children and adults.
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:43.660]   Interoceptive awareness is one sense
[01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:47.520]   of one's own internal state, heartbeat, breathing,
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:50.540]   contact of skin with a given surface, et cetera.
[01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:52.780]   For a long time, there was this hypothesis,
[01:37:52.780 --> 01:37:54.940]   this idea that people with ADHD
[01:37:54.940 --> 01:37:57.560]   were just not in touch with how they felt,
[01:37:57.560 --> 01:37:59.380]   that somehow they weren't registering
[01:37:59.380 --> 01:38:01.400]   all the stuff that was going on inside them,
[01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:02.940]   changes in heart rate and so forth,
[01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:04.860]   and so they were behaving in a way
[01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:07.840]   that was dysregulated or appear dysregulated,
[01:38:08.740 --> 01:38:11.360]   and that if they could just learn to attend
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:13.200]   to their internal state better,
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:16.280]   that somehow they would function better in the world.
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:19.300]   Now, before we described a process,
[01:38:19.300 --> 01:38:23.080]   literally a 17-minute interoceptive exercise
[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:25.840]   that does seem to lead to improvements
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:29.920]   in one's ability to focus for a longer period of time.
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:33.560]   However, it's very unlikely that that was due
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:37.320]   to increasing interoceptive awareness per se.
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:41.380]   It probably wasn't because people gain a much heightened
[01:38:41.380 --> 01:38:46.120]   or improved ability to understand what's going on internally.
[01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:48.440]   In fact, you can imagine how that might actually prevent
[01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:49.920]   one's ability to pay attention to things
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:51.440]   in the outside world.
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:53.620]   So while there is benefit to just sitting there
[01:38:53.620 --> 01:38:55.340]   and being in stillness, as they say,
[01:38:55.340 --> 01:38:57.860]   or focusing on one's breathing and internal state
[01:38:57.860 --> 01:39:00.340]   for sake of then accessing information
[01:39:00.340 --> 01:39:02.320]   in the external world,
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:06.480]   a really nice study called Interoceptive Awareness
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:08.560]   in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:11.120]   explored whether or not interoceptive awareness
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:16.120]   was different in people with ADHD or did not have ADHD.
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:20.160]   And the findings were essentially that there's no difference,
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:22.400]   that people with ADHD, children and adults,
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:25.320]   they are aware of what's going on inside them
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:27.520]   just as much as anyone else is.
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:29.840]   And the typical measure of interoceptive awareness
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:33.120]   is one's ability to count their own heartbeats.
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:36.000]   This is actually challenging for some individuals
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.840]   and very easy for other individuals,
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:39.620]   regardless of their attentional capacity.
[01:39:39.620 --> 01:39:41.820]   Some people just can really feel their heartbeat
[01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:44.980]   without taking their pulse, other people cannot.
[01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:47.360]   And these studies are pretty straightforward to do.
[01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:50.780]   You ask people to sit there and to count their heartbeats
[01:39:50.780 --> 01:39:52.660]   and then you are monitoring their heartbeats
[01:39:52.660 --> 01:39:55.100]   and you get to gauge how accurate they are.
[01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:58.940]   So it's important to understand that people with ADHD
[01:39:58.940 --> 01:40:01.520]   are in touch with how they feel.
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:03.640]   It's really a question of whether or not
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:06.720]   they can take the demands that are placed upon them
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:09.380]   and enter a cognitive state, a mental state
[01:40:09.380 --> 01:40:11.180]   that allows them to access the information
[01:40:11.180 --> 01:40:12.020]   they need to access.
[01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:13.260]   In other words, whether or not they can focus.
[01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:16.280]   But it is absolutely wrong to think that the child
[01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:20.060]   that's getting up 11 times during a short six-minute
[01:40:20.060 --> 01:40:23.920]   interaction at the table or whether or not a child
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:26.240]   who somehow has to venture off every moment
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:28.260]   or a coworker of yours who's an adult
[01:40:28.260 --> 01:40:30.200]   who's constantly fidgeting or moving things around
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:32.360]   that somehow they are unaware that they are oblivious.
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:34.200]   They're not oblivious to how they feel.
[01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:36.480]   Chances are they are very challenged in the situations
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:38.480]   that they're in and they're doing everything they can
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:40.380]   to try and regulate their attention.
[01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:42.800]   So I think it's an important study to highlight
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:45.480]   because it really underscores the fact that something else
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:48.280]   is going on and that something else has everything to do
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:51.440]   with this ability to coordinate these task-directed networks
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:53.880]   and to coordinate that in the proper way
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:55.800]   with that default mode network.
[01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:58.080]   And that is a process, as you now know,
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:02.480]   that's regulated exquisitely by certain neurochemicals
[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:04.700]   and in particular, the neurochemicals dopamine,
[01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:07.080]   norepinephrine, and serotonin.
[01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:09.000]   And a fourth one I'd like to throw into the mix,
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.360]   which is acetylcholine,
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:12.960]   which is very vital for cognitive focus.
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:15.360]   So now I want to switch back to talking about
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:17.520]   some of the drugs that are typically used
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:19.760]   to access those systems, prescription drugs.
[01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:21.480]   And I want to talk about some of the new
[01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:23.880]   and emerging non-prescription approaches
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:25.920]   to increasing the levels of dopamine,
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:28.100]   acetylcholine, and serotonin in the brain
[01:41:28.100 --> 01:41:30.200]   using various supplement type compounds
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:32.700]   because several of them are showing
[01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:34.720]   really remarkable efficacy
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:36.680]   in excellent peer-reviewed studies.
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:39.720]   So before moving to some of the newer atypical compounds
[01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:41.840]   and things sold over the counter,
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:46.260]   I'd like to just briefly return to the classic drugs
[01:41:46.260 --> 01:41:48.320]   that are used to treat ADHD.
[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:51.560]   These are the ones I mentioned earlier,
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:56.360]   methylphenidate, also called Ritalin, modafinil,
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:42:00.420]   armodafinil is another one, and Adderall.
[01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:03.600]   Again, all of these work by increasing levels of dopamine
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:05.480]   and norepinephrine.
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:08.800]   Typically they are taken orally in pill form
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:11.600]   or sometimes in capsule form.
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:13.560]   The dosages that are appropriate
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:17.280]   vary according to severity of the condition
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:20.840]   for a given person and the age of the person.
[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:24.200]   This is a complicated landscape for each individual.
[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:25.720]   They have to figure out the pharmacology
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:26.960]   that's best for them.
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:30.320]   Some individuals are even layering long
[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:35.100]   or time to release Ritalin with Adderall in smaller doses.
[01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:36.320]   It can get quite complex
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:37.780]   or it can be quite straightforward.
[01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:40.180]   If you are really interested in these drugs
[01:42:40.180 --> 01:42:44.080]   and how they work, and you'd like to get a glance
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:47.700]   at a table of all the results from all the studies
[01:42:47.700 --> 01:42:49.800]   of which there are now hundreds,
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:52.740]   there's an excellent review about these drugs
[01:42:52.740 --> 01:42:55.520]   and their use and their comparison
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:57.220]   to similarly structured drugs,
[01:42:57.220 --> 01:43:01.480]   in particular MDMA and cocaine and amphetamine,
[01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:03.000]   meaning street amphetamine,
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.440]   to really illustrate the similarities of action
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:10.240]   and some of the problems associated with long-term use.
[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:11.840]   I don't expect you to read this article in full.
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:14.320]   I'm here so that you don't have to go read these articles,
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:17.060]   but in case you want a ton of information,
[01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:18.840]   the paper is Esposito et al.
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:20.720]   Frontiers in Biosciences.
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:23.160]   It's an excellent, excellent review
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:24.640]   of the entire literature.
[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:26.700]   It is quite long.
[01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:29.820]   I can put a link to that study in our caption.
[01:43:29.820 --> 01:43:33.080]   And it essentially describes all the studies
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:35.940]   that have been done, peer reviewed and published.
[01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:39.120]   And it refers to these drugs in an interesting way.
[01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:41.920]   It doesn't just refer these drugs as for treatment of ADHD.
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:44.220]   It actually refers to them using language
[01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:46.640]   that ordinarily I'm not very fond of,
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:50.020]   but I'll agree to here, which is so-called smart drugs
[01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:51.340]   or nootropics.
[01:43:51.340 --> 01:43:55.800]   It also covers caffeine, which again,
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:59.340]   as I mentioned earlier, increases dopamine, norepinephrine,
[01:43:59.340 --> 01:44:01.860]   and to some extent serotonin.
[01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:04.520]   But what I like about this review so much
[01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:07.000]   is that in putting these drugs of abuse,
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.200]   methamphetamine and cocaine,
[01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:11.360]   right alongside these drugs like Ritalin and Adderall
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:13.340]   and also caffeine, we start to realize
[01:44:13.340 --> 01:44:15.880]   that the distinction between drugs of abuse
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:18.000]   and the distinction between drugs of treatment
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:21.720]   is actually a very fine and sometimes even a blurry line.
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:23.960]   And in thinking about whether or not
[01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:26.600]   one wants to use these prescription,
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:28.420]   I want to emphasize prescription, not drugs of abuse,
[01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:29.480]   but prescription drugs
[01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:32.180]   for treatment of one's own attentional capacity,
[01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:35.260]   I think it is important to understand
[01:44:35.260 --> 01:44:37.100]   the extent to which they all carry
[01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:38.580]   more or less the same side effects.
[01:44:38.580 --> 01:44:40.000]   The one exception being caffeine.
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.840]   Caffeine side effects can be anxiety
[01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:44.680]   if you ingest too much of it, insomnia,
[01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:46.280]   if you drink it too late in the day,
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:48.280]   but typically it will not cause
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:50.880]   the major side effects of the other drugs,
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:54.420]   such as high propensity for addiction and abuse.
[01:44:54.420 --> 01:44:58.520]   Amphetamines of any kind, as well as cocaine,
[01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:00.640]   can cause sexual side effects
[01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:02.160]   because they're vasoconstrictors,
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:06.480]   so men have trouble achieving erection.
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:11.480]   There can often be the intense desire or libido for sex,
[01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:14.320]   but an inability to actually perform.
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:16.940]   So that's an issue with any kind of stimulant.
[01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:19.240]   So these drugs are not without their consequences.
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:24.000]   In addition, and here I'd lump caffeine back into the mix,
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:27.720]   in addition, they almost all carry cardiac effects, right?
[01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:28.840]   They increase heart rate,
[01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:32.800]   but they also have effects on constriction of blood vessels
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:34.520]   and arteries and veins and so forth
[01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:37.520]   in ways that can create cardiovascular problems.
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:40.500]   Now, caffeine is a bit of a complicated one.
[01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:42.600]   I talked about this on a podcast long ago,
[01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:44.900]   but I'll just remind you that it turns out
[01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:46.680]   that if you are caffeine adapted,
[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:49.260]   in other words, if you are used to drinking caffeine,
[01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:51.240]   then the ingestion of caffeine
[01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:53.240]   most often will cause vasodilation.
[01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:55.520]   It will actually allow more blood flow through.
[01:45:55.520 --> 01:45:57.680]   However, if you are not caffeine adapted,
[01:45:57.680 --> 01:45:59.560]   it will cause vasoconstriction
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:02.120]   due to an increased stress response.
[01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:04.180]   So if you're familiar with caffeine,
[01:46:04.180 --> 01:46:06.320]   caffeine can actually have a little bit more
[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:08.040]   of a relaxation response,
[01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:09.060]   although if you drink enough of it,
[01:46:09.060 --> 01:46:10.960]   it will make you amped up.
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:14.920]   These other drugs almost always lead to vasoconstriction,
[01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:17.320]   increased heart rate, dilation of the pupils,
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:19.860]   less blinking, heightened levels of attention,
[01:46:19.860 --> 01:46:22.000]   which looks very much like stress.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.260]   And at its extremes,
[01:46:23.260 --> 01:46:25.180]   looks very much like the effects of street drugs,
[01:46:25.180 --> 01:46:27.240]   like cocaine and amphetamine.
[01:46:27.240 --> 01:46:29.120]   Because of the large amounts of dopamine
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:30.580]   that are released in the brain,
[01:46:30.580 --> 01:46:33.320]   people tend to crave that state over and over,
[01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:36.240]   and yet with each subsequent use
[01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:39.360]   are able to get less and less of that euphoric feeling
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:41.300]   or that really, really focused feeling.
[01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:43.520]   So one thing that's being explored quite extensively now
[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:47.720]   in the treatment of ADHD are drug schedules,
[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:51.680]   whether or not people should take Adderall every day
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:52.760]   or every other day,
[01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:53.800]   whether or not they should take it
[01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:55.120]   only every once in a while,
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:57.720]   whether or not young children can take it just a few times
[01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:00.400]   and engage in behavioral training of the sort
[01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:02.940]   that I talked about before where they're doing,
[01:47:02.940 --> 01:47:05.960]   maybe it's a 17 minute meditation type exercise,
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:08.080]   but more likely it would be the movement
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:10.400]   followed by the visual focusing,
[01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:12.960]   'cause that's only done for 20 or 30 or 60 seconds.
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:13.820]   Why would you do that?
[01:47:13.820 --> 01:47:16.460]   Well, in a chemically enhanced state,
[01:47:16.460 --> 01:47:17.800]   your brain is more plastic.
[01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:21.700]   The circuits are able to modify and learn better.
[01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:25.800]   That's the optimal time to engage in focus
[01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:27.320]   in a very deliberate way.
[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:29.740]   So just taking a drug and expecting focus
[01:47:29.740 --> 01:47:31.080]   to just work at any point
[01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:35.040]   and being able to turn focus on and off at will,
[01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:37.960]   that's an unrealistic expectation, right?
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:42.960]   More likely the best use of things like Adderall,
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:46.740]   modafinil, armodafinil, and Ritalin
[01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:48.680]   is going to be to combine those treatments
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:52.660]   with behavioral exercises that actively engage
[01:47:52.660 --> 01:47:55.320]   the very circuits that you're trying to train up and enhance
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:57.980]   and then perhaps, I want to highlight perhaps,
[01:47:57.980 --> 01:47:59.360]   tapering off those drugs
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:01.540]   so that then one can use those circuits
[01:48:01.540 --> 01:48:04.440]   without any need for chemical intervention.
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:07.120]   So despite any controversy that might be out there,
[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:08.120]   I think it's fair to say
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:11.280]   that the consumption of omega-3 fatty acids
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:16.600]   can positively modulate the systems for attention and focus.
[01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:20.480]   So then the question becomes how much EPA,
[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:22.520]   how much DHA does that differ
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:25.760]   for what's helpful for depression, et cetera?
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:27.880]   And actually it does differ.
[01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:29.280]   In reviewing the studies for this,
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:34.280]   it appears that a threshold level of 300 milligrams of DHA
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:37.160]   turns out to be an important inflection point.
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:41.680]   So typically fish oils or other sources of omega-3s
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:43.920]   will have DHA and EPA.
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:45.820]   And typically it's the EPA
[01:48:45.820 --> 01:48:48.120]   that's harder to get at sufficient levels.
[01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:50.120]   Meaning you have to take quite a lot of fish oil
[01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:52.340]   in order to get above that 1000 milligram
[01:48:52.340 --> 01:48:55.700]   or 2000 milligram threshold to improve mood
[01:48:55.700 --> 01:48:56.640]   and other functions.
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:48:59.240]   But for sake of attention,
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:02.360]   there are 10 studies that have explored this in detail.
[01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:05.400]   And while the EPA component is important,
[01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:07.560]   the most convincing studies point to the fact
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:12.080]   that getting above 300 milligrams per day of DHA
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:14.240]   is really where you start to see the attentional effects.
[01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:16.440]   Now, fortunately, if you're getting sufficient EPA
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:19.360]   for sake of mood and other biological functions,
[01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:22.560]   almost without question,
[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:25.200]   you're getting 300 milligrams or more of DHA.
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:27.800]   So that usually checks that box just fine.
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:30.040]   What's interesting is that there's another compound,
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:35.040]   phosphatidylsterine that has been explored for its capacity
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:37.640]   to improve the symptoms of ADHD.
[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:39.700]   Again, I don't think this is any direct way,
[01:49:39.700 --> 01:49:41.840]   but rather in a modulatory way.
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:46.160]   But it appears that phosphatidylsterine taken for two months
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:49.640]   for 200 milligrams per day
[01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:52.920]   was able to reduce the symptoms of ADHD in children.
[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:55.400]   It has not been looked at in adults yet,
[01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:57.240]   at least as far as I know,
[01:49:57.240 --> 01:50:00.560]   but that this effect was greatly enhanced
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:03.520]   by the consumption of omega-3 fatty acids.
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:05.680]   So now we're starting to see synergistic effects
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:08.900]   of omega-3 fatty acids and phosphatidylsterine.
[01:50:08.900 --> 01:50:11.180]   Again, that was 200 milligrams per day.
[01:50:11.180 --> 01:50:12.800]   This is something that sold over the counter
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:15.200]   in capsule form, at least in the US.
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:18.440]   There were two studies, both were double blind studies
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:21.080]   carried out for anywhere from one to six months
[01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:22.700]   on both boys and girls.
[01:50:22.700 --> 01:50:24.760]   And it really was boys and girls, not men and women.
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:28.820]   This was kids age one to six or seven to 12.
[01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:32.120]   And it was a fairly large number of subjects.
[01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:35.520]   So 147 subjects in one case and 36 in the other.
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:39.240]   The takeaway is that getting sufficient levels of EPAs,
[01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:42.760]   in particular this 300 milligram threshold of DHA,
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:46.720]   plus if you are interested in it and it's right for you,
[01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:48.920]   200 milligrams of phosphatidylsterine
[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:50.400]   can be an important augment
[01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:53.480]   for improving the symptoms of ADHD.
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:55.360]   You'll also find literature out there
[01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:59.240]   and many claims about so-called ginkgo bilboa,
[01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:01.780]   which has been shown to have minor effects
[01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:04.500]   in improving the symptoms of ADHD.
[01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:07.860]   Not nearly as effective as Ritalin and Adderall.
[01:51:07.860 --> 01:51:12.440]   Ginkgo bilboa is not appropriate for many people.
[01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:14.120]   I am one such person.
[01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:18.140]   I don't have ADHD, but when I've taken ginkgo,
[01:51:18.140 --> 01:51:19.280]   even at very low doses,
[01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:21.640]   I get absolutely splitting headaches.
[01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:23.400]   Some people do not experience those headaches,
[01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:26.400]   but it's known to have very potent vasoconstrictive
[01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:29.200]   and vasodilating properties that vary
[01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:31.960]   depending on when you took the compound.
[01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:35.760]   So for those of you that are exploring ginkgo bilboa,
[01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:38.040]   and you will see a lot of claims about ginkgo bilboa
[01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:39.560]   for attention in ADHD,
[01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:42.980]   definitely take the vasodilation, vasoconstriction,
[01:51:42.980 --> 01:51:45.980]   headache issue into consideration.
[01:51:45.980 --> 01:51:48.400]   So I'd like to talk about the drug modafinil
[01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:50.920]   and the closely related drug armodafinil,
[01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:55.480]   and that's AR modafinil because modafinil and armodafinil
[01:51:55.480 --> 01:51:57.320]   are gaining popularity out there,
[01:51:57.320 --> 01:52:00.260]   both for treatment of ADHD and narcolepsy,
[01:52:00.260 --> 01:52:03.760]   but also for communities of people
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:05.920]   that are trying to stay awake long periods of time.
[01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:09.980]   So it's actively used in the military by first responders.
[01:52:09.980 --> 01:52:13.100]   It's gaining popularity on college campuses,
[01:52:13.100 --> 01:52:15.440]   and people are using it more and more as an alternative
[01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:20.440]   to Adderall and Ritalin and excessive amounts of coffee.
[01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:23.640]   It does increase focus, and to a dramatic extent.
[01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:28.200]   Modafinil typically was very expensive.
[01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:30.080]   I don't know if it's still this expensive,
[01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:32.680]   but when one has a prescription for it,
[01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:35.560]   it could still cost as much as eight or $900
[01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:37.920]   or even a thousand dollars a month.
[01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:41.940]   R-modafinil is a far less expensive version
[01:52:41.940 --> 01:52:44.900]   that's chemically slightly different than modafinil.
[01:52:44.900 --> 01:52:45.840]   Regardless of price,
[01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:48.920]   people are taking modafinil and R-modafinil.
[01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:52.520]   Want to emphasize that unlike Ritalin and Adderall,
[01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:54.720]   modafinil and R-modafinil
[01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:57.720]   are weak dopamine reuptake inhibitors,
[01:52:57.720 --> 01:53:00.100]   and that's how they lead to increases in dopamine.
[01:53:00.100 --> 01:53:03.040]   So whereas Ritalin and Adderall, amphetamine and cocaine
[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:05.320]   lead to big increases in dopamine,
[01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:07.880]   also through reuptake mechanisms and so forth,
[01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:12.800]   modafinil is a weaker dopamine reuptake stimulator.
[01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:15.800]   And so what that means is that it leaves more dopamine
[01:53:15.800 --> 01:53:17.720]   around to be active at the synapse,
[01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:19.880]   the gaps between neurons.
[01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:22.040]   However, it also activates other systems.
[01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:24.240]   It acts on the orexin system,
[01:53:24.240 --> 01:53:26.380]   which is actually a peptide that we talked about
[01:53:26.380 --> 01:53:28.400]   in the episode on hunger,
[01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:31.100]   because it regulates hunger and appetite,
[01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:34.280]   and it regulates sleepiness and feelings of sleepiness.
[01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:37.700]   In fact, the orexin, also called hypocretin system,
[01:53:37.700 --> 01:53:39.320]   the orexin hypocretin system
[01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:42.040]   is what's disrupted in narcolepsy.
[01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:44.400]   That was the important discovery of my colleagues,
[01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:46.600]   Emmanuel Mignon and Seiji Nishino
[01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:48.320]   at Stanford some years ago,
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:50.960]   they identified the biological basis of narcolepsy,
[01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:54.800]   and it's a disruption in the orexin hypocretin system,
[01:53:54.800 --> 01:53:56.960]   and modafinil is one of the primary treatments
[01:53:56.960 --> 01:53:58.120]   for narcolepsy.
[01:53:58.120 --> 01:54:01.600]   It also has these other effects on the dopamine system
[01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:03.900]   and on the norepinephrine system.
[01:54:03.900 --> 01:54:08.480]   Even though it doesn't lead to quite as intense levels
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:11.360]   of dopamine and arousal and focus,
[01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:12.600]   it does have the property
[01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:14.840]   of raising levels of attention and focus,
[01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:16.160]   and that's why people are using it.
[01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:19.400]   So it's a somewhat milder form of Adderall.
[01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:23.120]   R-modafinil, for some people, works as well as modafinil,
[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:24.760]   and as I mentioned before, it's much lower cost.
[01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:26.240]   For other people, it doesn't.
[01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:30.280]   I have an experience, meaning I do have an experience
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:32.500]   that I'll share with you with R-modafinil.
[01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:34.560]   A few years ago, I was suffering from jet lag
[01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:38.860]   really terribly, and I was traveling overseas.
[01:54:38.860 --> 01:54:40.780]   I went to a meeting to give a talk.
[01:54:40.780 --> 01:54:45.740]   I took half of the prescribed dose of R-modafinil.
[01:54:45.740 --> 01:54:47.680]   It was prescribed to me.
[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:51.220]   I took that half dose, and I gave my lecture,
[01:54:51.220 --> 01:54:53.120]   and then I stayed around to answer questions,
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:57.160]   and then four hours later, a friend of mine came up to me
[01:54:57.160 --> 01:54:59.080]   and said, "You know, you've been talking
[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:01.040]   for four and a half hours,
[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:03.580]   and there are only a few people still here."
[01:55:03.580 --> 01:55:04.920]   Luckily, there were still a few people.
[01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:07.680]   It'd be a lot weirder if the room was completely empty
[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:09.420]   since it wasn't being recorded.
[01:55:09.420 --> 01:55:10.940]   So I have firsthand knowledge
[01:55:10.940 --> 01:55:13.980]   of the sorts of cognitive effects that it can create.
[01:55:13.980 --> 01:55:16.460]   I personally would not want to be in that state
[01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:18.120]   for sake of studying or learning
[01:55:18.120 --> 01:55:21.280]   or for doing this podcast, for instance,
[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:24.400]   and I can honestly say that today all I've ingested
[01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:28.140]   is some coffee and some yerba mate tea and some water.
[01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:30.440]   I'm not on any of the compounds that I've described
[01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:32.780]   during the course of today's episode.
[01:55:32.780 --> 01:55:36.060]   You might ask why I took half the recommended dose
[01:55:36.060 --> 01:55:39.720]   of R-modafinil, and the reason is that I'm somebody
[01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:44.500]   who's fairly hypersensitive to medication of any kind.
[01:55:44.500 --> 01:55:46.800]   What you find if you look in the literature
[01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:48.580]   is that about 5% of people
[01:55:48.580 --> 01:55:50.800]   are hyper hypersensitive to medication.
[01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:53.880]   They require far lower doses of any medication
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:56.560]   than other people in order to experience the same effects.
[01:55:56.560 --> 01:56:00.120]   I'm somebody that I think is sort of modest hyper,
[01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:02.120]   if that sort of oxymoronic statement,
[01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:05.340]   but a modest hypersensitivity to medication,
[01:56:05.340 --> 01:56:07.160]   so I've almost always been able to get by
[01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:09.800]   on taking less of whatever was prescribed for me
[01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:11.880]   and feel just fine,
[01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:13.960]   or in this case to feel like it was still too much.
[01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:17.160]   It turned out that the right dose of R-modafinil for me
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:19.080]   was zero milligrams.
[01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:21.000]   Now you may notice that I haven't talked much
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:22.760]   about acetylcholine.
[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:24.920]   Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter
[01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:26.960]   that at the neuron to muscle connections,
[01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:28.840]   the so-called neuromuscular junctions,
[01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:30.840]   is involved in generating muscular contractions
[01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:32.800]   of all kinds for all movements.
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:37.160]   Acetylcholine is also released from two sites in the brain,
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:38.520]   so a little bit of nomenclature here.
[01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:41.040]   Again, feel free to ignore the nomenclature,
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:43.680]   but there is a collection of neurons in your brain stem
[01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:45.080]   that send projections forward,
[01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:48.400]   kind of like a sprinkler system that's very diffuse
[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:50.040]   to release acetylcholine,
[01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:53.640]   and those neurons reside in an area or a structure
[01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:57.240]   that's called the pedunculopontine nucleus, the PPN.
[01:56:57.240 --> 01:56:59.340]   And then there's a separate collection of neurons
[01:56:59.340 --> 01:57:01.040]   in the basal forebrain
[01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:04.040]   called unimaginatively nucleus basalis,
[01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:05.700]   the nucleus at the base.
[01:57:05.700 --> 01:57:09.260]   And they also hose the brain with acetylcholine,
[01:57:09.260 --> 01:57:11.800]   but in a much more specific way.
[01:57:11.800 --> 01:57:13.720]   So one is sort of like a sprinkler system,
[01:57:13.720 --> 01:57:15.400]   and the other one is more like a fire hose
[01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:16.480]   to a particular location.
[01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:21.000]   And those two sources of acetylcholine collaborate
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.760]   to activate particular locations in the brain
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:26.500]   and really bring about a tremendous degree of focus
[01:57:26.500 --> 01:57:29.700]   to whatever is happening at those particular synapses.
[01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:31.980]   So it could be a focus on visual information
[01:57:31.980 --> 01:57:33.180]   or auditory information.
[01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:35.980]   If you're listening closely to what I'm saying right now,
[01:57:35.980 --> 01:57:39.380]   you just heard closely step out from the rest of my sentence,
[01:57:39.380 --> 01:57:42.560]   no doubt there was acetylcholine released at the sites
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:45.020]   in your brain where the neurons that represent
[01:57:45.020 --> 01:57:49.240]   your recognition of the word closely occurred, okay?
[01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:51.340]   So now you have an example and you have an understanding
[01:57:51.340 --> 01:57:52.500]   and hopefully a picture in your mind
[01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:54.560]   of how all this is working.
[01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:56.020]   Not surprisingly then,
[01:57:56.020 --> 01:58:00.260]   drugs that increase cholinergic or acetylcholine transmission
[01:58:00.260 --> 01:58:03.340]   will increase focus and cognition.
[01:58:03.340 --> 01:58:06.380]   One such compound is so-called alpha-GPC,
[01:58:06.380 --> 01:58:08.320]   which is a form of choline
[01:58:08.320 --> 01:58:11.020]   and increases acetylcholine transmission.
[01:58:11.020 --> 01:58:14.620]   Dosages as high as 1200 milligrams per day,
[01:58:14.620 --> 01:58:16.500]   which is a very high dosage spread out,
[01:58:16.500 --> 01:58:19.560]   typically it's 300 or 400 milligrams spread out
[01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:21.220]   throughout the day,
[01:58:21.220 --> 01:58:24.560]   have been shown to offset some of the effects
[01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:26.240]   of age-related cognitive decline,
[01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:27.460]   improve cognitive functioning,
[01:58:27.460 --> 01:58:29.560]   people that don't have age-related cognitive decline,
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:30.940]   that's a very high dose.
[01:58:30.940 --> 01:58:34.700]   Typically when people are using alpha-GPC to study
[01:58:34.700 --> 01:58:36.900]   or to enhance learning of any kind,
[01:58:36.900 --> 01:58:39.960]   they will take somewhere between 300 and 600 milligrams,
[01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:41.660]   that's more typical.
[01:58:41.660 --> 01:58:43.620]   Again, you have to check with your doctor,
[01:58:43.620 --> 01:58:45.380]   you have to decide if the safety margins
[01:58:45.380 --> 01:58:47.060]   are appropriate for you.
[01:58:47.060 --> 01:58:49.520]   Obviously you'll want to check that out,
[01:58:49.520 --> 01:58:53.180]   but alpha-GPC is effective in creating more focus
[01:58:53.180 --> 01:58:54.880]   by way of this cholinergic system,
[01:58:54.880 --> 01:58:56.740]   it stimulates acetylcholine release
[01:58:56.740 --> 01:58:58.900]   from both of those locations,
[01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:00.760]   the PPN in the back of the brain
[01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:03.420]   and nucleus basalis in the front of the brain.
[01:59:03.420 --> 01:59:07.440]   There are two other over-the-counter compounds
[01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:11.520]   that are in active use out there for treatment of ADHD
[01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:15.820]   and in use for simply trying to improve focus.
[01:59:15.820 --> 01:59:17.640]   And the first one is L-tyrosine,
[01:59:17.640 --> 01:59:20.240]   it's an amino acid that acts as a precursor
[01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:22.340]   to the neuromodulator dopamine.
[01:59:22.340 --> 01:59:23.460]   And now knowing everything you know
[01:59:23.460 --> 01:59:25.780]   about dopamine attention and the circuits involved,
[01:59:25.780 --> 01:59:26.860]   it should come as no surprise
[01:59:26.860 --> 01:59:29.940]   as to why people are exploring the use of L-tyrosine
[01:59:29.940 --> 01:59:31.300]   for that purpose.
[01:59:31.300 --> 01:59:34.640]   L-tyrosine does lead to increases in dopamine,
[01:59:34.640 --> 01:59:37.260]   they are fairly long-lived
[01:59:37.260 --> 01:59:41.340]   and L-tyrosine can improve one's ability to focus,
[01:59:41.340 --> 01:59:46.060]   however, the dosaging can be very tricky to dial in,
[01:59:46.060 --> 01:59:48.700]   sometimes it makes people feel too euphoric
[01:59:48.700 --> 01:59:50.500]   or too jittery or too alert
[01:59:50.500 --> 01:59:53.220]   that they are then unable to focus well.
[01:59:53.220 --> 01:59:56.280]   So the dosage ranges are huge,
[01:59:56.280 --> 01:59:58.600]   you see evidence for 100 milligrams
[01:59:58.600 --> 02:00:00.860]   all the way up to 1200 milligrams,
[02:00:00.860 --> 02:00:02.180]   it's something that really should be approached
[02:00:02.180 --> 02:00:04.140]   with caution, especially for people
[02:00:04.140 --> 02:00:06.380]   that have any kind of underlying psychiatric
[02:00:06.380 --> 02:00:07.540]   or mood disorder,
[02:00:07.540 --> 02:00:10.100]   because dysregulation of the dopamine system
[02:00:10.100 --> 02:00:13.980]   is central to many of the mood disorders
[02:00:13.980 --> 02:00:17.520]   such as depression, but also especially mania,
[02:00:17.520 --> 02:00:21.000]   mania bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, things of that sort,
[02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:22.640]   so it's something that really should be approached
[02:00:22.640 --> 02:00:25.920]   with caution, nonetheless, in exploring what's out there
[02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:30.480]   and even some studies online that were done,
[02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:32.520]   either animal studies or human studies,
[02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:35.560]   it's clear that L-tyrosine is being explored
[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:39.380]   for that purpose, as is PEA and phenylethylamine,
[02:00:39.380 --> 02:00:43.880]   which is essentially PEA, but some related compounds,
[02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:46.680]   so there's a whole class of dopaminergic
[02:00:46.680 --> 02:00:48.760]   or dopamine stimulating supplements
[02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:49.700]   that people are using to try
[02:00:49.700 --> 02:00:50.980]   and get their dopamine levels up,
[02:00:50.980 --> 02:00:53.700]   and again, it's kind of a fine line
[02:00:53.700 --> 02:00:57.380]   between too little, enough, and too much.
[02:00:57.380 --> 02:01:00.840]   If you want to get the literature on those two compounds,
[02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:05.840]   there I will refer you to this great website, examine.com,
[02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:09.740]   just as it sounds, and you can put in L-tyrosine or PEA,
[02:01:09.740 --> 02:01:11.020]   and you can get the details on that,
[02:01:11.020 --> 02:01:14.640]   but I highly recommend also going to their section on ADHD
[02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:17.760]   to see how those particular compounds relate specifically
[02:01:17.760 --> 02:01:20.920]   to ADHD and cognitive focus.
[02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:22.520]   And last but not least,
[02:01:22.520 --> 02:01:24.240]   in terms of these different compounds,
[02:01:24.240 --> 02:01:26.860]   I do want to mention the racetams.
[02:01:26.860 --> 02:01:30.420]   These are somewhat esoteric,
[02:01:30.420 --> 02:01:32.600]   and probably most of you haven't heard about them,
[02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:35.320]   but some of you probably know a lot about them,
[02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:36.760]   and they are becoming more popular.
[02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:40.600]   They go by names like Nupept and things of that sort.
[02:01:40.600 --> 02:01:43.760]   The racetams are illegal in certain countries.
[02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:45.660]   They are gray market in other countries,
[02:01:45.660 --> 02:01:47.800]   and they are sold over the counter
[02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:50.480]   in this country, in the US.
[02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:54.280]   So they have different margins for safety.
[02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:56.560]   You definitely need to consult your doctor,
[02:01:56.560 --> 02:01:58.620]   especially if you have ADHD,
[02:01:58.620 --> 02:02:03.040]   but Nupept has been shown when taken at 10 milligrams
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:05.960]   twice daily can be more effective
[02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:07.800]   than some of the other racetams.
[02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:08.640]   What is Nupept?
[02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:10.960]   Nupept taps into the cholinergic system,
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:12.000]   the acetylcholine system,
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.720]   in ways very similar to alpha-GPC,
[02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:17.340]   but seems to have a slightly higher affinity
[02:02:17.340 --> 02:02:19.320]   for some of the receptors involved
[02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:21.140]   and can lead to those heightened states
[02:02:21.140 --> 02:02:23.080]   of cognitive capacity.
[02:02:23.080 --> 02:02:26.440]   And there are these studies, one in particular,
[02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:28.520]   comparative studies of Nupept and paracetam
[02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:31.800]   in the treatment of patients with mild cognitive disorders
[02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:34.300]   and brain diseases of vascular and traumatic origin.
[02:02:34.300 --> 02:02:35.140]   That's a mouthful.
[02:02:35.140 --> 02:02:37.500]   What this study basically points to
[02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:39.440]   is the fact that people who are experiencing
[02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:42.200]   some degree of inability to focus
[02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:45.540]   due to prior concussion or some vascular event,
[02:02:45.540 --> 02:02:47.800]   a stroke or ischemia of any kind,
[02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:49.080]   because neurons need blood,
[02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:50.920]   when the blood supply is cut off to neurons
[02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:52.760]   or when there's a bleed in the brain,
[02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:53.760]   subsequent to that,
[02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:56.720]   often there are challenges in maintaining focus.
[02:02:56.720 --> 02:02:59.080]   This is very common for people that have done sports
[02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:00.620]   where there's a lot of running into each other
[02:03:00.620 --> 02:03:04.320]   with your head, like rugby, football, hockey, and so forth,
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:06.100]   but also people who have experienced head blows
[02:03:06.100 --> 02:03:08.120]   or often overlooked is the fact
[02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:10.040]   that most traumatic head injury
[02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:11.960]   is not actually from sports, even football,
[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:14.080]   it's from things like construction work,
[02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:16.600]   from high impact work of that kind.
[02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:18.520]   So there does seem to be some efficacy
[02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:21.720]   of Nupept and paracetam and things like it.
[02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:24.140]   It's an emerging area.
[02:03:24.140 --> 02:03:25.480]   And as I mentioned in the US,
[02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:27.320]   these things are sold over the counter.
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:29.600]   Again, you have to figure out if it's right for you,
[02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:32.860]   but they are beginning to show some promise.
[02:03:32.860 --> 02:03:35.640]   And I'm intrigued by them because of the way
[02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:37.660]   that they tap into the cholinergic system,
[02:03:37.660 --> 02:03:40.600]   which is both directly involved in focus
[02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:42.400]   and the ability to focus,
[02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:45.380]   but is also important for things
[02:03:45.380 --> 02:03:47.640]   related to age-related cognitive decline.
[02:03:47.640 --> 02:03:51.280]   So a decline in cholinergic transmission or acetylcholine,
[02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:53.120]   as we call it in the brain,
[02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:55.540]   is one of the things associated with cognitive decline.
[02:03:55.540 --> 02:03:58.360]   And it does seem that increasing cholinergic transmission
[02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:00.360]   can offset some of that cognitive decline
[02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:03.240]   and perhaps even more so in conditions
[02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:06.280]   such as vascular damage or concussion to the brain.
[02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:09.520]   If you're interested in atypical treatments for ADHD,
[02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:13.280]   compounds to improve focus and related themes,
[02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:14.920]   and you like reading about this stuff,
[02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:17.960]   there's an excellent review article that I can refer you to.
[02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:20.880]   It's by Ann et al, AHN.
[02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:22.560]   It was published in 2016.
[02:04:22.560 --> 02:04:24.240]   So it's a little bit behind the times,
[02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:27.680]   although it's surprisingly comprehensive given that,
[02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:32.500]   which lines up all the various drugs that I've discussed,
[02:04:32.500 --> 02:04:36.520]   racetams and Adderall and Ritalin and various forms
[02:04:36.520 --> 02:04:39.380]   of dopaminergic agents and cholinergic agents,
[02:04:39.380 --> 02:04:41.280]   spells out whether or not they are sold
[02:04:41.280 --> 02:04:43.320]   over the counter by prescription,
[02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:45.180]   and really lines them up in all their effects,
[02:04:45.180 --> 02:04:48.100]   their drawbacks, et cetera.
[02:04:48.100 --> 02:04:49.360]   I'll refer you to that study.
[02:04:49.360 --> 02:04:52.280]   It's available in its full length form online for free.
[02:04:52.280 --> 02:04:58.280]   It's on et al, the journal is Neuroplasticity 2016.
[02:04:58.280 --> 02:05:01.360]   Should be very easy to find if you put those keywords in.
[02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:04.360]   And while it is a review, it is a very comprehensive review.
[02:05:04.360 --> 02:05:06.080]   And if you're really into this stuff
[02:05:06.080 --> 02:05:07.980]   and you also want to learn a thing or two
[02:05:07.980 --> 02:05:11.440]   about how these things interact with neurofeedback, et cetera,
[02:05:11.440 --> 02:05:13.440]   there's some information in there as well.
[02:05:13.440 --> 02:05:15.540]   I know I've already covered a lot of information,
[02:05:15.540 --> 02:05:18.480]   but there is one more category of technology
[02:05:18.480 --> 02:05:22.520]   for the treatment of ADHD and for enhancement of focus
[02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:25.880]   in anyone that I would like to emphasize,
[02:05:25.880 --> 02:05:28.880]   and that's transcranial magnetic stimulation.
[02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:31.940]   Transcranial magnetic stimulation, also called TMS,
[02:05:31.940 --> 02:05:34.560]   is achieving increasing popularity nowadays
[02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:38.360]   for the treatment of all sorts of neurologic conditions
[02:05:38.360 --> 02:05:40.160]   and psychiatric conditions.
[02:05:40.160 --> 02:05:41.800]   It is a non-invasive tool.
[02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:45.480]   It involves taking a coil, it's a device with a coil
[02:05:45.480 --> 02:05:48.920]   that's placed over particular locations in the brain,
[02:05:48.920 --> 02:05:53.320]   and then sends magnetic stimulation into the brain.
[02:05:53.320 --> 02:05:54.520]   It can actually pass through the skull
[02:05:54.520 --> 02:05:56.520]   without having to drill through the skull.
[02:05:56.520 --> 02:05:59.800]   And nowadays can be used to both lower
[02:05:59.800 --> 02:06:02.520]   the amount of activity or increase the amount of activity
[02:06:02.520 --> 02:06:04.720]   in specific brain areas.
[02:06:04.720 --> 02:06:09.720]   Its spatial precision is not remarkable.
[02:06:09.720 --> 02:06:11.160]   That doesn't mean it's not of use,
[02:06:11.160 --> 02:06:16.160]   but it is not a super fine-grain tool, okay?
[02:06:16.160 --> 02:06:19.440]   It's not a cannon, but it's also not a needle.
[02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:21.160]   It is somewhere in between.
[02:06:21.160 --> 02:06:23.800]   It can direct the activity of particular brain regions
[02:06:23.800 --> 02:06:25.560]   at particular depths.
[02:06:25.560 --> 02:06:27.160]   And as I mentioned, it can increase
[02:06:27.160 --> 02:06:28.400]   or decrease that activity.
[02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:31.120]   So for instance, I've had a TMS coil placed on my head,
[02:06:31.120 --> 02:06:33.320]   not for therapeutic purposes.
[02:06:33.320 --> 02:06:36.600]   Even it was, I wouldn't tell you, but rather just for,
[02:06:36.600 --> 02:06:38.960]   well, I'm a neuroscientist and I worked in a lab with one
[02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:41.240]   for entertainment, exploratory purposes.
[02:06:41.240 --> 02:06:42.640]   Please don't do this at home.
[02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:46.720]   It was placed over my motor cortex,
[02:06:46.720 --> 02:06:49.200]   which generates voluntary action.
[02:06:49.200 --> 02:06:52.200]   And it was a coil that at that time
[02:06:52.200 --> 02:06:54.100]   could only inhibit neurons.
[02:06:54.100 --> 02:06:56.900]   And so what I was doing is I was moving objects around
[02:06:56.900 --> 02:06:58.440]   on a table, just like I am now.
[02:06:58.440 --> 02:07:00.280]   It was actually a pencil, not a pen.
[02:07:00.280 --> 02:07:01.940]   And I was tapping the pencil
[02:07:01.940 --> 02:07:04.440]   and then the TMS coil was turned on.
[02:07:04.440 --> 02:07:08.520]   And for the life of me, I could not move that pencil, okay?
[02:07:08.520 --> 02:07:11.480]   Because it was inhibiting my upper motor neurons
[02:07:11.480 --> 02:07:12.920]   in the portion of my cortex
[02:07:12.920 --> 02:07:15.560]   that controls voluntary activity.
[02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:16.920]   As soon as the coil was turned off,
[02:07:16.920 --> 02:07:19.900]   I could return to tapping the pencil again.
[02:07:19.900 --> 02:07:23.120]   Nowadays, it's possible to stimulate motor cortex
[02:07:23.120 --> 02:07:26.140]   or any area of the brain with some degree of precision
[02:07:26.140 --> 02:07:29.500]   that could create the impulse to move
[02:07:29.500 --> 02:07:31.640]   without actually making the decision to move.
[02:07:31.640 --> 02:07:34.760]   So you can literally engage certain neural circuits
[02:07:34.760 --> 02:07:36.820]   and therefore behaviors and certain thought
[02:07:36.820 --> 02:07:37.940]   and emotional patterns
[02:07:37.940 --> 02:07:40.700]   by way of transcranial magnetic stimulation.
[02:07:40.700 --> 02:07:43.800]   This has far reaching and vast implications
[02:07:43.800 --> 02:07:46.080]   as you can probably imagine.
[02:07:46.080 --> 02:07:50.720]   In discussing ADHD with a colleague that uses TMS,
[02:07:50.720 --> 02:07:55.360]   what they are doing is they are taking the TMS coil
[02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:59.240]   to children and adults that have ADHD
[02:07:59.240 --> 02:08:01.920]   and they're using it to stimulate the portions
[02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:04.720]   of the prefrontal cortex that we talked about earlier
[02:08:04.720 --> 02:08:08.560]   that engage task-directed focused states.
[02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:11.440]   So rather than using a drug that generally increases dopamine
[02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:13.080]   and some of the other chemicals involved,
[02:08:13.080 --> 02:08:17.280]   they're using directed TMS stimulation of these circuits.
[02:08:17.280 --> 02:08:20.440]   And fortunately, I was quite relieved to hear this,
[02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:24.040]   they are combining that with a focused learning task.
[02:08:24.040 --> 02:08:25.900]   So they're literally teaching the brain to learn
[02:08:25.900 --> 02:08:28.780]   in a non-invasive way, no drug at all.
[02:08:28.780 --> 02:08:30.880]   And right now there are experiments,
[02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:34.080]   clinical trials going on comparing TMS of this sort
[02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:37.520]   to the drug treatments of the sort that we described earlier
[02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:40.120]   that engage these circuits through pharmacologic mechanisms.
[02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:43.040]   So very exciting times for TMS,
[02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:48.040]   very exciting times for pharmacology related to ADHD
[02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:49.720]   and for enhancing focus in general.
[02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:52.180]   And when I say very exciting times, I mean,
[02:08:52.180 --> 02:08:56.680]   no drug is perfect, but the constellation of drugs
[02:08:56.680 --> 02:08:58.880]   that's out there is getting much larger,
[02:08:58.880 --> 02:09:01.280]   but because they tap into different aspects
[02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:04.020]   of their circuitry, I do think that we are well on our way
[02:09:04.020 --> 02:09:06.800]   to identifying the ideal combinations of drug treatments,
[02:09:06.800 --> 02:09:09.800]   technological treatments and behavioral paradigms
[02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:14.080]   for increasing focus in both children and adults with ADHD.
[02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:16.620]   And as a final, final point,
[02:09:16.620 --> 02:09:18.940]   I also want to mention something about technologies
[02:09:18.940 --> 02:09:22.100]   that are making it harder for all of us to focus,
[02:09:22.100 --> 02:09:26.060]   regardless of whether or not we have preexisting ADHD or not.
[02:09:26.060 --> 02:09:28.760]   You can probably guess where this is going.
[02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:31.160]   Everybody nowadays seems to have a smartphone.
[02:09:31.160 --> 02:09:33.200]   I'm sure there are a few individuals out there
[02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:35.500]   that don't have a smartphone.
[02:09:35.500 --> 02:09:37.120]   Nonetheless, most people have them.
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:40.040]   Most kids want one as soon as they can get them
[02:09:40.040 --> 02:09:43.520]   and they are small.
[02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:45.880]   They grab our attention entirely,
[02:09:45.880 --> 02:09:48.520]   but within that small box of attention,
[02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:53.120]   there are millions of attentional windows scrolling by.
[02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:55.140]   So just because it's one device that we look at
[02:09:55.140 --> 02:09:56.760]   does not mean that we are focused.
[02:09:56.760 --> 02:09:58.600]   We are focused on our phone,
[02:09:58.600 --> 02:10:02.240]   but because of the way in which context switches up so fast
[02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:05.280]   within the phone, it's thought that the brain
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:09.500]   is struggling now to leave that rapid turnover of context.
[02:10:09.500 --> 02:10:12.160]   Many, many shows, many, many Instagram pages,
[02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:14.200]   many, many Twitter feeds, many, many websites,
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:17.880]   basically the whole world, at least in virtual format,
[02:10:17.880 --> 02:10:20.120]   is available within that small box.
[02:10:20.120 --> 02:10:21.840]   Unlike any other technology humans
[02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:23.080]   have ever dealt with before,
[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:25.340]   even though there are trillions,
[02:10:25.340 --> 02:10:27.120]   infinite number of bits of information
[02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:29.240]   in the actual physical world,
[02:10:29.240 --> 02:10:32.700]   your attentional window, that aperture of constriction
[02:10:32.700 --> 02:10:34.860]   and dilating that visual window
[02:10:34.860 --> 02:10:36.080]   is the way in which you cope
[02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:39.120]   with all that overwhelming information typically.
[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:40.600]   Well, within the phone,
[02:10:40.600 --> 02:10:43.980]   your visual aperture is set to a given width.
[02:10:43.980 --> 02:10:45.000]   It's about this big.
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:46.720]   Typically the phone seemed to be getting bigger,
[02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:48.920]   but nonetheless, it's about that big.
[02:10:48.920 --> 02:10:52.300]   And within there, your attentional window
[02:10:52.300 --> 02:10:56.160]   is grabbing a near infinite number of bits of information,
[02:10:56.160 --> 02:10:57.260]   colors, movies.
[02:10:57.260 --> 02:10:59.080]   If a picture is worth a thousand words,
[02:10:59.080 --> 02:11:01.400]   a movie is worth a billion pictures.
[02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:03.520]   The brain loves visual motion.
[02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:06.060]   And so the question is,
[02:11:06.060 --> 02:11:09.360]   does that sort of interaction on a regular basis
[02:11:09.360 --> 02:11:12.560]   lead to deficits in the types of attention that we need
[02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:13.580]   in order to perform well
[02:11:13.580 --> 02:11:15.840]   in work and school relationships, et cetera?
[02:11:15.840 --> 02:11:19.160]   And the short answer is, yes, it does appear so.
[02:11:19.160 --> 02:11:22.120]   We are inducing a sort of ADHD.
[02:11:22.120 --> 02:11:24.280]   And while the studies on this are ongoing
[02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:26.120]   because prominent use of smartphones
[02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:30.200]   really took off right around 2010 and we're only in 2021,
[02:11:30.200 --> 02:11:33.520]   longstanding studies take time,
[02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:36.880]   which is essentially to say the same thing as longstanding.
[02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:39.060]   There are some studies and one in particular
[02:11:39.060 --> 02:11:39.900]   that I'd like to highlight.
[02:11:39.900 --> 02:11:42.860]   One was actually carried out pretty early in 2014.
[02:11:42.860 --> 02:11:46.040]   This is a study that explored smartphone use,
[02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:47.940]   at the time they called it mobile phone use,
[02:11:47.940 --> 02:11:50.620]   but smartphone use and inattention,
[02:11:50.620 --> 02:11:55.620]   difficulties in attending in 7,102 adolescents.
[02:11:55.620 --> 02:11:57.980]   So this is a huge study,
[02:11:57.980 --> 02:12:01.260]   a population-based cross-sectional study.
[02:12:01.260 --> 02:12:06.260]   And you will be probably surprised and somewhat dismayed
[02:12:06.260 --> 02:12:10.040]   to hear that in order to avoid this decrease
[02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:13.800]   in attentional capacity, adolescents needed
[02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:18.800]   to use their smartphone for less than 60 minutes per day
[02:12:18.800 --> 02:12:22.960]   in order to stay focused and centered on their other tasks.
[02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:26.380]   Otherwise they started to really run into significant issues.
[02:12:26.380 --> 02:12:28.280]   So 60 minutes is not much.
[02:12:28.280 --> 02:12:31.360]   I have a feeling that most young people
[02:12:31.360 --> 02:12:33.640]   are using their phone more than 60 minutes per day.
[02:12:33.640 --> 02:12:35.120]   I know I am.
[02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:38.120]   I think for adults, the number is probably higher,
[02:12:38.120 --> 02:12:40.640]   meaning if you're an adult,
[02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:43.760]   I'm going to just extrapolate from what I read in this study.
[02:12:43.760 --> 02:12:47.080]   It seems that probably two hours a day on the phone
[02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:49.720]   would be the upper limit beyond which
[02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:51.400]   you would probably experience
[02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:54.020]   pretty severe attentional deficits.
[02:12:54.020 --> 02:12:57.880]   I'm a big fan of Cal Newport who wrote the book, "Deep Work."
[02:12:57.880 --> 02:13:00.360]   He's also written the excellent book, "A World Without Email."
[02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:02.420]   I've never met him, but I'm a huge admirer of his work.
[02:13:02.420 --> 02:13:05.120]   And I will paraphrase something that he said
[02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:07.400]   far more eloquently than I ever could,
[02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:11.100]   which is that the brain does not do well
[02:13:11.100 --> 02:13:15.560]   with constant context switching, meaning it can do it,
[02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:18.580]   but it diminishes our capacity to do meaningful work
[02:13:18.580 --> 02:13:20.260]   of any other kind.
[02:13:20.260 --> 02:13:22.840]   And so Cal, as I understand,
[02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:26.760]   he's a computer science professor at Georgetown, by the way,
[02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:29.860]   is very structured and very disciplined
[02:13:29.860 --> 02:13:32.260]   in his avoidance of cell phone use.
[02:13:32.260 --> 02:13:34.820]   I think we're all striving to do that.
[02:13:34.820 --> 02:13:36.060]   I'm not here to tell you what to do,
[02:13:36.060 --> 02:13:39.480]   but I think whether or not you have ADHD or not,
[02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:40.580]   if you're an adolescent,
[02:13:40.580 --> 02:13:45.320]   limiting your smartphone use to 60 minutes per day or less,
[02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:49.900]   and if you are an adult to two hours per day or less
[02:13:49.900 --> 02:13:54.100]   is going to be among the very best ways to maintain,
[02:13:54.100 --> 02:13:56.600]   just to maintain your ability to focus
[02:13:56.600 --> 02:13:58.780]   at whatever level you can now.
[02:13:58.780 --> 02:14:01.320]   And as I always say,
[02:14:01.320 --> 02:14:03.580]   most of the things that we get recognized for in life,
[02:14:03.580 --> 02:14:05.860]   success in life in every endeavor,
[02:14:05.860 --> 02:14:09.180]   whether or not it's school, relationships, sport,
[02:14:09.180 --> 02:14:12.760]   creative works of any kind are always proportional
[02:14:12.760 --> 02:14:16.020]   to the amount of focus that we can bring that activity.
[02:14:16.020 --> 02:14:18.240]   It is important to rest, of course, to get proper sleep,
[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:20.340]   but I stand behind that statement.
[02:14:20.340 --> 02:14:23.340]   And I leave you with that study about attention
[02:14:23.340 --> 02:14:26.660]   and cell phones and how cell phones are indeed eroding
[02:14:26.660 --> 02:14:28.580]   our attentional capacities.
[02:14:28.580 --> 02:14:31.640]   So I realized I covered a lot of information about ADHD
[02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:35.660]   and the biology of focus and how to get better at focusing.
[02:14:35.660 --> 02:14:37.540]   We talked about the behavioral
[02:14:37.540 --> 02:14:40.220]   and psychological phenotypes of ADHD.
[02:14:40.220 --> 02:14:43.600]   We talked about the underlying neural circuitry.
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:45.860]   We also talked about the neurochemistry,
[02:14:45.860 --> 02:14:48.900]   and we talked about the various prescription drug treatments
[02:14:48.900 --> 02:14:51.100]   that are aimed at that neurochemistry
[02:14:51.100 --> 02:14:52.860]   and aimed at increasing focus
[02:14:52.860 --> 02:14:55.500]   in children and adults with ADHD.
[02:14:55.500 --> 02:14:58.240]   We also talked about over-the-counter compounds,
[02:14:58.240 --> 02:15:01.660]   the role of particular types of diets and elimination diets.
[02:15:01.660 --> 02:15:03.400]   And we talked about interactions
[02:15:03.400 --> 02:15:07.020]   between these various features in dictating outcomes
[02:15:07.020 --> 02:15:10.060]   for ADHD and enhancing focus in general.
[02:15:10.060 --> 02:15:11.100]   We also talked a little bit
[02:15:11.100 --> 02:15:13.380]   about emerging neurotechnologies
[02:15:13.380 --> 02:15:15.840]   and how certain technologies like the smartphone
[02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:18.540]   are no doubt hindering our ability to focus
[02:15:18.540 --> 02:15:23.500]   and put us at greater risk of developing ADHD at all ages.
[02:15:23.500 --> 02:15:26.980]   I do acknowledge the irony and somewhat the contradiction
[02:15:26.980 --> 02:15:30.620]   of doing a two-hour plus episode on ADHD
[02:15:30.620 --> 02:15:32.840]   if indeed people who are watching this
[02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:34.420]   have challenges with attention.
[02:15:34.420 --> 02:15:36.420]   I want to emphasize that this podcast,
[02:15:36.420 --> 02:15:38.460]   like all of our podcast episodes,
[02:15:38.460 --> 02:15:41.180]   are timestamped for a specific reason.
[02:15:41.180 --> 02:15:42.380]   They are designed to be digested
[02:15:42.380 --> 02:15:45.540]   in whatever batch one chooses, right?
[02:15:45.540 --> 02:15:46.380]   You don't have to watch
[02:15:46.380 --> 02:15:48.340]   or listen to the entire thing all at once.
[02:15:48.340 --> 02:15:51.300]   However, if you've gotten to this point in the podcast,
[02:15:51.300 --> 02:15:52.260]   I want to thank you.
[02:15:52.260 --> 02:15:55.360]   I do hope that you've learned a lot about this condition.
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:56.980]   I hope you've also learned a lot
[02:15:56.980 --> 02:15:58.940]   about your own capacity to focus
[02:15:58.940 --> 02:16:00.800]   and things that you can do to enhance your focus.
[02:16:00.800 --> 02:16:02.840]   We even talked about a tool that takes just one
[02:16:02.840 --> 02:16:06.380]   17-minute session to enhance your ability to focus
[02:16:06.380 --> 02:16:09.240]   thereafter, presumably forever.
[02:16:09.240 --> 02:16:11.620]   If you're enjoying this podcast and you're learning from it,

[02:17:01.880 --> 02:17:02.780]   During today's episode,
[02:17:02.780 --> 02:17:05.940]   we talked a lot about supplement-based compounds.
[02:17:05.940 --> 02:17:07.220]   If you're interested in supplements
[02:17:07.220 --> 02:17:09.500]   and you want to see the supplements that I personally take,
[02:17:09.500 --> 02:17:12.820]   you can go to Thorne, that's T-H-O-R-N-E,
[02:17:12.820 --> 02:17:15.660]   slash the letter U, slash Huberman,
[02:17:15.660 --> 02:17:17.860]   and you can see everything that I take,
[02:17:17.860 --> 02:17:20.580]   and you can get 20% off any of those supplements.
[02:17:20.580 --> 02:17:23.840]   Or if you navigate into the Thorne site through that portal,
[02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:27.340]   you can get 20% off any of the supplements that Thorne makes.
[02:17:27.340 --> 02:17:28.740]   Supplements aren't for everybody.
[02:17:28.740 --> 02:17:30.700]   You by no means have to take supplements,
[02:17:30.700 --> 02:17:32.060]   but if you are going to take supplements,
[02:17:32.060 --> 02:17:33.280]   it's important that you take supplements
[02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:35.200]   from a source that's reputable,
[02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:38.180]   in which the ingredients are very high quality,
[02:17:38.180 --> 02:17:40.460]   and in which the amount of the ingredients
[02:17:40.460 --> 02:17:41.760]   that listed on the bottle
[02:17:41.760 --> 02:17:43.380]   actually matches what's in the bottle.
[02:17:43.380 --> 02:17:44.960]   That's why we partnered with Thorne,
[02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:46.900]   because they have the highest levels of stringency
[02:17:46.900 --> 02:17:50.000]   in terms of quality and specificity of the ingredients.
[02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000]   And finally, I want to thank you for your time
[02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:53.260]   and your attention,
[02:17:53.260 --> 02:17:56.180]   and as always, thank you for your interest in science.
