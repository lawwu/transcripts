[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.500]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of "All The Hacks,"
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.280]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.520]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.040]   and I wanna start this episode by saying happy new year
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.200]   and how grateful I am for all of you and all your support
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.880]   and how excited I am for everything
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.780]   that we're gonna get done in 2024.
[00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.400]   But instead of talking about all those new things today,
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.720]   I want to share some of my takeaways from last year.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.840]   I actually went back and listened
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.320]   to dozens of episodes from 2023,
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.940]   and I wanted to share my top 10 takeaways from last year.
[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.200]   I'm gonna reference a bunch of past episodes today,
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.320]   so just know that if you want to find that episode,
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.240]   you can always go to allthehacks.com/
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.160]   whatever the episode number is.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.160]   So if it's episode 99, allthehacks.com/99.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.080]   And as always, I'll include links to all the episodes
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.280]   I cover and anything else in the show notes
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.160]   to make things easier for you.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.980]   So let's jump into my top 10 takeaways from 2023
[00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.120]   right after this.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.800]   Taking care of your health isn't always easy,
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.800]   but it should at least be simple.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.320]   That's why for the last two years,
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.120]   I've been drinking AG1 every day, no exceptions,
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.800]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.280]   It's just one scoop mixed in water once a day, every day,
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.000]   and it makes me feel so energized
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.680]   and ready to take on whatever comes my way.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.520]   That's because each serving of AG1
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.440]   delivers my daily dose of vitamins,
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.600]   minerals, pre and probiotics, and more.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.960]   It's a powerful, healthy habit
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.900]   that's also powerfully simple.
[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.700]   And one of the reasons I love AG1
[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.480]   is that healthy aging shouldn't feel complicated.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.460]   The thought of taking multiple supplements
[00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.900]   or mixing and matching pills and powders every day
[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.580]   sounds exhausting.
[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.060]   But just one scoop of AG1 covers my nutrient gaps
[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.300]   and supports my mental and physical health
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.080]   without a lot of hassle.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.680]   In just 60 seconds,
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.980]   I mix it up with some cold water every morning,
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.580]   add a few ice cubes because it's so good cold,
[00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.020]   and I know I'm giving my body what it needs
[00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.020]   and setting up sustainable habits for the long run.
[00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.780]   If there's one product to recommend
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.780]   to elevate your health, it's AG1,
[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.560]   and that's why I've partnered with them for so long.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.260]   So if you wanna take ownership of your health,
[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.740]   start with AG1.
[00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.360]   Try AG1 and get a free one-year supply
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.900]   of vitamin D3 and K2
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.220]   and five free AG1 travel packs with your first purchase
[00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.460]   exclusively at allthehacks.com/AG1.
[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.220]   That's allthehacks.com/AG1.
[00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.380]   Check it out.
[00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.380]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.580]   Takeaway number one,
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.700]   and don't read into the order of these 10,
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.260]   is that everyone can build more confidence.
[00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.840]   Now, I wouldn't say I'm the most confident person I know,
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.140]   but it's certainly not a skill
[00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.020]   that I ever thought I was necessarily lacking.
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.380]   But after my conversation with Aziz Ghazipoura
[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.820]   in episode 130,
[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.380]   I realized that confidence is a skill that anyone
[00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.580]   and really everyone can improve.
[00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.020]   And one of those reasons
[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.580]   is that just believing in something
[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.740]   and being confident about it
[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.220]   isn't always the same as asking for it.
[00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.620]   And that asking for things
[00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.020]   often leads to a lot more than you thought.
[00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.720]   So one of my takeaways from that episode
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.120]   is just practice getting rejected
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.620]   to help boost your confidence
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.460]   and your ability to ask for things.
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.740]   And it might surprise you over the course of your life.
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.100]   And it's literally as easy as going up to random people
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.980]   and asking questions even that you know they'll say no to.
[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.440]   So find a stranger and ask for $100,
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.820]   not in a way that you're begging
[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:19.740]   or giving a reason,
[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.500]   just say, "Hey, do you think I could have $100?"
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.980]   The goal is not to get the $100.
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.900]   It's to help you get better and better
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.460]   at understanding and feeling that discomfort
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.940]   so that you can ask things
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.740]   and be more confident in the future.
[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.580]   If this seems hard,
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.340]   you can work through uncomfortable situations in advance.
[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.620]   Ask yourself, if this happens, what would be the outcome?
[00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.740]   And almost every time you'll realize
[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.500]   that it's not really gonna be as bad
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.980]   as you might've initially thought.
[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.020]   And part of the reason that I think being confident
[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.540]   and walking into certain situations is hard
[00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.780]   is because there's so much uncertainty.
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.340]   But I had another conversation this year with Matt Abrahams,
[00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.300]   which was episode 139,
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.940]   where I learned that you can prepare
[00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.380]   for a lot of spontaneous conversation as well.
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.340]   And one of the biggest tactics I learned there
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.160]   was he gave four ways
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.320]   that you can relieve the pressure to respond
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.300]   if you're in a situation where you're not sure what to say.
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.020]   One of them that might be the most uncomfortable
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.840]   is to just pause.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.060]   I've seen a handful of speakers do this really well
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.900]   at conferences and as uncomfortable as it is,
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.360]   the responses that come after are almost always so good
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.820]   that you forget about that pause.
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:26.820]   So that's one thing.
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.740]   The other is if you need to buy yourself some time,
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.900]   you can just ask someone to clarify.
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.540]   Another option is to just paraphrase what someone said.
[00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.420]   So you could just repeat what they said,
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.740]   allowing you some time to think and process.
[00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.720]   And then the last,
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.100]   which is something that I think it's hard
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.340]   for all of us to do
[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.900]   and takes a little bit of confidence
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.300]   is to just say you don't know.
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.020]   Matt also suggested pairing that with I don't know,
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.460]   but I'll look into it and follow up with you.
[00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.060]   But my hunch or my inkling is this.
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.240]   So people understand that you have the expertise,
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.020]   but you couch that you don't actually know if it's correct
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.880]   versus so often we know people that say things
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.500]   that they're thinking and state them as facts.
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.180]   The other big way to get better
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.740]   at being confident in situations with other people,
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.220]   especially when communicating
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.900]   is to really just focus on other people's needs.
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.620]   So often we think about conversation,
[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.540]   negotiation being about ourselves,
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.320]   but it's often about others.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.020]   And so one line that Matt learned from his mother
[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.380]   was just constantly saying, tell me more.
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.760]   Let people do the talking, listen to their needs
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.020]   and respond to their needs appropriately.
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.060]   That said, there are a few tactics that I'll share
[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.520]   before I move on to number two
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.820]   that were really interesting.
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.260]   And they were all about having some structures
[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.220]   to how you will have a conversation.
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.100]   And so Matt shared a few, I'll just share them.
[00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.460]   One was what, so what, now what?
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.780]   And he's like, if you just think about this
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.820]   and you practice it in advance,
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.100]   it just makes it really easy
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.420]   anytime you're asked a question or put on the spot
[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.580]   to put your answer into a framework
[00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.640]   that'll help you be concise and deliver your point.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.300]   So what happened, why is it important,
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.520]   and what are we doing next?
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.760]   Similarly, there's problem, solution, benefit,
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.500]   which is a common thing in sales tactics.
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.940]   You can frame your response or your question as,
[00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.500]   well, here's the problem, here's what we're gonna do,
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.900]   and here's why it matters.
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.140]   And then he gave one that was great
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.420]   that I haven't had a chance to practice yet,
[00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.380]   but it was for toasts or tributes.
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.980]   Anytime you're put on the spot to speak at an event,
[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.100]   maybe a dinner, he called it what?
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.020]   It stands for why, why you're here.
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.740]   H is how are we connected?
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.780]   A is an anecdote or two, and T is the thank you or toast.
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.780]   So if you get tapped on at a dinner,
[00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.300]   hopefully that will help.
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.420]   And one of the ways he said you can practice these
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.920]   is just look at anything going on in life.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.340]   Maybe it's an ad on TV and just think,
[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.940]   what was the structure they were using?
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.220]   And just thinking about it and practicing it
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.380]   makes it second nature and makes it much easier
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.860]   for you to think on the fly.
[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.100]   So takeaway one is that everyone can build more confidence,
[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.380]   especially when it comes to spontaneous conversations.
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.220]   Takeaway two is that kindness is so important.
[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.720]   So often we hear messages like nice guys finish last,
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.380]   but after my conversation with Gary Vaynerchuk
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.700]   in episode 118, I think we can all understand
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.720]   how flawed that statement might be.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.060]   I know I've been jealous of other people in the past,
[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.060]   and honestly, I'm not sure why,
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.900]   but there is an overwhelming abundance of resources
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.600]   and opportunity in this world.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.940]   And other people's success doesn't usually limit
[00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.100]   or take away from your opportunities or accomplishments.
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.900]   Maybe if you're in a race with someone,
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.220]   obviously if they win, you will not win.
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.720]   But in general, in life, in business,
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.460]   in a lot of our endeavors, that's not true.
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.860]   And with so much more perspective,
[00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.060]   anytime I've been jealous in the past seems crazy.
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.860]   And now I've kind of become this person
[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.100]   that always wants to be the first to congratulate
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.700]   other people on their successes,
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.380]   and it's a sincere happiness for them.
[00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.860]   Now, I don't know why this is so hard for so many people.
[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.220]   I think a lot of it probably comes down to fear.
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.820]   People are scared they're gonna fail,
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.340]   they're gonna be taken advantage of,
[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.940]   and so instead of being kind, they throw up their defenses.
[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.340]   But I think if you start being kind and accountable
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.060]   to yourself and to others,
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.420]   I think you'll see your personal life, your career,
[00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.540]   and really everything start to flourish,
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.080]   including the success of others around you,
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.060]   which is a really amazing feeling.
[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.860]   And one step that might help is just trying to understand
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.280]   who you're trying to accomplish things for.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.780]   Are you working to make yourself happy,
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.420]   your parents or your friend group?
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:16.620]   And as you push and push,
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.380]   I think ultimately it'll hopefully come back
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.540]   to what's truly gonna make you happy.
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:22.700]   However, I just wanna flag
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.260]   that all of this talk about kindness
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.420]   reminds me of a quick conversation I had
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.600]   with Nisair Yassin in episode 123,
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.260]   where we discussed the distinction
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.460]   between being nice and being kind
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.360]   and how different they can be.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.780]   Sometimes I think we think we're being kind,
[00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.800]   but we might actually just be being nice
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.780]   because we're limited by the fear of offending someone else.
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.140]   So I wanna encourage you to realize
[00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:45.980]   that if you are delivering bad news,
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.580]   it does mean doing it from a place of sincerity.
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.360]   Some of the best feedback I've gotten
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.200]   from entrepreneurs I've spoken with
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.420]   who are raising money for their businesses
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.180]   is after I gave them very negative feedback
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.440]   about why I didn't want to invest,
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.900]   but I didn't say it to put them down.
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.820]   I didn't say it unkindly.
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.240]   I shared the things that made me concerned
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.180]   because honestly, I wanted to see
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.700]   if they thought they were valid.
[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.060]   And if they did, maybe they could course correct
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.380]   because ultimately I want them to succeed.
[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.900]   And the feedback from those meetings
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.860]   where I decided not to invest,
[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.000]   I've heard later was so, so helpful.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.960]   So in 2024, I'm really focused on kindness
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.260]   as being a superpower for life and business.
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.020]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:31.860]   I get it.
[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.540]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.420]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:41.500]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.460]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.380]   and let our sponsor Drizly,
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:49.100]   the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.940]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.780]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.180]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.140]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.620]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.700]   that you got through another week.
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.820]   With Drizly, you can make hosting easy
[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.340]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.120]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.200]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.860]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.440]   Drizly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.420]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.460]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.300]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.340]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:24.980]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.460]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.540]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizly app
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.420]   or go to drizly.com.
[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:37.420]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:40.660]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:44.180]   It's time to get real.
[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.780]   If you have a family like I do,
[00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.160]   then you need to look at getting term life insurance
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.220]   to protect them.
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.940]   It's one of the smartest financial decisions you can make,
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.100]   and the start of a new year is a perfect time to get it done
[00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.100]   so you can focus on whatever else
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.940]   the year has in store for you.
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.500]   So go check out our sponsor today, Fabric by Gerber Life.
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.100]   Fabric was designed by parents for parents
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.140]   to help you get a high quality, surprisingly affordable
[00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.980]   term life insurance policy in less than 10 minutes.
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.980]   And when I say surprisingly affordable,
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.260]   I actually went online to compare prices
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.020]   and found that Fabric was highly competitive
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.040]   with great policies like a million dollars in coverage
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.060]   for less than a dollar a day.
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.220]   And you could go from start to covered
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:28.940]   in less than 10 minutes with no health exam required.
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.980]   So join the thousands of parents who trust Fabric
[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.540]   to protect their family.

[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.200]   Policies issued by Western Southern Life Assurance Company,
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.900]   not available in certain states,
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:54.260]   price is subject to underwriting and health questions.
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:55.920]   Takeaway number three is that we need
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.420]   to value our time better and really get better
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.560]   at outsourcing, delegating, or even dropping things
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.980]   that we don't wanna do.
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.380]   So why is this important?
[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.340]   Well, I think we all know that time is such a precious
[00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:10.020]   and limited resource that we can't get more of.
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.020]   And I had a great conversation with Dan Martell
[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:16.420]   in episode 98, who's really the master at this.
[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.620]   And one thing we talked about was calculating
[00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.980]   our buyback rate to figure out what your time is worth.
[00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.060]   And there's a lot of ways to do that math,
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.700]   but that's not actually the hard part.
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.740]   I think the hard part is once you get that number,
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:30.300]   actually applying it.
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.900]   Because when we're sitting at home trying to decide
[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.740]   if we wanna order groceries online,
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.140]   we're not actually going to make our buyback rate
[00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:37.980]   in the one hour we'd save.
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.900]   And so putting this in practice is especially hard.
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.420]   I know that many of the people listening,
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.820]   myself included, are frugal, we hate paying premiums,
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.260]   but you never know what you're gonna miss out on
[00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.060]   until you make space for it.
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.020]   Take this podcast as an example.
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.540]   Once I went full time on it,
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.500]   I was able to do so much more from consistency
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.980]   with the newsletter, the membership,
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.420]   more research for solo episodes,
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.660]   which might evolve to be an even bigger part
[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:05.700]   of the show next year, but I didn't know that at the time.
[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.660]   It was having the space to think, to write out ideas,
[00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.660]   to brainstorm and get creative
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.220]   that allowed so many cool things to unlock.
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.660]   And I wouldn't have had that space
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.940]   if I wasn't willing to protect my time.
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:18.900]   So what are some ways you can buy back your time?
[00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.660]   I love doing a time audit, look at your calendar,
[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.020]   I'll talk about that in another takeaway later.
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.540]   You can look at all the tasks
[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:26.860]   that you might be able to outsource
[00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.980]   and just try to figure out are there things
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.820]   that you don't want to spend your time on,
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.420]   that you don't enjoy, that don't give you energy,
[00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.420]   that you could outsource somewhere else.
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.260]   Whether that's work or home, could be grocery shopping,
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.540]   cooking, cleaning, gardening, fixing a toilet,
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:43.260]   all those things are possible.
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.100]   Yes, it'll cost more, but how much?
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.980]   I used to hate paying all these markups
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.500]   and delivery fees and service fees
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.020]   to get groceries delivered.
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.820]   And I wanted to know the true cost
[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:53.940]   so I could feel good about it.
[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.660]   I added everything to the card in the app
[00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.260]   and then I actually went to the grocery store
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.980]   and I compared the total and the difference was about $15.
[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.220]   Except the grocery store trip took an hour.
[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.060]   And by the way, I think I ended up buying
[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:07.340]   about $15 of things I didn't need
[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:09.820]   because I was a little bit more impulsive at the store.
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.460]   But even if I avoided that impulsive behavior,
[00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.260]   $15 an hour seems like a great deal.
[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.220]   Every day, I don't just hop in the car
[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.020]   and drive for Uber or Lyft to make $15 an hour.
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.820]   So clearly I value my time at more than that.
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.620]   And if you look at what I've charged
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:28.500]   in the past for consulting, my rate is way more than that.
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.620]   So why is it so hard?
[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.300]   The more I think about it, the more I'm able to do it,
[00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.260]   but it's the doing it that makes it easier
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.180]   because once I do it, I start to actually see the things
[00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:40.340]   that have happened in my life with extra time
[00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:41.780]   to be creative and to think.
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.140]   And that's when it's gotten more and more comfortable.
[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:47.060]   On the work side, 2023 was actually the year
[00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:50.180]   I finally hired an assistant and I haven't looked back.
[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:51.220]   Her name is Possany.
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:54.180]   She's amazing and I'm so grateful for her.
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.940]   I worried for months before going through that process
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.100]   that I wouldn't be able to fill her week with work.
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.460]   And now we're already talking about
[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.580]   when to hire another person to join the team
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.900]   because she's already taken on so much work.
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:06.180]   So if you're even remotely interested,
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:07.620]   there are lots of companies you can use
[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:10.500]   to find or recruit an assistant, but we used Oceans.
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:14.100]   The website's oceansxyz.com, highly recommended.
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.060]   If you're interested, reach out to them
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.380]   and let them know I sent you
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.540]   and ask them if they can hook you up with a deal.
[00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:21.460]   Also, we have an amazing episode coming out
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.100]   in a week or two with Sam Korkos
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.420]   about all the different ways you can leverage delegation
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.420]   through assistance, automation, and more.
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.980]   So that's gonna be really awesome.
[00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:32.940]   Finally, part of this takeaway was also say no.
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.900]   And I included that because just looking
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.020]   at an email this morning and I got a pitch
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.140]   to use someone's service, and I still felt
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.780]   this small instinct that I needed to reply,
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:44.380]   but I'm not sure why.
[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:46.980]   Just because they or probably some automated system
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.860]   sent me an email to my inbox
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.980]   doesn't mean I owe them a reply.
[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:53.300]   A previous version of me probably would have,
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.260]   but I think it's really important to protect our own time
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.700]   and realize that just because someone is trying
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.860]   to impede on our time doesn't mean
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.820]   we have to let that happen.
[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:05.180]   So when you get a phone call, you can say no.
[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:07.540]   When you get an email, you can just archive it.
[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.860]   Don't forget that you need to be more protective
[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.820]   of your own time as well.
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.140]   So that's takeaway three, value your time
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.260]   and really get better at outsourcing, delegating,
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.900]   and just dropping the things you don't want to do.
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.180]   Takeaway number four for me
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.180]   was learning the skill of spending.
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.060]   This one is so important and it has two steps.
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:28.020]   First, getting clarity on your spending,
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:31.460]   which I really went deep on this year in episode 133.
[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.500]   I have never had more clarity on our spending
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.460]   in my entire 39 years of life.
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:37.940]   I've tried all the tools.
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.460]   We ended up using Copilot to track everything.
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:42.980]   I think it's fun and easy and way better
[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.900]   at categorizing expenses than the five
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.660]   to 10 other apps I tried.
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.020]   They are now a partner of the show.
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.100]   So if you want to try it out for two months for free,
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.900]   you can do that at allthehacks.com/copilot
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.940]   or with the code HACKS2.
[00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:58.620]   And good news for both XMint users and Android web users,
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.540]   they're building a Mint data importer as we speak,
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.060]   which should be done soon.
[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:04.620]   And they'll be launching Copilot
[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:06.900]   for Android and web this year.
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.220]   I'm really excited for more of you
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:09.500]   to be able to check it out.
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.100]   But once you understand where you're spending money,
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.820]   you need to also be intentional about where you want to spend
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:16.340]   and the changes you want to make,
[00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:18.540]   which involves going through all those categories
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.380]   and really thinking about what you care about,
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:23.140]   what you don't, what's important to you and what's not.
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:26.220]   And the hard part for me wasn't actually cutting back
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:27.660]   on things I don't care about.
[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:29.940]   It was learning the skill of spending
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.940]   to dial up the things I did care about.
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.860]   I'll go back to how hard it is for me
[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.140]   and probably many of you to steer away
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:40.620]   from our like frugal and optimizing way of life.
[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.700]   And honestly, it's still hard,
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.020]   but I've gotten better and better at doing it.
[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.980]   In fact, I once heard someone describe a budget
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.380]   as being more freeing than restricting,
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.580]   because when you allocate a certain amount of money
[00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.980]   to a category, it actually gives you the freedom
[00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:55.660]   to spend it without worry.
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:56.820]   And I have to agree.
[00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.660]   So this year, we've decided to increase
[00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.540]   our money dial for travel.
[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.500]   And we wanted to do that because we love traveling,
[00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.980]   but we also wanted it to be comfortable with two kids,
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:08.780]   which is something we really value.
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:11.980]   And by the way, you might not, which is totally fine.
[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.500]   But for us, that means renting a bigger house
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.620]   or getting two connecting hotel rooms,
[00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.740]   or in some cases, renting a suite,
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.580]   all of which costs two to three times what we used to spend
[00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:24.020]   and usually can't be booked with points.
[00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.220]   But because we know we've cut back
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.700]   in other areas of our life,
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:30.540]   and because we've allocated a specific amount
[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.940]   of extra money to this category,
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.940]   and it's important to us,
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:38.100]   we've gotten a lot more comfortable spending that money.
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.260]   If you wanna go back to episode 141,
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.620]   I talked with three-time All The Hacks guest, Brad Barrett,
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.100]   from the Choose Five podcast,
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.180]   all about learning the skill of spending.
[00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.060]   And it also brought me back to a very early episode,
[00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:52.140]   episode number nine with Ramit Sethi,
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.380]   who really believes vehemently
[00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.260]   that you should spend on the things you care about,
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.580]   turn up those money dials,
[00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.500]   and then cut back mercilessly
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.140]   on the things you don't care about.
[00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.780]   So that's takeaway number four.
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.180]   I really needed to get better
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.580]   at learning the skill of spending,
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:11.260]   and I think it's a journey that I am on and making progress.
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.660]   Number five is that there are many paths
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:14.900]   to happiness and success.
[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.460]   Now, this one seems so obvious,
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:19.680]   but Amy and I worked in tech in Silicon Valley
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.180]   for the last decade,
[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.380]   and it almost seemed in our minds
[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:26.900]   that success was being the founder of a unicorn startup
[00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.620]   or being a venture capitalist,
[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:32.180]   which in hindsight seems so obviously narrow and wrong,
[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:33.660]   but that career and effectively
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:35.060]   the way you invest your money,
[00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.820]   because if you're being a founder,
[00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.340]   you're taking a lower salary or investing in your company,
[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:40.340]   and if you're an investor,
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.700]   you're actually investing in those funds that you manage.
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.580]   It just seemed like what you were supposed to do
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:47.340]   with your time and energy and money to be successful.
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:50.700]   And even though I'm doing the podcast full-time,
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:54.620]   it still felt a little bit to me like a side hustle
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:57.620]   or a less exciting path because it wasn't success
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:01.100]   in the way the last decade has trained me to think about it.
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.180]   And then I had a conversation with Cody Sanchez
[00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:06.460]   in episode 119, and it really changed things.
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:08.660]   First off, she's built her entire empire
[00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:10.100]   buying boring businesses,
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.380]   which was something I'd never considered,
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.780]   and honestly didn't sound exciting to me,
[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:18.060]   but she's built a wildly successful company around it.
[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.540]   And it just kind of kicked me out of that mode of thinking
[00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:23.780]   because she's put her time and money into something
[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.740]   that's not that sexy, but that she really enjoys
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.100]   and has done so well.
[00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:29.500]   And it got the wheels turning for me
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.020]   about all the possible things I could do,
[00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:33.740]   but not just me, anyone.
[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:35.740]   I've shared that episode to so many friends
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:38.020]   and family members in different industries,
[00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.580]   from medicine to oil and gas to teaching.
[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:42.340]   And even though many of them aren't rushing out
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.740]   to buy a laundromat or another small business,
[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.420]   they've all shared how they're now thinking
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:49.540]   a little bit differently about the paths they could take
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.300]   to their own happiness and success, which is awesome.
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:54.300]   And I can't wait to see where the next year or two
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.420]   take all those people,
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.580]   and especially take me and Amy and everything we're doing.
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.820]   Don't worry, the podcast isn't going anywhere.
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.280]   I'm just excited for everything that can come.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.220]   So takeaway number five,
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.840]   there are so many more paths to happiness and success
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.180]   that you might not be considering.
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.040]   Takeaway number six is that we are all responsible
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.560]   for our own health.
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.580]   And this really came to light this year
[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:18.100]   and started with my cholesterol situation,
[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.340]   which for most of my life had been high.
[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:23.280]   But for years, the advice I'd gotten from doctors
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:26.500]   was just exercise, eat healthy, check back.
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.680]   And even though my cholesterol numbers didn't get better,
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.420]   the advice never changed.
[00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:32.340]   I'd been on that regimen for a while.
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:35.260]   And then I started listening to Peter Attia's podcast
[00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.600]   and eventually went down the rabbit hole of heart disease,
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.500]   which by the way, is the leading cause of death,
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.620]   and realized that the advice I've been getting is so bad.
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.240]   And the reasons why are so crazy.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:50.160]   One of the primary ones is that the way we evaluate risk
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.460]   of heart disease is that we look at the likelihood
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.800]   of a cardiac event and set a threshold
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.500]   where if it's higher than that point, we take action.
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.260]   And if it's not, we don't.
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.260]   And most of those tests that are used
[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:03.980]   don't even work until you're 40.
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:07.280]   So if you're not 40, or if you are 40,
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.420]   but you're not a high enough likelihood
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.140]   of something happening, then we don't take any practice.
[00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:15.580]   It's as if we said, until you're a specific percentage
[00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.780]   likely to get lung cancer in the next 10 years,
[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:21.080]   smoking is fine, which seems crazy.
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:24.480]   And so I started taking this into my own hands.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.320]   I went and paid for a calcium score test,
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:30.600]   which at some places is quite affordable,
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.760]   and found out that I have a small,
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.320]   but non-zero amount of calcium in my arteries,
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.200]   which meant this is serious.
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.600]   I sought out a doctor that would actually listen
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.880]   to some of these results and talk.
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.220]   They were part of one medical,
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:47.280]   so it's not like I went and spent a ton of money to do this.
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.920]   And the course of action was to get on statins,
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.740]   and I've brought my cholesterol down,
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.660]   and I feel much, much better about the future.
[00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.140]   In the middle of this entire process,
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.420]   I also did an episode with Dr. Jordan Shlain,
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.820]   which was episode 97, and we discussed how important it is
[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.820]   for all of us to be in charge of our own health.
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.420]   And that's because even the best doctors in the world
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.380]   don't have the time or ability to care about your health
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:10.620]   as much as you do.
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:13.260]   They also can't be experts in everything.
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.480]   And unfortunately, many have to tailor their advice
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.220]   to what patients can do, i.e. what's covered by insurance,
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:22.100]   and often what's been given to them in outdated guidance
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.220]   that they're still operating on.
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.860]   So in addition to that calcium score test,
[00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:28.820]   I've done a bunch of research on other tests
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.900]   I could be doing just to get a baseline
[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.620]   of where I can affect change.
[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:34.820]   And fortunately, a lot of those diagnostics
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:37.060]   are getting cheaper and more accessible.
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.180]   Things like DEXA scans, VO2max,
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.460]   getting all of your biomarkers done, whole-body MRIs.
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:43.980]   I'm actually gonna do a whole episode
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.800]   on what I learned in that process next year,
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.680]   but please don't get caught up
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.400]   on everything you could possibly do.
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.840]   Yes, you can use those tests
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.100]   to figure out where to make progress,
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.440]   but honestly, anywhere you make progress
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.020]   is better than nowhere.
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:01.640]   And I love this one point where I think it was Dr. Schlain
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.600]   said, you know, there are a million ways
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.580]   you can improve your health,
[00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:07.480]   but if you're not just exercising and eating healthy,
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.780]   a lot of them don't matter.
[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:11.120]   So yes, you can go deeper and deeper,
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.800]   but also don't forget about the fundamentals
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.140]   and keep in mind that you're ultimately in charge.
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.800]   If you wanna go deeper on this,
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.440]   Peter Attia's book "Outlive" came out this past year
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.920]   and I really enjoyed it.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.720]   So takeaway number six,
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.560]   we're all responsible for our own health.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.400]   We have to take it into our own hands.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.800]   And fortunately, that's become a lot easier.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:34.640]   I've talked to a lot of amazing people on this podcast,
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.000]   but if you're like me, you wanna go deeper.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.400]   So where can you go to learn
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.160]   from the most remarkable people?
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.240]   That's Masterclass,
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.600]   who I'm excited to partner with for this episode.
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:46.000]   This year, don't just talk about improving.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.280]   Masterclass helps you actually do it
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.040]   by giving you unlimited access
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.160]   to intimate one-on-one classes with the world's best.
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.640]   In fact, Masterclass offers
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.520]   over 180 world-class instructors.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.560]   So whether you wanna master negotiation with Chris Voss,
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.680]   think like a boss with Martha Stewart,
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.680]   or go deeper on mental strength
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.120]   with All The Hacks guest Robin Arzon,
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:09.160]   Masterclass has you covered.
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.960]   There are over 200 classes to pick from
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.400]   with new classes added every month,
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.200]   like modern Japanese cooking,
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.720]   which helped me be more confident in the kitchen
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:22.080]   and introduce some new flavors to our weekly meals.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.520]   Plus, every new membership

[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.360]   When it comes to building wealth,
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.960]   taxes are such a big part of the strategy,
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.640]   and even if you've already filed,
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:56.960]   being proactive right now to lower your future liability
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.320]   is so important.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.880]   And now that I'm working with GELT,
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:02.280]   I feel like I finally have a partner I can trust
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:05.600]   to handle everything for my personal and business taxes,
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.160]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.040]   Think of GELT as the ultimate modern CPA.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.400]   They not only offer an amazing tech platform
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.000]   that gives you personalized guidance
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.240]   to maximize deductions, tax credits, and savings,
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.160]   but also it's so easy to communicate with them.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.440]   There's an in-house team of expert CPAs
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.720]   who can recommend the most effective tax strategies
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.080]   to minimize risk and grow your wealth.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.240]   And my favorite story
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.200]   is that when we first onboarded with GELT,
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.880]   they reviewed our past returns
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:36.120]   and found a huge mistake our prior CPA had made,
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:39.080]   so they refiled and got us back all that money.
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.120]   So, if you're ready for a more premium,
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:44.800]   proactive tax strategy to optimize and file your taxes,
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.480]   you have to check out GELT.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.880]   And as an "All The Hacks" listener,
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.560]   you can skip the wait list.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:54.400]   Just head to allthehacks.com/GELT, that's G-E-L-T.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:58.120]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/G-E-L-T
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.400]   to stop overpaying on taxes.
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:04.120]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.600]   and supporting the show.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.440]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.160]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals,
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.920]   and discounts from our partners,
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.480]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.720]   So, please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.440]   All right, my takeaway number seven
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.680]   is that eating well can be so much easier than you think.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.520]   So, just talked about health.
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.280]   One of the biggest things there is food and diet,
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:31.360]   and I feel like it's always seemed so hard to eat healthy.
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.880]   But this year, we've realized
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.480]   that we've been making it more work than it needs to be.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.360]   So, I wanna share some of the tips we've learned
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.560]   and been using to make the process better.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.800]   First off, meal planning helps so much.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.400]   This could be as simple as just planning out
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.920]   what you wanna cook each week.
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.040]   We organize all our meals in an app called Paprika,
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.080]   which I love.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.640]   But if you wanna make it even easier,
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.480]   there are plenty of sites that sell
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.640]   or give away full meal plans.
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.720]   And this is one where AI can actually be really helpful.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.120]   If you haven't done this, definitely try it out.
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.560]   Go to ChatGPT, or whatever your AI of choice is,
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.400]   and ask them to create a meal plan,
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.280]   and then continually try to tailor it
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.680]   to exactly what you want,
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:11.680]   whether that's flavors, or diets, or types of protein.
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.600]   And the results are amazing.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.240]   You can do this for regular cooking,
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:19.040]   or you could even layer on kind of a meal prep aspect
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:21.240]   where you're gonna make food in bulk and freeze it,
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.600]   which will make cooking meals even easier
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.260]   in the weeks that follow.
[00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:26.100]   Okay, another one.
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.160]   You've probably heard me talk about this multiple times,
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.080]   but one of the ways we make eating well easy
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.360]   is that three of our meals every single week
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:33.640]   come from Green Chef,
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.920]   which is a meal kit focused on eating well.
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.320]   There are a lot of options here,
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:38.880]   and we've tried others in the past,
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.720]   but when we tried Green Chef early last year,
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:44.120]   it was amazing, both the food taste and the health aspect.
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:45.520]   And we've honestly been ordering it
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:47.520]   every week we're in town since.
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.160]   And even though I got them to become a partner of the show,
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.040]   though they don't even know I'm doing this,
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.840]   we still have to pay for it every single week,
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.080]   but we're happy to.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.560]   And if you go to allthehacks.com/greenchef,
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.860]   you can get 60% off your first kit.
[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:01.800]   Another thing we've done to simplify meal planning
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.720]   is just repeat meals.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.080]   Comes in two forms for us,
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.160]   which is just repeating recipes we love,
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.700]   which has the added benefit of making the cooking so easy
[00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:12.100]   because the recipes become second nature,
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:15.300]   or we just do tacos on Tuesday and pizza on Friday.
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.440]   There's no overhead on what we're doing those nights.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.800]   It's always the same.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.420]   And when you combine that with Green Chef
[00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:21.560]   for three nights a week,
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:24.560]   we really only have to plan for two nights a week.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:25.960]   I mentioned outsourcing above,
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.960]   but ordering groceries online has made everything easy.
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.120]   And for this, we're mostly using Amazon Fresh
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:34.200]   and Whole Foods because every time we keep trying Instacart,
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.760]   they do such a bad job of replacements.
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.760]   And by the way, if you end up getting an assistant,
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.860]   you could actually ask them to help plan your meals
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.160]   and order the groceries and save you time.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.680]   In the past, we've also had someone help with meal prep.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.180]   So I put an ad out on Craigslist
[00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:51.400]   just to find someone local who could cook meals
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.400]   and prep for the week,
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.880]   and it was way less than the cost of delivery.
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.200]   And we were able to share recipes we wanted
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.880]   to someone who would shop and cook
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.280]   for two to three days at a time
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.440]   and drop everything off on Tupperware.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.960]   It seemed like such a luxury,
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.200]   but it was so much cheaper than you'd think.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.780]   And all we had to do for dinner was reheat things.
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:11.180]   Then finally, after talking to Chef David Chang
[00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:14.040]   in episode 122, I took away a bunch of hacks
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.580]   to make cooking at home easy,
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.520]   like buying more frozen fish, using spices more,
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.940]   not always needing to peel ginger,
[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.580]   so many more things in that episode.
[00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:24.360]   But a big one that has saved us time
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.280]   is just using the microwave more.
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.560]   Which no joke, we've probably made
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:31.160]   his salmon veggie rice dish a dozen times in the microwave,
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.280]   which you can make with just one pot
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.680]   and do the whole meal in your microwave.
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.480]   It's delicious, but the microwave
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.480]   also helps keep food nutrients dense,
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.360]   and you don't have to use as many oils or fats.
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:44.440]   Honestly, we enjoyed the microwave cooking
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.720]   that we learned so much
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.360]   that we ended up partnering with AnyDay,
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.680]   the microwave cooking company Dave Chang is behind,
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:53.520]   to get all listeners 15% off at allthehacks.com/anyday
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.200]   if you wanna check it out.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.220]   So takeaway number seven is that eating well
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:58.920]   can be a lot easier than you think.
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:02.720]   Number eight is that you are in control of your own life.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.760]   This one seemed so cliche to include
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:07.840]   because it wasn't really a new message from 2023,
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.640]   I'm sure we've all heard it.
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:13.160]   But talking about it with Robin Arzon in episode 145
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.160]   really made it come to life for me,
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.080]   because I realized it's not always about
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.880]   just the big changes as much as it is some of the small ones.
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.640]   So often we hear that we're in charge,
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.320]   we get to decide what we wanna do,
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.240]   where we wanna go in our life,
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:29.720]   but those all seem like they lead to big, hard changes.
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:32.000]   But it's so important to not let great
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.280]   be the enemy of good,
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:36.560]   and realize you don't need the best outcome to make change.
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.240]   Sometimes you can actually split those two things out
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.360]   and get started as one step,
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.960]   and then optimize your way to the ideal outcome
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:47.360]   as a second step that you might end up not wanting to do.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.680]   For example, meditating was always set aside
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:50.840]   30 minutes a day,
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.360]   and it would take the right location,
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:54.680]   room, sounds, type of practice.
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:58.160]   Then I did an episode with Light Watkins in episode 126,
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.600]   and he reminded me that you can meditate from anywhere
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:01.920]   for any amount of time.
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.360]   You may get more benefit doing it in the most optimal way,
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:06.960]   but there's so much benefit you can get
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:09.000]   just meditating while sitting on your couch
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:09.960]   for a few minutes.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.760]   Then with Robin, she pushed me to prove
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:15.160]   that I could do something hard in the hardest time of year
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.320]   instead of an easier time of year
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.680]   with her 3 for 31 challenge,
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.280]   which as of recording this,
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:22.920]   I've managed to run three miles
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.240]   or move for 22 days straight in December,
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.400]   and I am confident I will manage to continue
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.200]   for the last nine days,
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.640]   which will leave me thinking,
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.680]   wow, if I can do this in December
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.600]   when we had both sets of parents visiting,
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.880]   two kids, all the holidays,
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.360]   everything we were trying to get done for end of year work,
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:41.920]   taxes and everything,
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.320]   I could probably do this any month of the year.
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.680]   Part of that was reframing commitment
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.320]   to be part of my identity.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.040]   So when I think about exercise,
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.460]   I think about the fact that I'm someone who said to others,
[00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:52.300]   including you all,
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:54.160]   that I'm gonna make my health important.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.800]   So if I say I wanna exercise three times a week
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.240]   and I don't do that,
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.040]   I'm not being someone who follows through on my own word,
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.840]   which is actually way more motivating for me
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:07.800]   than being someone who just didn't exercise in a given week.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.240]   Finally, I wanna share a really cool thing Amy and I did,
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.840]   which we called our billionaire life exercise.
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.080]   Basically, we went through a bunch of categories
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.600]   and spent time brainstorming
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.520]   what our life would look like in each of them
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:21.040]   if time or money weren't a concern.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.680]   Those categories were
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.520]   the relationship you have with your spouse,
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:26.200]   your friends and family,
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.960]   health and fitness,
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.000]   travel and transportation,
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.920]   hobbies and personal expression,
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.640]   work and career,
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:35.440]   self-improvement,
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:36.720]   giving back,
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.840]   and celebrations and holidays.
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:41.240]   So we came up with all kinds of ideas
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.080]   on what we would change and what we would do.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.480]   But at the end, the crazy realization
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.680]   was that the difference between our really rich life
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:50.200]   wasn't a billion dollars.
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:53.040]   It was many, many orders of magnitude less
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:56.120]   and actually pretty close to where we were today
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:57.760]   with some subtle changes
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:00.080]   that we feel like we could easily make
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.000]   now that we've gone through this process
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.960]   of cutting where we don't care and focusing on where we are.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.600]   And so the goal for 2024
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.480]   is to fit a lot of those into our annual spending
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.560]   and actually live the life that we want.
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.000]   And it's just so crazy when you go through this exercise,
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.800]   which I'll encourage you all to try
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:19.080]   because some of the things that make us feel like
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.560]   we're living our billionaire life as we called it
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.560]   was replacing our garage door opener.
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.240]   We have one of those old garage door openers
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.600]   that's so loud every time you open it.
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.480]   And anytime we're at my parents' house
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.680]   or anyone's house that has a newer garage door,
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:32.960]   it's so quiet.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.680]   So for us, we haven't done that
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:37.520]   because we have a functioning garage door.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.800]   But if we had a billion dollars, of course we'd replace it.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.560]   Well, it turns out the cost to replace a garage door
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.040]   isn't that high.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.520]   So if we can make ourselves feel so much happier
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.120]   and feel like we're living the life
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.120]   that we really wanna live for a few hundred dollars,
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:51.960]   that's amazing.
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.800]   And so there's a bunch of those things
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.400]   in all of these categories,
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.520]   especially around how we spend our time
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.920]   with friends and family and during the holidays.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:02.240]   So I don't know, I really love that exercise.
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.000]   I hope that other people get to do it.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.880]   So takeaway eight is that you're in control of your life.
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.360]   I encourage you all, even the small things,
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.920]   to be more intentional about it.
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:14.000]   Takeaway number nine is that you've gotta ditch plan B.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.360]   And while this might be similar to the last takeaway,
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:19.160]   it was really different for me and much more specific.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.520]   And it all came from talking to Matt Higgins
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:25.040]   in episode 105 about his book, "Burn the Boats."
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:27.400]   The big takeaway was all of this research
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.880]   that shows that merely having a plan B can hold you back.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.560]   There's this experiment that happened
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.000]   with undergraduates in college
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.320]   where they brought them into a room
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.880]   and gave them a task of unscrambling words
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:40.640]   to form sentences and promise them energy bars
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:43.080]   as a reward for high performance.
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.080]   They randomly assigned them into two groups.
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.280]   And in one of the groups,
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.520]   they had them think about a backup plan
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:51.080]   that could get them free snacks on campus.
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:52.760]   And the other group, they didn't.
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:53.600]   And sure enough,
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:56.120]   the group that had those backup plans in advance
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:58.600]   didn't perform as well as the other group.
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:00.240]   The subsequent experiments have been run
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.000]   with money and time and other rewards.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.520]   And the results are similar every time
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.240]   that just having a plan B
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:10.080]   makes it less likely for plan A to be successful.
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:12.080]   So this was a challenge because as an optimizer,
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:13.880]   I always wanna make the best decision.
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:17.520]   It often means contemplating options and having hedges.
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.120]   But I've really realized that when it comes to the big stuff
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:22.120]   that I wanna make sure happens,
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:24.800]   I need to go all in and not look back.
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.280]   It's why I quit my job to focus on all the hacks.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.200]   It's why Amy did the same thing.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.080]   And sure, we probably could have
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.080]   and should have done it sooner,
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.760]   but it was awesome to see what happened
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:35.800]   when we went all in
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.160]   and things really felt like they were gonna work.
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:40.920]   And one way to help make this happen even more in your life
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:43.080]   is a lesson from my conversation with Sahil Bloom
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:45.720]   about razors in episode 116.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:48.160]   And it's what he called the optimist razor,
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.200]   which was when choosing who to spend time with,
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:52.840]   prioritize spending time with optimists.
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:54.680]   Pessimists see the doors that are closed,
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:56.240]   optimists see the doors that are open
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.080]   and probably will help you kick down
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.840]   those closed doors as well.
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:03.320]   So in 2024, I'm trying to surround myself even more
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.960]   with others who will push me to burn my boats,
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.760]   focus on plan A and not give up.
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.760]   So that's takeaway nine.
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:15.080]   Final takeaway, number 10 is taking the time to reflect.
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:16.640]   And part of the way this episode
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:20.160]   and the one I did like this a year ago came together
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.960]   is that I took the time to reflect
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.200]   on all the lessons I learned from the podcast.
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.280]   But funny enough, when I did this last year,
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:29.640]   I was so focused on doing it for the episode
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.160]   that I didn't actually let the exercise bleed over
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:35.080]   to reflecting on my own life.
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:38.920]   Then in episode 99, at the very beginning of 2023,
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:42.160]   Sahil Bloom shared his personal annual review exercise
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.040]   and it was such an eye-opener.
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.000]   I loved forcing myself to do that reflection for me.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   And in his review, the template is simple.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.400]   There's just seven questions and you can actually go back
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.640]   and re-listen to the episode I did with him
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.240]   if you want more detail.
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.520]   The questions were,
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.600]   what did I change my mind on this year?
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:01.480]   What created energy this year?
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.560]   What drained energy this year?
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:05.760]   Who were the boat anchors in my life?
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:08.280]   What did I not do because of fear?
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.840]   What were my greatest hits and worst misses
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.920]   and what did I learn this year?
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.320]   I won't go through my answers to all of them publicly,
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:18.000]   though I am curious if you think sharing that kind of stuff
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.840]   with you would be interesting in a future episode,
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.560]   but I will share one tactic in the process
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:27.040]   when it came to what created and drained energy that I love
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.760]   and that's doing a calendar audit.
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:30.160]   And I mentioned it earlier,
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.840]   but it just involves looking back
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:33.240]   at a few weeks of your calendar
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.320]   and evaluating everything you did
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:38.560]   on those criteria of what created and drained energy.
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.480]   And if you wanna make it even more visual,
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.520]   you can take the things that created energy
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.240]   and make them green on your calendar.
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.560]   If they took away energy, make them red.
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.640]   If you're not sure, you can make them gray
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.040]   and then look at your calendar
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.480]   and you can visually see
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.240]   where you might wanna make changes going forward.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.600]   But I don't think that just reflecting is enough.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:59.360]   I think it's also really important to set goals.
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:00.960]   Obviously those can change,
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:04.040]   but when you have your plan A, when you have your goals,
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.320]   you can just accomplish a lot more.
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:07.760]   And when I said in takeaway eight
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.480]   that you wanna be in control of your life,
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.920]   it's so helpful to set out where you wanna be,
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:15.000]   what you wanna do so that you can take that control.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.240]   Finally, two other quick things
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.040]   that I wanted to share from last year
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:19.840]   that kind of fit into this takeaway.
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:23.160]   And that's one, I looked back at episode 109
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.520]   and I re-listened to my conversation with Derek Sivers,
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:26.600]   which was amazing.
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:28.800]   And he talked about getting to the point in your life
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.960]   where you raise the bar for everything
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:33.360]   to be a hell yeah or a no,
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:35.960]   which is something I've tried to do a lot.
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.560]   Sure, earlier in your career,
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.280]   it might be way better to just say yes to everything.
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.760]   But now I'm trying to only say yes
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.960]   to the things I'm very excited about
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:48.920]   and let go of the FOMO I might've had about everything else.
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:51.080]   There are so many specific examples
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:53.360]   of a dinner or an event that I said no to,
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:55.720]   and I actually struggled to say no,
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:58.600]   but afterwards I felt so much better skipping
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.760]   and usually ended up using that time
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:03.240]   to do something I valued a lot more,
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:07.600]   whether it was work or just spending time with my family,
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.840]   which actually made it so much easier
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.680]   the next time something came up to say no.
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:15.640]   The other thing was when I talked to Cody Sanchez
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:19.080]   in episode 119, she shared this framework called TEAM
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.360]   that she uses to check in
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.480]   and kind of take an inventory with your relationship.
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.160]   It only takes about 10 minutes.
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:27.640]   So it starts with T for touch,
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:28.720]   maybe you wanna hold hands,
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:30.440]   maybe you wanna sit next to each other.
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:31.600]   E is for education,
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:34.640]   sharing something that you found interesting that day.
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.320]   A is for appreciation,
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:39.040]   sharing something you appreciate about the other person,
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:40.680]   but just don't keep using the same one.
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:43.000]   And then the really important one is M for metrics,
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.320]   where you just talk about things
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.360]   that you wanna change in your relationship
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:48.800]   or sometimes that your spouse wants to change,
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.600]   but you do it in a structured setting
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:53.040]   instead of sharing it in the heat of the moment.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.360]   Now, you don't have to use this specifically,
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:58.120]   but it was just a good idea of ways to apply
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:01.840]   kind of a regular review process to your relationship,
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:04.760]   which might sometimes get lost in your personal goals
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:06.600]   and your personal review.
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:10.040]   Okay, so my final takeaway was to take time to reflect,
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.320]   which I hope all of you are able to do
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.000]   when you think about last year.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.920]   Those are my top 10 takeaways from the podcast.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.320]   I really hope this episode was helpful to you.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.560]   I know it was so helpful for me to put together
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:26.080]   and think about and start to plan for 2024.
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:28.520]   However, if there was a big takeaway from the show
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:29.920]   that I didn't include,
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:32.280]   I would seriously love to hear about it.
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:35.760]   Please share it to me, podcast@allthehacks.com.
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.400]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.700]   I will see you next week.
[00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:41.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.860]   (upbeat music)
