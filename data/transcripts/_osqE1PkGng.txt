[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.720]   Question number one comes from Anne.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.760]   Anne is asking about time management for undergraduates
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.080]   from underrepresented backgrounds.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.160]   She's a university professor, mentors students
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.160]   from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.960]   So Anne says, and this is interesting,
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.480]   when we talk about time management,
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.320]   often the challenging part for these students
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.200]   is getting their parents or younger siblings
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.600]   to respect their deep work time.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.560]   I find this challenge really different than what
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.480]   I face as a parent, where it's much easier for me
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.200]   to carve out time for my work because I'm
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.560]   the head of the household.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.840]   What would you recommend for non-traditional students
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.360]   in building effective time management
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.680]   strategies that take into account
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.360]   multi-generational households and unique demands faced
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.440]   by underrepresented minorities?
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.880]   It's a good question.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.680]   And an interesting thing I would say about my college books,
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.680]   and in particular, How to Become a Straight A Student,
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.640]   is as far as I can tell, the number one market for that book
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.320]   is non-traditional college students.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.400]   So you would imagine, oh, that book
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.400]   is read by a bunch of young Cal Newports.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.480]   It's a traditional 19-year-old residential college.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.880]   They're there for four years.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.720]   That's actually not the number one market for that book
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.600]   because the traditional 19-year-old coming
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.440]   to a residential college out of their upper middle class
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.600]   neighborhood, they don't even really want advice.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.200]   To them, college is like a social experience
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.280]   as much as an intellectual one, and they just want to have fun.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.880]   But it's non-traditional students
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.600]   from many different definitions of that term
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.600]   that are much more focused on, hey, I'm
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.040]   here to learn and to get grades, to open up opportunities,
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.800]   are way more receptive to, I want every piece of advice
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.120]   I can get.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.280]   So How to Become a Straight A Student, for example,
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.760]   it's used in a lot of first-generation college
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.920]   mentoring programs where a lot of schools like Georgetown
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.320]   will have a very particular program if you're
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.160]   a first-generational student.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.840]   And How to Become a Straight A Student is used a lot.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.280]   It's used in some military veteran programs.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.880]   We're preparing military vets who
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.800]   are returning to college a little bit later
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.440]   in life on the GI Bill.
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.560]   Let's get our act together.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.400]   Let's get after it.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.240]   So I'll just say that as a preamble.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.240]   The books like How to Become a Straight A Student
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.200]   are, I think, more popular among people
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.280]   who are much more willing to say, I want to do this well,
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.400]   and I'm looking for advice.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.480]   All right, so how do we deal with that particular problem
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.880]   of carving out time?
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.680]   The things I think are important is
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.280]   you need to treat your schoolwork in this situation
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.960]   using the same idioms with which you would treat a job.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.960]   This is my job.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.160]   It's a part-time job I have.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.740]   It's a part-time job which is getting
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.840]   a degree from this school.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.320]   So first of all, when talking to your family,
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.440]   talking to your relatives, talking to your friends,
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.880]   this is one of my part-time jobs.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.760]   Then you have to actually treat it like a job,
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.320]   meaning this is when and where I do the work.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.320]   This is the idiom surrounding work we're much more used to.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.060]   Oh, you have a job, and you have shifts,
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.520]   and these shifts are on these days at these times.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.360]   All right, when you have a shift for your work,
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.320]   you're not available to do something else.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.880]   We understand those conventions.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.080]   You have to essentially in this situation
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.720]   treat your schoolwork the same way.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.680]   And this is where autopilot scheduling is going
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.800]   to play a really big role.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.140]   Let me look at all the work I have
[00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.960]   to do on a regular basis for my classes.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.480]   Let me figure out when and where I always do that work.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.720]   And then I can make that really clear.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.200]   This is my shift schedule for school.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.360]   And then people just recognize, ah, it's Tuesday from 4 to 6.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.760]   That's when he's working on school.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.920]   So we just know he's not available then.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.680]   As opposed to treating it more, again,
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.240]   like a student at a residential college where you just say,
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.720]   man, what's due tomorrow?
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.520]   Ah, man, I got a lot of things due tomorrow.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.520]   I better go do a lot of work.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.400]   And suddenly there's other people saying, wait,
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.600]   we needed you to help look after your little brother.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.960]   And we need you to give a ride for your grandma.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.400]   You can't just be gone all day.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.720]   You didn't tell us about this.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.760]   We have stuff we need to do.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.680]   So you have to actually really focus, I think,
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.320]   on the autopilot scheduling approach to schoolwork
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.760]   when you're in these situations where it's not just
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.480]   my full-time job is I'm at school living in a dorm
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.600]   and I have nothing else going on.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.120]   So that is what I'd recommend.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.800]   To the extent possible, do this work not in your house, too.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.600]   I think that makes it more clear.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.200]   If you can do it on the campus where you're taking the classes,
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.800]   if you can do it surrounding the classes, works really well.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.080]   I'm going to school to the lecture.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.880]   And then for the next hour after the lecture,
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.000]   I do the schoolwork related to the next lecture.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.760]   So it's all just combined with I'm gone, doing school,
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.120]   it's my shift, and then I'm back.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.040]   So that clarity, I think, is going to go a long way.
