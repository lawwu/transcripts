[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   insights, and encouragement you need

[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   My name is Josh Rasheeds, I'm your host,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   and today is Friday, February 17, 2023.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Though you might not know it due to the absence of music,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   today is Friday Q&A.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Apologies, I went to start everything just before the show
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   and it has disappeared from the places
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   where it was supposed to be
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   and I don't have the backup systems at my fingertips.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   So if you're new to the show,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   welcome each and every Friday here

[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   when I can arrange the appropriate technology.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   We do a live Q&A show, works just like call-in talk radio.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   You call in, talk about anything that you want,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   ask me any questions that you want,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   opine on anything that you want.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   You set the course of the call.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   And so I do that each and every Friday
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   when I can arrange the appropriate recording setup.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   If you would like to gain access

[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   We begin with Annette in North Carolina.

[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   How can I serve you today?
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   I have a question for you.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   I am starting a third grade reading literacy website
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   for my county,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   and I wanted to know what three things
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   would you have on the website and why?
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   I would...
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   I love the question.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   A specific question creates great answers.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   So number one thing I would have on the website
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   is I would have a...
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   some compelling way to demonstrate...
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   So first, a couple of questions.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Who are you hoping will be looking at your website?
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Okay, so let me give you a back...
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   I am not a reading specialist.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   I'm a math major,
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   but I am concerned about reading.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   My county is like 17 points behind the state,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   and African-American students are at the bottom.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And so I went to people to try to get some help.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Nobody was interested,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   so I went to school to learn how to code,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   and I have gathered some resources.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I bought that book that you mentioned in the...
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I think it was the read-along.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   And so I'm just trying to...
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   I'm trying to gather resources.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   This is just a first start at this,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   just putting resources that we have in the county already.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   And so I'm looking towards parents to begin with
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   and maybe the children, the students.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Right.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   So the first most important thing, I think,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   is to persuade people of the value of reading.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   If you hear how I try to talk about it,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   I try to demonstrate a little bit
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   of the clear and obvious research that exists...
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Excuse me, on how incredibly influential reading is
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   on all of the metrics that we care about.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Reading helps to improve academic outcomes substantially.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Reading improves empathy.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Reading helps children to be more successful.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Reading is the corner...
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   It is the cornerstone thing.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   In the Read Aloud Handbook,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Jim Trelease, the author,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   which is the book that I think you're referring to,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Jim Trelease talks about it and he says,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   "If somebody created a pill that would deliver
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   all of the academic benefits of reading,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   there would be a line for miles and miles around."
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   It is the single most important thing that can happen.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   It can help children to improve their test scores,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   academics across the board.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   And so I think the first thing is just to demonstrate
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   a little bit of the research to inspire people
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   that this is fundamentally the thing
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   that can alter the course of someone's life.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   The second thing that I think is important
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   is to emphasize the value of reading aloud.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   And so I would focus...
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   I didn't talk much...
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   In the episodes that have been publicly released,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   I haven't talked about audiobooks.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   But I think the best gateway drug,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   especially for poor families,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   for families where parents are working, etc.,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   the gateway drug that you want to get kids hooked on
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   is audiobooks.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   I see that as the key thing.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Because if somebody listens to lots of stories read aloud,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   that person is far more likely to eventually become
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   a skilled and fluent reader with his eyes
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   if he's had lots of stories read aloud.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   So obviously we want to get moms and dads and grandmas
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   and grandpas and neighbors, etc.,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   reading stories aloud themselves,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   pulling out books and showing people
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   and reading to them in person.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   But given that that can be challenging,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   I think our gateway drug is audiobooks.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   And audiobooks, carefully selected and chosen,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   are just wonderful, and children respond to them.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   So I would focus on trying to get people to be aware
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   of the audiobooks that are available to them,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   perhaps the ones that are there in your local library system.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   I would speak with the local librarian
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   about the audiobooks that they have,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   and I would make sure you choose some good quality audiobooks
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   that have rich, beautiful stories,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   that are high-quality children's literature, etc.,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   and focus on audiobooks.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   And then the third thing I would say,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   if I had to just choose three,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   every bit of academic research that I have seen on this
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   indicates that it doesn't matter what children read,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   it matters that they read.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   So what I mean is I would encourage parents
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   not to try to guide children's reading too much,
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   too proactively.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   If you look at people who are readers as adults,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   they generally become readers
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   because at some point along the way
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   they got hooked on a book or a series of books
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   or a genre or something that they really loved.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   For me as a reader, I remember when I was a boy,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   it was Hardy Boys.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   When I discovered the Hardy Boys books
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   and I discovered all of the incredible adventures
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   that my heroes Frank and Joe Hardy could have,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   it opened up the world to me,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   and I read dozens and dozens of those books.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   For some people it's Babysitter's Club
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   or it's Goosebumps or it's Harry Potter
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   or it's something that grabs them.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   And so I think that there's a danger
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   that people try too hard to direct
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   the reading choices of children.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Now obviously we want to protect children
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   from things that are harmful,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   but the risk of them coming across something that's harmful
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   is very low compared to the risk of them
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   not coming across anything at all.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   And so it's really important that we surround children
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   with books and that they have the opportunity
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   to choose the books that appeal to them
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   without our interference.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   The sustained free reading is the key factor
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   where the child chooses the book that he's interested in
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   for whatever reasons he's interested in
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   and is just given time to read it.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   And so I would work to just make sure parents
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   and school administrators and teachers and whatnot
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   don't try too hard to direct the children.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Don't try in the early years too hard
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   to direct the children to high-quality literature
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   or highbrow literature or quality, et cetera.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Just give free reign.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   And then once you see that you've got a reader
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   and you've got a reader who's addicted,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   then go ahead and start giving that reader
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   advice and recommendations.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Those would be kind of what I think are the top three
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   to educate people on.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   - All right, thank you so much.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Bye.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   - My pleasure, and I'm glad you are here
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   and I'm glad you're taking up.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Read carefully the Read Aloud Handbook
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   that you have gotten because all of it is in there.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   And then I would say check out probably
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   the Read Aloud Revival podcast.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   I have never listened to this.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   I've read her book called The Read Aloud Family.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   It's a second stringer to Read Aloud Handbook
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   by Jim Trulise, but it's a good book.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   It's a very encouraging book.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   But she has a podcast called Read Aloud Revival
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   the author of that.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   So I would go and look through her podcast
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   and see if she discusses some of these themes.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   And if you're interested in becoming an activist
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   for this issue, which I think is a wonderful choice,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   that's a community that I would look for.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   (upbeat music)

[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   - Hey Joshua, and I can agree on the Hardy Boys.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   I think I have a lot of accelerator reader points
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   back in the day, thanks to the Hardy Boys.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   - Absolutely. - They were great.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   (laughing)
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Question for you, and you can tell me
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   if you don't like the question, or if it's too personal,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   but it's not so much of what should I do,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   but I was just kind of thinking and wondering,
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   what do you do with your extra money
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   in terms of investing or keeping in cash?
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   You have life insurance policies you talked about before,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   but tell me if you don't like the question,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   I can ask something else.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   - Yeah, I don't love to talk a ton of personal details.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   So I'll answer the question kind of broadly,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   but I'll just say I practice what I preach.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   So my comment would be,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   the first most important investment category
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   is into lifestyle.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   And so anything, there are a lot of little investments
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   that people can make into lifestyle
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   that can result in freedom.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   So I've invested into my lifestyle.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   I don't think that the idea,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   I have abandoned the concepts of hardcore,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   living on 10% of what I make kind of things
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   just to stretch and to strain forever.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   I'm at a point in my life stage
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   in which lifestyle is important to me.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Meaning that I want to live in a house
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   that fits my long-term goals.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   I want to travel the world with my children.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   This is the stage of life in which I want to spend money.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   If I could go back and do it over again
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   and be 15 years old
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   and be taught about extreme savings and whatnot,
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   then I would embrace extreme savings at 15 years old.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   I would embrace extreme savings as a young single man.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   But I am at a stage in which I'm in
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   and going into my highest expense years
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   because of my family decisions and family obligations.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   So my eldest is nine and I have a newborn
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   and I have five children.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   And so these are the years in which I'm mostly focused
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   on buying lifestyle.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   And that lifestyle primarily revolves
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   around time with my children
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   and opportunities for my children.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   So I spend a lot of money on travel.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   I spend a lot of money
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   on educational opportunities for them.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   I spend a lot of money on their education.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Those are the things that are important to me.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   And I don't have much interest
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   in kind of cheapening out on it.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   I enjoy pushing myself and my children
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   into poverty-level conditions
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   as a way of stretching us and keeping us flexible.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   But I enjoy staying at nice hotels
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   and taking, you know, I enjoy flying nice airlines
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   and taking nice taxis
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   and enjoy staying in nice hotels much more
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   than I enjoy shoestringing it.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   And so to me, and let me just pause for a moment.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Why am I starting with this
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   rather than talking about investing?
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   I'll start logically.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   The only reason any of us should ever save
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   and invest money is if we have something,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   if there's an expenditure that we would like to make
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   with money in the future that we value more
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   than the expenditure that we can make
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   on the money today.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   So that's why you save money.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   Other than that, you should consume money.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   There's no point in saving money.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   So when you're saving for the future,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   there has to be something in the future
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   that you want more than what you can spend
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   the money on today.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   That's why you save.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   So why drive a $2,000 car
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   when you could drive a $100,000 car?
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   Well, because you want a $500,000 car
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   in the future, or because you want a car
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   that has more, that you want the $100,000 car
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   and you want financial freedom
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   so you don't have to work, et cetera.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   So when you reach, when you look at lifestyle,
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   all of kind of conventional financial wisdom
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   is focused on the idea of having more
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   in the future.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   And that makes a lot of sense
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   when you're 15 years old.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   But it doesn't make a lot of sense
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   when you are looking forward to having more
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   when you're 95 years old.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   What's the point of having more money
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   at 95 years old if you could have more money
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   at 35 years old?
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   So that's what I'm trying to argue
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   is simply that I'm at a stage in my life
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   in which I am choosing to consume
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   and I intend to substantially increase
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   the consumption of money
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   because I want to spend the money now
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   more than I want to have more money
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   in the future.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   And to me, that's the logical, rational choice,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   especially given the stage of where I am
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   with children.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   I would rather travel the world
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   with my children and take them
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   to a hundred countries
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   rather than me have tons of money
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   when I'm 30 years older
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   so that I alone, or my wife and I alone,
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   can go to the hundred countries.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   So I'm primarily focused on consuming
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   over the next decade
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   and I'm making decisions that are focused on that.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   The second primary form of investment then
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   is to invest into building income sources
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   with my money
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   that allow me to generate cash flow
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   on a better structure.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   So I don't want to work 80 hours a week.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   I don't want to work 60 hours a week.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   I want to work and be productive
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   but I want to invest money
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   into things that allow me to produce
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   ever increasing amounts of money
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   on a few hours of work per day
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   because that enhances my lifestyle goals
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   not just financially.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   And so I've made a lot of moves in that direction
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   and that's a primary focus for me.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   Because if you can create cash flow
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   on a modest amount of time
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   then you can have more financial abundance
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   while also having more lifestyle abundance
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   which is primary.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Now flipping that around, what about extra money?
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Well I think the standard approach for extra money
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   should always be simply stocks
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   because there is no other solution
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   that provides the highest potential
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   of long term wins
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   with less risk and with less frustration
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   than just simply buying the securities
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   of publicly traded companies.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   When you understand how truly incredible it is
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   that you can purchase these securities
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   especially when wrapped up in a mutual fund
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   or an ETF at a very low cost
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   and you can have zero obligation
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   and yet have substantial long term benefit and growth
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   to me that's an incredible value proposition.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   That should be the standard.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   So we should not deprecate
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   the value of owning stocks.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   We should not deprecate the value of just a mutual fund,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   a standard mutual fund.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Rather, in the same way
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   that when we are doing analysis of investment returns
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   and we look at the risk free rate of return
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   of government debt
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   and that's the baseline
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   we should use the same philosophy
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   when it comes to just simply owning a mutual fund
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   and say this is the baseline.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Now prove to me that the alternative investment is better.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   And when you genuinely understand
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   how incredible a run of the mill mutual fund is
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   compared to all of the work
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   and all of the hassle
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   and all of the everything else that's required
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   to pursue an alternative path
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   mutual funds will shine most of the time.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   Then finally a third stage.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   I have myself remained uncommitted
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   to a specific geographic place.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   And that uncertainty has caused me
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   to not be willing to make certain investment decisions
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   that I would make if I committed to a place.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   And I've wrestled with this for the last few years.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   I'm content with it because it's a decision I've made.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   But if I were committed to a place
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   meaning that this was the specific place that I live,
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   this is our town, this is kind of like our home
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   then I would purchase real estate
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   and I would invest into local businesses in the place.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   And so what I am doing is just waiting to see
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   whether or not I choose a place
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   that I'm going to be committed to
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   or whether I continue this kind of weird lifestyle that I live.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   And so in addition to those things that I said
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   then I'm mostly focused on just stockpiling dry powder
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   and waiting for opportunities as I see them.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   So those are my answers and the logic behind them.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   I'm at a stage in which I'm consuming
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   and I want geographic freedom
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   and we'll see what other investments I make in the future.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   - Yeah, thanks.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   That's helpful to hear you think through.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   I didn't think you were going to say
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   that you were investing in commodity futures
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   or anything crazy.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   So that's about in line with what I expected
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   but it's always helpful to hear how you think through these things.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   - I guess that means I've done my job right.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   If my answer is as predicted
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   then hopefully I am consistent in doing my job right.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   - Now for a limited time at Del Amo Motorsports
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   get financing as low as 1.99% for 36 months
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   on select 2023 Can-Am Maverick X3.

[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   from King of the Hammers to Uncle Ned's Backcountry Rally
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   you're not going to find a better deal
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   on front row seats to a championship winner.

[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   Kyle in Washington, welcome to the show.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   How can I serve you today?
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   - Well, I wasn't going to ask you this
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   but I just, as long as we're getting personal
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   I thought I might ask you a follow up to that.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   - I'm trying to get away from personal.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Go ahead.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   - All right, I'll go.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   - Go ahead.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   - All right, I'm going to do it then.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Okay, so what type of real estate seminar
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   did your father talk you out of?
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   - Do you remember Russ Whitney?
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   - No, I haven't actually heard that name.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   - Okay, so there was an organization that was like
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   I think they did a motive.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   So here was the basic structure when I was in college.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   There was a motivational seminar.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   I forget what it was called.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   I think it may have been called Get Motivated.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   And the way the business model worked
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   is they sold tickets to I think
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   a three day motivational seminar.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   And those tickets, again I think it may have been called
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   Get Motivated but this is going back a long time
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   so I don't remember.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   And then they would bring in, no actually excuse me,
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   it wasn't a three day seminar, it was a one day seminar.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   So they brought in tickets to,
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   it was a one day Get Motivated seminar.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   So I went to Miami, downtown Miami Convention Center
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   and it was kind of the first time I had ever been
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   to a big motivational seminar.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   And it was incredible.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   I forget all the speakers that were there at this point.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   In fact I can't specifically identify a single name.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   But it was one of the most incredible days of my life.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   Just that first initial motivational seminar.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   The tickets to that seminar were very inexpensive.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   I'm sure they charged something
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   but it was one of the like, okay $29, something like that.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Some nominal fee compared to getting a day of content
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   was great.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   And then the way that the speakers did it
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   is they gave a great talk.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   They had about five or six, seven, eight speakers,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   something like that.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   They would give a really good talk.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   They would usually probably have 45 to 90 minutes,
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   somewhere in that scenario.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   And then they would sell from the stage
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   their next follow on appointment.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   And so this technique is so powerful.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   You listen to a great presentation
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   and then they sell and say,
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   if you're interested in this,
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   then you can go on to the next step.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   So at the time, Russ Whitney was running seminars.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   And he or one of his guys talked about real estate investing.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   And I was talking to my buddies about real estate investing.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   And he said, I'm hosting a three-day seminar.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   And again, there was some laughably low entrance fee
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   for that three-day seminar, right?
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   $99, something like that.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   So I immediately signed up for his three-day seminar.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   Then I went to his three-day seminar.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   And they had a very well done structure.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   So day one was solid, consistent real estate content.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   In hindsight now, of course, I understand.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   It was just the basics.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   But when you've never been involved in real estate,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   then it sounds incredible
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   in terms of all the things that can be done.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   When you understand that you can have tax-free real estate money
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   and you can use other people's money and whatnot,
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   these basic concepts,
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   when they're beautifully presented, are so powerful.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   And then they did what Russ really excelled at,
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   was techniques.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   So I forget who the instructor was,
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   but the thing I specifically remember,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   it wasn't Russ himself.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   It was one of his guys.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   But what I specifically remember
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   was he dropped all of the markers of financial success.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   So when he came in, he came in in a three-piece suit,
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   beautiful, blue, dark, blue three-piece suit with a red tie.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   And he talked about it during the seminar.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   He was like, "This is my banker suit.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   "This is what I wear when I go see a banker."
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   But it conveys the impression.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   He casually let fall all of the markers of wealth,
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   of his own wealth, right?
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   So he made the comment and he showed a picture
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   of his Prevo bus sitting out in the parking lot.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   And about how he just goes on this bus
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   because he doesn't like hotel rooms.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   And you're thinking, "Wow, this is a guy who's so rich
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   "that he's got this $300,000 bus
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   "and he doesn't want to use a perfectly good hotel room
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   "'cause that's how rich he is."
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   And shows the deals.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   And of course, he showed the,
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   "I bought this property for $17,000
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   "and I sold it for $125,000.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   "And you can do this too.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   "And then on day two or three,
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   "anyway, I'm going too long,
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   "but then they talk about the options for education.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   "And then of course, they go to the big package deal
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   "and they have a consulting deal.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   "And the consulting deal is you sign up
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   "and you pay $20,000, something like that,
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   "or $1,500 a month.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   "The numbers escape me."
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   But I was so on fire about what could be done
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   that I was completely ready to sign up
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   for the big package consulting deal.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   And that was what my dad talked me out of.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   And so looking back,
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   Russ Whitney turned out to be basically
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   a charlatan and a crook.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   Of course, most of what he said was okay.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   It was okay, good knowledge,
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   but in terms of the structure,
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   it was a lot of flim-flam stuff
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   that a lot of advertising
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   and very little actual substance.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   And Russ himself later declared bankruptcy
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   and was just one of the long line
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   of disgraced real estate gurus.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   But that's who it was.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   It was Russ Whitney.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   I don't know where he is today or what he's doing,
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   but that's the story.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   - It'll be a fun Google after the call.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   - John Reed on his Guru Ratings page
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   has comments on him.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   And Russ was sued specifically
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   for a lot of his techniques.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   So they would use constant,
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   I forget what they were,
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   but just these, you know,
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   making the room cold or hot
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   and artificial table rushes
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   and all of this stuff.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   He would use all these techniques.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   And having gone through that
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   and experienced the emotion of it,
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   I discovered just how powerful those things are.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   And it's why we gotta be so careful
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   to use our emotions
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   and harness them in a positive sense
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   and also to be very careful
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   of when we're being run by emotions
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   and we don't have them regulated.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   - Yeah, I like that.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   It's easy to fall in love
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   when you read, you know,
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   I'm reading, I forget the guy's name,
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   the Nothing Down guy.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   - Yeah, Robert Allen.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   - Allen, thank you.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   And yeah, it's really easy to say,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   oh yeah, I'm not gonna spend a single cent.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   I'm gonna buy all these properties.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   So easy.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   Look how easy Robert Allen's doing.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   - Right.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   - Have you got another one for me?
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   - I guess I was just gonna say
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   that the lesson,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   and I may have been meaning to do this
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   as a standalone podcast,
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   so if I repeat it in the future, it's fine,
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   but that's what a Friday Q&A show is.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   One of the lessons that I have learned is,
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   and part of what I described just there
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   was there were three events in my life
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   that have led me personally to hate mobs.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   I have been a part of one mob
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   that was amazing to me,
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   and I'll just tell the story briefly
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   because it ties into what I said
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   about psychology.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   There was a time in which I went out
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   with a mob of people,
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   and we had pitchforks and torches,
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   and we went out to kill the beast.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   Now, obviously the reference should be obvious,
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   but when I was in high school,
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   I acted in, I was in the chorus
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   for our high school production
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   of the Disney musical Beauty and the Beast.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   And one of the things I vividly remember
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   is during the mob song,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   where the villagers are going out
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   to get the beast, right?
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   ♪ He's got fangs, razor sharp ones ♪
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   ♪ Da-na-na, da-na-na-na-na-na ♪
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   That song, is we were acting in it,
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   but as we're going out with pitchforks,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   singing about we're going out to kill the beast,
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   and there's the Gaston is pumping us up
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   in the show,
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   one of the things I remember,
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   and still just now,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   my skin is filled with goosebumps,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   I remembered every night I would be filled
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   with these emotions,
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   these genuine emotions of hatred
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   for the beast,
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   and like a genuine desire
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   to go and kill this thing.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   And it was just a play,
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   it was just a stage production,
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   but I would experience these emotions,
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   and it scared me to my core.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   It, to this day,
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   I'm so scared of mob psychology
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   because of that initial experience.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   The second time I experienced a mob psychology
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   was in what I described to you,
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   where I remember being a part of the room,
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   and I remember being manipulated
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   from the front of the room
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   to go and basically,
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   as a 19-year-old kid,
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   be ready to sign up
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   for a tens of thousands of dollar
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   consulting package.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   And I remember how much I'm wrestling
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   with the decision,
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   and I was ready to do it.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   And I think about that a lot,
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   about how could I have been so stupid,
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   and so obvious,
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   as my father wasn't trying to discourage me
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   from becoming a real estate investor,
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   he wasn't trying to say,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   "No, Joshua, you can't do it."
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   He was just giving the voice of reason
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   to say, "Maybe you shouldn't sign up
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   for something that costs
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   tens of thousands of dollars
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   when you haven't first read a few books
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   or gotten to know some people
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   or gone and worked in a real estate office.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Maybe you can accomplish
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   your emotionally important goal to you
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   of financial independence through real estate,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   but you can do it in a sensible way."
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   And I remember how much I hated him
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   for that, like, trying to jump on my dreams
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   and to beat my dreams down.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   And now I see the wisdom in it.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   The third time was actually
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   a different money seminar.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   So after I got on the list,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   and I don't, I think it was,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   no, actually, it was separate.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   So I was in a bookstore,
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   and I bought T. Harv Ecker's book
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   called "The Millionaire Mind."
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   Really interesting book.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   I enjoyed a lot of what he said.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   But in Ecker's book,
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   his standard marketing approach
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   for his seminar was he would give away
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   tickets to his seminar in the book.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   And so I got the book,
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   and I got these two tickets.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   So I called up, and I signed up.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   And once again, I went to Miami
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   for T. Harv Ecker's seminar.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   And I really enjoyed the seminar, right?
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   There was some really good,
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   useful concepts in it.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   But I remember this one technique
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   that they used in the seminar.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   I don't think he's around.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   I don't think they do it anymore,
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   so I'm telling you the sauce.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   But they were doing this.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   We were specifically instructed
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   to bring to, so there's an all-day seminar,
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   and then we were specifically instructed
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   to bring to the evening seminar
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   a $100 bill.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   And I think we were instructed
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   to bring a lighter as well.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   And the guy from the stage
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   is going on and on about how
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   if you're gonna master money,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   and if you're gonna get all the money stuff
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   out of fixed in your head,
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   then you've gotta make sure
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   that money doesn't have any control over you.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   And you have to prove it to yourself
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   by burning money.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   You've gotta show that you don't care about money.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   And the way that we're gonna do this
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   is we're gonna burn this $100 bill.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   And so I remember,
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   $100 is a lot of money.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   And I didn't wanna burn a $100 bill,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   but I also didn't wanna miss out
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   on the lesson from the stage.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   And they're building the whole thing up,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   and the doors are closed,
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   and everyone has their $100 bills,
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   and it's kind of this mob ritual scenario.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   And we're right up at the moment
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   where everyone's gonna start burning
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   their $100 bill.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   And I'm sitting there saying,
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   do I do it?
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Do I go along with the crowd
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   and burn my $100 bill, or do I not?
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   I think this is stupid,
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   but what do I do?
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   And in the very last moment,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   they stop everything.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   And the lesson is,
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   you idiot,
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   why would you ever burn a $100 bill?
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   But, like,
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   and so the lesson was the opposite
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   of what we were hearing.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   They were trying to say,
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   you have to,
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   the real lesson they were trying to teach
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   was you have to show your respect
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   by money every bit of it.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   You should never even consider it.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   But I've always wondered,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   would I have burned the money or not?
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   And what scares me is I don't know the answer.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   I can't confidently say that,
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   I can't confidently say,
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   no, I would definitely not have burned the money
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   'cause I'm smarter than that.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   But I also know that I was wrestling with those things.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   And so for me,
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   that question of mob psychology is really scary
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   because I realize how easily I have been manipulated
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   and how easily I could be a part of a mob.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   And it's one of the most dangerous,
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   that idea of mob psychology
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   is one of the most dangerous things
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   in the human condition that I know of.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   And so I don't judge people who do stupid things
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   when they're part of the mob
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   because I kind of see myself being susceptible
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   just like them.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   But I try to learn for myself
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   and try to teach others to say,
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   let's exercise our logical brain
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   and then be careful about the times
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   we put ourselves in an emotional state
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   that could lead to stupidity.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   Emotions are really valuable.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   And so we want to harness the positive ones
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   but not give way to the negative ones.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   - Yeah, that was fantastic answer.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   You got, I got a lot more personal out of you
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   than I thought I would with that.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   Thank you.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   - My pleasure.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   Did you have any other questions
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   or that was just your prod, your poke for today?
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   - No, I've got another.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   If you've got, if you wanna let me ask too,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   I'll ask too.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   - Go ahead with your second
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   and I'll go quickly and then go on.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   Go ahead.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   - Okay, yeah.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   So what ideas do you have for generating earned income
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   for a child to fund Roth IRA?
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   And this seems like something
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   you may have already covered in the past.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   So if you wanna direct me to your catalog,
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   you can move on.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   - I've been thinking about this for years
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   and I have been,
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   at some point I wanna develop this into a course.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   So I don't wanna give away all my great ideas,
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   but I'll just give a few.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   So I think the first ones are simply
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   if the parent has a way to employ the child,
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   that should be the ideal scenario.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   I think that people often,
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   sorry, that's the most applicable thing.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   Obviously, if the parent has a business
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   and the parent can employ the child in the business,
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   then clearly that's an obvious solution.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   But I think people overcomplicate it.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   They say, well, I have to have my own business
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   into which I can employ my children.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   No, you can just employ your children.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   And so maybe you decide that these are some things
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   that I want my children to do
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   and I wanna pay them for it.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   And so whether it can be mowing the lawn,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   it can be pressure washing the roof or the driveway
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   or those kinds of things,
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   and you can just simply pay your children.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   And I think that's a fair and useful thing to do.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   I believe in the concept of family chores,
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   but I also believe that it's important
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   that we pay our children.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   Incidentally, one of the reasons why I think
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   some of us who have been more hard-nosed
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   should soften on this,
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   is that we need our children
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   to get accustomed to handling money.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   And so I have, over the past years,
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   I have paid my children an allowance.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   If you had told me 10 years ago
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   that I would do that,
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   I would have been very surprised.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   Because I would have been of the mindset,
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   well, an allowance is welfare, right?
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   And I don't wanna teach my children welfare.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   I don't wanna teach them that they can just have money.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   But the reason I started to pay my children an allowance
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   was I realized I want them
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   to get accustomed to handling money.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   And if they don't have,
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   and since my young children
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   largely can't do much to actually earn money,
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   if I wait until they're working and earning money,
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   then they'll lose years of handling money.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   And I want them to get experience of spending money.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   I want them to waste money
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   and discover how frustrating that is.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   I want them to learn how to separate their money
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   into giving and saving and investing, et cetera.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   And so in order for that to happen,
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   I need to make money flow through their hands.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   And the most obvious way to do that is with an allowance.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   So back to the idea of paying your children for things.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Well, paying your children for things
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   is a good way of getting money into your children's hands.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   And it is the appropriate thing
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   if you can find anything in your life
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   where you can just simply hire them and pay them.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   The second thing that I think is important to do
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   is to look for jobs for your children
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   within your social and peer group.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   One of the things that my father did really well for me
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   was he encouraged me to go and get jobs.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   And I remember growing up,
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   most of the jobs that I had at a young age
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   were jobs that I got from within our family network.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   And so in our church,
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   there was a guy who had a landscaping company,
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   and I would work for the landscaping company on my time off,
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   just an extra helper.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   It worked out fine.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   I worked for a tile setter who was in our church.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   I worked for a carpenter who was in our church.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   And so we just used the social community,
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   and he encouraged us to go and take those jobs.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   And I don't think he was pulling strings.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   Like, he wasn't paying, saying,
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   "Hey, here's $500 for you to hire my son."
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   But even if he had, that would have been smart
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   because I learned so much from those experiences.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   And so if you have a social network
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   or you know people who have those simple jobs
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   that they can hire your children,
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   there's a lot that can be done.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   And by the way,
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   it doesn't have to be actually a formalized business.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   And so one guy hired me to spread manure
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   on his banana plants, right?
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   He would get a truckload of manure
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   and he needed someone to spread it.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   Well, there was several days of work.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   Other people, of course, would hire you to mow their grass
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   and all those things and do cleaning and house cleaning.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   I worked for a neighbor, and we did house cleaning.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   They would get contracts to do pre-construction--
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   or sorry, post-construction, pre-moving house cleaning.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   And so I would go and clean houses
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   after the construction phase
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   when the family was ready to move in.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   And you put all these things together,
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   and none of them are much money,
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   but on the whole,
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   they are a good amount of money and a good experience
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   if you just look for them and actively work for them.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   The key is you can't work with big companies
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   because they can't take the legal risk, etc.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   But if you can just find local small employers,
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   that's a good scenario.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   Then you move on to the types of things
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   that your children can do
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   that can grow into a bigger opportunity.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   So obviously the classics are, okay, modeling
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   or something like that for our family business.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   But I don't think it's that necessary--
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   I don't think it's that necessary
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   that we give them so many opportunities at a young age.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   What I think is more important that we teach them,
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   once they're at the age where they can actually be productive,
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   how to exercise and develop skills
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   that other people will pay for.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   So I've used the example of balloon tying.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   Somebody who's good at balloon tying
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   can make a couple hundred dollars in a day at a festival.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   And so if you teach your children to say,
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   "Let's learn how to tie 5 to 10 balloon animals,"
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   and then paint you in clown makeup
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   and go to the street festival that happens twice a year,
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   there's a few hundred dollars in that day
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   for somebody to work.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   Or if you look--
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   and I have friends who work for a family decorating business,
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   and during the holidays they go and do--
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   and it's just seasonal work,
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   but they go and do extra work during those times.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   And so if we're proactive about finding opportunities
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   that are businesses for our children,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   then we can guide them just basically to see
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   that you don't need to go and work for $8.25 an hour
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   at an everyday part-time job
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   if instead you can learn how to make a few hundred dollars
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   by working at a balloon tying business at a festival.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   And teaching people to keep their eye out
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   for highly paid work that is seasonal
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   to me fits in better with the needs of children.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   And a lot of it just comes from you encouraging
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   and supporting it.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   I'll just give two examples.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   One, an early job that I had was--
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   when I was a young man--
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   I had a job working at a boat dealership cleaning boats.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   And that job came about completely organically.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   It wasn't a connection that anyone had made for me.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   What it was is my older brother had had a fundraiser
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   where they would have a barbecue for his school.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   And I had worked--
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   and they would have a fundraiser
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   where they would cook thousands of chickens,
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   barbecue chickens, and sell the meals as, again, a fundraiser.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   And so I was just there hanging out,
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   but I was a diligent worker helping
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   with all of the process of the barbecuing, et cetera.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   And there was-- the father of one of the co-workers
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   was there at the event with us.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   And he liked the way I worked.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   He said, would you like a job?
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   And he just offered me a job.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   Well, every Saturday, my dad had to take me 30 minutes to work
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   and come pick me up, 30 minutes at the end of the day.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   But his willingness to do that and support me
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   allowed me at a very young age to have this job
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   of washing boats every Saturday.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   And it was an important part of my life.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   Similar things-- there was a point in which I had a job
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   working for a DJ who would DJ weddings and things like that.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   And I was primarily just a grump assistant
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   to help set up the whole--
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   all the speakers and the light bars and all of that stuff.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   But it was a neat experience.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   But in order for it to happen,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   my parents had to have confidence in me
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   that even though I was a fairly young teenager,
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   that they would allow me to be out late at night,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   on Friday nights and Saturday nights, et cetera,
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   to help this DJ work.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   And it was a useful part of my overall experience in life.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   So I don't think that it's so necessary
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   that we have the exact business.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   But it is more necessary that we encourage
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   the children to develop it.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   And so if it's to say, hey, here's a camera.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   Why don't you go to this local business and say,
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   can I shoot a quick sizzle reel for your website?
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   And that's a money-making opportunity
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   that a local business owner would be happy to spend $500
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   to get a sizzle reel for his Facebook page
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   or something like that.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   And yet, that's something that the child
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   can do very, very quickly.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   So I do have a good long list of things
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   that I think are really worthy considerations.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   But more importantly is just simply the attitude
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   and the proactivity of the parents.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   Sure.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   And the ability for you to put that in the raw
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   just comes down to, for example,
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   the parent documenting what work the child did for who
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   so that you don't-- as long as you can pass the SNP test
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   at the auditing.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   Right.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   Right.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   Absolutely.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   All right.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   Thank you, sir.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   My pleasure.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   We move on to Ori in Minnesota.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   Ori, welcome to the show.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   How can I serve you today?
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   Hey, Joshua.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   My family is considering maybe possibly moving
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   to South Florida.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   West Palm Beach down to Boca Del Rey, that sort of area.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   I'll actually be there on a trip in the next two weeks.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   But I know you have lived there in the past.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   And in that area, I just kind of wanted
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   to hear your thoughts about the area in terms
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   of nice places to live, communities,
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   kind of just general thoughts on the area.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   I mean, I know it's beautiful.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   We vacation there.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   And I obviously love it in the winter.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   I haven't really been there in the summer.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   But I just kind of wanted to hear your thoughts in general
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   on life in South Florida.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   Sure.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   Obviously, it's my neck of the woods.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   And it has a lot going for it.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   But it also has some disadvantages.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   So let's start kind of on the macro level of Florida
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   versus other states.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   I believe that Florida has an extremely ideal mixture
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   of so many things, or at least things
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   that I look for in a place to live.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   Florida is not an extremely polarized state.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   It's a very, very balanced state,
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   which is probably the healthiest kind of situation for us
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   to live in on most levels.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   So Florida is not-- it's a Republican state.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   The Republican legislature controls the state.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   But in many ways, they're very balanced.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   They're not a Republican state in the same way
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   that Idaho is a Republican state.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   It's a very kind of mixture state.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   And when you move into South Florida,
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   you get also a really interesting mix.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   You have this strongly Republican red state.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   And then you have these intense blue pockets.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   And of course, there are many benefits
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   that you get with having those intense blue pockets.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   So it's a state that has, as far as I'm concerned,
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   an ideal mixture of freedoms.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   The freedoms that I care about that you may or may not
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   care about, number one, really high quality
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   homeschooling laws, great educational freedom.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   So you can pretty much do what you want.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   It's not a zero regulation state like Idaho
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   or something like that.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   But it's not an intrusive state.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   Homeschooling laws basically require that once a year,
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   you have your educational outcomes reviewed
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   either by a certified teacher or you
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   have your children go through standardized testing.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   Those are basically the requirements.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   And so it's fairly simple, high degrees of freedom.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   It's a fairly free state with regard to medical freedom.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   You can pretty much do the things that you want to do.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   You don't face a bunch of onerous, heavy-handed laws
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   in terms of medical freedoms as far as how you
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   handle your health decisions.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   It's a pretty good state with regard to things like gun laws
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   and protecting your home, et cetera.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   It's a generally well-run state with regard
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   to the state finances.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   It's got a huge attractiveness as a zero income tax state.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   But unlike some other income tax states that don't have
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   kind of a big business support or you worry about--
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   so Wyoming, for example, zero income tax state
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   because of oil revenue.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   So if oil revenue goes down, well,
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   where does Wyoming get its things from?
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   Well, Florida is a zero personal income tax state.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   And that's basically enshrined in the culture.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   It's a very, very safe protection for the culture
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   because it's so much a part of what it means
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   to be a Floridian.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   Like Floridians, longtime Floridians,
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   the idea of filing a state income tax is unthinkable
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   to them because it's very much a part of it.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   And where the state gets its revenue is from corporate tax
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   and other sources as well.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   So it's a really good state there.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   There is no better state for wealthy people
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   in terms of wealth protecting laws.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   There's no wealth tax.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   There's no estate tax.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   There's no state income tax on personal income.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   And then when you get into the asset protection laws
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   where you have unlimited exemption for your primary homestead
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   in terms of asset protection, you have unlimited exemptions
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   for retirement accounts.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   And by state law, IRAs, Roth IRAs,
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   Floridians, the same protection as 401ks.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   You have unlimited exemption for things like annuities,
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   life insurance, cash values, et cetera.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   From an asset protection state, I don't know of a better one
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   that allows you to protect more of your assets.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   Now, there's not really anything beyond those categories,
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   but it does protect those categories very, very well.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   So I think that Florida is a really wonderful,
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   balanced state where it has so many of the things
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   that you appreciate about a red state,
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   so many of the things that you appreciate about a blue state.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   It's very, very balanced.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   So now you go to Florida Geography and you try to figure out,
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   well, what are the different regions that you can live in?
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   So in terms of big metro areas,
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   you basically have four big metro areas.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   You have South Florida, which consists of the three counties
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   of Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   That's the South Florida area.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   And it's a little bit--they're kind of indistinguishable,
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   but there's just one long line of development.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   That's South Florida.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   Then over on the left coast, you have Tampa and St. Pete.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   That's another big urban center.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   In the middle, you have Orlando.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   And then up on the top right, you have Jacksonville.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   And that's basically it in terms of big cities.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   One of the great things about Florida is basically
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   every lifestyle is available to you.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   So you can be in downtown Miami or downtown Tampa, et cetera,
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   and experience the big city lifestyle.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   On the other hand, you want to have a rural beach town,
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   you go up to some of the cities south of St. Augustine
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   or over on the Gulf Coast, you can just have this incredible,
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   laid-back, relaxed beach lifestyle, et cetera.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   You go through the middle of the state,
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   Florida is a huge ranching and beef production state.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   And so you just have incredible remote,
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   rural areas in central Florida.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   You want horse country.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   You go up north of Orlando into--I always forget the name
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   of that region there--but amazing horse country.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   You want the southern hills, you go up in the Panhandle,
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   or you go up in the northern border, Gainesville, et cetera,
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   and you just have totally diverse lifestyle choices.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   And that diversity involves weather, et cetera.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   So it's got all the different lifestyles that are represented,
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   and you can usually fix those things in terms of
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   how close you want to be to different issues.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   Meaning how close you want to be to downtown, city, et cetera.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   It's pretty accessible.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   Now, what's the unique geography of South Florida?
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   All of the South Florida geography is dictated
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   based upon the Everglades.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   So the Everglades is a giant barrier that keeps
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   South Florida from expanding westward.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   If you go across Alligator Alley and you cross,
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   you see there's this giant thing.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   And since it's all now protected, there's basically no development
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   that can happen to the west of this narrow strip
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   along the corridor.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   So that puts a lot of development pressure onto the tri-counties.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   So Miami and Broward and West Palm Beach face this.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   And until you get up and to northern West Palm Beach,
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   basically, actually central West Palm Beach,
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   in central West Palm Beach, you start to expand out
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   into the western farming regions.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   So west of, if you go at 441,
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   west of Western Palm Beach is, you get Cluiston,
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   Belle Glade, et cetera.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   These are all big farming regions, and you don't have the same,
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   you don't have the same block by the federally protected wetlands.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   You have farming regions.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   And so what has been happening is West Palm Beach itself
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   is spilling to the west, out there with new communities,
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   new housing developments being made from this farmland.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   But that doesn't happen in Broward and Miami
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   because of the constraints of the coast and the Everglades.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   So in terms of choices, you have a couple different lifestyles
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   that are available.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   So Miami is super, super interesting from a cultural perspective
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   because of the intense Latin culture.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   So if somebody wants to live in the Latin culture,
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   and they want to, they speak Spanish,
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   or they have a Hispanic background,
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   I think Miami can very fairly be called the capital of the Americas.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   It is the most intensely Hispanic culture that is expressed,
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   and really because it brings all of that together
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   from all of South and Central America,
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   there's just an incredible, intense Latin melting pot.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   You have all the Caribbean there, et cetera.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   So culturally, that's super interesting.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   It's like, I guess you can speak English in Miami,
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   but I don't ever use English as a first language.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   Whenever I'm in Miami, I just automatically default to Spanish.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   And so for some people, that's a pro.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   For some other people, it's a con.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   Miami, however, is super intense,
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   and I think it has a lot of the worst things of the big city.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   Like the heat is horrific.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   Now, Florida is well-prepared for the heat,
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   but still it's a concrete jungle.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   The traffic, the rates you pay for car insurance, et cetera,
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   are double what you pay when you go up north, farther to the north.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   So very bad traffic, too much urban development,
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   and it's not very smart urban development.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   They've been doing it.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   There are several new train lines that have gone in.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   Brightline now has train connections from West Palm Beach
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   through Broward and into Miami.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   Miami has some connectedness on their metro rail, et cetera,
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   but it's still a car-intensive city, and it's not super, super great.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   So who does I think Miami appeal to?
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   Well, if you're young and you're single and you want to wear white pants
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   and a fancy shirt and a gold watch, et cetera,
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   you kind of do the party lifestyle
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   and you want to have that young, intense experience,
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   then I think Miami is a great fit.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   If you have an affinity for Latin culture,
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   then I think Miami is a great fit.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   If you want to live the downtown lifestyle,
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   you want to live in brickle towers or something like that,
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   or you want to have a great downtown penthouse and go to heat games
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   or walking across the street to the American Airlines Arena,
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   et cetera, then that's great.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   And if you've got all the money in the world
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   and you want to move on to one of the private islands
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   and just kind of have that full Miami lifestyle,
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   then I think Miami is good for that.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   So moving north, you get into Broward.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   Broward has all those same benefits of the beaches and whatnot,
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   but Broward is where you start to get into
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   kind of more the retirement culture mixed with the business culture.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   So downtown Fort Lauderdale, you have lots of businesses,
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   lots of big opportunities with kind of that downtown region,
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   but then you start to get into the farms of housing communities.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   So the basic feature of South Florida is endless, endless,
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   endless suburban developments.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   It's all very car-centric.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   They're all very beautiful,
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   but you're going to be living in a suburban development
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   where you have a homeowners association, et cetera.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   That's just the lifestyle.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   And so if that appeals to you, you can find something in Broward,
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   and that's a good, you know, they're fits.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   Then it's all just variations on the same.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   Coming up through Boca, you can--I mean, there's options.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   Boca, West Palm Beach, and then you get into northern West Palm Beach
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   and moving into Jupiter.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   So as you get to West Palm Beach,
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   you start to have less traffic, less congestion, and more options.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   Prices go down quite a lot because of that basic factor of the Everglades,
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   but they're still a lot higher than they are farther north
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   in, say, Palm City, et cetera.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   So you get--so I like West Palm Beach
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   because I think you get the best of both worlds.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   In West Palm Beach, especially now as kind of the downtown has developed,
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   you get basically everything you want in a big city
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   but without the oppressive constancy of Miami.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   And so you can get out of it pretty quickly and you can get into it.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   It's just not as intense as the giant interchanges of the highway in Miami.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   And then north of West Palm Beach,
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   you can start to get into a much more laid-back culture.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   You go up to Hobe Sound, et cetera, and you can be genuinely rural.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   Or you can live--you know, Martin County, if you want to live on the water
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   but you want to have it a very kind of quiet lifestyle,
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   Martin County, Stewart, Palm City, et cetera,
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   there's just so many little enclaves that are really, really wonderful.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   So I think central and northern Palm Beach County
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   are probably some of the ideal scenarios
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   because you can access the business of West Palm Beach.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   You can access the beaches.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   You can access Broward and Miami fairly easily.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   When you want to fly in and out,
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   you've got three great airports for domestic connections.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   Palm Beach International is very, very convenient.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   And then for international connections,
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   Fort Lauderdale and Miami are both wonderful airports.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   And so there's my kind of lay of the land.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   It's just a matter of saying, "Is this the lifestyle that we want?"
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   And, you know, beyond--I mean, that's my overview,
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   but I think it's a great region.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   Great. Thank you, Joshua.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   We'll definitely look around when we're down there
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   and think about our options. Appreciate it.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   Yeah, my pleasure.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   We move on to Pennsylvania.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   Welcome to the show. How can I serve you today?
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   Hello, Joshua. Thank you for taking my call.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   So I had a question about when, if ever,
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   does it make sense to make double payments on your mortgage
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   or when to invest in a property
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   to lower your interest that you're paying over time?
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   So I bought a property recently,
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   and I'm using the upstairs as a rental unit.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   And in coordination with a side business I have,
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   that pretty much covers the cost of the mortgage.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   So--well, mortgage and utility.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   With that in mind,
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   at what point should I be investing--
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   like, diversifying into the property
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   versus just stocks and other investments?
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   What interest rate is your mortgage?
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   That's 5.625%.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   Okay.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   Basically, the only reason that I can see--
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   be careful with that word "only."
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   Let me change that adjective to "major."
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   The major reasons that I can see
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   that you should make double payments on your mortgage are these.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   The first is if making that extra payment
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   is personally motivating to you.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   What I mean is, every single month,
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   do you find that you're willing to work extra,
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   or do you find that you're willing to lower your consumption
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   in some other area because of the tangibility
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   of making that extra mortgage payment?
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   This is what is, I think, the most important reason,
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   is that if you are going to--
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   if making the extra--
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   so let's say your mortgage payment is $2,000 a month,
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   or $1,500 a month,
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   and you're thinking of, "Should I put the $1,500 at--"
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   Sorry.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   Your standard mortgage payment is $1,500 a month.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   You have an extra $1,500 a month,
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   and you're thinking, "Should I put the money
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   "into a savings account or into an investment account,
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   "or should I put it into the mortgage?"
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   Generally speaking, if your stock account,
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   your 401(k) doesn't beat the rate of return
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   that you're going to make on your extra payment to the mortgage,
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   we're all done for.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   Everything breaks and falls apart.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   Even at 5.625%, I still think that that holds true.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   Now, it was easy for me to say that was 3%.
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   It may be harder when we're saying at about 8%,
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   but at the end of the day, your stocks in your 401(k)
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   have to substantially outperform mortgage payments,
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   or our entire financial system unhinges itself.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   Like, it's all--all of our assumptions are no longer valid.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   We're in a new era, which is possible.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   I don't think it's the case, but it's possible.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   And if you can't make more than 5.625% on your investments,
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   then, again, everything collapses.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   The financial question as to whether you should pay down debt
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   or invest the money is exclusively a question of interest rate,
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   of higher rate of return.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   So if you don't--your investment should exceed 5.625%,
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   which means that every single time you put that into a calculator,
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   you're better off investing the money than you are paying off debt.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   That's the math.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   But what the math often ignores is motivation.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   So a lot of people are not motivated to go and make an extra $1,500
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   so that they can invest the money at higher than 5.6%.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   Whereas a lot of times, having a clear, tangible goal of,
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   "I want my house paid off in 10 years.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   I want my house paid off by my 40th birthday."
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   This clarity of goal is motivating to people in a way
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   that the investment accumulation is not.
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   This motivation is enhanced by a couple of factors
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   that are unique about debt payoff.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   Number one, debt payoff is certain.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   You can be guaranteed of your 5.625% savings
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   when you lower your mortgage value.
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   Debt payoff is predictable.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   Your mortgage payment is going to go down, and you can model that.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   You can put a chart on your refrigerator, and you can say,
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   "See, by my 40th birthday, this house is going to be paid off."
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   That clarity of mind and intentionality can cause people
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   to make unbelievable improvements in their financial life,
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   spending less, making more because of that clarity.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   I don't experience, and I haven't seen people experience,
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   that same clarity when it comes to investment returns.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   That's because, number one, in the beginning,
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   your investment contributions are not going to lead to a number
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   that is going to cause you to see how it's a meaningful difference.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   Let's say that you get all motivated about putting your extra $1,500 a month
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   into your account, and you say, "Guess what?
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   By my 40th birthday, I'm going to have $250,000 in my 401(k),
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   whereas if I didn't do that, I would have $150,000 in my 401(k)."
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   Well, so what?
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   Now, obviously, that $100,000 is a lot of money,
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   but at the end of the day, you're not financially independent
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   with $250,000 in your 401(k).
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   It can pay off a lot when you're 65, if you have it in there at 40,
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   but it's going to take you a long time to see that.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   The other thing that's so difficult is you can't predict with certainty
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   what that actual account balance will be.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   So what if you're all motivated, and you're focusing,
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   and you're saving money, and you're putting that extra $1,500 in there,
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000]   and for some reason it's motivating and clear to you
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   that I'm going to have $250,000 in my 401(k) because of this sacrifice
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   that I'm making and the fact that I'm working this extra part-time job.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   And then along comes a random year in the stock market
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   where it goes down 20%.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   All of a sudden, your $250,000 account balance
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   that you were excited about drops to $160,000.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   And because of the ephemerality of that,
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   because of the fact that it's hard to connect with,
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   you're immediately like, "Well, they're going to want my goal."
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000]   Now, we all know that maybe the next year you'll be super happy
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   because it'll come up 20%, and all of a sudden you're looking great.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   But that certainty that you have with paying off debt, etc.,
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   is a really powerful, powerful movement.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   So the third factor I would say is,
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   is there something that not having a mortgage payment
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   is going to allow you to do that if you had the mortgage payment
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   you wouldn't otherwise allow yourself to do?
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   I think in reality, as I've argued publicly,
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   which I assume you've heard,
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   I think in general you're always better off with the money in the bank
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   rather than no mortgage payment.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   If I could choose between having $100,000 in the bank
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   and a $150,000 mortgage
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   versus having a $0 in the bank and a $50,000 mortgage,
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   or even a $0 in the bank and a $0 mortgage,
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   I would choose the $100,000 in the bank
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000]   because I have freedom of decision in that situation
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   that I don't just by not having a mortgage payment.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   But sometimes having a $0 mortgage balance
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   does indeed open up new options in your thinking.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   And because it's so clear and so tangible,
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   you don't have to rely on financial engineering
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   and what your financial advisor tells you.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   You just know, "I don't have any bills."
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   That can allow you to sail the world.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   That can allow you to do those things that start a business
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   or have more children,
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   that you wouldn't otherwise do.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   So financially, you're almost certainly better off
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   in the long run investing the money
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   versus prepaying a mortgage.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   But motivationally, if the clarity and the focused nature
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000]   of prepaying the mortgage can cause you
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   to feel very motivated,
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   then that motivation is the X factor
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   that can't fit easily into a spreadsheet.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000]   But I'm convinced it's real.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   - Okay, thank you.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   Yeah, I wouldn't say it's about a motivational thing.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   It would be more the math equation of rate of return
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   over the past year in the market
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   and in the situation we're at with the stock market.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   So whether spreading that money out
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000]   into something other than just retirement account
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   and stocks and bonds is an important factor to consider.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   But no, I think I'll just look for other areas
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   to improve that rate of return versus the mortgage.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   So thanks for your time.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   - Yeah, if the businesses that you can buy
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   in the stock market don't give you,
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   on the aggregate, a higher rate of return
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   than paying down a mortgage on a piece of property,
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   our entire financial system is upended
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   and we will be in genuinely a new era,
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   regardless of what the one-year returns are.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   To me, that's just an obvious truth.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   Our entire system of finance is based upon the idea
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   that businesses are going to be productive.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   Now, if that changes, we're in a brave new world.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   Missouri, welcome to the show.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   How can I serve you today?
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   St. Louis, Missouri.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   314-- - Hey, Joshua, you hear me?
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   - Yep, no, go ahead.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   - Good deal.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   My wife and I got married last year
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   in honor for our one-year anniversary.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   We're taking a European trip,
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   and as part of that trip,
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   we're going to spend four to five days in Malta.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   I know you had been there previously.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   I think it was last year,
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   maybe the year before, on your family travels,
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   and just wanted to get your opinion about it
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000]   and if you had any recommendations while I was there
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   relating to touristy things to do
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   and any international plan B or backup plans,
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000]   anything you have would be great.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   - It's funny.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   It's such an out-of-the-way place.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   You're the second or third time
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   I've gotten questions about Malta,
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   and it's such an unusual place.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   I went there because of my interest in their cryptocurrency.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   They want to become like Crypto Island,
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   and they have just some other interesting components of it,
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   but I also have been a lot of other places in Europe.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   It's an interesting place.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   So let's start with the tourist stuff.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   The tourist stuff is fairly straightforward.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000]   It's a beautiful Mediterranean island,
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000]   and have you found,
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.000]   do you already have your places to stay lined up?
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000]   - Yes, we do.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.000]   - Good, so you'll have a hotel or a resort or whatever,
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   and it's a fairly small place
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   that has just this really interesting history,
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   so you'll certainly want to spend at least a day or two
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   in the downtown Valletta area
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   because the history of that is really remarkable.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.000]   That is what is incredible about Malta,
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   is the long-term history.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   Downtown Valletta is so interesting.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   They have great tours,
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.000]   great insight into the history, et cetera.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   There is a city that is one of my favorite old cities,
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.000]   and I'll come up with a name in a moment
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   because it was formerly kind of the capital city refuge area.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   It's called the Medina Old City,
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000]   and one of the things that I think is interesting about Medina
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000]   is it's an old-walled city,
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   but it gives you an insight into the cities of the past,
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000]   and I was amazed from,
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   I really care about it from an architectural perspective,
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   meaning I'm fascinated by the stone architecture,
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   the narrow streets, how comfortable it is,
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   even in a blazing hot climate, et cetera,
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   and so make sure you spend time for a tour of Medina.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   There is also an interesting set of very old buildings.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000]   They claim, let's see, what is their claim?
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000]   The oldest human buildings in existence,
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000]   these old ruins, I forget what they are,
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000]   but they're very famous, world heritage sites,
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   these old ruins, I forget the name of them.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   That's also worth accessing.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   You can access all of these things on the public bus system.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   They have a public bus system that covers the entire island of Malta,
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   and then you can, of course, go over to the other island of Gozo.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   Malta is made up of basically five islands,
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   two of which are inhabited,
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:23.000]   but you can go to Gozo if you want to go and experience that as well.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   Then Malta has several kind of well-known tourist attractions,
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   all of which are easily booked.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000]   They have the Blue Grotto,
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.000]   this amazing old caves that you can travel into,
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   and then they have various sightseeing things to go and spend a day
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   in the Blue Lagoon and some of the other stuff that they have.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   So five days, you can fill up five days with those activities
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:54.000]   in a very straightforward way, and it's perfectly accessible.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   Those are the recommended.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.000]   I've done all those, and those are the recommended activities.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000]   In terms of transportation, again,
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   you can get around the entire city on the bus system,
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000]   and they have scooters and whatnot that you can rent and ride as well.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   You mentioned Plan B.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:15.000]   Were you interested in other things more than just tourist stuff?
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   Yeah, I had done a little bit of research as far as a residence is concerned,
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000]   that kind of thing.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:28.000]   It seemed pretty expensive for if you were just to invest and give a bunch of money.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:35.000]   I think one option that I read up on was to buy like a $325,000 piece of real estate.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   That would get you access, but I'm not in the situation to do that right now.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   Right.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000]   It was just a general question.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:48.000]   If there was anything like Canada opening a foreign bank account,
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000]   that kind of thing, that you have in mind.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000]   Yeah. I don't recommend Malta for banking.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   I do recommend Malta for a lot of Plan B stuff,
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   but it is all premium-level Plan B.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:06.000]   So what Malta is most well-known for in the international circles
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000]   is their Citizenship by Investment program.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000]   For those who have the almost seven figures,
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   it is the best way to get yourself a very, very quick,
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000]   very, very doable Plan B citizenship.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.000]   Malta calls it their exceptional citizenship program.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   Basically, the way it works is you go to Malta,
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:34.000]   you make a very large donation directly to the Maltese government,
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.000]   you rent or buy property on the island,
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   you make some other donations, etc.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000]   It comes out to just under, basically, just a little bit less than a million dollars,
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.000]   and you and your family can all become Maltese citizens.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:54.000]   As Maltese citizens, you now have a Grade A citizenship
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   that allows you to travel the world, live and work in Europe, etc.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000]   The problem is the price tag.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.000]   It's about an 18-month process to do the entire thing,
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000]   but in 18 months you can be a European citizen.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   For those who are interested in that and who have the money,
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000]   I would say you should move fast.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.000]   One of the things that is, that this particular program
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:24.000]   has been under attack since it was incepted.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.000]   And there have been other programs in Europe previously,
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:34.000]   and the pressure from the European Union has caused all of those programs to close.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000]   Previously Cyprus, etc., some other countries had these kinds of programs.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   Malta is the last remaining program.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   Interestingly, just this morning we received news from the nation of Portugal
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.000]   that Portugal has cancelled its Golden Visa program.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   The Portuguese Golden Visa has been an extremely attractive option
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   that many, many Americans and global citizens have taken advantage of
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000]   to go to Portugal, purchase real estate in Portugal,
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   and be granted a visa to live in Portugal.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000]   That visa can eventually lead to citizenship.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000]   I use this just as an example to say that these things close.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000]   For those who have the almost seven figures,
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.000]   and that makes sense for you to simply purchase a second citizenship,
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000]   and you want one that gives you incredible global freedom,
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000]   travel access, as well as the ability to live anywhere in the European Union,
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000]   Malta is the ticket, and you probably should get on it quickly,
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000]   because we don't know how long it will last.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   Now coming back from that, Malta also has a Golden Visa program,
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   and so that's what you're referring to,
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.000]   is that you could invest a lot less than a million dollars,
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000]   several hundred thousand dollars, and you can get residency rights in Malta.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000]   In addition, Malta has several attractive tax programs,
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000]   including for some people to situate a company there,
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.000]   and/or for your personal residence to be there.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:02.000]   But all of those are at the top levels of income and significantly expensive.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   So unless that makes sense for your business life,
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000]   I would just focus on enjoying my vacation much more
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:14.000]   than I would focus on doing any kind of that level plan B stuff.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000]   That's great. Thanks so much for all my questions.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.000]   Enjoy your trip. While you are there, where are you flying in from?
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000]   We're actually spending a few days in Italy first.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:30.000]   We'll be flying into Rome, and then we're going to travel down to Naples.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.000]   Then we actually catch a flight from Naples to Malta,
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:40.000]   and then after four days we'll fly out to London.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:44.000]   Okay. Wonderful. So you can fly.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.000]   There is also a ferry, so you can take a ferry,
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000]   depending on how much time you have.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000]   One of the things that I think is super interesting is
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000]   you can take a ferry across from Malta to Sicily,
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:00.000]   and then you can take the train from Sicily up into Italy, to Rome,
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.000]   so back either way, and then you can also, of course, take it across Europe.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:09.000]   Then there are also a couple of interesting inexpensive flights that are from Malta.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000]   Ryanair has a flight that you can go to Israel on Ryanair,
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.000]   pretty inexpensively from Malta, and also to Turkey.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.000]   So if you have more time, once you're in Malta,
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000]   there are some interesting inexpensive flight destinations
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000]   that you can exploit as well.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000]   But enjoy it. It's a really fascinating time.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:32.000]   Let me make one book suggestion for you that I read with my children
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.000]   that you may enjoy, and I'll give you the title.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:43.000]   There is a book called A Knight of St. John,
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.000]   A Tale of the Siege of Malta.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.000]   So it's called A Knight of St. John, A Tale of the Siege of Malta
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.000]   by Captain F.S. Brereton.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.000]   And this is a remarkably--it's a very interesting book.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.000]   Brereton is a very unknown author.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.000]   G.A. Henty is the one who gets all the attention
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000]   for his historical novels, but Brereton is a really interesting novel.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000]   Captain Brereton.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.000]   And this particular book talks about the siege of Malta
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.000]   from the--I think it was the 1400s--with the Turks.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000]   And it talks a lot about the interesting history
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000]   of the Knights of St. John.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.000]   While you are there in Malta, you will tour
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000]   some of the establishments of the Knights of St. John.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000]   They're now known as--they were known as the Hospitallers,
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:41.000]   and they're also known as the Sovereign Order of Malta.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000]   And they moved from there.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000]   So this is a really fascinating bit of history,
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:53.000]   where originally many of the Christian crusaders
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:58.000]   went out from Europe, and they went to the Holy Land
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000]   on the Crusades.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000]   And while they were on the Holy Land,
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000]   they wanted to participate in very--while they were there,
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.000]   they saw the need of these charitable works.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:15.000]   And they started to create this--again,
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000]   I think it was called the Hospitallers' Order
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000]   or something like that.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.000]   And if you go and you read about the Order of Malta,
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000]   you'll see the whole history.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:33.000]   But while they were there, they established--
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000]   so they established these charitable works,
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000]   and they started focusing on establishing hospitals
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000]   and whatnot, providing care.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000]   Anyway, long story short, they wound up setting up
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000]   a base at Rhodes.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000]   And then there was the siege of Rhodes,
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000]   and then all of the knights were driven from Rhodes
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000]   eventually to Malta.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.000]   And then while they were in Malta,
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:58.000]   they were later attacked by the Muslims from Turkey.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:03.000]   And it was just this incredible--just these incredible battles.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000]   So one of the fascinating things about Malta
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000]   is that basically it has been attacked by everyone.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000]   Because of its strategic location,
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.000]   sitting right there in the Caribbean,
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:20.000]   then they've been attacked by the Turks, the French.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000]   They were attacked in World War II.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000]   There's an incredible history of their resilience
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000]   in World War II, et cetera.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.000]   And so there has been a constant history of siege
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.000]   by all of the surrounding nations who've wanted to control
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000]   this very strategic island right in the middle
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000]   of the Caribbean.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.000]   So back to the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000]   It's a super interesting organization
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:47.000]   because it is a sovereign country that for many decades,
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000]   at least decades, had no land.
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.000]   And so Sovereign Military Order of Malta,
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000]   which has nothing to do with the current day--
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.000]   sorry, not nothing to do, but is not the Maltese government
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:03.000]   of the nation of Malta--is a country,
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000]   it's an independent state that does not have land.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.000]   It's a UN state.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000]   Now, they now have a building that they work in,
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.000]   and it's a very small thing,
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000]   but it's a Catholic fraternal order that is dedicated
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000]   to charitable works all around the world,
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000]   especially hospitals, et cetera.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.000]   So if you read a little bit in advance before you go,
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000]   I think it'll help you to appreciate things
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000]   a little bit more.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000]   And my children really enjoyed that book called
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000]   A Night of St. John, as far as it's an adventure story,
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000]   and they really enjoyed it because then you can go
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000]   and you can see how everything develops.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000]   That would be my literary recommendation for you
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.000]   in advance of your trip.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000]   >> Well, thank you.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000]   I'll be sure to be up on it.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   >> My pleasure.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.000]   And with that, we come to the end of our Q&A show.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000]   Thank you for bringing me a great and interesting set
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000]   of questions.
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.000]   I've enjoyed it very much.
