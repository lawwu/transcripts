[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040]   The following is a conversation with Manolis Kellis,
[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.360]   his third time on the podcast.
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.480]   He's a professor at MIT
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.200]   and head of the MIT Computational Biology Group.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.200]   This time we went deep on the science, biology and genetics.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.800]   So this is a bit of an experiment.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.360]   Manolis went back and forth between the basics of biology
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.320]   to the latest state of the art in the research.
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.120]   He's a master at this.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.080]   So I just sat back and enjoyed the ride.
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.440]   This conversation happened at 7 a.m.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.400]   So it's yet another podcast episode
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.160]   after an all-nighter for me.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.000]   And once again, since the universe has a sense of humor,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.400]   this one was a tough one for my brain to keep up,
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.240]   but I did my best and I never shy away from good challenge.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.680]   Quick mention of each sponsor,
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.560]   followed by some thoughts related to the episode.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.320]   First is SEMrush, the most advanced SEO optimization tool
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.200]   I've ever come across.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.240]   I don't like looking at numbers,
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.040]   but someone probably should.
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.360]   It helps you make good decisions.
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.740]   Second is Pessimist Archive.
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.840]   They're back.
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.760]   One of my favorite history podcasts
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.100]   on why people resist new things,
[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.600]   from recorded music to umbrellas, to cars,
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.120]   chess, coffee, and the elevator.
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.200]   Third is 8sleep, a mattress that cools itself,
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.160]   measures heart rate variability, has an app,
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.160]   and has given me yet another reason
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.400]   to look forward to sleep,
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.760]   including the all-important power nap.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.800]   And finally, BetterHelp, online therapy
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.440]   when you want to face your demons
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.280]   with a licensed professional,
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.000]   not just by doing the David Goggins-like physical challenges
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.900]   like I seem to do on occasion.
[00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.160]   Please check out these sponsors in the description

[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.080]   As a side note, let me say that biology in the brain
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.300]   and in the various systems of the body fill me with awe
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.900]   every time I think about how such a chaotic mess
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.400]   coming from its humble origins in the ocean
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.640]   was able to achieve such incredibly complex
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.200]   and robust mechanisms of life that survived
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.440]   despite all the forces of nature that want to destroy it.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.200]   It is so unlike the computing systems
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.680]   we humans have engineered that it makes me feel
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.120]   that in order to create artificial general intelligence
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.920]   and artificial consciousness,
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.440]   we may have to completely rethink
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.480]   how we engineer computational systems.

[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.700]   And now, here's my conversation with Manolis Callas.
[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.120]   So your group at MIT is trying to understand
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.760]   the molecular basis of human disease.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.360]   What are some of the biggest challenges in your view?
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.320]   - Don't get me started.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.440]   I mean, understanding human disease
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.100]   is the most complex challenge in modern science.
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.100]   So because human disease is as complex as the human genome,
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.200]   it is as complex as the human brain,
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.720]   and it is in many ways even more complex
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.240]   because the more we understand disease complexity,
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.920]   the more we start understanding genome complexity
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.920]   and epigenome complexity and brain circuitry complexity
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.160]   and immune system complexity and cancer complexity
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.180]   and so on and so forth.
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.000]   So traditionally, human disease
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.320]   was following basic biology.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.040]   You would basically understand basic biology
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.920]   and model organisms like mouse and fly and yeast.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.960]   You would understand sort of mammalian biology
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.280]   and animal biology and eukaryotic biology
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.480]   in sort of progressive layers of complexity,
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.640]   getting closer to human phylogenetically.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.600]   And you would do perturbation experiments in those species
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.800]   to see if I knock out a gene, what happens?
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.280]   And based on the knocking out of these genes,
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.440]   you would basically then have a way to drive human biology
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.880]   because you would sort of understand
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.840]   the functions of these genes.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.880]   And then if you find that a human gene, locus,
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.680]   something that you've mapped from human genetics
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.960]   to that gene is related to a particular human disease,
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.240]   you'd say, aha, now I know the function of the gene
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.440]   from the model organisms.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.000]   I can now go and understand the function
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.440]   of that gene in human.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.200]   But this is all changing.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.360]   This is dramatically changed.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.720]   So that was the old way of doing basic biology.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.360]   You would start with the animal models,
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.120]   the eukaryotic models, the mammalian models,
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.360]   and then you would go to human.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.060]   Human genetics has been so transformed
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.420]   in the last decade or two that human genetics
[00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.300]   is now actually driving the basic biology.
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.960]   There is more genetic mutation information
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.480]   in the human genome than there will ever be
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.120]   in any other species.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.400]   - What do you mean by mutation information?
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.360]   - So perturbations is how you understand systems.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.080]   So an engineer builds systems,
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.240]   and then they know how they work from the inside out.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.300]   A scientist studies systems through perturbations.
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.280]   You basically say, if I poke that balloon,
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.120]   what's gonna happen?
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.760]   And I'm gonna film it in super high resolution,
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.280]   understand, I don't know, air dynamics or fluid dynamics,
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.840]   if it's filled with water, et cetera.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.160]   So you can then make experimentation by perturbation.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.420]   And then the scientific process is sort of building models
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:40.000]   that best fit the data, designing new experiments
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.120]   that best test your models and challenge your models
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.280]   and so on and so forth.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.520]   That's the same thing with science.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.840]   Basically, if you're trying to understand
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.560]   biological science, you basically want to do perturbations
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.560]   that then drive the models.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.080]   - So how do these perturbations
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.280]   allow you to understand disease?
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.360]   - So if you know that a gene is related to disease,
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.760]   you don't wanna just know that it's related to the disease.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.320]   You wanna know what is the disease mechanism
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.900]   because you wanna go and intervene.
[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.800]   So the way that I like to describe it
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.800]   is that traditionally, epidemiology,
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.280]   which is basically the study of disease,
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.820]   sort of the observational study of disease,
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.720]   has been about correlating one thing with another thing.
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.240]   So if you have a lot of people with liver disease
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.240]   who are also alcoholics, you might say,
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.720]   well, maybe the alcoholism is driving the liver disease,
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.120]   or maybe those who have liver disease
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.760]   self-medicate with alcohol.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.940]   So the connection could be either way.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.520]   With genetic epidemiology,
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.600]   it's about correlating changes in the genome
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.680]   with phenotypic differences,
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.040]   and then you know the direction of causality.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.120]   So if you know that a particular gene
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.160]   is related to the disease,
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.760]   you can basically say, okay,
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.080]   perturbing that gene in mouse
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.720]   causes the mice to have X phenotype.
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.280]   So perturbing that gene in human
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.180]   causes the humans to have the disease.
[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.360]   So I can now figure out
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.680]   what are the detailed molecular phenotypes
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.240]   in the human that are related
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.760]   to that organismal phenotype in the disease.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.280]   So it's all about understanding disease mechanism,
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.840]   understanding what are the pathways,
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.440]   what are the tissues,
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.320]   what are the processes that are associated with the disease
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.920]   so that we know how to intervene.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.320]   You can then prescribe particular medications
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.300]   that also alter these processes.
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.260]   You can prescribe lifestyle changes
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.020]   that also affect these processes, and so on and so forth.
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.960]   - That's such a beautiful puzzle to try to solve,
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.400]   like what kind of perturbations
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.960]   eventually have this ripple effect
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.000]   that leads to disease across the population.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.340]   And then you study that for animals or mice first,
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:54.520]   and then see how that might possibly connect to humans.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.600]   How hard is that puzzle of trying to figure out
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.260]   how little perturbations might lead to,
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.960]   in a stable way, to a disease?
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:08.340]   - In animals, we make the puzzle simpler
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.920]   because we perturb one gene at a time.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.460]   That's the beauty of it, it's the power of animal models.
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.780]   You can basically decouple the perturbations.
[00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.860]   You only do one perturbation,
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.140]   and you only do strong perturbations at a time.
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:25.180]   In human, the puzzle is incredibly complex
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.700]   because, I mean, obviously,
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.500]   you don't do human experimentation.
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.780]   You wait for natural selection
[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.180]   and natural genetic variation
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.880]   to basically do its own experiments,
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.960]   which it has been doing for hundreds and thousands of years
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.720]   in the human population,
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.240]   and for hundreds of thousands of years
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:48.240]   across the history leading to the human population.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.700]   So you basically take this natural genetic variation
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.300]   that we all carry within us.
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.320]   Every one of us carries six million perturbations.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.480]   So I've done six million experiments on you,
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.880]   six million experiments on me,
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.940]   six million experiments on every one
[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.220]   of seven billion people on the planet.
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.620]   - What's the six million correspond to?
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:11.960]   - Six million unique genetic variants
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.620]   that are segregating the human population.
[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:19.620]   Every one of us carries millions of polymorphic sites,
[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.420]   poly, many, morph, forms.
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.020]   Polymorphic means many forms, variants.
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.900]   That basically means that every one of us
[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.420]   has single nucleotide alterations
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.780]   that we have inherited from mom and from dad
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.560]   that basically can be thought of
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.000]   as tiny little perturbations.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.720]   Most of them don't do anything,
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.620]   but some of them lead to all of the phenotypic differences
[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:43.900]   that we see between us.
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.040]   The reason why two twins are identical
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.100]   is because these variants completely determine
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.500]   the way that I'm gonna look at exactly 93 years of age.
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.680]   - How happy are you with this kind of data set?
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:59.420]   Is it large enough of the human population of Earth?
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:01.680]   Is that too big, too small?
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.680]   - Yeah, so is it large enough is a power analysis question.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.260]   And in every one of our grants,
[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.540]   we do a power analysis based on what is the effect size
[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.540]   that I would like to detect
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:18.540]   and what is the natural variation in the two forms.
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.220]   So every time you do a perturbation,
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.160]   you're asking I'm changing form A into form B.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.460]   Form A has some natural phenotypic variation around it
[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:31.140]   and form B has some natural phenotypic variation around it.
[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.140]   If those variances are large
[00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.860]   and the differences between the mean of A
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.200]   and the mean of B are small,
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.860]   then you have very little power.
[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:43.020]   The further the means go apart, that's the effect size,
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.420]   the more power you have,
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.300]   and the smaller the standard deviation,
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.700]   the more power you have.
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.620]   So basically when you're asking is that sufficiently large,
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.260]   certainly not for everything,
[00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.100]   but we already have enough power
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:59.220]   for many of the stronger effects
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.700]   in the more tight distributions.
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:02.860]   - So that's a hopeful message
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:07.300]   that there exists parts of the genome
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:12.300]   that have a strong effect that has a small variance.
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.140]   - That's exactly right.
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.100]   Unfortunately, those perturbations
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.700]   are the basis of disease in many cases.
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.540]   So it's not a hopeful message.
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.640]   Sometimes it's a terrible message.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.660]   It's basically, well, some people are sick,
[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.740]   but if we can figure out
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.980]   what are these contributors to sickness,
[00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.700]   we can then help make them better
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.420]   and help many other people better
[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.900]   who don't carry that exact mutation,
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.900]   but who carry mutations on the same pathways.
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:42.780]   And that's what we like to call the allelic series of a gene.
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.380]   You basically have many perturbations
[00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:49.180]   of the same gene in different people,
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:52.500]   each with a different frequency in the human population
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.520]   and each with a different effect
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.540]   on the individual that carries them.
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:58.460]   - So you said in the past,
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.740]   there would be these small experiments
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.780]   on perturbations in animal models.
[00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:08.300]   What does this puzzle-solving process look like today?
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.860]   - So we basically have something
[00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:12.420]   like seven billion people in the planet,
[00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:13.660]   and every one of them carries
[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.660]   something like six million mutations.
[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.660]   You basically have an enormous matrix
[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:22.960]   of genotype by phenotype
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.020]   by systematically measuring the phenotype
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.780]   of these individuals.
[00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:30.540]   And the traditional way of measuring this phenotype
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.660]   has been to look at one trait at a time.
[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.540]   You would gather families,
[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:38.260]   and you would sort of paint the pedigrees
[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.100]   of a strong effect,
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.840]   what we like to call Mendelian mutation.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.060]   So a mutation that gets transmitted
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.680]   in a dominant or a recessive,
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.220]   but strong effect form,
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.340]   where basically one locus plays a very big role
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.540]   in that disease.
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.900]   And you could then look at carriers versus non-carriers
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.220]   in one family,
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:01.100]   carriers versus non-carriers in another family,
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:04.300]   and do that for hundreds, sometimes thousands of families,
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.580]   and then trace these inheritance patterns,
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.500]   and then figure out what is the gene that plays that role.
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.340]   - Is this the matrix that you're showing
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:14.340]   in talks or lectures?
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:18.940]   - So that matrix is the input
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:20.980]   to the stuff that I show in talks.
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.060]   So basically that matrix
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.940]   has traditionally been strong effect genes.
[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.780]   What the matrix looks like now
[00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.540]   is instead of pedigrees, instead of families,
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.820]   you basically have thousands,
[00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:34.100]   and sometimes hundreds of thousands
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.100]   of unrelated individuals,
[00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.020]   each with all of their genetic variants,
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.820]   and each with their phenotype,
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.740]   for example, height, or lipids,
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:46.180]   or whether they're sick or not for a particular trait.
[00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.740]   That has been the modern view.
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.300]   Instead of going to families,
[00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.260]   we're going to unrelated individuals
[00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.780]   with one phenotype at a time.
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:56.980]   And what we're doing now,
[00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:00.460]   as we're maturing in all of these sciences,
[00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.300]   is that we're doing this in the context
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.780]   of large medical systems,
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:08.180]   or enormous cohorts that are very well phenotyped
[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.820]   across hundreds of phenotypes,
[00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.780]   sometimes with our complete electronic health record.
[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.500]   So you can now start relating
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.220]   not just one gene, segregating one family,
[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.820]   not just thousands of variants,
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.860]   segregating with one phenotype,
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.900]   but now you can do millions of variants
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.020]   versus hundreds of phenotypes.
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.300]   And as a computer scientist,
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.540]   I mean, deconvolving that matrix,
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:35.340]   partitioning it into the layers of biology
[00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.500]   that are associated with every one of these elements
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.780]   is a dream come true.
[00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.860]   It's like the world's greatest puzzle.
[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.340]   And you can now solve that puzzle
[00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:48.540]   by throwing in more and more knowledge
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:52.740]   about the function of different genomic regions
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:56.300]   and how these functions are changed across tissues
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.100]   and in the context of disease.
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.740]   And that's what my group and many other groups are doing.
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.340]   We're trying to systematically relate
[00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:05.900]   this genetic variation with molecular variation
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.380]   at the expression level of the genes,
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:12.700]   at the epigenomic level of the gene regulatory circuitry,
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.260]   and at the cellular level
[00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.020]   of what are the functions that are happening in those cells,
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:20.340]   at the single cell level, using single cell profiling,
[00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:23.620]   and then relate all that vast amount of knowledge
[00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:27.500]   computationally with the thousands of traits
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:31.460]   that each of these of thousands of variants are perturbing.
[00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:32.900]   - I mean, this is something we talked about,
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.220]   I think, last time.
[00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.460]   So there's these effects at different levels that happen.
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.780]   You said at a single cell level,
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.460]   you're trying to see things that happen
[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.700]   due to certain perturbations.
[00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.740]   And then, it's not just like a puzzle
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:49.460]   of perturbation and disease.
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:53.420]   It's perturbation, then effect at a cellular level,
[00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.780]   then at an organ level, at a body,
[00:15:55.780 --> 00:16:00.020]   like how do you disassemble this
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.420]   into what your group is working on?
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.340]   You're basically taking a bunch of the hard problems
[00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:06.500]   in the space.
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.660]   How do you break apart a difficult disease
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:14.140]   and break it apart into puzzles
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.440]   that you can now start solving?
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.100]   - So there's a struggle here.
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.660]   Computer scientists love hard puzzles.
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.820]   And they're like, "Oh, I wanna build a method
[00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.620]   that just deconvolves the whole thing computationally."
[00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:28.420]   And that's very tempting and it's very appealing,
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.540]   but biologists just like to decouple
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:32.980]   that complexity experimentally,
[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.940]   to just like peel off layers of complexity experimentally.
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.780]   And that's what many of these modern tools
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:41.540]   that my group and others have both developed and used.
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:44.500]   The fact that we can now figure out tricks
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.780]   for peeling off these layers of complexity
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.780]   by testing one cell type at a time,
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.740]   or by testing one cell at a time.
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.100]   And you could basically say,
[00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.880]   what is the effect of these genetic variants
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.140]   associated with Alzheimer's on human brain?
[00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:02.520]   Human brain sounds like, oh, it's an organ, of course,
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.200]   just go one organ at a time.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.920]   But human brain has, of course,
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.420]   dozens of different brain regions.
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.200]   And within each of these brain regions,
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.500]   dozens of different cell types.
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.660]   And every single type of neuron,
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.820]   every single type of glial cell,
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:20.540]   between astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia,
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:25.540]   between all of the neural cells and the vascular cells
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:29.520]   and the immune cells that are co-inhabiting the brain
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.660]   between the different types of excitatory
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.360]   and inhibitory neurons that are sort of interacting
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.340]   with each other between different layers of neurons
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:39.020]   in the cortical layers.
[00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:44.020]   Every single one of these has a different type of function
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:49.380]   to play in cognition, in interaction with the environment,
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:54.140]   in maintenance of the brain, in energetic needs,
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:58.300]   in feeding the brain with blood, with oxygen,
[00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:01.460]   in clearing out the debris that are resulting
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.780]   from the super high energy production
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.820]   of cognition in humans.
[00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:09.580]   So all of these things are basically
[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:15.200]   potentially deconvolvable computationally,
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:19.140]   but experimentally, you can just do single cell profiling
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.060]   of dozens of regions of the brain
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.420]   across hundreds of individuals, across millions of cells.
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:28.100]   And then now you have pieces of the puzzle
[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.060]   that you can then put back together
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:33.180]   to understand that complexity.
[00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.100]   - I mean, first of all, I mean, the human brain,
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.740]   the cells in the human brain are the most,
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.500]   okay, maybe I'm romanticizing it,
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.340]   but cognition seems to be very complicated.
[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:45.900]   So separating into the function,
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:52.780]   breaking Alzheimer's down to the cellular level
[00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.560]   seems very challenging.
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:59.540]   Is that basically you're trying to find a way
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:04.540]   that some perturbation in genome results
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:10.220]   in some obvious major dysfunction in the cell?
[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:14.340]   You're trying to find something like that.
[00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.180]   - Exactly.
[00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.900]   So what does human genetics do?
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.580]   Human genetics basically looks at the whole path
[00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:22.260]   from genetic variation all the way to disease.
[00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:26.660]   So human genetics has basically taken thousands
[00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:31.660]   of Alzheimer's cases and thousands of controls
[00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:36.700]   matched for age, for sex, for environmental backgrounds
[00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.320]   and so on and so forth.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.640]   And then looked at that map where you're asking
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.540]   what are the individual genetic perturbations
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.940]   and how are they related to all the way
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:48.360]   to Alzheimer's disease?
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.200]   And that has actually been quite successful.
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.820]   So we now have more than 27 different loci,
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:57.780]   these are genomic regions that are associated
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:02.340]   with Alzheimer's at this end to end level.
[00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:05.180]   But the moment you sort of break up that very long path
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:09.700]   into smaller levels, you can basically say from genetics,
[00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:12.380]   what are the epigenomic alterations
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.240]   at the level of gene regulatory elements?
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.660]   Where that genetic variant perturbs
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:19.060]   the control region nearby.
[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:20.580]   That effect is much larger.
[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.500]   - You mean much larger in terms of
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:25.460]   this down the line impact?
[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:28.100]   - It's much larger in terms of the measurable effect.
[00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:33.100]   This A versus B variance is actually so much cleanly defined
[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:35.660]   when you go to the shorter branches.
[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:39.380]   Because for one genetic variant to affect Alzheimer's,
[00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:40.740]   that's a very long path.
[00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.940]   That basically means that in the context of millions
[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:45.500]   of these six million variants that every one of us carries,
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:49.340]   that one single nucleotide has a detectable effect
[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.300]   all the way to the end.
[00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.620]   I mean, it's just mind boggling that that's even possible.
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:55.940]   - That's crazy. - But indeed, yeah.
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.540]   But indeed, there are such effects.
[00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:01.420]   - So the hope is, or the most, scientifically speaking,
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:03.900]   the most effective place where to detect
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.460]   the alteration that results in disease
[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.700]   is earlier on in the pipeline, as early as possible.
[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.620]   - It's a trade off.
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.860]   If you go very early on in the pipeline,
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.680]   now each of these epigenomic alterations,
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.460]   for example, this enhancer control region,
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:25.420]   is active maybe 50% less, which is a dramatic effect.
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:27.340]   Now you can ask, well, how much does changing
[00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.340]   one regulatory region in the genome
[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.260]   in one cell type change disease?
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:32.700]   Well, that path is now long.
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:37.640]   So if you instead look at expression,
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.140]   the path between genetic variation
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:40.420]   and the expression of one gene
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.700]   goes through many enhancer regions,
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.500]   and therefore it's a subtler effect at the gene level.
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:49.620]   But then now you're closer because one gene is acting
[00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.300]   in the context of only 20,000 other genes,
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.700]   as opposed to one enhancer acting
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.320]   in the context of 2 million other enhancers.
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.020]   So you basically now have genetic,
[00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:03.140]   epigenomic, the circuitry, transcriptomic,
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:06.580]   the gene expression level, and then cellular,
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:07.500]   where you can basically say,
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.980]   I can measure various properties of those cells.
[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:15.060]   What is the calcium influx rate
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.380]   when I have this genetic variation?
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:19.580]   What is the synaptic density?
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.700]   What is the electric impulse conductivity?
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:24.380]   And so on and so forth.
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:29.380]   So you can measure things along this path to disease,
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:32.560]   and you can also measure endophenotypes.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:37.380]   You can basically measure your brain activity.
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:39.580]   You can do imaging in the brain.
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.180]   You can basically measure, I don't know,
[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:43.140]   the heart rate, the pulse, the lipids,
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:46.540]   the amount of blood secreted, and so on and so forth.
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.740]   And then through all of that,
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:52.300]   you can basically get at the path to causality,
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.480]   the path to disease.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:57.540]   - And is there something beyond cellular?
[00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:01.340]   So you mentioned lifestyle interventions
[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:03.340]   or changes as a way to,
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:07.740]   or like be able to prescribe changes in lifestyle.
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.240]   Like what about organs?
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:13.220]   What about like the function of the body as a whole?
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:14.060]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.020]   So basically, when you go to your doctor,
[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.140]   they always measure your pulse.
[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.260]   They always measure your height.
[00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.380]   They always measure your weight, your BMI.
[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.980]   So basically, these are just very basic variables.
[00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:26.300]   But with digital devices nowadays,
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:27.900]   you can start measuring hundreds of variables
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.500]   for every individual.
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.980]   You can basically also phenotype cognitively
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:37.180]   through tests, Alzheimer's patients.
[00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:38.940]   There are cognitive tests that you can measure,
[00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:43.620]   that you typically do for cognitive decline,
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:46.060]   these mini mental observations
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.420]   that you have specific questions to.
[00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:49.940]   You can think of sort of enlarging
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:51.860]   the set of cognitive tests.
[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:53.020]   So in the mouse, for example,
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:55.580]   you do experiments for how do they get out of mazes?
[00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:57.100]   How do they find food?
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.160]   Whether they recall a fear,
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.300]   whether they shake in a new environment,
[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:02.340]   and so on and so forth.
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.900]   In the human, you can have much, much richer phenotypes,
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.340]   where you can basically say,
[00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:10.680]   not just imaging at the organ level,
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.740]   but, and all kinds of other activities at the organ level,
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:17.540]   but you can also do at the organism level,
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.360]   you can do behavioral tests.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.980]   And how did they do on empathy?
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:22.740]   How did they do on memory?
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.780]   How did they do on long-term memory
[00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:26.020]   versus short-term memory?
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:26.860]   And so on and so forth.
[00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:28.740]   - I love how you're calling that phenotype.
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:30.900]   I guess it is. - It is.
[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.500]   - But like your behavior patterns
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:36.060]   that might change over a period of a life.
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.700]   Your ability to remember things,
[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:42.620]   your ability to be, yeah, empathetic or emotionally,
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.940]   or your intelligence, perhaps even.
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.940]   - Yeah, but intelligence has hundreds of variables.
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:48.380]   You can be your math intelligence,
[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:49.460]   your literary intelligence,
[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.300]   your puzzle-solving intelligence, your logic.
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.780]   It could be like hundreds of things.
[00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:55.660]   - And all of that, we're able to measure that
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:56.500]   better and better.
[00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.820]   And all of that could be connected to the entire pipeline.
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:01.180]   - We used to think of each of these as a single variable,
[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:02.020]   like intelligence.
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:03.180]   I mean, that's ridiculous.
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:06.600]   It's basically dozens of different genes
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:10.780]   that are controlling every single variable.
[00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:12.340]   You can basically think of,
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.060]   imagine us in a video game
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:17.620]   where every one of us has measures of strength,
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:20.840]   stamina, energy left, and so on and so forth.
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.060]   But you could click on each of those five bars
[00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:24.120]   that are just the main bars,
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:27.020]   and each of those will just give you then hundreds of bars.
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:27.980]   And you can basically say,
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:31.180]   "Okay, great, for my machine learning task,
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:34.280]   "I want someone who, a human,
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:37.200]   "who has these particular forms of intelligence.
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.500]   "I require now these 20 different things."
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.240]   And then you can combine those things
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.580]   and then relate them to, of course,
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:46.180]   performance in a particular task.
[00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:49.420]   But you can also relate them to genetic variation
[00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:52.700]   that might be affecting different parts of the brain.
[00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.260]   For example, your frontal cortex
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:55.460]   versus your temporal cortex
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:57.920]   versus your visual cortex, and so on and so forth.
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:01.060]   So genetic variation that affects expression of genes
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.540]   in different parts of your brain
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:05.120]   can basically affect your music ability,
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.460]   your auditory ability, your smell,
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:11.340]   your, you know, just dozens of different phenotypes
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:14.100]   can be broken down into, you know,
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.780]   hundreds of cognitive variables,
[00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:19.060]   and then relate each of those to thousands of genes
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:20.880]   that are associated with them.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:24.640]   - So somebody who loves RPGs, role-playing games,
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:28.340]   there's too few variables that we can control.
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:31.180]   So I'm excited, if we're in fact living in a simulation,
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:32.560]   this is a video game,
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.700]   I'm excited by the quality of the video game.
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:39.620]   The game designer did a hell of a good job,
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.020]   so we're impressed.
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.460]   - So I don't know, the sunset last night
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:43.620]   was a little unrealistic.
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.060]   (both laughing)
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.020]   - Yeah, yeah, the graphics.
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:47.860]   - Exactly.
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:48.860]   - Come on, Nvidia.
[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:50.900]   To zoom back out, we've been talking about
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:53.980]   the genetic origins of diseases,
[00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:57.140]   but I think it's fascinating to talk about
[00:26:57.140 --> 00:27:00.780]   what are the most important diseases to understand,
[00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:03.360]   and especially as it connects to the things
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.220]   that you're working on.
[00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.460]   - So it's very difficult to think about
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:08.820]   important diseases to understand.
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:10.260]   There's many metrics of importance.
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.100]   One is lifestyle impact.
[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:14.300]   I mean, if you look at COVID,
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.380]   the impact on lifestyle has been enormous.
[00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:18.500]   So understanding COVID is important
[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:22.040]   because it has impacted the wellbeing
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.620]   in terms of ability to have a job,
[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:25.660]   ability to have an apartment,
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:26.920]   ability to go to work,
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:30.580]   ability to have a mental circle of support,
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:33.540]   and all of that for millions of Americans,
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:35.460]   like huge, huge impact.
[00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:36.980]   So that's one aspect of importance.
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:38.780]   So basically mental disorders,
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.060]   Alzheimer's has a huge importance
[00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:43.740]   in the wellbeing of Americans.
[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:46.000]   Whether or not it kills someone,
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.140]   for many, many years, it has a huge impact.
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:51.900]   So the first measure of importance is just wellbeing.
[00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.540]   - Impact on the quality of life.
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.780]   - Impact on the quality of life, absolutely.
[00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:58.420]   The second metric, which is much easier to quantify,
[00:27:58.420 --> 00:27:59.860]   is deaths.
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:01.860]   - What is the number one killer?
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.700]   - The number one killer is actually heart disease.
[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:08.940]   It is actually killing 650,000 Americans per year.
[00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:14.100]   Number two is cancer, with 600,000 Americans.
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:17.440]   Number three, far, far down the list, is accidents.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.520]   Every single accident combined.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.100]   So basically you read the news, accidents,
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:25.700]   like there was a huge car crash, all over the news.
[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:30.700]   But the number of deaths, number three by far, 167,000.
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:33.660]   Lower respiratory disease, so that's asthma,
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:37.900]   not being able to breathe, and so on and so forth, 160,000.
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:42.300]   Alzheimer's, number five, with 120,000.
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.940]   And then stroke, brain aneurysms, and so on and so forth,
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:46.700]   that's 147,000.
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:51.080]   Diabetes and metabolic disorders, et cetera, that's 85,000.
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:53.540]   The flu, a 60,000.
[00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:56.060]   Suicide, 50,000.
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:58.140]   And then overdose, et cetera,
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:00.080]   you know, goes further down the list.
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.720]   So of course, COVID has creeped up
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:04.820]   to be the number three killer this year,
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:09.820]   with more than 100,000 Americans, and counting.
[00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:14.500]   And, you know, but if you think about sort of
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.020]   what do we use, what are the most important diseases,
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:20.460]   you have to understand both the quality of life,
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.820]   and the just sheer number of deaths,
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:25.100]   and just numbers of years lost, if you wish.
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:28.820]   - And each of these diseases you can think of as,
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.900]   and also including terrorist attacks,
[00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:32.600]   and school shootings, for example,
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:36.600]   things which lead to fatalities,
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:41.060]   you can look at as problems that could be solved.
[00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:44.900]   And some problems are harder to solve than others.
[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:46.740]   I mean, that's part of the equation.
[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:48.620]   So maybe if you look at these diseases,
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:53.100]   if you look at heart disease, or cancer, or Alzheimer's,
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:56.700]   or just like schizophrenia, and obesity,
[00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.620]   that'd be like, not necessarily things that kill you,
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.620]   but affect the quality of life.
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:04.940]   Which problems are solvable, which aren't,
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.300]   which are harder to solve, which aren't?
[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.780]   - I love your question, because it puts it in the context
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:14.780]   of a global effort, rather than just a local effort.
[00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:19.580]   So basically, if you look at the global aspect,
[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:22.620]   exercise and nutrition are two interventions
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:26.080]   that we can, as a society, make a much better job at.
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:28.900]   So if you think about sort of the availability
[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:32.900]   of cheap food, it's extremely high in calories,
[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:34.780]   it's extremely detrimental for you,
[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:36.860]   like a lot of processed food, et cetera.
[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:40.900]   So if we change that equation, and as a society,
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:44.340]   we made availability of healthy food much, much easier,
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:48.500]   and charged a burger at McDonald's,
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.520]   the price that it costs on the health system,
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:56.260]   then people would actually start buying more healthy foods.
[00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:58.660]   So basically, that's sort of a societal intervention,
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:30:59.500]   if you wish.
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:03.980]   In the same way, increasing empathy, increasing education,
[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:08.020]   increasing the social framework and support
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.960]   would basically lead to fewer suicides,
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.800]   it would lead to fewer murders,
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:15.740]   it would lead to fewer deaths overall.
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:18.540]   So that's something that we as a society can do.
[00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.800]   You can also think about external factors
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:21.900]   versus internal factors.
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.700]   So the external factors are basically communicable diseases,
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:26.960]   like COVID, like the flu, et cetera.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:31.780]   And the internal factors are basically things like cancer
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:34.260]   and Alzheimer's, where basically your genetics
[00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:36.580]   will eventually drive you there.
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:41.620]   And then of course, with all of these factors,
[00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:44.480]   every single disease has both a genetic component
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.100]   and environmental component.
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:49.580]   So heart disease, huge genetic contribution.
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:54.580]   Alzheimer's, it's like 60% plus genetic.
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:58.960]   So I think it's like 79% heritability.
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:01.560]   So that basically means that genetics alone
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:06.040]   explains 79% of Alzheimer's incidence.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:10.240]   And yes, there's a 21% environmental component
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:15.240]   where you could basically enrich your cognitive environment,
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:19.420]   enrich your social interactions, read more books,
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:21.900]   learn a foreign language, go running,
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.680]   sort of have a more fulfilling life.
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.640]   All of that will actually decrease Alzheimer's,
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.360]   but there's a limit to how much that can impact
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:31.200]   because of the huge genetic footprint.
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.040]   - So this is fascinating.
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:36.720]   So each one of these problems have a genetic component
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.760]   and an environment component.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.240]   And so when there's a genetic component,
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.000]   what can we do about some of these diseases?
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.760]   What have you worked on?
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:47.160]   What can you say that's in terms of problems
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.400]   that are solvable here or understandable?
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.800]   - So my group works on the genetic component,
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.040]   but I would argue that understanding the genetic component
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.560]   can have a huge impact even on the environmental component.
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:00.560]   Why is that?
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:03.440]   Because genetics gives us access to mechanism.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.520]   And if we can alter the mechanism,
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.680]   if we can impact the mechanism,
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.600]   we can perhaps counteract
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.000]   some of the environmental components.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:11.960]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:15.720]   - So understanding the biological mechanisms
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.300]   leading to disease is extremely important
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.700]   in being able to intervene.
[00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:22.920]   But when you can intervene,
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:27.320]   the analogy that I like to give is, for example, for obesity.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.280]   Think of it as a giant bathtub of fat.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:32.920]   There's basically fat coming in from your diet
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:36.640]   and there's fat coming out from your exercise.
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:40.120]   That's an in-out equation.
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.100]   And that's the equation that everybody's focusing on.
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:47.100]   But your metabolism impacts that bathtub.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:50.460]   Basically, your metabolism controls
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:52.980]   the rate at which you're burning energy.
[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:55.620]   It controls the rate at which you're storing energy.
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:34:01.180]   And it also teaches you about the various valves
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:03.900]   that control the input and the output equation.
[00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:08.020]   So if we can learn from the genetics, the valves,
[00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:09.920]   we can then manipulate those valves.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:14.100]   And even if the environment is feeding you a lot of fat
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:15.960]   and getting a little of that out,
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.180]   you can just poke another hole at the bathtub
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:19.900]   and just get a lot of the fat out.
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:21.680]   - Yeah, that's fascinating.
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:25.700]   Yeah, so we're not just passive observers of our genetics.
[00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:26.860]   The more we understand,
[00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:29.540]   the more we can come up with actual treatments.
[00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:33.080]   - And I think that's an important aspect to realize.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:36.180]   When people are thinking about strong effect
[00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:37.980]   versus weak effect variants.
[00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.520]   So some variants have strong effects.
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:41.300]   We talked about these Mendelian disorders
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:43.980]   where a single gene has a sufficiently large effect,
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:46.400]   penetrance, expressivity, and so on and so forth,
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:50.760]   that basically you can trace it in families
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:53.160]   with cases and not cases, cases not cases,
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:54.960]   and so on and so forth.
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:58.320]   But even the, you know, but,
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.280]   so these are the genes that everybody says,
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.920]   oh, that's the genes we should go after
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.920]   because that's a strong effect gene.
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.600]   I like to think about it slightly differently.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:11.040]   These are the genes where genetic impacts
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.940]   that have a strong effect were tolerated.
[00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:17.500]   Because every single time we have a genetic association
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.040]   with disease, it depends on two things.
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.880]   Number one, the obvious one,
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:24.500]   whether the gene has an impact on the disease.
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.220]   Number two, the more subtle one,
[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:30.300]   is whether there is genetic variation
[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.180]   standing and circulating and segregating
[00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:36.400]   in the human population that impacts that gene.
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:41.000]   Some genes are so darn important
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.360]   that if you mess with them even a tiny little amount,
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.360]   that person's dead.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.940]   So those genes don't have variation.
[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:51.100]   You're not gonna find a genetic association
[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:52.960]   if you don't have variation.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.380]   That doesn't mean that the gene has no role.
[00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:56.460]   It simply that the gene,
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:59.060]   it simply means that the gene tolerates no mutations.
[00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:00.420]   - So that's actually a strong signal
[00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:01.380]   when there's no variation.
[00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:03.260]   That's so fascinating. - Exactly.
[00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:06.740]   Genes that have very little variation are hugely important.
[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:08.900]   You can actually rank the importance of genes
[00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.700]   based on how little variation they have.
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:13.700]   And those genes that have very little variation
[00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:16.740]   but no association with disease,
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:18.140]   that's a very good metric to say,
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:19.840]   oh, that's probably a developmental gene
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.780]   because we're not good at measuring those phenotypes.
[00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:25.100]   So it's genes that you can tell evolution
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:27.280]   has excluded mutations from,
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.940]   but yet we can't see them associated
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:32.040]   with anything that we can measure nowadays.
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:34.380]   It's probably early embryonic lethal.
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:36.000]   - What are all the words you just said?
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.140]   Early embryonic what?
[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:38.260]   - Lethal.
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:39.100]   - Meaning?
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:39.920]   - Meaning that--
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:40.760]   - If you don't have that, then--
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:41.580]   - If you don't have that, you'll die.
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:42.420]   - Okay.
[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.980]   There's a bunch of stuff that is required
[00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:48.380]   for a stable functional organism--
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:49.700]   - Exactly. - Across the board.
[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:51.900]   - Exactly. - For our entire,
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:53.840]   for an entire species, I guess.
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:58.540]   - If you look at sperm, it expresses thousands of proteins.
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:01.000]   Does sperm actually need thousands of proteins?
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.060]   No, but it's probably just testing them.
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:06.460]   So my speculation-- - Early on.
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:09.500]   - Is that misfolding of these proteins
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.880]   is an early test for failure.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:16.440]   So that out of the millions of sperm that are possible,
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.120]   you select the subset that are just not
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:21.840]   grossly misfolding thousands of proteins.
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:25.560]   - So it's kind of an assert that this is folded correctly.
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:26.400]   - Correct.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:29.520]   - Yeah, this, just because if this little thing
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:32.380]   about the folding of a protein isn't correct,
[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:34.520]   that probably means somewhere down the line
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:35.560]   there's a bigger issue.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:37.480]   - That's exactly right, so fail fast.
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:41.080]   So basically if you look at the mammalian investment
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:45.880]   in a newborn, that investment is enormous
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:47.600]   in terms of resources.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:52.600]   So mammals have basically evolved mechanisms for fail fast.
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:56.400]   Where basically in those early months of development,
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.680]   I mean, it's horrendous, of course, at the personal level
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:03.320]   when you lose your future child,
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:08.320]   but in some ways there's so little hope
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:11.100]   for that child to develop and sort of make it
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:12.920]   through the remaining months that sort of fail fast
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:16.360]   is probably a good evolutionary principle.
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.480]   - Yeah, from an evolutionary perspective.
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:22.100]   - For mammals, and of course humans have a lot
[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:24.780]   of medical resources that you can sort of give
[00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:26.720]   those children a chance.
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:31.720]   And we have so much more success in sort of giving folks
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:35.400]   who have these strong carrier mutations a chance,
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:36.640]   but if they're not even making it
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:39.740]   through the first three months, we're not gonna see them.
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:43.580]   So that's why when we say what are the most important genes
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:46.840]   to focus on, the ones that have a strong effect mutation
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.200]   or the ones that have a weak effect mutation,
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.280]   well, the jury might be out,
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.920]   because the ones that have a strong effect mutation
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:58.640]   are basically not mattering as much.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:01.040]   The ones that only have weak effect mutations,
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:04.720]   by understanding through genetics
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.120]   that they have a weak effect mutation
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.860]   and understanding that they have a causal role
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:11.280]   on the disease, we can then say, okay, great,
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:14.700]   evolution has only tolerated a 2% change in that gene.
[00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:19.480]   Pharmaceutically, I can go in and induce a 70% change
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.320]   in that gene.
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:24.800]   And maybe I will poke another hole at the bathtub
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:29.800]   that was not easy to control in many of the studies
[00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:35.060]   in many of the other strong effect genetic variants.
[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:39.980]   - So there's this beautiful map across the population
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:42.660]   of things that you're saying strong and weak effects,
[00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:44.880]   so stuff with a lot of mutations
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:48.260]   and stuff with little mutations, with no mutations.
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:51.320]   And you have this map and it lays out the puzzle.
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.420]   - Yeah, so when I say strong effect,
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:56.020]   I mean at the level of individual mutations.
[00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:58.900]   So basically genes where,
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:03.120]   so you have to think of first the effect of the gene
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:03.960]   on the disease.
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:07.100]   Remember how I was sort of painting that map earlier
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:09.060]   from genetics all the way to phenotype.
[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:14.140]   That gene can have a strong effect on the disease,
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:16.880]   but the genetic variant might have a weak effect
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.840]   on the gene.
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:22.440]   So basically when you ask what is the effect
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:24.880]   of that genetic variant on the disease,
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.200]   it could be that that genetic variant impacts the gene
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:30.920]   by a lot, and then the gene impacts the disease by a little,
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:32.440]   or it could be that the genetic variant
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:33.600]   impacts the gene by a little,
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.800]   and then the gene impacts the disease by a lot.
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:40.800]   So what we care about is genes that impact the disease a lot,
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:43.560]   but genetics gives us the full equation.
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:48.120]   And what I would argue is if we couple the genetics
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:51.960]   with expression variation,
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.720]   to basically ask what genes change by a lot,
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:41:01.240]   and which genes correlate with disease by a lot,
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.560]   even if the genetic variants change them by a little,
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.760]   then those are the best places to intervene.
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:10.360]   Those are the best places where pharmaceutically,
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:12.680]   if I have even a modest effect,
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:15.240]   I will have a strong effect on the disease.
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:16.280]   Whereas those genetic variants
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.200]   that have a huge effect on the disease,
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:20.480]   I might not be able to change that gene by this much
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.760]   without affecting all kinds of other things.
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:23.600]   - Interesting.
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:25.320]   So yeah, okay, so that's what we're looking at.
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.720]   And what have we been able to find
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:31.920]   in terms of which disease could be helped?
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:34.960]   - Again, don't get me started.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:38.840]   This is, we have found so much.
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:43.520]   Our understanding of disease has changed so dramatically
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:46.040]   with genetics.
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.880]   I mean, places that we had no idea would be involved.
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:51.720]   So one of the worst things about my genome
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:53.520]   is that I have a genetic predisposition
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:56.440]   to age-related macular degeneration, AMD.
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:59.080]   So it's a form of blindness that causes you
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.680]   to lose the central part of your vision
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:03.400]   progressively as you grow older.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:06.240]   My increased risk is fairly small.
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.560]   I have an 8% chance.
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:09.480]   You only have a 6% chance.
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:11.120]   - You, I'm an average.
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:12.080]   - Yeah.
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:14.440]   - By the way, when you say my, you mean literally yours.
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:15.880]   You know this about you.
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:17.880]   - I know this about me, yeah.
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:22.600]   - Which is kind of, I mean, philosophically speaking
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:26.240]   is a pretty powerful thing to live with.
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:29.280]   Maybe that's, so we agreed to talk again, by the way,
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:32.480]   for the listeners to where we're gonna try to focus
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:35.920]   on science today and a little bit of philosophy next time.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:40.480]   But it's interesting to think about
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.600]   the more you're able to know about yourself
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:45.960]   from the genetic information in terms of the diseases,
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.760]   how that changes your own view of life.
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:51.960]   - Yeah, so there's a lot of impact there.
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:55.960]   And there's something called genetic exceptionalism,
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:58.120]   which basically thinks of genetics
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:01.120]   as something very, very different than everything else
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:03.760]   as a type of determinism.
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:07.280]   And, you know, let's talk about that next time.
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:08.880]   So basically-- - That's a good preview.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.000]   - Yeah.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.640]   So let's go back to AMD.
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:16.640]   So basically with AMD, we have no idea what causes AMD.
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:20.080]   You know, it was a mystery
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:23.600]   until the genetics were worked out.
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:27.160]   And now the fact that I know that I have a predisposition
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:30.480]   allows me to sort of make some life choices, number one.
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:34.920]   But number two, the genes that lead to that predisposition
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:37.360]   give us insights as to how does it actually work.
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:40.800]   And that's a place where genetics
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.920]   gave us something totally unexpected.
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:46.400]   So there's a complement pathway,
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.840]   which is an immune function pathway
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:52.400]   that was in, you know,
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:55.880]   most of the loci associated with AMD.
[00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:57.600]   And that basically told us that, wow,
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:02.520]   there's an immune basis to this eye disorder
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:05.120]   that people had just not expected before.
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.760]   If you look at complement,
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:09.640]   it was recently also implicated in schizophrenia.
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:13.960]   And there's a type of microglia
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.960]   that is involved in synaptic pruning.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.960]   So synapses are the connections between neurons.
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:22.680]   And in this whole use it or lose it view
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:26.840]   of mental cognition and other capabilities,
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:31.200]   you basically have microglia, which are immune cells
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.720]   that are sort of constantly traversing your brain
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:36.160]   and then pruning neuronal connections,
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:39.080]   pruning synaptic connections that are not utilized.
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:42.600]   So in schizophrenia,
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:47.040]   there's thought to be a change in the pruning
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.480]   that basically if you don't prune your synapses
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:50.960]   the right way,
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.720]   you will actually have an increased role of schizophrenia.
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:56.320]   This is something that was completely unexpected
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:57.160]   for schizophrenia.
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.960]   Of course, we knew it has to do with neurons,
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:01.280]   but the role of the complement complex,
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.760]   which is also implicated in AMD,
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:05.400]   which is now also implicated in schizophrenia,
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:06.280]   was a huge surprise.
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:07.920]   - What's the complement complex?
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:11.160]   - So it's basically a set of genes, the complement genes,
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:15.320]   that are basically having various immune roles.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:16.440]   And as I was saying earlier,
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.520]   our immune system has been co-opted
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:21.040]   for many different roles across the body.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:23.400]   So they actually play many diverse roles.
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:26.360]   - And somehow the immune system is connected
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:28.200]   to the synaptic pruning process.
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:29.120]   - Exactly. - The process of it.
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:29.960]   - Exactly.
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:33.080]   So immune cells were co-opted to prune synapses.
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:34.280]   - How did you figure this out?
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:35.640]   (laughing)
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:40.200]   How does one go about figuring this intricate connection,
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:42.040]   like pipeline of connections out?
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:43.840]   - Yeah, let me give you another example.
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:45.960]   So Alzheimer's disease,
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:48.200]   the first place that you would expect it to act
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:49.680]   is obviously the brain.
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.280]   So we had basically this
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:56.800]   roadmap epigenomics consortium view of the human epigenome,
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:59.080]   the largest map of the human epigenome
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:00.720]   that has ever been built,
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:05.680]   across 127 different tissues and samples
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.800]   with dozens of epigenomic marks
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:10.440]   measured in hundreds of donors.
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:13.520]   So what we've basically learned through that
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.840]   is that you basically can map
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:18.040]   what are the active gene regulatory elements
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:20.200]   for every one of the tissues in the body.
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:25.080]   And then we connected these gene regulatory active maps
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:28.360]   of basically what regions of the human genome
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:31.920]   are turning on in every one of different tissues.
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.440]   We then can go back and say,
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:37.480]   where are all of the genetic loci
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.160]   that are associated with disease?
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:41.720]   This is something that my group,
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:45.160]   I think was the first to do back in 2010
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:48.640]   in this Ernst Nature Biotech paper.
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.960]   But basically we were for the first time able to show
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.160]   that specific chromatin states,
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.560]   specific epigenomic states,
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.160]   in that case enhancers,
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:00.640]   were in fact enriched in disease associated variants.
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:02.240]   We pushed that further
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:05.440]   in the Ernst Nature paper a year later,
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:08.920]   and then in this roadmap epigenomics paper,
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:11.320]   a few years after that.
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:15.120]   But basically that matrix that you mentioned earlier
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:17.320]   was in fact the first time that we could see
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:21.160]   what genetic traits have genetic variants
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:25.040]   that are enriched in what tissues in the body.
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:28.640]   And a lot of that map made complete sense.
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:31.440]   If you looked at a diversity of immune traits,
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:34.720]   like allergies and type 1 diabetes and so on and so forth,
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:37.800]   you basically could see that they were enriching,
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:40.120]   that the genetic variants associated with those traits
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:42.960]   were enriched in enhancers,
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:44.600]   in these gene regulatory elements,
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:46.520]   active in T cells and B cells
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:49.040]   and hematopoietic stem cells and so on and so forth.
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:54.040]   So that basically gave us a confirmation in many ways
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:56.880]   that those immune traits were indeed
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:58.840]   enriching in immune cells.
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:02.480]   If you looked at type 2 diabetes,
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:06.000]   you basically saw an enrichment in only one type of sample,
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.880]   and it was pancreatic islets.
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:10.760]   And we know that type 2 diabetes
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:14.680]   sort of stems from the dysregulation of insulin
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:17.200]   in the beta cells of pancreatic islets.
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.920]   And that sort of was spot on, super precise.
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:22.680]   If you looked at blood pressure,
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.760]   where would you expect blood pressure to occur?
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:27.800]   You know, I don't know, maybe in your metabolism,
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:30.160]   in ways that you process coffee or something like that,
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:32.360]   maybe in your brain, the way that you stress out
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:34.240]   and increases your blood pressure, et cetera.
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:37.240]   What we found is that blood pressure localized specifically
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:40.280]   in the left ventricle of the heart.
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:42.680]   So the enhancers of the left ventricle in the heart
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:44.160]   contained a lot of genetic variants
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:45.760]   associated with blood pressure.
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:48.320]   If you look at height,
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.480]   we found an enrichment specifically
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:52.280]   in embryonic stem cell enhancers.
[00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:54.800]   So the genetic variants predisposing you
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:56.400]   to be taller or shorter
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:59.320]   are in fact acting in developmental stem cells.
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:01.280]   Makes complete sense.
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:03.400]   If you looked at inflammatory bowel disease,
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:06.640]   you basically found inflammatory, which is immune,
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:09.760]   and also bowel disease, which is digestive.
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:12.000]   And indeed, we saw a double enrichment,
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.680]   both in the immune cells and in the digestive cells.
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:16.880]   So that basically told us that,
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.880]   aha, this is acting in both components.
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.360]   There's an immune component to inflammatory bowel disease
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:23.320]   and there's a digestive component.
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.840]   And the big surprise was for Alzheimer's.
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:28.120]   We had seven different brain samples.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:33.120]   We found zero enrichment in the brain samples
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:36.080]   for genetic variants associated with Alzheimer's.
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:37.880]   And this is mind boggling.
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:39.760]   Our brains were literally hurting.
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.560]   What is going on?
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:44.520]   And what is going on is that the brain samples
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:49.520]   are primarily neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:52.920]   in terms of the cell types that make them up.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:56.480]   So that basically indicated that genetic variants
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:50:00.520]   associated with Alzheimer's were probably not acting
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:04.400]   in oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, or neurons.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.240]   So what could they be acting in?
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:09.560]   Well, the fourth major cell type is actually microglia.
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:13.680]   Microglia are resident immune cells in your brain.
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:14.520]   - Oh, nice.
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:17.320]   The immune, oh, wow.
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:21.280]   - And they are CD14+, which is this sort of
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:24.080]   cell surface markers of those cells.
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:27.000]   So they're CD14+ cells, just like microphages
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.080]   that are circulating in your blood.
[00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:33.960]   The microglia are resident monocytes
[00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:35.560]   that are basically sitting in your brain.
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:38.280]   They're tissue-specific monocytes.
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:41.440]   And every one of your tissues, like your fat, for example,
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:43.680]   has a lot of macrophages that are resident.
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:46.720]   And the M1 versus M2 macrophage ratio
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:49.120]   has a huge role to play in obesity.
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:51.760]   And so basically, again, these immune cells are everywhere,
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.480]   but basically what we found,
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:56.080]   through this completely unbiased view
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:58.280]   of what are the tissues that likely
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:00.440]   underlie different disorders,
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:05.040]   we found that Alzheimer's was humongously enriched
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:08.960]   in microglia, but not at all in the other cell types.
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:11.080]   - So what are we supposed to make of that
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:14.720]   if you look at the tissues involved?
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:18.040]   Is that simply useful for indication
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:20.920]   of propensity for disease?
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:24.560]   Or does it give us somehow a pathway of treatment?
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:26.040]   - It's very much the second.
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:31.040]   If you look at the way to therapeutics,
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:33.760]   you have to start somewhere.
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:34.600]   What are you gonna do?
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:36.960]   You're gonna basically make assays
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:41.960]   that manipulate those genes and those pathways
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:43.680]   in those cell types.
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:46.640]   So before we know the tissue of action,
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:49.120]   we don't even know where to start.
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:50.960]   We basically are at a loss.
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:52.520]   But if you know the tissue of action,
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:55.240]   and even better, if you know the pathway of action,
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:58.160]   then you can basically screen your small molecules,
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:00.360]   not for the gene, you can screen them directly
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:03.080]   for the pathway in that cell type.
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:04.560]   So you can basically develop
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:08.880]   a high throughput multiplexed robotic system
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:12.960]   for testing the impact of your favorite molecules
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:14.800]   that you know are safe, efficacious,
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:18.800]   and sort of hit that particular gene, and so on and so forth.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.800]   You can basically screen those molecules
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:25.800]   against either a set of genes that act in that pathway,
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:29.640]   or on the pathway directly by having a cellular assay.
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:32.360]   And then you can basically go into mice and do experiments
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:33.800]   and basically sort of figure out ways
[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:36.280]   to manipulate these processes
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:38.520]   that allow you to then go back to humans
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:40.200]   and do a clinical trial that basically says,
[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:43.880]   okay, I was able indeed to reverse these processes in mice,
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:46.080]   can I do the same thing in humans?
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:49.080]   So the knowledge of the tissues
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:51.280]   gives you the pathway to treatment.
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:52.640]   But that's not the only part.
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:54.760]   There are many additional steps
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:56.960]   to figuring out the mechanism of disease.
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:58.760]   - I mean, so that's really promising.
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:01.760]   Maybe to take a small step back,
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:03.560]   you've mentioned all these puzzles
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:07.720]   that were figured out with the Nature paper for,
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:10.540]   I mean, you've mentioned a ton of diseases,
[00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:14.800]   from obesity to Alzheimer's, even schizophrenia,
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:15.840]   I think you mentioned.
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:20.640]   What is the actual methodology of figuring this out?
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:22.920]   - So indeed, I mentioned a lot of diseases,
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:25.760]   and my lab works on a lot of different disorders.
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:29.280]   And the reason for that is that
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:31.680]   if you look at the,
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:36.360]   if you look at biology,
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:39.560]   it used to be zoology departments
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:42.560]   and botanology departments and virology departments
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:43.400]   and so on and so forth.
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:45.160]   And MIT was one of the first schools
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:47.080]   to basically create a biology department,
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:49.520]   like, oh, we're gonna study all of life suddenly.
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:51.320]   Why was that even a case?
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:55.240]   Because the advent of DNA and the genome
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:58.520]   and the central dogma of DNA makes RNA makes protein,
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:00.620]   in many ways, unified biology.
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:04.360]   You could suddenly study the process of transcription
[00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:06.920]   in viruses or in bacteria
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:10.120]   and have a huge impact on yeast and fly
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:12.040]   and maybe even mammals,
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:14.600]   because of this realization
[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:16.440]   of these common underlying processes.
[00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:22.400]   And in the same way that DNA unified biology,
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:27.080]   genetics is unifying disease studies.
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:28.460]   So you used to have,
[00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:34.560]   you used to have, I don't know,
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:36.640]   cardiovascular disease department
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:40.120]   and neurological disease department
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:41.960]   and neurodegeneration department
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:46.960]   and basically immune and cancer and so on and so forth.
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:50.520]   And all of these were studied in different labs
[00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.640]   because it made sense,
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.240]   because basically the first step
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:56.440]   was understanding how the tissue functions
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:57.960]   and we kind of knew the tissues involved
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:00.560]   in cardiovascular disease and so on and so forth.
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:01.840]   But what's happening with human genetics
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:03.520]   is that all of that,
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:05.600]   all of these walls and edifices
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:08.280]   that we had built are crumbling.
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:11.680]   And the reason for that is that genetics
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:16.440]   is in many ways revealing unexpected connections.
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:19.080]   So suddenly we now have to bring the immunologists
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:20.300]   to work on Alzheimer's.
[00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:22.600]   They were never in the room.
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:24.640]   They were in another building altogether.
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:28.040]   The same way for schizophrenia,
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:30.440]   we now have to sort of worry about
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:33.060]   all these interconnected aspects.
[00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:34.300]   For metabolic disorders,
[00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:36.380]   we're finding contributions from brain.
[00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:38.920]   So suddenly we have to call the neurologist
[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:41.200]   from the other building and so on and so forth.
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:46.000]   So in my view, it makes no sense anymore
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.400]   to basically say, oh, I'm a geneticist
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:50.640]   studying immune disorders.
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:52.440]   I mean, that's ridiculous because,
[00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:54.280]   I mean, of course, in many ways,
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:56.260]   you still need to sort of focus.
[00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:59.240]   But what we're doing is that we're basically saying,
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:02.080]   we'll go wherever the genetics takes us.
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:05.580]   And by building these massive resources,
[00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:10.280]   by working on our latest maps, now 833 tissues,
[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:13.740]   sort of the next generation of the epigenomics roadmap,
[00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:17.880]   which we're now called EpiMap, is 833 different tissues.
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:21.140]   And using those, we've basically found enrichments
[00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:24.460]   in 540 different disorders.
[00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:26.200]   Those enrichments are not like, oh, great,
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:29.180]   you guys work on that and we'll work on this.
[00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:31.840]   They're intertwined amazingly.
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:34.500]   So of course there's a lot of modularity,
[00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:37.120]   but there's these enhancers that are sort of broadly active
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:39.500]   and these disorders that are broadly active.
[00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:41.820]   So basically some enhancers are active in all tissues
[00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:45.060]   and some disorders are enriching in all tissues.
[00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:47.740]   So basically there's these multifactorial
[00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:48.580]   and these other class,
[00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:51.420]   which I like to call polyfactorial diseases,
[00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:54.140]   which are basically lighting up everywhere.
[00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:59.140]   And in many ways, it's sort of cutting across these walls
[00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:01.640]   that were previously built across these departments.
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:03.980]   - And the polyfactorial ones were probably
[00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:06.180]   the previous structure departments
[00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:08.620]   wasn't equipped to deal with those.
[00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:12.860]   I mean, again, maybe it's a romanticized question,
[00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:16.780]   but there's in physics, there's a theory of everything.
[00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:19.740]   Do you think it's possible to move towards
[00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:22.520]   an almost theory of everything of disease
[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:24.020]   from a genetic perspective?
[00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:27.940]   So if this unification continues, is it possible that,
[00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:29.460]   like, do you think in those terms,
[00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:33.060]   like trying to arrive at a fundamental understanding
[00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:35.460]   of how disease emerges, period?
[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:40.460]   - That unification is not just foreseeable, it's inevitable.
[00:57:40.460 --> 00:57:43.440]   I see it as inevitable.
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:45.140]   We have to go there.
[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:49.660]   You cannot be a specialist anymore if you're a genomicist,
[00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:53.740]   you have to be a specialist in every single disorder.
[00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:58.260]   And the reason for that is that the fundamental understanding
[00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:00.780]   of the circuitry of the human genome
[00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:03.800]   that you need to solve schizophrenia,
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:08.020]   that fundamental circuitry is hugely important
[00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:09.500]   to solve Alzheimer's.
[00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:11.420]   And that same circuitry is hugely important
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:13.020]   to solve metabolic disorders.
[00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:16.940]   And that same exact circuitry is hugely important
[00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:19.340]   for solving immune disorders and cancer
[00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:22.180]   and every single disease.
[00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:26.580]   So all of them have the same sub task.
[00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:29.580]   And I teach dynamic programming in my class.
[00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:31.380]   Dynamic programming is all about sort of
[00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:36.380]   not redoing the work, it's reusing the work that you do once.
[00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:40.140]   So basically for us to say, oh, great,
[00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:41.780]   you guys in the immune building,
[00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:44.140]   go solve the fundamental circuitry of everything.
[00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:46.120]   And then you guys in the schizophrenia building
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:47.380]   go solve the fundamental circuitry
[00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:50.040]   of everything separately, is crazy.
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:52.700]   So what we need to do is come together
[00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:55.580]   and sort of have a circuitry group,
[00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:57.500]   the circuitry building that sort of tries
[00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:59.300]   to solve the circuitry of everything.
[00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:03.840]   And then the immune folks who will apply this knowledge
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:06.620]   to all of the disorders that are associated
[00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:09.080]   with immune dysfunction.
[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:12.500]   And the schizophrenia folks will basically interact
[00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:15.460]   with both the immune folks and with the neuronal folks.
[00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:16.780]   And all of them will be interacting
[00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:18.940]   with the circuitry folks and so on and so forth.
[00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:21.500]   So that's sort of the current structure of my group,
[00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:22.340]   if you wish.
[00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:24.180]   So basically what we're doing is focusing
[00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:25.700]   on the fundamental circuitry.
[00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:31.160]   But at the same time, we're the users of our own tools
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:34.860]   by collaborating with many other labs
[00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:37.460]   in every one of these disorders that we mentioned.
[00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:41.060]   We basically have a heart focus on cardiovascular disease,
[00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:44.220]   coronary artery disease, heart failure, and so on and so forth.
[00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:48.840]   We have an immune focus on several immune disorders.
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:53.840]   We have a cancer focus on metastatic melanoma
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:55.520]   and immunotherapy response.
[00:59:55.520 --> 01:00:00.360]   We have a psychiatric disease focus on schizophrenia,
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:04.060]   autism, PTSD, and other psychiatric disorders.
[01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:06.880]   We have an Alzheimer's and neurodegeneration focus
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:11.780]   on Huntington's disease, ALS, and AD-related disorders
[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:14.380]   like frontotemporal dementia and Lewy body dementia.
[01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:16.660]   And of course, a huge focus on Alzheimer's.
[01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:21.200]   We have a metabolic focus on the role of exercise and diet
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:26.200]   and sort of how they're impacting metabolic organs
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:28.980]   across the body and across many different tissues.
[01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:33.980]   And all of them are interfacing with the circuitry.
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:38.100]   And the reason for that is another computer science principle
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:40.640]   of eat your own dog food.
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:44.900]   If everybody ate their own dog food,
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:46.600]   dog food would taste a lot better.
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:51.720]   The reason why Microsoft Excel and Word and PowerPoint
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:55.140]   was so important and so successful
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:58.340]   is because the employees that were working on them
[01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:01.460]   were using them for their day-to-day tasks.
[01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:04.420]   You can't just simply build a circuitry and say,
[01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:07.060]   "Here it is, guys, take the circuitry, we're done,"
[01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:09.380]   without being the users of that circuitry
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:11.220]   because you then go back.
[01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:13.420]   And because we span the whole spectrum
[01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:17.420]   from profiling the epigenome, using comparative genomics,
[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:19.800]   finding the important nucleotides in the genome,
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:21.740]   building the basic functional map
[01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:24.500]   of what are the genes in the human genome,
[01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:27.620]   what are the gene regulatory elements of the human genome.
[01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:30.260]   I mean, over the years, we've written a series of papers
[01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:32.740]   on how do you find human genes in the first place,
[01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:34.060]   using comparative genomics.
[01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:36.940]   How do you find the motifs that are the building blocks
[01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:39.620]   of gene regulation, using comparative genomics?
[01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:43.060]   How do you then find how these motifs come together
[01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:46.220]   and act in specific tissues, using epigenomics?
[01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:50.980]   How do you link regulators to enhancers and enhancers
[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:52.220]   to their target genes,
[01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:55.220]   using epigenomics and regulatory genomics?
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:57.500]   So through the years, we've basically built
[01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:00.380]   all this infrastructure for understanding
[01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:03.700]   what I like to say, every single nucleotide
[01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:07.420]   of the human genome and how it acts in every one
[01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:10.500]   of the major cell types and tissues of the human body.
[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:12.020]   I mean, this is no small task.
[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:15.460]   This is an enormous task that takes the entire field.
[01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:18.060]   And that's something that my group has taken on,
[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:19.500]   along with many other groups.
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:23.100]   And we have also, and that sort of, I think,
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:24.780]   sets my group perhaps apart,
[01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:26.940]   we have also worked with specialists
[01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:28.820]   in every one of these disorders
[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:30.700]   to basically further our understanding
[01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:32.460]   all the way down to disease.
[01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:34.420]   And in some cases, collaborating with pharma
[01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:36.580]   to go all the way down to therapeutics
[01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:39.980]   because of our deep, deep understanding
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:41.140]   of that basic circuitry
[01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:46.500]   and how it allows us to now improve the circuitry,
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:49.060]   not just treat it as a black box,
[01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:50.300]   but basically go and say, okay,
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:53.620]   we need a better cell type specific wiring
[01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:56.420]   that we now have at the tissue specific level.
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:59.500]   So we're focusing on that because we're understanding
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:01.780]   the needs from the disease front.
[01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:04.060]   - So you have a sense of the entire pipeline.
[01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:07.940]   I mean, one, maybe you can indulge me,
[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:09.780]   one nice question to ask would be,
[01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:14.340]   how do you, from the scientific perspective,
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:17.340]   go from knowing nothing about the disease
[01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:22.060]   to going, you said, to going through the entire pipeline
[01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:25.260]   and actually have a drug or a treatment
[01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:26.740]   that cures that disease?
[01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:30.100]   - So that's an enormously long path
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:32.460]   and an enormously great challenge.
[01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:34.940]   And what I'm trying to argue is that
[01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:38.820]   it progresses in stages of understanding
[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:40.900]   rather than one gene at a time.
[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:42.740]   The traditional view of biology was
[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:44.860]   you have one postdoc working on this gene
[01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:47.460]   and another postdoc working on that gene.
[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:50.300]   And they'll just figure out everything about that gene.
[01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:51.940]   And that's their job.
[01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:54.500]   What we've realized is how polygenic
[01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:56.260]   the diseases are.
[01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:58.140]   So we can't have one postdoc per gene anymore.
[01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:03.140]   We now have to have these cross-cutting needs.
[01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:07.460]   And I'm gonna describe the path to circuitry
[01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:10.140]   along those needs.
[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:12.900]   And every single one of these paths,
[01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:16.860]   we are now doing in parallel across thousands of genes.
[01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:21.660]   So the first step is you have a genetic association.
[01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:24.740]   And we talked a little bit about sort of the Mendelian path
[01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:27.660]   and the polygenic path to that association.
[01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:30.020]   So the Mendelian path was looking through families
[01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:34.500]   to basically find gene regions and ultimately genes
[01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:36.740]   that are underlying particular disorders.
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:40.580]   The polygenic path is basically looking at
[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:43.220]   unrelated individuals in this giant matrix
[01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:44.940]   of genotype by phenotype,
[01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:47.940]   and then finding hits where a particular variant
[01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:51.300]   impacts disease all the way to the end.
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:53.900]   And then we now have a connection,
[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:56.700]   not between a gene and a disease,
[01:04:56.700 --> 01:05:00.100]   but between a genetic region and a disease.
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:03.460]   And that distinction is not understood by most people.
[01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:05.580]   So I'm gonna explain it a little bit more.
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:10.020]   Why do we not have a connection between a gene
[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:11.340]   and a disease, but we have a connection
[01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:13.380]   between a genetic region and a disease?
[01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:18.380]   The reason for that is that 93% of genetic variants
[01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:21.900]   that are associated with disease
[01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:25.220]   don't impact the protein at all.
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:29.940]   So if you look at the human genome, there's 20,000 genes.
[01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:32.100]   There's 3.2 billion nucleotides.
[01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:38.140]   Only 1.5% of the genome codes for proteins.
[01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:45.020]   The other 98.5% does not code for proteins.
[01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:49.460]   If you now look at where are the disease variants located,
[01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:55.700]   93% of them fall in that outside the genes portion.
[01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:57.340]   Of course, genes are enriched,
[01:05:57.340 --> 01:06:00.500]   but they're only enriched by a factor of three.
[01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:03.460]   That means that still 93% of genetic variants
[01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:05.700]   fall outside the proteins.
[01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:08.140]   Why is that difficult?
[01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:09.420]   Why is that a problem?
[01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:12.820]   The problem is that when a variant falls outside the gene,
[01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:16.860]   you don't know what gene is impacted by that variant.
[01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:19.220]   You can't just say, "Oh, it's near this gene.
[01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:20.860]   Let's just connect that variant to the gene."
[01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:24.340]   And the reason for that is that the genome circuitry
[01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:26.740]   is very often long range.
[01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:30.740]   So you basically have that genetic variant
[01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:34.500]   that could sit in the intron of one gene.
[01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:36.300]   And an intron is sort of the place
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:38.140]   between the exons that code for proteins.
[01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:41.300]   So proteins are split up into exons and introns,
[01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:43.740]   and every exon codes for a particular subset
[01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:46.860]   of amino acids, and together they're spliced together,
[01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:49.180]   and then make the final protein.
[01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:50.660]   So that genetic variant might be sitting
[01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:51.820]   in an intron of a gene.
[01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:53.620]   It's transcribed with the gene,
[01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:55.500]   it's processed and then excised,
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:57.140]   but it might not impact this gene at all.
[01:06:57.140 --> 01:06:59.500]   It might actually impact another gene
[01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:01.060]   that's a million nucleotides away.
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:02.380]   - So it's just riding along,
[01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:03.540]   even though it has nothing to do
[01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:05.820]   with this nearby neighborhood.
[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:07.580]   - That's exactly right.
[01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:09.580]   Let me give you an example.
[01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:12.380]   The strongest genetic association with obesity
[01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:15.660]   was discovered in this FTO gene,
[01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:18.340]   fat and obesity associated gene.
[01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:23.340]   So this FTO gene was studied ad nauseum.
[01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:26.700]   People did tons of experiments on it.
[01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:29.140]   They figured out that FTO is in fact
[01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:32.980]   RNA methylation trans rays.
[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:36.060]   It basically, it sort of impacts something
[01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:38.740]   that we know that we call the epitranscriptome,
[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:40.740]   just like the genome can be modified,
[01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:43.580]   the transcriptome, the transcripts of the genes
[01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:44.660]   can be modified.
[01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:46.620]   And we basically said, oh great,
[01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:48.500]   that means that epitranscriptomics
[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:49.980]   is hugely involved in obesity
[01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:53.740]   because that gene FTO is clearly
[01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:55.620]   where the genetic locus is at.
[01:07:55.620 --> 01:08:00.180]   My group studied FTO in collaboration
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:04.140]   with a wonderful team led by Melina Klausnitzer.
[01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:08.460]   And what we found is that this FTO locus,
[01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:11.740]   even though it is associated with obesity,
[01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:14.860]   does not implicate the FTO gene.
[01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:19.420]   The genetic variant sits in the first intron
[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:23.500]   of the FTO gene, but it controls two genes,
[01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:28.500]   IRX3 and IRX5, that are sitting 1.2 million nucleotides away,
[01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:31.860]   several genes away.
[01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:34.500]   - Oh boy.
[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:36.140]   When am I supposed to feel about that?
[01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:38.620]   Isn't that like super complicated then?
[01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:40.740]   - So the way that I was introduced at a conference
[01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:43.780]   a few years ago was, and here's Manolis Kellis
[01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:46.940]   who wrote the most depressing paper of 2015.
[01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:48.620]   (laughs)
[01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:49.780]   And the reason for that is that
[01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:52.180]   the entire pharmaceutical industry was so comfortable
[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:56.020]   that there was a single gene in that locus.
[01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:58.500]   Because in some loci, you basically have three dozen genes
[01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:01.340]   that are all sitting in the same region of association.
[01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:04.020]   And you're like, oh gosh, which ones of those is it?
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:06.780]   But even that question of which ones of those is it,
[01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:09.860]   is making the assumption that it is one of those,
[01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:12.860]   as opposed to some random gene just far, far away,
[01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:14.820]   which is what our paper showed.
[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:16.860]   So basically what our paper showed is that
[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:19.060]   you can't ignore the circuitry.
[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:21.060]   You have to first figure out the circuitry,
[01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:23.180]   all of those long range interactions,
[01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:25.780]   how every genetic variant impacts the expression
[01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:28.620]   of every gene in every tissue imaginable
[01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:30.780]   across hundreds of individuals.
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:33.980]   And then you now have one of the building blocks,
[01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:35.660]   not even all of the building blocks,
[01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:39.340]   for then going and understanding disease.
[01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:44.340]   - So okay, so embrace the wholeness of the circuitry.
[01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:45.500]   - Correct.
[01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:48.060]   - But what, so back to the question of starting
[01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:51.660]   knowing nothing to the disease and going to the treatment.
[01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:53.460]   So what are the next steps?
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:56.100]   - So you basically have to first figure out the tissue
[01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:57.980]   and then describe how you figure out the tissue.
[01:09:57.980 --> 01:09:59.260]   You figure out the tissue by taking
[01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:01.300]   all of these non-coding variants
[01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:03.220]   that are sitting outside proteins,
[01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:06.700]   and then figuring out what are the epigenomic enrichments.
[01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:10.220]   And the reason for that, thankfully,
[01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:12.420]   is that there is convergence,
[01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:17.060]   that the same processes are impacted in different ways
[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:18.180]   by different loci.
[01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:23.060]   And that's a saving grace for our field.
[01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:26.140]   The fact that if I look at hundreds of genetic variants
[01:10:26.140 --> 01:10:27.700]   associated with Alzheimer's,
[01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:30.860]   they localize in a small number of processes.
[01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:34.580]   - Can you clarify why that's hopeful?
[01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:36.860]   So they show up in the same exact way
[01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:40.180]   in the specific set of processes?
[01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:42.460]   - Yeah, so basically there's a small number
[01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:44.980]   of biological processes that underlie,
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:48.460]   or at least that play the biggest role in every disorder.
[01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:51.380]   So in Alzheimer's, you basically have
[01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:53.900]   maybe 10 different types of processes.
[01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:56.180]   One of them is lipid metabolism.
[01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:58.740]   One of them is immune cell function.
[01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:02.300]   One of them is neuronal energetics.
[01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:04.100]   So these are just a small number of processes,
[01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:06.940]   but you have multiple lesions,
[01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:08.580]   multiple genetic perturbations
[01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:10.860]   that are associated with those processes.
[01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:12.740]   So if you look at schizophrenia,
[01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:14.300]   it's excitatory neuron function,
[01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:15.620]   it's inhibitory neuron function,
[01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:17.780]   it's synaptic pruning, it's calcium signaling,
[01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:18.820]   and so on and so forth.
[01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:22.100]   So when you look at disease genetics,
[01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:24.580]   you have one hit here and one hit there
[01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:26.300]   and one hit there and one hit there,
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:28.100]   completely different parts of the genome.
[01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:30.100]   But it turns out all of those hits
[01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:32.340]   are calcium signaling proteins.
[01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:33.180]   - Oh, cool.
[01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:35.060]   - You're like, aha, that means
[01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:37.300]   that calcium signaling is important.
[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:39.940]   So those people who are focusing on one docus at a time
[01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:42.540]   cannot possibly see that picture.
[01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:44.500]   You have to become a genomicist.
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.940]   You have to look at the omics, the om,
[01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:51.220]   the holistic picture to understand these enrichments.
[01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:53.500]   - But you mentioned the convergence thing.
[01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:56.820]   So whatever the thing associated
[01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:58.300]   with the disease shows up.
[01:11:58.300 --> 01:11:59.700]   - So let me explain convergence.
[01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:01.780]   Convergence is such a beautiful concept.
[01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:03.460]   (Zubin laughs)
[01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:07.380]   So you basically have these four genes
[01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:11.340]   that are converging on calcium signaling.
[01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:15.260]   So that basically means that they are acting
[01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:18.900]   each in their own way, but together in the same process.
[01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:22.540]   But now in every one of these loci,
[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:27.500]   you have many enhancers controlling each of those genes.
[01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:29.540]   That's another type of convergence
[01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:32.180]   where dysregulation of seven different enhancers
[01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:35.980]   might all converge on dysregulation of that one gene,
[01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:39.220]   which then converges on calcium signaling.
[01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:41.020]   And in each one of those enhancers,
[01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:43.580]   you might have multiple genetic variants
[01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:46.540]   distributed across many different people.
[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:49.820]   Everyone has their own different mutation,
[01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:52.860]   but all of these mutations are impacting that enhancer,
[01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:55.140]   and all of these enhancers are impacting that gene,
[01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:57.540]   and all of these genes are impacting this pathway,
[01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:59.980]   and all of these pathways are acting in the same tissue,
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:02.420]   and all of these tissues are converging together
[01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:04.700]   on the same biological process of schizophrenia.
[01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:07.820]   - And you're saying the saving grace
[01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:09.660]   is that that convergence seems to happen
[01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:11.060]   for a lot of these diseases.
[01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:11.900]   - For all of them.
[01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:14.620]   Basically that for every single disease
[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:15.500]   that we've looked at,
[01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:18.380]   we have found an epigenomic enrichment.
[01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:19.580]   How do you do that?
[01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:22.540]   You basically have all of the genetic variants
[01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:24.020]   associated with the disorder,
[01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:26.140]   and then you're asking for all of the enhancers
[01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:27.940]   active in a particular tissue.
[01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:30.860]   For 540 disorders,
[01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:33.740]   we've basically found that indeed there is an enrichment.
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:37.020]   That basically means that there is commonality,
[01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:40.620]   and from the commonality, we can just get insights.
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:43.300]   So to explain in mathematical terms,
[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:47.060]   we're basically building an empirical prior.
[01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:50.020]   We're using a Bayesian approach to basically say,
[01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:53.540]   "Great, all of these variants are equally likely
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:55.780]   "in a particular locus to be important."
[01:13:55.780 --> 01:13:58.420]   So in a genetic locus,
[01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:02.660]   you basically have a dozen variants that are co-inherited,
[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:05.460]   because the way that inheritance works in the human genome
[01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:10.140]   is through all of these recombination events during meiosis.
[01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:12.700]   You basically have, you know,
[01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:16.740]   you inherit maybe three, chromosome three, for example,
[01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:17.780]   in your body.
[01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:20.140]   It's inherited from four different parts.
[01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:21.860]   One part comes from your dad,
[01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:23.060]   another part comes from your mom,
[01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:24.380]   another part comes from your dad,
[01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:25.860]   another part comes from your mom.
[01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:28.060]   So basically, the way that it,
[01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:30.180]   sorry, from your mom's mom.
[01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:33.140]   So you basically have one copy that comes from your dad
[01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:34.540]   and one copy that comes from your mom.
[01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:36.580]   But that copy that you got from your mom
[01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:40.980]   is a mixture of her maternal and her paternal chromosome.
[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:42.260]   And the copy that you got from your dad
[01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:45.620]   is a mixture of his maternal and his paternal chromosome.
[01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:48.300]   So these breakpoints that happen
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:51.180]   when chromosomes are lining up
[01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:54.780]   are basically ensuring, through these crossover events,
[01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:59.780]   they're ensuring that every child cell
[01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:02.540]   during the process of meiosis,
[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:04.460]   where you basically have, you know,
[01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:08.220]   one spermatozoid that basically couples with one ovule
[01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:10.020]   to basically create one egg,
[01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:12.180]   to basically create the zygote.
[01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:15.780]   You basically have half of your genome that comes from dad
[01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:17.300]   and half your genome that comes from mom.
[01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:19.540]   But in order to line them up,
[01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:21.100]   you basically have these crossover events.
[01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:23.740]   These crossover events are basically leading
[01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:27.700]   to co-inheritance of that entire block
[01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:30.260]   coming from your maternal grandmother
[01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:33.780]   and that entire block coming from your maternal grandfather.
[01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:35.620]   Over many generations,
[01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:38.780]   these crossover events don't happen randomly.
[01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:41.460]   There's a protein called PRDM9
[01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:45.140]   that basically guides the double-stranded breaks
[01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:48.180]   and then leads to these crossovers.
[01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:50.820]   And that protein has a particular preference
[01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:54.180]   to only a small number of hotspots of recombination,
[01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:57.740]   which then lead to a small number of breaks
[01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:59.900]   between these co-inheritance patterns.
[01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:01.820]   So even though there are 6 million variants,
[01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:03.300]   there are 6 million loci,
[01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:08.380]   this variation is inherited in blocks.
[01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:11.940]   And every one of these blocks has like two dozen
[01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:14.220]   genetic variants that are all associated.
[01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:17.420]   So in the case of FTO, it wasn't just one variant,
[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:19.740]   it was 89 common variants
[01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:23.180]   that were all humongously associated with obesity.
[01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:26.780]   Which ones of those is the important one?
[01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:29.620]   Well, if you look at only one locus, you have no idea.
[01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:32.140]   But if you look at many loci,
[01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:36.700]   you basically say, "Aha, all of them are enriching
[01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:40.060]   in the same epigenomic map."
[01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:44.140]   In that particular case, it was mesenchymal stem cells.
[01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:47.100]   So these are the progenitor cells that give rise
[01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:50.660]   to your brown fat and your white fat.
[01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:54.020]   - Progenitor is like the early on developmental stem cells?
[01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:56.060]   - So you start from one zygote,
[01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:59.100]   and that's a totipotent cell type, it can do anything.
[01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:04.340]   You then, that cell divides, divides, divides,
[01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:09.340]   and then every cell division is leading to specialization,
[01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:13.060]   where you now have a mesodermal lineage,
[01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:15.620]   an ectodermal lineage, an endodermal lineage,
[01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:19.220]   that basically leads to different parts of your body.
[01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:22.300]   The ectoderm will basically give rise to your skin.
[01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:25.740]   Ecto means outside, derm is skin.
[01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:28.740]   So ectoderm, but it also gives rise to your neurons
[01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:31.060]   and your whole brain, so that's a lot of ectoderm.
[01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:33.780]   Mesoderm gives rise to your internal organs,
[01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:37.220]   including the vasculature and your muscle
[01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:38.300]   and stuff like that.
[01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:43.060]   So you basically have this progressive differentiation,
[01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:45.940]   and then if you look further, further down that lineage,
[01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:47.900]   you basically have one lineage that will give rise
[01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:51.760]   to both your muscle and your bone, but also your fat.
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:55.840]   And if you go further down the lineage of your fat,
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:58.900]   you basically have your white fat cells.
[01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:01.580]   These are the cells that store energy.
[01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:03.940]   So when you eat a lot, but you don't exercise too much,
[01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:07.540]   there's an excess set of calories, excess energy.
[01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:08.620]   What do you do with those?
[01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:11.140]   You basically create, you spend a lot of that energy
[01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:14.660]   to create these high-energy molecules, lipids,
[01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:19.660]   which you can then burn when you need them on a rainy day.
[01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:22.580]   So that leads to obesity if you don't exercise
[01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:26.420]   and if you overeat, because your body's like,
[01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:28.620]   oh, great, I have all these calories, I'm gonna store them.
[01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:30.420]   Ooh, more calories, I'm gonna store them too.
[01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:31.460]   Ooh, more calories.
[01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:36.020]   And 42% of European chromosomes
[01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:40.140]   have a predisposition to storing fat,
[01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:45.140]   which was selected probably in the food scarcity periods.
[01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:50.140]   Like basically as we were exiting Africa
[01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:52.660]   before and during the ice ages,
[01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:54.380]   there was probably a selection to those individuals
[01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:58.120]   who made it north to basically be able to store energy,
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:00.820]   a lot more energy.
[01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:03.860]   So you basically now have this lineage
[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:07.220]   that is deciding whether you want to store energy
[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:11.580]   in your white fat or burn energy in your beige fat.
[01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:14.340]   Turns out that your fat is,
[01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:18.540]   we have such a bad view of fat.
[01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:19.900]   Fat is your best friend.
[01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:23.140]   Fat can both store all these excess lipids
[01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:26.500]   that would be otherwise circulating through your body
[01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:29.900]   and causing damage, but it can also burn calories directly.
[01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:33.180]   If you have too much of energy,
[01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:36.220]   you can just choose to just burn some of that as heat.
[01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:38.020]   So basically when you're cold,
[01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:41.180]   you're burning energy to basically warm your body up
[01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:42.340]   and you're burning all these lipids
[01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:44.500]   and you're burning all these calories.
[01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:48.740]   So what we basically found is that across the board,
[01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:50.540]   genetic variants associated with obesity
[01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:54.260]   across many of these regions were all enriched repeatedly
[01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:58.340]   in mesenchymal stem cell enhancers.
[01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:02.020]   So that gave us a hint as to which of these genetic variants
[01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:05.940]   was likely driving this whole association.
[01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:09.340]   And we ended up with this one genetic variant
[01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:13.340]   called RS1421085.
[01:20:13.340 --> 01:20:17.340]   And that genetic variant out of the 89
[01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:20.780]   was the one that we predicted to be causal for the disease.
[01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:23.180]   So going back to those steps,
[01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:25.900]   first step is figure out the relevant tissue
[01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:27.740]   based on the global enrichment.
[01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:30.780]   Second step is figure out the causal variant
[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:34.900]   among many variants in this linkage disequilibrium
[01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:37.140]   in this co-inherited block
[01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:39.660]   between these recombination hotspots,
[01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:42.500]   these boundaries of these inherited blocks.
[01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:43.900]   That's the second step.
[01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:47.660]   The third step is once you know that causal variant,
[01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:50.020]   try to figure out what is the motif
[01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:52.540]   that is disrupted by that causal variant.
[01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:54.140]   Basically, how does it act?
[01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:56.060]   Variants don't just disrupt elements,
[01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:59.500]   they disrupt the binding of specific regulators.
[01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:01.020]   So basically the third step there was
[01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:04.660]   how do you find the motif that is responsible,
[01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:07.020]   like the gene regulatory word,
[01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:09.020]   the building block of gene regulation
[01:21:09.020 --> 01:21:12.420]   that is responsible for that dysregulatory event.
[01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:13.980]   And the fourth step is finding out
[01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:17.140]   what regulator normally binds that motif
[01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:19.900]   and is now no longer able to bind.
[01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:21.340]   - And then once you have the regulator,
[01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:23.740]   can you then try to figure out how to,
[01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:27.140]   what, after it developed, how to fix it?
[01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:28.140]   - That's exactly right.
[01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:30.260]   You now know how to intervene.
[01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:32.140]   You have basically a regulator,
[01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:34.140]   you have a gene that you can then perturb.
[01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:36.140]   And you say, well, maybe that regulator
[01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:38.740]   has a global role in obesity.
[01:21:38.740 --> 01:21:40.180]   I can perturb the regulator.
[01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:43.180]   - Just to clarify, when we say perturb,
[01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:46.300]   like on the scale of a human life,
[01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:48.380]   can a human being be helped?
[01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:49.940]   - Of course, of course.
[01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:51.180]   Yeah, so perturb. - I guess understanding
[01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:52.180]   is the first step.
[01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:53.340]   - Exactly.
[01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:55.020]   No, no, but perturbed basically means
[01:21:55.020 --> 01:21:56.420]   you now develop therapeutics,
[01:21:56.420 --> 01:21:59.140]   pharmaceutical therapeutics against that.
[01:21:59.140 --> 01:22:01.140]   Or you develop other types of intervention
[01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:03.660]   that affect the expression of that gene.
[01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:06.780]   - What do pharmaceutical therapeutics look like
[01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:11.340]   when your understanding's on a genetic level?
[01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:12.180]   - Yeah. - Sorry if it's
[01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:13.180]   a dumb question. - No, no, no.
[01:22:13.180 --> 01:22:14.260]   It's a brilliant question,
[01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:15.900]   but I wanna save it for a little bit later
[01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:17.700]   when we start talking about therapeutics.
[01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:18.620]   - Perfect. - We've talked about
[01:22:18.620 --> 01:22:20.200]   the first four steps.
[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:21.540]   There's two more.
[01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:23.780]   So basically the first step is figure out,
[01:22:23.780 --> 01:22:25.060]   I mean, the zeroth step,
[01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:26.740]   the starting point is the genetics.
[01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:29.220]   The first step after that is figure out
[01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:31.060]   the tissue of action.
[01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:34.300]   The second step is figuring out the nucleotide
[01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:36.900]   that is responsible or set of nucleotides.
[01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:38.700]   The third step is figure out the motif
[01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:40.800]   and the upstream regulator, number four.
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:44.260]   Number five and six is what are the targets?
[01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:45.740]   So number five is great.
[01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:48.260]   Now I know the regulator, I know the motif,
[01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:50.460]   I know the tissue, and I know the variant.
[01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:53.380]   What does it actually do?
[01:22:53.380 --> 01:22:56.980]   So you have to now trace it to the biological process
[01:22:56.980 --> 01:23:00.420]   and the genes that mediate that biological process.
[01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:03.340]   So knowing all of this can now allow you
[01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:05.300]   to find the target genes.
[01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:06.260]   How?
[01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:08.920]   By basically doing perturbation experiments
[01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:13.300]   or by looking at the folding of the epigenome
[01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:16.180]   or by looking at the genetic impact
[01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:19.420]   of that genetic variant on the expression of genes.
[01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:20.540]   And we use all three.
[01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:22.500]   So let me go through them.
[01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:26.300]   Basically, one of them is physical links.
[01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:29.780]   This is the folding of the genome onto itself.
[01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:32.100]   How do you even figure out the folding?
[01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:33.380]   It's a little bit of a tangent,
[01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:35.220]   but it's a super awesome technology.
[01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:39.120]   Think of the genome as, again,
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:41.440]   this massive packaging that we talked about
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:43.540]   of taking two meters worth of DNA
[01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:48.500]   and putting it in something that's a million times smaller
[01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:51.700]   than two meters worth of DNA, that's a single cell.
[01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:53.540]   You basically have this massive packaging,
[01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:57.060]   and this packaging basically leads to the chromosome
[01:23:57.060 --> 01:24:01.320]   being wrapped around in sort of tie-tight ways,
[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:04.100]   in ways, however, that are functionally capable
[01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:05.940]   of being reopened and reclosed.
[01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:11.460]   So I can then go in and figure out that folding
[01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:14.860]   by sort of chopping up the spaghetti soup,
[01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:17.900]   putting glue, and ligating the segments
[01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:20.740]   that were chopped up but nearby each other,
[01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:23.660]   and then sequencing through these ligation events
[01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:25.940]   to figure out that this region of this chromosome,
[01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:28.300]   that region of the chromosome were near each other,
[01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:30.020]   that means they were interacting,
[01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:32.620]   even though they were far away on the genome itself.
[01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:37.540]   So that chopping up, sequencing, and re-gluing
[01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:42.540]   is basically giving you folds of the genome that we call.
[01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:44.580]   - Sorry, can you backtrack?
[01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:46.420]   - Of course. - How does cutting it
[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:49.220]   help you figure out which ones were close
[01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:50.500]   in the original folding?
[01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:52.440]   - So you have a bowl of noodles.
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:54.460]   - Go on.
[01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:56.100]   - And in that bowl of noodles,
[01:24:56.100 --> 01:24:59.860]   some noodles are near each other.
[01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:01.560]   So throwing a bunch of glue,
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:05.580]   you basically freeze the noodles in place,
[01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:07.500]   throwing a cutter that chops up the noodles
[01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:08.560]   into little pieces,
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:13.820]   now throwing some ligation enzyme
[01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:17.260]   that lets those pieces that were free
[01:25:17.260 --> 01:25:19.060]   re-ligate near each other.
[01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:22.740]   In some cases, they re-ligate what you had just cut,
[01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:24.020]   but that's very rare.
[01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:26.700]   Most of the time, they will re-ligate
[01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:28.620]   in whatever was proximal.
[01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:32.940]   You now have glued the red noodle
[01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:35.380]   that was crossing the blue noodle to each other.
[01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:40.260]   You then reverse the glue, the glue goes away,
[01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:42.860]   and you just sequence the heck out of it.
[01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:46.140]   Most of the time, you'll find red segment with,
[01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:47.700]   you know, a red segment,
[01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:50.180]   but you can specifically select for ligation events
[01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:52.500]   that have happened that were not from the same segment
[01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:54.420]   by sort of marking them a particular way,
[01:25:54.420 --> 01:25:56.540]   and then selecting those,
[01:25:56.540 --> 01:26:00.180]   and then you sequence and you look for red with blue matches
[01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:01.860]   of sort of things that were glued
[01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:04.500]   that were not immediate proximal to each other,
[01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:07.780]   and that reveals the linking of the blue noodle
[01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:08.600]   and the red noodle.
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:09.740]   You're with me so far? - Yeah.
[01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:10.580]   - Good.
[01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:11.420]   So we've done these experiments.
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:13.340]   - That's the physical.
[01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:14.180]   - That's the physical.
[01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:15.660]   That's step one of the physical,
[01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:17.180]   and what the physical revealed
[01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:18.900]   is topologically associated domains,
[01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:20.820]   basically big blocks of the genome
[01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:23.960]   that are topologically, you know, connected together.
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:26.260]   That's the physical.
[01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:29.060]   The second one is the genetic links.
[01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:32.660]   It basically says, across individuals
[01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:35.520]   that have different genetic variants,
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:39.140]   how are their genes expressed differently?
[01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:40.300]   Remember before I was saying
[01:26:40.300 --> 01:26:43.020]   that the path between genetics and disease is enormous,
[01:26:43.020 --> 01:26:44.620]   but we can break it up to look at the path
[01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:47.460]   between genetics and gene expression.
[01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:50.220]   So instead of using Alzheimer's as the phenotype,
[01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:54.180]   I can now use expression of IRX3 as the phenotype,
[01:26:54.180 --> 01:26:55.300]   expression of gene A,
[01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:59.380]   and I can look at all of the humans
[01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:01.260]   who contain a G at that location
[01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:03.980]   and all the humans that contain a T at that location
[01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:05.220]   and basically say, wow,
[01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:07.420]   turns out that the expression of this gene is higher
[01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:10.580]   for the T humans than for the G humans at that location.
[01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:12.660]   So that basically gives me a genetic link
[01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:16.220]   between a genetic variant, a locus, a region,
[01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:18.740]   and the expression of nearby genes.
[01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:20.980]   Good on the genetic link?
[01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:22.240]   - I think so. - Awesome.
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:25.380]   So the third link is the activity link.
[01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:26.420]   What's an activity link?
[01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:27.260]   It basically says,
[01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:31.060]   if I look across 833 different epigenomes,
[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:34.180]   whenever this enhancer is active,
[01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:35.980]   this gene is active.
[01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:37.540]   That gives me an activity link
[01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:40.840]   between this region of the DNA and that gene.
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:43.940]   And then the fourth one is perturbations
[01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:46.940]   where I can go in and blow up that region
[01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:49.340]   and see what are the genes that change in expression,
[01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:51.980]   or I can go in and over-activate that region
[01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:53.980]   and see what genes change in expression.
[01:27:53.980 --> 01:27:57.620]   - So I guess that's similar to activity?
[01:27:57.620 --> 01:28:00.380]   - Yeah, yeah, so that's basically similar to activity.
[01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:03.180]   I agree, but it's causal rather than correlational.
[01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:05.380]   - Again, I'm a little weird.
[01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:07.060]   - No, no, you're 100% on.
[01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:08.380]   It's exactly the same as activity,
[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:09.700]   but perturbation. - But the perturbations.
[01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:11.500]   - Where I go and intervene,
[01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:13.700]   I basically take a bunch of cells.
[01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:15.860]   So you know CRISPR, right?
[01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:20.860]   CRISPR is this genome guidance and cutting mechanism.
[01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:24.640]   It's what George Church likes to call genome vandalism.
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:28.020]   So you basically are able to, (laughs)
[01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:31.700]   you can basically take a guide RNA
[01:28:31.700 --> 01:28:34.380]   that you put into the CRISPR system,
[01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:36.740]   and the CRISPR system will basically use this guide RNA,
[01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:39.380]   scan the genome, find wherever there's a match,
[01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:41.420]   and then cut the genome.
[01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:47.500]   So I digress, but it's a bacterial immune defense system.
[01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:50.880]   So basically bacteria are constantly attacked by viruses,
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:55.300]   but sometimes they win against the viruses,
[01:28:55.300 --> 01:28:56.820]   and they chop up these viruses,
[01:28:56.820 --> 01:28:59.820]   and remember as a trophy inside their genome,
[01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:02.740]   they have these loci, these CRISPR loci,
[01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:04.460]   that basically stands for clustered,
[01:29:04.460 --> 01:29:06.380]   repeats, interspersed, et cetera.
[01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:10.140]   So basically it's an interspersed repeats structure,
[01:29:10.140 --> 01:29:13.220]   where basically you have a set of repetitive regions,
[01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:16.760]   and then interspersed where these variable segments
[01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:19.540]   that were basically matching viruses.
[01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:21.820]   So when this was first discovered,
[01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:23.260]   it was basically hypothesized
[01:29:23.260 --> 01:29:25.560]   that this is probably a bacterial immune system
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:27.940]   that remembers the trophies of the viruses
[01:29:27.940 --> 01:29:29.060]   that manage the kill.
[01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:32.100]   And then the bacteria pass on,
[01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:34.460]   you know, they sort of do lateral transfer of DNA,
[01:29:34.460 --> 01:29:36.340]   and they pass on these memories
[01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:37.660]   so that the next bacterium says,
[01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:38.940]   "Ooh, you killed that guy.
[01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:41.580]   "When that guy shows up again, I will recognize him."
[01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:44.020]   And the CRISPR system was basically evolved
[01:29:44.020 --> 01:29:47.300]   as a bacterial adaptive immune response
[01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:50.920]   to sense foreigners that should not belong,
[01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:53.060]   and to just go and cut their genome.
[01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:57.480]   So it's an RNA guided, RNA cutting enzyme,
[01:29:57.480 --> 01:30:00.220]   or an RNA guided DNA cutting enzyme.
[01:30:00.220 --> 01:30:02.140]   So there's different systems.
[01:30:02.140 --> 01:30:04.340]   Some of them cut DNA, some of them cut RNA,
[01:30:04.340 --> 01:30:09.340]   but all of them remember this sort of viral attack.
[01:30:09.340 --> 01:30:13.660]   So what we have done now as a field is, you know,
[01:30:13.660 --> 01:30:16.700]   through the work of, you know, Jennifer Doudna,
[01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:19.340]   Manuel Carpentier, Feng Zhang, and many others,
[01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:24.300]   is co-opted that system of bacterial immune defense
[01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:26.460]   as a way to cut genomes.
[01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:30.780]   You basically have this guiding system
[01:30:30.780 --> 01:30:33.380]   that allows you to use an RNA guide
[01:30:33.380 --> 01:30:37.660]   to bring enzymes to cut DNA at a particular locus.
[01:30:37.660 --> 01:30:39.140]   - That's so fascinating.
[01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:41.900]   So this is like already a natural mechanism,
[01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:45.580]   a natural tool for cutting that was useful
[01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:47.260]   in this particular context.
[01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:49.940]   And we're like, well, we can use that thing to actually,
[01:30:49.940 --> 01:30:51.860]   it's a nice tool that's already in the body.
[01:30:51.860 --> 01:30:52.700]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:55.380]   It's not in our body, it's in the bacterial body.
[01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:58.300]   It was discovered by the yogurt industry.
[01:30:58.300 --> 01:31:01.660]   They were trying to make better yogurts,
[01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:03.560]   and they were trying to make their bacteria
[01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:06.800]   in their yogurt cultures more resilient to viruses.
[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:10.060]   And they were studying bacteria,
[01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:12.420]   and they found that, wow, this CRISPR system is awesome.
[01:31:12.420 --> 01:31:14.700]   It allows you to defend against that.
[01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:16.920]   And then it was co-opted in mammalian systems
[01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:21.380]   that don't use anything like that as a targeting way
[01:31:21.380 --> 01:31:23.980]   to basically bring these DNA-cutting enzymes
[01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:25.740]   to any locus in the genome.
[01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:29.580]   Why would you want to cut DNA to do anything?
[01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:33.860]   The reason is that our DNA has a DNA repair mechanism,
[01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:36.580]   where if a region of the genome gets randomly cut,
[01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:40.180]   you will basically scan the genome for anything that matches
[01:31:40.180 --> 01:31:43.420]   and sort of use it by homology.
[01:31:43.420 --> 01:31:45.140]   So the reason why we're diploid
[01:31:45.140 --> 01:31:47.200]   is because we now have a spare copy.
[01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:49.220]   As soon as my mom's copy is deactivated,
[01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:50.580]   I can use my dad's copy.
[01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:52.540]   And somewhere else, if my dad's copy is deactivated,
[01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:55.180]   I can use my mom's copy to repair it.
[01:31:55.180 --> 01:31:58.640]   So this is called homologous-based repair.
[01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:02.020]   - So all you have to do is the cutting,
[01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:04.020]   and you don't have to do the fixing.
[01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:04.860]   - That's exactly right.
[01:32:04.860 --> 01:32:06.140]   You don't have to do the fixing.
[01:32:06.140 --> 01:32:07.220]   - 'Cause it's already built in.
[01:32:07.220 --> 01:32:08.400]   - That's exactly right.
[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:10.780]   But the fixing can be co-opted
[01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:14.340]   by throwing in a bunch of homologous segments
[01:32:14.340 --> 01:32:16.780]   that instead of having your dad's version,
[01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:19.020]   have whatever other version you'd like to use.
[01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:22.460]   - So you then control the fixing
[01:32:22.460 --> 01:32:23.980]   by throwing in a bunch of other stuff.
[01:32:23.980 --> 01:32:24.820]   - That's exactly right.
[01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:26.380]   And that's how you do genome editing.
[01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:27.780]   - So that's what CRISPR is.
[01:32:27.780 --> 01:32:28.620]   - That's what CRISPR is.
[01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:30.900]   - In popular culture, people use the term.
[01:32:30.900 --> 01:32:32.540]   I've never, wow, that's brilliant.
[01:32:32.540 --> 01:32:34.340]   That's just an awesome explanation.
[01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:38.420]   - Genome vandalism followed by a bunch of Band-Aids
[01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:39.900]   that have the sequence that you'd like.
[01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:42.740]   - And you can control the choices of Band-Aids.
[01:32:42.740 --> 01:32:43.660]   - Correct.
[01:32:43.660 --> 01:32:46.300]   And of course, there's new generations of CRISPR.
[01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:48.400]   There's something that's called prime editing
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:51.860]   that was sort of very, very much in the press recently,
[01:32:51.860 --> 01:32:53.160]   that basically instead of sort of making
[01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:57.240]   a double-stranded break, which again is genome vandalism,
[01:32:57.240 --> 01:33:00.800]   you basically make a single-stranded break.
[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:03.560]   You basically just nick one of the two strands,
[01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:06.180]   enabling you to sort of peel off
[01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:08.740]   without sort of completely breaking it up,
[01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:11.820]   and then repair it locally using a guide
[01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:16.000]   that is coupled to your initial RNA
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.580]   that took you to that location.
[01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:22.200]   - Dumb question, but is CRISPR as awesome
[01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:23.900]   and cool as it sounds?
[01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:27.760]   I mean, technically speaking, in terms of like,
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:31.840]   as a tool for manipulating our genetics
[01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:35.920]   in the positive meaning of the word manipulating,
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:38.680]   or is there downsides, drawbacks,
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:40.360]   in this whole context of therapeutics
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:42.840]   that we're talking about, or understanding and so on?
[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:46.580]   - So when I teach my students about CRISPR,
[01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:49.480]   I show them articles with the headline,
[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:53.000]   Genome Editing Tool Revolutionizes Biology,
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.440]   and then I show them the date of these articles,
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:57.920]   and they're 2004, like five years
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:33:59.320]   before CRISPR was invented.
[01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:02.260]   And the reason is that they're not talking about CRISPR.
[01:34:02.260 --> 01:34:04.680]   They're talking about zinc finger enzymes
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:08.880]   that are another way to bring these cutters to the genome.
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:12.040]   It's a very difficult way of sort of designing
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:13.800]   the right set of zinc finger proteins,
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:15.480]   the right set of amino acids
[01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:19.160]   that will now target a particular long stretch of DNA,
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:22.160]   because for every location that you want to target,
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:25.360]   you need to design a particular regulator,
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:29.200]   a particular protein that will match that region well.
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:31.760]   There's another technology called talons,
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:36.760]   which are basically just a different way of using proteins
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:39.300]   to sort of guide these cutters
[01:34:39.300 --> 01:34:41.140]   to a particular location in the genome.
[01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:44.620]   These require a massive team of engineers,
[01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:45.680]   of biological engineers,
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:48.100]   to basically design a set of amino acids
[01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:51.420]   that will target a particular sequence of your genome.
[01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:55.720]   The reason why CRISPR is amazingly, awesomely revolutionary
[01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:58.760]   is because instead of having this team of engineers
[01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:00.640]   design a new set of proteins
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:02.560]   for every locus that you want to target,
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:04.560]   you just type it in your computer,
[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:06.740]   and you just synthesize an RNA guide.
[01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:10.000]   The beauty of CRISPR is not the cutting.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:11.000]   It's not the fixing.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.800]   All of that was there before.
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:15.860]   It's the guiding, and the only thing that changes
[01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:17.980]   is that it makes the guiding easier
[01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:21.940]   by sort of just typing in the RNA sequence,
[01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:24.860]   which then allows the system to sort of scan the DNA
[01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:25.860]   to find that.
[01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:29.740]   - So the coding, the engineering of the cutter is easier
[01:35:29.740 --> 01:35:32.180]   in terms of SV. - Exactly.
[01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:34.260]   - That's kind of similar to the story of deep learning
[01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:36.660]   versus old school machine learning,
[01:35:36.660 --> 01:35:39.540]   is some of the challenging parts are automated.
[01:35:39.540 --> 01:35:44.540]   Okay, so, but CRISPR's just one cutting technology.
[01:35:44.540 --> 01:35:47.120]   And then there's, that's part of the challenges
[01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:49.600]   and exciting opportunities of the field
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:52.960]   is to design different cutting technologies.
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:56.080]   - So now, this was a big parenthesis on CRISPR,
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:36:00.760]   but now, when we were talking about perturbations,
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:02.380]   you basically now have the ability
[01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:05.800]   to not just look at correlation between enhancers and genes,
[01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:09.900]   but actually go and either destroy that enhancer
[01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:11.800]   and see if the gene changes in expression,
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:15.260]   or you can use the CRISPR targeting system
[01:36:15.260 --> 01:36:19.860]   to bring in not vandalism and cutting,
[01:36:19.860 --> 01:36:24.500]   but you can couple the CRISPR system with,
[01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:27.500]   and the CRISPR system is called usually CRISPR-Cas9
[01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:30.760]   because Cas9 is the protein that will then come and cut.
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:34.580]   But there's a version of that protein called dead Cas9
[01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:36.700]   where the cutting part is deactivated.
[01:36:36.700 --> 01:36:39.640]   So you basically use dCas9, dead Cas9,
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:44.640]   to bring in an activator or to bring in a repressor.
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:48.640]   So you can now ask, is this enhancer changing that gene?
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:51.860]   By taking this modified CRISPR,
[01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:53.580]   which is already modified from the bacteria
[01:36:53.580 --> 01:36:54.740]   to be used in humans,
[01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:57.700]   that you can now modify the Cas9 to be dead Cas9,
[01:36:57.700 --> 01:37:00.960]   and you can now further modify to bring in a regulator,
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:03.980]   and you can basically turn on or turn off that enhancer
[01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:06.580]   and then see what is the impact on that gene.
[01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:10.100]   So these are the four ways of linking the locus
[01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:12.700]   to the target gene, and that's step number five.
[01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:16.100]   Step number five is find the target gene,
[01:37:16.100 --> 01:37:19.540]   and step number six is what the heck does that gene do?
[01:37:19.540 --> 01:37:22.180]   You basically now go and manipulate that gene
[01:37:22.180 --> 01:37:26.620]   to basically see what are the processes that change.
[01:37:26.620 --> 01:37:31.060]   And you can basically ask, well, in this particular case,
[01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:34.660]   in the FTO locus, we found mesenchymal stem cells
[01:37:34.660 --> 01:37:38.100]   that are the progenitors of white fat and brown fat,
[01:37:38.100 --> 01:37:39.500]   or beige fat.
[01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:43.020]   We found the RS1421085 nucleotide variant
[01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:44.820]   as the causal variant.
[01:37:44.820 --> 01:37:49.820]   We found this large enhancer, this master regulator.
[01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:53.300]   I like to call it OB1 for obesity one,
[01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:55.620]   like the strongest enhancer associated with it.
[01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:57.180]   And OB1 was kind of chubby as the actor,
[01:37:57.180 --> 01:37:58.500]   I don't know if you remember him.
[01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:00.420]   (laughing)
[01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:01.260]   - Yeah.
[01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:02.980]   - So you basically are using this Jedi mind trick
[01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:04.580]   to basically find out the--
[01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:05.420]   - Thank you.
[01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:06.300]   (laughing)
[01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:09.100]   - The location of the genome that is responsible,
[01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:12.540]   the enhancer that harbors it, the motif,
[01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:15.540]   the upstream regulator, which is ARID5B,
[01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:18.100]   for AT-rich interacting domain 5B.
[01:38:18.100 --> 01:38:20.960]   That's a protein that sort of comes and binds normally.
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:23.100]   That protein is normally a repressor.
[01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:25.060]   It represses this super enhancer,
[01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:26.900]   this massive 12,000 nucleotide
[01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:28.740]   master regulatory control region,
[01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:32.500]   and it turns off IRX3,
[01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:34.940]   which is a gene that's 600,000 nucleotides away,
[01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:38.340]   and IRX5, which is 1.2 million nucleotides away.
[01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:39.180]   So those--
[01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:40.620]   - And what's the effect of turning them off?
[01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:42.260]   - That's exactly the next question.
[01:38:42.260 --> 01:38:45.420]   So step six is, what do these genes actually do?
[01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:48.580]   So we then ask, what does IRX3 and IRX5 do?
[01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:50.940]   The first thing we did is look across individuals
[01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:53.740]   for individuals that had higher expression of IRX3
[01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:55.380]   or lower expression of IRX3.
[01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:56.700]   And then we looked at the expression
[01:38:56.700 --> 01:38:58.860]   of all of the other genes in the genome.
[01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:01.500]   And we looked for simply correlation.
[01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:03.500]   And we found that IRX3 and IRX5
[01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:08.340]   were both correlated positively with lipid metabolism
[01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:12.680]   and negatively with mitochondrial biogenesis.
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:16.300]   You're like, what the heck does that mean?
[01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:17.940]   - Doesn't sound related to obesity.
[01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:20.320]   - Not at all, superficially.
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:22.840]   But lipid metabolism should,
[01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:26.620]   because lipids is these high energy molecules
[01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:28.420]   that basically store fat.
[01:39:28.420 --> 01:39:32.380]   So IRX3 and IRX5 are negatively correlated
[01:39:32.380 --> 01:39:33.700]   with lipid metabolism.
[01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:36.100]   So that basically means that when they turn on,
[01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:37.740]   lipid metabolism, or positively,
[01:39:37.740 --> 01:39:41.020]   when they turn on, they turn on lipid metabolism.
[01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:42.460]   And they're negatively correlated
[01:39:42.460 --> 01:39:45.820]   with mitochondrial biogenesis.
[01:39:45.820 --> 01:39:49.220]   What do mitochondria do in this whole process?
[01:39:49.220 --> 01:39:51.740]   Again, small parenthesis, what are mitochondria?
[01:39:51.740 --> 01:39:56.140]   Mitochondria are little organelles.
[01:39:56.140 --> 01:40:00.860]   They arose, they only are found in eukaryotes.
[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:03.900]   Euk means good, karyote means nucleus.
[01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:05.820]   So truly, like a true nucleus.
[01:40:05.820 --> 01:40:07.740]   So eukaryotes have a nucleus.
[01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:09.900]   Prokaryotes are before the nucleus.
[01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:11.200]   They don't have a nucleus.
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:13.500]   So eukaryotes have a nucleus.
[01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:15.180]   Hmm, compartmentalization.
[01:40:15.180 --> 01:40:18.620]   Eukaryotes have also organelles.
[01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:22.700]   Some eukaryotes have chloroplasts.
[01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:24.860]   These are the plants, they photosynthesize.
[01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:28.580]   Some other eukaryotes, like us,
[01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:33.140]   have another type of organelle called mitochondria.
[01:40:33.140 --> 01:40:38.140]   These arose from an ancient species that we engulfed.
[01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:43.660]   This is an endosymbiosis event.
[01:40:43.660 --> 01:40:47.260]   Symbiosis, bio means life, sym means together.
[01:40:47.260 --> 01:40:49.860]   So symbiotes are things that live together.
[01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:51.980]   Endosymbiosis, endo means inside,
[01:40:51.980 --> 01:40:53.780]   so endosymbiosis means you live together,
[01:40:53.780 --> 01:40:55.980]   holding the other one inside you.
[01:40:55.980 --> 01:41:00.980]   So the pre-eukaryotes engulfed an organism
[01:41:00.980 --> 01:41:05.620]   that was very good at energy production,
[01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:11.140]   and that organism eventually shed most of its genome
[01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:14.740]   to now have only 13 genes in the mitochondrial genome.
[01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:21.060]   And those 13 genes are all involved in energy production,
[01:41:21.060 --> 01:41:23.340]   the electron transport chain.
[01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:25.620]   So basically, electrons are these massive,
[01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:27.280]   super energy-rich molecules.
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:33.340]   We basically have these organelles that produce energy,
[01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:35.700]   and when your muscle exercises,
[01:41:35.700 --> 01:41:37.780]   you basically multiply your mitochondria.
[01:41:37.780 --> 01:41:41.900]   You basically sort of use more and more mitochondria,
[01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:43.740]   and that's how you get beefed up.
[01:41:43.740 --> 01:41:45.740]   So basically, the muscle sort of learns
[01:41:45.740 --> 01:41:47.820]   how to generate more energy.
[01:41:47.820 --> 01:41:49.180]   So basically, every single time,
[01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:51.580]   your muscles will, you know, overnight regenerate
[01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:52.460]   and sort of become stronger
[01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:55.180]   and amplify their mitochondria and so forth.
[01:41:55.180 --> 01:41:56.460]   So what do the mitochondria do?
[01:41:56.460 --> 01:42:01.460]   The mitochondria use energy to sort of do any kind of task.
[01:42:01.460 --> 01:42:04.920]   When you're thinking, you're using energy.
[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:06.740]   This energy comes from mitochondria.
[01:42:06.740 --> 01:42:09.800]   Your neurons have mitochondria all over the place.
[01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:12.180]   Basically, this mitochondria can multiply its organelles,
[01:42:12.180 --> 01:42:14.900]   and they can be spread along the body of your muscle.
[01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:17.340]   Some of your muscle cells have actually multiple nuclei.
[01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:18.500]   They're polynucleated,
[01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:20.380]   but they also have multiple mitochondria
[01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:22.580]   to basically deal with the fact
[01:42:22.580 --> 01:42:24.340]   that your muscle is enormous.
[01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:26.780]   You can sort of span this super, super long length,
[01:42:26.780 --> 01:42:29.320]   and you need energy throughout the length of your muscle.
[01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:31.420]   So that's why you have mitochondria throughout the length,
[01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:32.820]   and you also need transcription through the length,
[01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:35.000]   so you have multiple nuclei as well.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:40.000]   So these two processes, lipids store energy.
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.020]   What do mitochondria do?
[01:42:42.020 --> 01:42:45.660]   So there's a process known as thermogenesis,
[01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:48.020]   thermal heat genesis generation.
[01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:50.380]   Thermogenesis is the generation of heat.
[01:42:50.380 --> 01:42:55.060]   Remember that bathtub with in and out?
[01:42:55.060 --> 01:42:57.100]   That's the equation that everybody's focused on.
[01:42:57.100 --> 01:42:58.800]   So how much energy do you consume?
[01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:00.920]   How much energy do you burn?
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:03.280]   But in every thermodynamic system,
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:05.940]   there's three parts to the equation.
[01:43:05.940 --> 01:43:10.780]   There's energy in, energy out, and energy lost.
[01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:14.580]   Any machine has loss of energy.
[01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:15.660]   How do you lose energy?
[01:43:15.660 --> 01:43:17.540]   You emanate heat.
[01:43:17.540 --> 01:43:18.980]   So heat is energy loss.
[01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:24.740]   So there's--
[01:43:24.740 --> 01:43:26.660]   - Which is where the thermogenesis comes in.
[01:43:26.660 --> 01:43:30.140]   - Thermogenesis is actually a regulatory process
[01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:32.100]   that modulates the third component
[01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:33.940]   of the thermodynamic equation.
[01:43:33.940 --> 01:43:37.180]   You can basically control thermogenesis explicitly.
[01:43:37.180 --> 01:43:39.340]   You can turn on and turn off thermogenesis.
[01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:40.980]   - And that's where the mitochondria comes into play.
[01:43:40.980 --> 01:43:41.820]   - Exactly.
[01:43:41.820 --> 01:43:46.280]   So RX3 and RX5 turn out to be the master regulators
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:49.060]   of a process of thermogenesis
[01:43:49.060 --> 01:43:52.300]   versus lipogenesis, generation of fat.
[01:43:52.300 --> 01:43:56.940]   So RX3 and RX5 in most people burn heat,
[01:43:56.940 --> 01:43:58.660]   burn calories as heat.
[01:43:58.660 --> 01:43:59.820]   So when you eat too much,
[01:43:59.820 --> 01:44:02.660]   just burn it off in your fat cells.
[01:44:02.660 --> 01:44:07.660]   So that bathtub has basically a sort of dissipation knob
[01:44:07.660 --> 01:44:11.200]   that most people are able to turn on.
[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:13.880]   I am unable to turn that on
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:16.340]   because I am a homozygous carrier
[01:44:16.340 --> 01:44:20.420]   for the mutation that changes a T into a C
[01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:24.620]   in the RS1421085 allele, a locus, a SNP.
[01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:26.940]   I have the risk allele twice,
[01:44:26.940 --> 01:44:28.240]   from my mom and from my dad.
[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:30.760]   So I'm unable to thermogenize.
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:35.220]   I'm unable to turn on thermogenesis through RX3 and RX5
[01:44:35.220 --> 01:44:38.100]   because the regulator that normally binds here,
[01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:39.780]   RX5B, can no longer bind
[01:44:39.780 --> 01:44:42.620]   because it's an AT-rich interacting domain.
[01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:44.720]   And as soon as I change the T into a C,
[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:47.940]   it can no longer bind because it's no longer AT-rich.
[01:44:47.940 --> 01:44:48.780]   - But doesn't that mean
[01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:51.700]   that you're able to use the energy more efficiently?
[01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:53.580]   You're not generating heat?
[01:44:53.580 --> 01:44:54.420]   Or is that--
[01:44:54.420 --> 01:44:56.940]   - That means I can eat less and get around just fine.
[01:44:56.940 --> 01:44:57.780]   - Yes.
[01:44:57.780 --> 01:44:58.620]   - Yeah, so--
[01:44:58.620 --> 01:44:59.820]   - That's a feature, actually.
[01:44:59.820 --> 01:45:02.140]   - It's a feature in a food-scarce environment.
[01:45:02.140 --> 01:45:02.980]   - Yeah, but--
[01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:05.080]   - If we're all starving, I'm doing great.
[01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:07.140]   If we all have access to massive amounts of food,
[01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:08.980]   I'm obese, basically.
[01:45:08.980 --> 01:45:11.040]   - That's taken us through the entire process
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:15.540]   of then understanding why mitochondria and then the lipids
[01:45:15.540 --> 01:45:18.420]   are both, even though distant, are somehow involved.
[01:45:18.420 --> 01:45:20.580]   - Different sides of the same coin.
[01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:22.460]   You basically choose to store energy
[01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:23.860]   or you can choose to burn energy.
[01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:27.640]   - And that all of that is involved in the puzzle of obesity.
[01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:29.580]   - And that's what's fascinating, right?
[01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:31.460]   Here we are in 2007,
[01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:34.580]   discovering the strongest genetic association with obesity
[01:45:34.580 --> 01:45:39.360]   and knowing nothing about how it works for almost 10 years.
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:42.660]   For 10 years, everybody focused on this FTO gene.
[01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:44.620]   And they were like, "Oh, it must have to do something
[01:45:44.620 --> 01:45:48.140]   "with RNA modification."
[01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:49.280]   And it's like, "No, it has nothing to do
[01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:50.580]   "with the function of FTO.
[01:45:50.580 --> 01:45:53.700]   "It has everything to do with all of this other process."
[01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:56.420]   And suddenly, the moment you solve that puzzle,
[01:45:56.420 --> 01:45:58.380]   which is a multi-year effort, by the way,
[01:45:58.380 --> 01:46:01.780]   a tremendous effort by Melina and many, many others.
[01:46:01.780 --> 01:46:04.180]   So this tremendous effort basically led us
[01:46:04.180 --> 01:46:07.100]   to recognize this circuitry.
[01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:10.860]   You went from having some 89 common variants associated
[01:46:10.860 --> 01:46:13.800]   in that region of the DNA, sitting on top of this gene,
[01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:16.040]   to knowing the whole circuitry.
[01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:21.060]   When you know the circuitry, you can now go crazy.
[01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:24.420]   You can now start intervening at every level.
[01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:27.180]   You can start intervening at the RX5B level.
[01:46:27.180 --> 01:46:28.980]   You can start intervening with CRISPR-Cas9
[01:46:28.980 --> 01:46:31.200]   at the single SNP level.
[01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:34.760]   You can start intervening at RX3 and RX5, directly there.
[01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:36.900]   You can start intervening at the thermogenesis level
[01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:38.340]   because you know the pathway.
[01:46:38.340 --> 01:46:41.500]   You can start intervening at the differentiation level,
[01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:46.500]   where the decision to make either white fat or beige fat,
[01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:47.980]   the energy-burning beige fat,
[01:46:47.980 --> 01:46:51.900]   is made developmentally in the first three days
[01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:53.940]   of differentiation of your adipocytes.
[01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:56.220]   So as they're differentiating, you basically can choose
[01:46:56.220 --> 01:46:59.180]   to make fat-burning machines or fat-storing machines,
[01:46:59.180 --> 01:47:02.180]   and sort of that's how you populate your fat.
[01:47:02.180 --> 01:47:04.460]   You basically can now go in pharmaceutically
[01:47:04.460 --> 01:47:05.560]   and do all of that.
[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:09.300]   And in our paper, we actually did all of that.
[01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:12.220]   We went in and manipulated every single aspect.
[01:47:12.220 --> 01:47:13.620]   At the nucleotide level,
[01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:16.080]   we use CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:18.220]   to basically take primary adipocytes
[01:47:18.220 --> 01:47:20.660]   from risk and non-risk individuals,
[01:47:20.660 --> 01:47:23.720]   and show that by editing that one nucleotide
[01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:26.580]   out of 3.2 billion nucleotides in the human genome,
[01:47:26.580 --> 01:47:29.660]   you could then flip between an obese phenotype
[01:47:29.660 --> 01:47:31.420]   and a lean phenotype like a switch.
[01:47:31.420 --> 01:47:34.900]   You can basically take micelles that are non-thermogenizing
[01:47:34.900 --> 01:47:36.580]   and just flip into thermogenizing cells
[01:47:36.580 --> 01:47:38.540]   by changing one nucleotide.
[01:47:38.540 --> 01:47:39.900]   It's mind-boggling.
[01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:41.920]   - It's so inspiring that this puzzle
[01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:43.140]   could be solved in this way,
[01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:46.020]   and it feels within reach to then be able
[01:47:46.020 --> 01:47:50.380]   to crack the problem of some of these diseases.
[01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:54.260]   What are, so it's 2007 you mentioned,
[01:47:54.260 --> 01:47:58.100]   what are the technologies, the tools that came along
[01:47:58.100 --> 01:47:59.780]   that made this possible?
[01:47:59.780 --> 01:48:01.780]   Like what are you excited about,
[01:48:01.780 --> 01:48:03.620]   maybe if we just look at the buffet of things
[01:48:03.620 --> 01:48:05.340]   that you've kind of mentioned.
[01:48:05.340 --> 01:48:09.460]   Is there, what's involved, what should we be excited about,
[01:48:09.460 --> 01:48:11.540]   what are you excited about?
[01:48:11.540 --> 01:48:13.940]   - I love that question because there's so much ahead of us.
[01:48:13.940 --> 01:48:15.180]   There's so, so much.
[01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:20.980]   There's, so basically solving that one locus
[01:48:20.980 --> 01:48:23.740]   required massive amounts of knowledge
[01:48:23.740 --> 01:48:25.500]   that we have been building across the years
[01:48:25.500 --> 01:48:28.320]   through the epigenome, through the comparative genomics
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:29.820]   to find out the causal variant
[01:48:29.820 --> 01:48:33.380]   and the controller regulatory motif
[01:48:33.380 --> 01:48:35.260]   through the conserved circuitry.
[01:48:35.260 --> 01:48:38.500]   It required knowing this regulatory genomic wiring.
[01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:41.500]   It required high C of these sort of topologically
[01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:42.940]   associated domains to basically find
[01:48:42.940 --> 01:48:44.500]   this long range interaction.
[01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:48.460]   It required EQTLs of this sort of genetic perturbation
[01:48:48.460 --> 01:48:51.060]   of these intermediate gene phenotypes.
[01:48:51.060 --> 01:48:53.200]   It required all of the arsenal of tools
[01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:57.060]   that I've been describing was put together for one locus.
[01:48:57.060 --> 01:48:59.380]   And this was a massive team effort,
[01:48:59.380 --> 01:49:03.980]   huge investment in time, energy, money,
[01:49:03.980 --> 01:49:06.180]   effort, intellectual, everything.
[01:49:06.180 --> 01:49:08.380]   - You're referring to, I'm sorry,
[01:49:08.380 --> 01:49:09.860]   just for the obesity one. - This one paper, yeah.
[01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:11.460]   This one paper. - This one single paper.
[01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:12.500]   - This one single locus.
[01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:14.340]   I like to say that this is a paper
[01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:16.460]   about one nucleotide in the human genome,
[01:49:16.460 --> 01:49:17.940]   about one bit of information,
[01:49:17.940 --> 01:49:20.400]   C versus T in the human genome.
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:21.660]   That's one bit of information
[01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:25.240]   and we have 3.2 billion nucleotides to go through.
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:27.440]   So how do you do that systematically?
[01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:32.320]   - I am so excited about the next phase of research
[01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:34.940]   because the technologies that my group
[01:49:34.940 --> 01:49:36.540]   and many other groups have developed
[01:49:36.540 --> 01:49:39.040]   allows us to now do this systematically,
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:41.540]   not just one locus at a time,
[01:49:41.540 --> 01:49:44.980]   but thousands of loci at a time.
[01:49:44.980 --> 01:49:47.920]   So let me describe some of these technologies.
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:52.300]   The first one is automation and robotics.
[01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:56.420]   So basically, we talked about how you can take
[01:49:56.420 --> 01:49:58.240]   all of these molecules and see
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:00.660]   which of these molecules are targeting each of these genes
[01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:02.100]   and what do they do.
[01:50:02.100 --> 01:50:03.420]   So you can basically now screen
[01:50:03.420 --> 01:50:06.300]   through millions of molecules,
[01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:09.140]   through thousands and thousands and thousands of plates,
[01:50:09.140 --> 01:50:10.820]   each of which has thousands and thousands
[01:50:10.820 --> 01:50:12.700]   and thousands of molecules,
[01:50:12.700 --> 01:50:17.500]   every single time testing all of these genes
[01:50:17.500 --> 01:50:21.960]   and asking which of these molecules perturb these genes.
[01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:25.420]   So that's technology number one, automation and robotics.
[01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:29.200]   Technology number two is parallel readouts.
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:31.080]   So instead of perturbing one locus
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:35.920]   and then asking if I use CRISPR-Cas9 on this enhancer
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:39.720]   to basically use dCas9 to turn on or turn off the enhancer,
[01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:42.140]   or if I use CRISPR-Cas9 on the SNP
[01:50:42.140 --> 01:50:44.780]   to basically change that one SNP at a time,
[01:50:44.780 --> 01:50:46.520]   then what happens?
[01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:51.160]   But we have 120,000 disease-associated SNPs
[01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:52.360]   that we wanna test.
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:55.620]   We don't wanna spend 120,000 years doing it.
[01:50:55.620 --> 01:50:58.820]   So what do we do?
[01:50:58.820 --> 01:51:01.300]   We basically develop this technology
[01:51:01.300 --> 01:51:06.300]   for massively parallel reporter assays, MPRA.
[01:51:06.300 --> 01:51:09.980]   So in collaboration with Tarjan Michelson, Eric Lander,
[01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:12.020]   I mean Jason Durey's group has done a lot of that.
[01:51:12.020 --> 01:51:13.460]   So there's a lot of groups
[01:51:13.460 --> 01:51:15.980]   that basically have developed technologies
[01:51:15.980 --> 01:51:20.980]   for testing 10,000 genetic variants at a time.
[01:51:21.340 --> 01:51:22.280]   How do you do that?
[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:26.040]   We talked about microarray technology,
[01:51:26.040 --> 01:51:29.120]   the ability to synthesize these huge microarrays
[01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:30.720]   that allow you to do all kinds of things
[01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:33.740]   like measure gene expression by hybridization,
[01:51:33.740 --> 01:51:36.260]   by measuring the genotype of a person,
[01:51:36.260 --> 01:51:38.680]   by looking at hybridization with one version with a T
[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:41.560]   versus the other version with a C,
[01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:42.640]   and then sort of figuring out
[01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:45.560]   that I am a risk carrier for obesity
[01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:47.380]   based on these hybridization,
[01:51:47.380 --> 01:51:49.240]   differential hybridization in my genome that says,
[01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:51.120]   oh, you seem to only have this allele
[01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:52.800]   or you seem to have that allele.
[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:54.340]   Microarrays can also be used
[01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:59.340]   to systematically synthesize small fragments of DNA.
[01:51:59.340 --> 01:52:01.360]   So you can basically synthesize
[01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:03.840]   these 150 nucleotide long fragments
[01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:08.380]   across 450,000 spots at a time.
[01:52:08.380 --> 01:52:14.120]   You can now take the result of that synthesis,
[01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:16.760]   which basically works through all of these sort of layers
[01:52:16.760 --> 01:52:18.680]   of adding one nucleotide at a time.
[01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:20.600]   You can basically just type it into your computer
[01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:25.120]   and order it, and you can basically order 10,000
[01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:30.560]   or 100,000 of these small DNA segments at a time.
[01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:33.360]   And that's where awesome molecular biology comes in.
[01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:35.280]   You can basically take all these segments,
[01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:39.960]   have a common start and end barcode or sort of ligator,
[01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:42.040]   like just like pieces of a puzzle,
[01:52:42.040 --> 01:52:44.600]   you can make the same end piece
[01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:46.780]   and the same start piece for all of them.
[01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:50.760]   And you can now use plasmids,
[01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:53.280]   which are these extra chromosomal,
[01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:56.560]   small DNA circular segments
[01:52:56.560 --> 01:53:00.520]   that are basically inhabiting all our genomes.
[01:53:00.520 --> 01:53:03.040]   We basically have plasmids floating around.
[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:06.840]   I mean, bacteria use plasmids for transferring DNA,
[01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:07.940]   and that's where they put a lot
[01:53:07.940 --> 01:53:10.640]   of antibiotic resistance genes.
[01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:12.080]   So they can easily transfer them
[01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:14.120]   from one bacterium to the other.
[01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:17.040]   So one bacterium evolves a gene to be resistant
[01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:19.680]   to a particular antibiotic.
[01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:20.880]   It basically says to all its friends,
[01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:24.680]   "Hey, here's that sort of DNA piece."
[01:53:24.680 --> 01:53:28.400]   We can now co-opt these plasmids into human cells.
[01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:30.900]   You can basically make a human cell culture
[01:53:30.900 --> 01:53:34.080]   and add plasmids to that human cell culture
[01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:38.080]   that contain the things that you want to test.
[01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:41.240]   You now have this library of 450,000 elements.
[01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:44.320]   You can insert them each into the common plasmid
[01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:48.280]   and then test them in millions of cells in parallel.
[01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:50.160]   - And the common plasmid is all the same
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:51.520]   before you add any-- - Exactly.
[01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:53.220]   The rest of the plasmid is the same.
[01:53:53.220 --> 01:53:57.240]   So it's called an epizomal reporter assay.
[01:53:57.240 --> 01:53:59.640]   Epizome means not inside the genome.
[01:53:59.640 --> 01:54:01.520]   It's sort of outside the chromosomes.
[01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:03.860]   So it's an epizomal assay
[01:54:03.860 --> 01:54:05.720]   that allows you to have a variable region
[01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:09.200]   where you basically test 10,000 different enhancers,
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:10.760]   and you have a common region
[01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:13.680]   which basically has the same reporter gene.
[01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:16.560]   You now can do some very cool molecular biology.
[01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:19.360]   You can basically take the 450,000 elements
[01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:20.760]   that you've generated,
[01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:22.720]   and you have a piece of the puzzle here,
[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:24.360]   piece of the puzzle here, which is identical,
[01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:27.020]   so they're compatible with that plasmid.
[01:54:27.020 --> 01:54:28.740]   You can chop them up in the middle
[01:54:28.740 --> 01:54:32.600]   to separate a barcode reporter from the enhancer,
[01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:34.360]   and in the middle, put the same gene,
[01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:36.840]   again, using the same pieces of the puzzle.
[01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:39.860]   You now can have a barcode readout
[01:54:39.860 --> 01:54:43.080]   of what is the impact of 10,000 different versions
[01:54:43.080 --> 01:54:45.560]   of an enhancer on gene expression.
[01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:47.880]   So we're not doing one experiment.
[01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:49.560]   We're doing 10,000 experiments.
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:55.480]   And those 10,000 can be 5,000 of different loci,
[01:54:55.480 --> 01:55:00.360]   and each of them in two versions, risk or non-risk.
[01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:02.040]   I can now test tens of thousands--
[01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:03.600]   - These are little hypotheses.
[01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:04.440]   - Exactly.
[01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:06.840]   - And then you can do 10,000, and wait--
[01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:08.880]   - You can test 10,000 hypotheses at once.
[01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:12.240]   - How hard is it to generate those 10,000?
[01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:13.800]   - Trivial, trivial.
[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:14.920]   - But it's biology.
[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:16.880]   - No, no, generating the 10,000 is trivial
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:20.680]   because you basically add, it's by technology.
[01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:22.720]   You basically have these arrays
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:26.480]   that add one nucleotide at a time at every spot.
[01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:29.880]   - So it's printing, and so you're able to control.
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:31.400]   - Yeah.
[01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:33.160]   - Super costly, is it?
[01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:34.360]   - 10,000 bucks.
[01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:35.800]   - So this is in millions?
[01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:37.360]   - 10,000 bucks for 10,000 experiments.
[01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:39.640]   Sounds like the right, you know.
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:42.040]   - I mean, so that's super, that's exciting,
[01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:44.000]   'cause you don't have to do one thing at a time.
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:45.440]   - You can now use that technology,
[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:47.320]   these massively parallel reporter assays,
[01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:49.880]   to test 10,000 locations at a time.
[01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:54.880]   We've made multiple modifications to that technology.
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:59.880]   One was SHARPER MPRA, which stands for, you know,
[01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:04.600]   basically getting a higher resolution view
[01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:09.480]   by tiling these elements.
[01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:14.480]   So you can see where along the region of control
[01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:16.000]   are they acting.
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.440]   And we made another modification called HYDRA
[01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:23.440]   for high, you know, definition, regulatory annotation
[01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:25.360]   or something like that,
[01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:29.880]   which basically allows you to test 7 million of these
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:32.800]   at a time by sort of cutting them directly from the DNA.
[01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:34.320]   So instead of synthesizing,
[01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:36.720]   which basically has the limit of 450,000
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:38.240]   that you can synthesize at a time,
[01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:40.080]   we basically said, "Hey, if we wanna test
[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:42.440]   all accessible regions of the genome,
[01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:45.400]   let's just do an experiment that cuts accessible regions.
[01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:47.640]   Let's take those accessible regions,
[01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:51.360]   put them all with the same end joints of the puzzles,
[01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:56.360]   and then now use those to create a much, much larger array
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:56:59.360]   of things that you can test.
[01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:01.200]   And then tiling all of these regions,
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:04.000]   you can then pinpoint what are the driver nucleotides,
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:05.760]   what are the elements, how are they acting
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:07.400]   across 7 million experiments at a time.
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:11.080]   So basically, this is all the same family of technology
[01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:14.040]   where you're basically using these parallel readouts
[01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:15.680]   of the barcodes.
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:18.000]   And then, you know, to do this,
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.240]   we used a technology called StarSeq
[01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:23.560]   for self-transcribing reporter assays,
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:25.600]   a technology developed by Alex Stark,
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:30.000]   my former postdoc, who's now a PI over in Vienna.
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.680]   So we basically coupled the StarSeq,
[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:35.520]   the self-transcribing reporters,
[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:39.280]   where the enhancer can be part of the gene itself.
[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:40.920]   So instead of having a separate barcode,
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:43.520]   that enhancer basically acts to turn on the gene
[01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:45.960]   and is transcribed as part of the gene.
[01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:47.320]   - So you don't have to have the two separate parts.
[01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:49.000]   - Exactly, so you can just read them directly.
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:52.560]   - So there's a constant improvement in this whole process.
[01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:54.840]   By the way, generating all these options,
[01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:56.920]   is it basically brute force?
[01:57:56.920 --> 01:57:58.560]   How much human intuition is--
[01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:01.000]   - Oh gosh, of course it's human intuition
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.160]   and human creativity and incorporating
[01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:05.760]   all of the input data sets,
[01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:09.200]   because again, the genome is enormous, 3.2 billion.
[01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:10.520]   You don't wanna test that.
[01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:12.520]   Instead, you basically use all of these tools
[01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:14.120]   that I've talked about already.
[01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:18.080]   You generate your top favorite 10,000 hypotheses,
[01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:19.760]   and then you go and test all 10,000.
[01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:21.080]   And then from what comes out,
[01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:22.720]   you can then go to the next step.
[01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:25.760]   So that's technology number two.
[01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:28.720]   So technology number one is robotics, automation,
[01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:30.200]   where you have thousands of wells
[01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:31.880]   and you constantly test them.
[01:58:31.880 --> 01:58:34.680]   The second technology is instead of having wells,
[01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:37.320]   you have these massively parallel readouts
[01:58:37.320 --> 01:58:39.920]   in sort of these pooled asses.
[01:58:39.920 --> 01:58:44.680]   The third technology is coupling CRISPR perturbations
[01:58:44.680 --> 01:58:50.680]   with these single-cell RNA readouts.
[01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:53.400]   So let me make another parenthesis here
[01:58:53.400 --> 01:58:56.480]   to describe now single-cell RNA sequencing.
[01:58:56.480 --> 01:58:59.560]   So what does single-cell RNA sequencing mean?
[01:58:59.560 --> 01:59:04.560]   So RNA sequencing is what has been traditionally used,
[01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:07.600]   or well, traditionally, the last 20 years,
[01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:10.120]   ever since the advent of next-generation sequencing.
[01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:12.840]   So basically, before, RNA expression profiling
[01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:14.560]   was based on these microarrays.
[01:59:14.560 --> 01:59:17.400]   The next technology after that was based on sequencing.
[01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:18.960]   So you chop up your RNA
[01:59:18.960 --> 01:59:21.440]   and you just sequence small molecules,
[01:59:21.440 --> 01:59:23.720]   just like you would sequence a genome,
[01:59:23.720 --> 01:59:27.040]   basically reverse transcribe the small RNAs into DNA,
[01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:29.000]   and you sequence that DNA
[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:32.920]   in order to get the number of sequencing reads
[01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:35.600]   corresponding to the expression level
[01:59:35.600 --> 01:59:37.400]   of every gene in the genome.
[01:59:37.400 --> 01:59:39.520]   You now have RNA sequencing.
[01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:42.240]   How do you go to single-cell RNA sequencing?
[01:59:42.240 --> 01:59:45.760]   That technology also went through stages of evolution.
[01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:48.000]   The first was microfluidics.
[01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:51.280]   You basically had these, or even chambers,
[01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:54.160]   you basically had these ways of isolating individual cells,
[01:59:54.160 --> 01:59:57.240]   putting them into a well for every one of these cells.
[01:59:57.240 --> 01:59:59.280]   So you have 384 well plates,
[01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:02.320]   and you now do 384 parallel reactions
[02:00:02.320 --> 02:00:05.520]   to measure the expression of 384 cells.
[02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:08.200]   That sounds amazing, and it was amazing,
[02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:11.200]   but we wanna do a million cells.
[02:00:11.200 --> 02:00:14.040]   How do you go from these wells to a million cells?
[02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:15.520]   You can't.
[02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:18.640]   So what the next technology was after that
[02:00:18.640 --> 02:00:21.520]   is instead of using a well for every reaction,
[02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:26.200]   you now use a lipid droplet for every reaction.
[02:00:26.200 --> 02:00:30.320]   So you use micro droplets as reaction chambers
[02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:32.080]   to basically amplify RNA.
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:34.480]   So here's the idea.
[02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:36.480]   You basically have microfluidics,
[02:00:36.480 --> 02:00:38.680]   where you basically have every single cell
[02:00:38.680 --> 02:00:41.440]   coming down one tube in your microfluidics,
[02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:44.560]   and you have little bubbles getting created in the other way
[02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:47.440]   with specifical primers that mark every cell
[02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:49.240]   with its own barcode.
[02:00:49.240 --> 02:00:50.680]   You basically couple the two,
[02:00:50.680 --> 02:00:54.320]   and you end up with little bubbles that have a cell
[02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:57.280]   and tons of markers for that cell.
[02:00:57.280 --> 02:01:00.280]   You now mark up all of the RNA for that one cell
[02:01:00.280 --> 02:01:01.680]   with the same exact barcode,
[02:01:01.680 --> 02:01:06.240]   and you then lyse all of the droplets,
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:08.200]   and you sequence the heck out of that,
[02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:10.280]   and you have for every RNA molecule
[02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:12.720]   a unique identifier that tells you what cell was it on.
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:16.320]   - That is such good engineering, microfluidics,
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:21.320]   and using some kind of primer to put a label on the thing.
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:24.040]   I mean, you're making this sound easy.
[02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:26.160]   I assume it's-- - It's beautiful, right?
[02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:27.280]   - But it's gorgeous, yeah.
[02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:29.440]   - So there's the next generation.
[02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:30.840]   So that's the second generation.
[02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:33.800]   Next generation is, forget the microfluidics altogether.
[02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:35.560]   Just use big bottles.
[02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:37.840]   How can you possibly do that with big bottles?
[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:39.280]   So here's the idea.
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:41.160]   You dissociate all of your cells,
[02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:44.200]   or all of your nuclei from complex cells like brain cells
[02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:47.640]   that are very long and sticky, so you can't do that.
[02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:49.040]   So if you have blood cells,
[02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:51.960]   or if you have neuronal nuclei or brain nuclei,
[02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:56.040]   you can basically dissociate, let's say, a million cells.
[02:01:56.040 --> 02:01:58.800]   You now want to add a unique barcode,
[02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:01.440]   a unique barcode in each one of a million cells
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:03.240]   using only big bottles.
[02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:04.240]   How can you possibly do that?
[02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:06.000]   Sounds crazy, but here's the idea.
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.720]   You use 100 of these bottles.
[02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:13.320]   You randomly shuffle all your million cells,
[02:02:13.320 --> 02:02:15.040]   and you throw them into those 100 bottles,
[02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:17.040]   randomly, completely randomly.
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:21.440]   You add one barcode out of 100 to every one of the cells.
[02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:23.440]   You then, you now take them all out,
[02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:24.760]   you shuffle them again,
[02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:27.200]   and you throw them again into the same 100 bottles,
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:30.640]   but now in a different randomization,
[02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:33.840]   and you add a second barcode.
[02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:35.760]   So every cell now has two barcodes.
[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:38.000]   You take them out again,
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.240]   you shuffle them, and you throw them back in.
[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:43.120]   Another third barcode is adding,
[02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:45.280]   randomly, from the same 100 barcodes.
[02:02:47.240 --> 02:02:51.920]   You've now labeled every cell probabilistically
[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:53.520]   based on the unique path that it took
[02:02:53.520 --> 02:02:55.760]   of which of 100 bottles did it go for the first time,
[02:02:55.760 --> 02:02:57.240]   which of 100 bottles the second time,
[02:02:57.240 --> 02:02:59.200]   and which of 100 bottles the third time.
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:04.080]   100 times 100 times 100 is a million unique barcodes
[02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:07.200]   in every single one of these cells
[02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:09.520]   without ever using microfluid.
[02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:10.360]   - Very clever.
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:11.600]   - It's beautiful, right? - From a computer science
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:12.720]   perspective, that's very clever.
[02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:14.960]   - Yeah, so you now have the single cell
[02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:16.000]   sequencing technology.
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.680]   You can use the wells, you can use the bubbles,
[02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:20.040]   or you can use the bottles.
[02:03:20.040 --> 02:03:22.360]   You have ways--
[02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:23.640]   - The bubbles still sound pretty damn cool.
[02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:24.600]   - The bubbles are awesome,
[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:26.480]   and that's basically the main technology that we're using.
[02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:29.040]   So the bubbles is the main technology.
[02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:32.360]   So there are kits now that companies just sell
[02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:34.840]   to basically carry out single cell RNA sequencing
[02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:37.480]   that you can basically, for $2,000,
[02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:40.520]   you can basically get 10,000 cells from one sample,
[02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:44.800]   and for every one of those cells,
[02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:48.040]   you basically have the transcription of thousands of genes.
[02:03:48.040 --> 02:03:52.680]   And of course, the data for any one cell is noisy,
[02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:54.200]   but being computer scientists,
[02:03:54.200 --> 02:03:57.360]   we can aggregate the data from all of the cells together
[02:03:57.360 --> 02:03:59.320]   across thousands of individuals together
[02:03:59.320 --> 02:04:01.600]   to basically make very robust inferences.
[02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:05.560]   So the third technology is basically single cell
[02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:08.520]   RNA sequencing that allows you to now start asking
[02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:12.680]   not just what is the brain expression level difference
[02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:14.240]   of that genetic variant,
[02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:15.960]   but what is the expression difference
[02:04:15.960 --> 02:04:17.440]   of that one genetic variant
[02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:21.520]   across every single subtype of brain cell?
[02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:23.320]   How is the variance changing?
[02:04:23.320 --> 02:04:27.240]   You can't just, you know, with a brain sample,
[02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:28.840]   you can just ask about the mean.
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:30.680]   What is the average expression?
[02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:35.280]   If I instead have 3,000 cells that are neurons,
[02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:38.320]   I can ask not just what is the neuronal expression,
[02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:41.960]   I can say for layer five excitatory neurons,
[02:04:41.960 --> 02:04:44.080]   of which I have, I don't know, 300 cells,
[02:04:44.080 --> 02:04:46.960]   what is the variance that this genetic variant has?
[02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:50.960]   So suddenly, it's amazingly more powerful.
[02:04:50.960 --> 02:04:52.040]   I can basically start asking
[02:04:52.040 --> 02:04:54.200]   about this middle layer of gene expression
[02:04:54.200 --> 02:04:56.080]   at unprecedented levels.
[02:04:56.080 --> 02:04:57.080]   - And when you look at the average,
[02:04:57.080 --> 02:05:01.400]   it washes out some potentially important signal
[02:05:01.400 --> 02:05:03.720]   that corresponds to ultimately the disease.
[02:05:03.720 --> 02:05:04.560]   - Completely.
[02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:05.400]   - Yeah.
[02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:07.720]   - So that, I can do that at the RNA level,
[02:05:07.720 --> 02:05:11.600]   but I can also do that at the DNA level for the epigenome.
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:13.200]   So remember how before I was telling
[02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:14.320]   about all this technology that we're using
[02:05:14.320 --> 02:05:15.760]   to probe the epigenome?
[02:05:15.760 --> 02:05:18.000]   One of them is DNA accessibility.
[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:19.440]   So what we're doing in my lab is that
[02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:23.280]   from the same dissociation of, say, a brain sample,
[02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:24.960]   where you now have all these tens of thousands
[02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:26.600]   of cells floating around,
[02:05:26.600 --> 02:05:30.080]   you basically take half of them to do RNA profiling,
[02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:31.920]   and the other half to do epigenome profiling,
[02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:34.000]   both at the single cell level.
[02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:35.440]   So that allows you to now figure out
[02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:39.840]   what are the millions of DNA enhancers
[02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:41.920]   that are accessible in every one
[02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:43.640]   of tens of thousands of cells.
[02:05:43.640 --> 02:05:47.440]   And computationally, we can now take the RNA
[02:05:47.440 --> 02:05:50.560]   and the DNA readouts and group them together
[02:05:50.560 --> 02:05:55.200]   to basically figure out how is every enhancer
[02:05:55.200 --> 02:05:57.400]   related to every gene.
[02:05:57.400 --> 02:05:59.400]   And remember these sort of enhancer gene linking
[02:05:59.400 --> 02:06:02.320]   that we were doing across 833 samples?
[02:06:02.320 --> 02:06:05.000]   833 is awesome, don't get me wrong,
[02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:08.080]   but 10 million is way more awesome.
[02:06:08.080 --> 02:06:10.120]   So we can now look at correlated activity
[02:06:10.120 --> 02:06:14.560]   across 2.3 million enhancers and 20,000 genes
[02:06:14.560 --> 02:06:16.520]   in each of millions of cells
[02:06:16.520 --> 02:06:18.080]   to basically start piecing together
[02:06:18.080 --> 02:06:22.520]   the regulatory circuitry of every single type of neuron,
[02:06:22.520 --> 02:06:24.840]   every single type of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes,
[02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:27.560]   microglial cell inside the brains
[02:06:27.560 --> 02:06:30.400]   of 1,500 individuals that we've sampled
[02:06:30.400 --> 02:06:33.480]   across multiple different brain regions
[02:06:33.480 --> 02:06:34.880]   across both DNA and RNA.
[02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:39.520]   So that's the dataset that my team generated last year alone.
[02:06:39.520 --> 02:06:43.600]   So in one year, we've basically generated 10 million cells
[02:06:43.600 --> 02:06:48.040]   from human brain across a dozen different disorders,
[02:06:48.040 --> 02:06:49.880]   across schizophrenia, Alzheimer's,
[02:06:49.880 --> 02:06:53.560]   frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, ALS,
[02:06:53.560 --> 02:06:58.640]   Huntington's disease, post-traumatic stress disorder,
[02:06:58.640 --> 02:07:03.640]   autism, bipolar disorder, healthy aging, et cetera.
[02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:08.000]   - So it's possible that even just within that dataset
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:13.000]   lie a lot of keys to understanding these diseases
[02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:18.360]   and then be able to directly lead to then treatment.
[02:07:18.360 --> 02:07:19.520]   - Correct, correct.
[02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:22.040]   So basically we are now-- - Motivating.
[02:07:22.040 --> 02:07:24.720]   - Yeah, so our computational team is in heaven right now
[02:07:24.720 --> 02:07:25.720]   and we're looking for people.
[02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:27.080]   I mean, if you have listeners who are--
[02:07:27.080 --> 02:07:28.000]   - They inspire, yeah, yeah.
[02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:29.640]   - Super smart computational people.
[02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:32.960]   - So this is a very interesting kind of side question.
[02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:36.160]   How much of this is biology, how much of this is computation?
[02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:38.600]   So you had the computational biology group,
[02:07:38.600 --> 02:07:43.600]   but how much of, should you be comfortable with biology
[02:07:43.600 --> 02:07:48.320]   to be able to solve some of these problems?
[02:07:48.320 --> 02:07:51.440]   If you just find, if you put several of the hats
[02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:53.640]   that you wear on, fundamentally,
[02:07:53.640 --> 02:07:56.400]   are you thinking like a computer scientist here?
[02:07:56.400 --> 02:07:57.400]   - You have to.
[02:07:57.400 --> 02:07:58.680]   This is the only way.
[02:07:58.680 --> 02:08:01.480]   As I said, we are the descendants
[02:08:01.480 --> 02:08:02.640]   of the first digital computer.
[02:08:02.640 --> 02:08:04.920]   We're trying to understand the digital computer.
[02:08:04.920 --> 02:08:06.240]   We're trying to understand the circuitry,
[02:08:06.240 --> 02:08:11.080]   the logic of this digital core computer
[02:08:11.080 --> 02:08:14.040]   and all of these analog layers surrounding it.
[02:08:14.040 --> 02:08:17.320]   So the case that I've been making
[02:08:17.320 --> 02:08:19.720]   is that you cannot think one gene at a time.
[02:08:19.720 --> 02:08:21.920]   The traditional biology is dead.
[02:08:21.920 --> 02:08:23.760]   There's no way, you cannot solve disease
[02:08:23.760 --> 02:08:24.840]   with traditional biology.
[02:08:24.840 --> 02:08:27.000]   You need it as a component.
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.480]   Once you figured out RX3 and RX5,
[02:08:29.480 --> 02:08:31.120]   you now can then say, hey,
[02:08:31.120 --> 02:08:32.360]   have you guys worked on those genes
[02:08:32.360 --> 02:08:33.760]   with your single gene approach?
[02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:35.440]   We'd love to know everything you know.
[02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:36.400]   And if you haven't,
[02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:38.760]   we now know how important these genes are.
[02:08:38.760 --> 02:08:40.760]   Let's now launch a single gene program
[02:08:40.760 --> 02:08:43.280]   to dissect them and understand them.
[02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:46.640]   But you cannot use that as a way to dissect disease.
[02:08:46.640 --> 02:08:48.480]   You have to think genomically.
[02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:50.720]   You have to think from the global perspective
[02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:53.280]   and you have to build these circuits systematically.
[02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:56.520]   So we need numbers of computer scientists
[02:08:56.520 --> 02:09:00.040]   who are interested and willing to dive into these data,
[02:09:00.040 --> 02:09:04.800]   you know, fully, fully in and sort of extract meaning.
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:06.920]   We need computer science people
[02:09:06.920 --> 02:09:10.080]   who can understand sort of machine learning and inference
[02:09:10.080 --> 02:09:12.960]   and sort of, you know, decouple these matrices,
[02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:16.240]   come up with super smart ways of sort of dissecting them.
[02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:20.320]   But we also need computer scientists who understand biology,
[02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:24.400]   who are able to design the next generation of experiments.
[02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:26.320]   Because many of these experiments,
[02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:28.400]   no one in their right mind would design them
[02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:30.200]   without thinking of the analytical approach
[02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:32.840]   that you would use to deconvolve the data afterwards.
[02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:35.640]   Because it's massive amounts of ridiculously noisy data.
[02:09:35.640 --> 02:09:39.680]   And if you don't have the computational pipeline
[02:09:39.680 --> 02:09:42.600]   in your head before you even design the experiment,
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:44.640]   you would never design the experiment that way.
[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:47.120]   - That's brilliant, so in designing the experiment,
[02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:50.040]   you have to see the entirety of the computational pipeline.
[02:09:50.040 --> 02:09:52.120]   - That drives the design.
[02:09:52.120 --> 02:09:55.600]   That even drives the necessity for that design.
[02:09:55.600 --> 02:09:57.880]   Basically, you know, if you didn't have
[02:09:57.880 --> 02:10:00.120]   a computer scientist way of thinking,
[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:03.480]   you would never design these hugely combinatorial,
[02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:05.440]   massively parallel experiments.
[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:09.080]   So that's why you need interdisciplinary teams.
[02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:10.240]   You need teams.
[02:10:10.240 --> 02:10:12.280]   And I wanna sort of clarify that,
[02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:15.120]   what do we mean by computational biology group?
[02:10:15.120 --> 02:10:16.760]   The focus is not on computational,
[02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:18.800]   the focus is on the biology.
[02:10:18.800 --> 02:10:20.800]   So we are a biology group.
[02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:22.040]   What type of biology?
[02:10:22.040 --> 02:10:23.360]   Computational biology.
[02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:27.640]   That's the type of biology that uses the whole genome.
[02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:30.400]   That's the type of biology that designs experiments,
[02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:33.120]   genomic experiments, that can only be interpreted
[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:34.720]   in the context of the whole genome.
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:37.320]   - Right, so it's philosophically
[02:10:37.320 --> 02:10:39.120]   looking at biology as a computer.
[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:40.640]   - Correct, correct.
[02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:45.080]   - So which is, in the context of the history of biology,
[02:10:45.080 --> 02:10:46.640]   is a big transformation.
[02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:48.920]   - Yeah, yeah, you can think of the name as,
[02:10:48.920 --> 02:10:50.040]   what do we do?
[02:10:50.040 --> 02:10:51.880]   Only computation, that's not true.
[02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:53.760]   But how do we study it?
[02:10:53.760 --> 02:10:55.520]   Only computationally, that is true.
[02:10:55.520 --> 02:10:58.560]   So all of these single cell sequencing
[02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:00.480]   can now be coupled with the technology
[02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:02.880]   that we talked about earlier for perturbation.
[02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:04.320]   So here's the crazy thing.
[02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:07.840]   Instead of using these wells and these robotic systems
[02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:10.560]   for doing one drug at a time,
[02:11:10.560 --> 02:11:14.680]   or for perturbing one gene at a time in thousands of wells,
[02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:18.200]   you can now do this using a pool of cells
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:20.040]   and single cell RNA sequencing.
[02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:20.920]   How?
[02:11:20.920 --> 02:11:25.920]   You basically can take these perturbations using CRISPR,
[02:11:25.920 --> 02:11:29.320]   and instead of using a single guide RNA,
[02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:31.320]   you can use a library of guide RNAs
[02:11:31.320 --> 02:11:34.440]   generated exactly the same way using this array technology.
[02:11:34.440 --> 02:11:37.560]   So you synthesize a thousand different guide RNAs.
[02:11:37.560 --> 02:11:42.240]   You now take each of these guide RNAs
[02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:45.400]   and you insert them in a pool of cells
[02:11:45.400 --> 02:11:48.160]   where every cell gets one perturbation.
[02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:51.360]   And you use CRISPR editing or CRISPR,
[02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:56.520]   so with either CRISPR-Cas9 to edit the genome
[02:11:56.520 --> 02:11:57.720]   with these thousand perturbations.
[02:11:57.720 --> 02:11:59.920]   - Or the activation one. - Or with the activation
[02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:01.320]   or with the repression.
[02:12:01.320 --> 02:12:04.400]   And you now can have a single cell readout
[02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:06.840]   where every single cell has received
[02:12:06.840 --> 02:12:09.520]   one of these modifications.
[02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:12.000]   And you can now, in massively parallel ways,
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:17.000]   couple the perturbation and the readout
[02:12:17.040 --> 02:12:18.280]   in a single experiment.
[02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:20.200]   - How are you tracking which perturbations
[02:12:20.200 --> 02:12:21.560]   each cell received?
[02:12:21.560 --> 02:12:23.560]   - So there's ways of doing that,
[02:12:23.560 --> 02:12:26.200]   but basically one way is to make that perturbation
[02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:30.120]   an expressible vector so that part of your RNA reading
[02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:33.120]   is actually that perturbation itself.
[02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:36.440]   So you can basically put it in an expressible part,
[02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:37.680]   so you can self-drive it.
[02:12:37.680 --> 02:12:40.320]   So the point that I wanna get across
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:42.040]   is that the sky's the limit.
[02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:43.560]   You basically have these tools,
[02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:46.440]   these building blocks of molecular biology.
[02:12:46.440 --> 02:12:50.240]   You have these massive datasets of computational biology.
[02:12:50.240 --> 02:12:54.200]   You have this huge ability to sort of use machine learning
[02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:57.080]   and statistical methods and linear algebra
[02:12:57.080 --> 02:12:59.400]   to sort of reduce the dimensionality
[02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:01.680]   of all these massive datasets.
[02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:06.680]   And then you end up with a series of actionable targets
[02:13:06.680 --> 02:13:11.080]   that you can then couple with pharma
[02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:13.280]   and just go after systematically.
[02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:18.280]   So the ability to sort of bring genetics to the epigenomics,
[02:13:18.280 --> 02:13:21.440]   to the transcriptomics, to the cellular readouts
[02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:24.320]   using these sort of high-throughput perturbation technologies
[02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:25.440]   that I'm talking about,
[02:13:25.440 --> 02:13:27.800]   and ultimately to the organismal
[02:13:27.800 --> 02:13:31.440]   through the electronic health record endophenotypes,
[02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:35.480]   and ultimately the disease battery of assays
[02:13:35.480 --> 02:13:38.200]   at the cognitive level, at the physiological level,
[02:13:38.200 --> 02:13:39.920]   and every other level,
[02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:45.120]   there is no better or more exciting field, in my view,
[02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:46.960]   to be a computer scientist then
[02:13:46.960 --> 02:13:48.920]   or to be a scientist in period.
[02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:51.200]   Basically, this confluence of technologies,
[02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:53.960]   of computation, of data, of insights,
[02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:56.160]   and of tools for manipulation
[02:13:56.160 --> 02:13:58.760]   is unprecedented in human history.
[02:13:58.760 --> 02:14:02.640]   And I think this is what's shaping the next century
[02:14:02.640 --> 02:14:04.720]   to really be a transformative century
[02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:07.480]   for our species and for our planet.
[02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:12.000]   - So you think the 21st century will be remembered
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:15.560]   for the big leaps in understanding
[02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:18.640]   and alleviation of biology?
[02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:20.120]   - If you look at the path
[02:14:20.120 --> 02:14:22.720]   between discovery and therapeutics,
[02:14:22.720 --> 02:14:24.760]   it's been on the order of 50 years.
[02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:27.040]   It's been shortened to 40, 30, 20,
[02:14:27.040 --> 02:14:29.380]   and now it's on the order of 10 years.
[02:14:29.380 --> 02:14:31.960]   But the huge number of technologies
[02:14:31.960 --> 02:14:35.480]   that are going on right now for discovery
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:37.920]   will result undoubtedly
[02:14:37.920 --> 02:14:41.200]   in the most dramatic manipulation of human biology
[02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:44.040]   that we've ever seen in the history of humanity
[02:14:44.040 --> 02:14:45.160]   in the next few years.
[02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:47.560]   - Do you think we might be able to cure some of the diseases
[02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:49.640]   we started this conversation with?
[02:14:49.640 --> 02:14:51.320]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:14:51.320 --> 02:14:54.040]   It's only a matter of time.
[02:14:54.040 --> 02:14:55.880]   Basically, the complexity is enormous,
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:14:58.360]   and I don't want to underestimate the complexity,
[02:14:58.360 --> 02:15:01.360]   but the number of insights is unprecedented,
[02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:03.880]   and the ability to manipulate is unprecedented,
[02:15:03.880 --> 02:15:07.520]   and the ability to deliver these small molecules
[02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:10.920]   and other non-traditional medicine perturbations.
[02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:13.080]   There's a lot of sort of new,
[02:15:13.080 --> 02:15:15.600]   there's a new generation of perturbations
[02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:18.440]   that you can use at the DNA level, at the RNA level,
[02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:22.640]   at the microRNA level, the epigenomic level.
[02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:26.440]   There's a battery of new generations of perturbations.
[02:15:26.440 --> 02:15:30.320]   If you couple that with cell type identifiers
[02:15:30.320 --> 02:15:32.880]   that can basically sense when you are in the right cell
[02:15:32.880 --> 02:15:34.080]   based on a specific combination
[02:15:34.080 --> 02:15:37.360]   and then turn on that intervention for that cell,
[02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:40.000]   you can now think of combinatorial interventions
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.040]   where you can basically sort of feed
[02:15:42.040 --> 02:15:44.400]   a synthetic biology construct to someone
[02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:47.560]   that will basically do different things in different cells.
[02:15:47.560 --> 02:15:50.160]   So basically for cancer, this is one of the therapeutics
[02:15:50.160 --> 02:15:52.400]   that our collaborator Ron Weiss is using
[02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:54.800]   to basically start sort of engineering the circuits
[02:15:54.800 --> 02:15:57.120]   that will use microRNA sensors of the environment
[02:15:57.120 --> 02:15:59.080]   to sort of know if you're in a tumor cell,
[02:15:59.080 --> 02:16:00.280]   or if you're in an immune cell,
[02:16:00.280 --> 02:16:02.040]   or if you're in a stromal cell, and so on and so forth,
[02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:04.800]   and basically turn on particular interventions there.
[02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:07.440]   You can sort of create constructs
[02:16:07.440 --> 02:16:10.240]   that are tuned to only the liver cells,
[02:16:10.240 --> 02:16:14.680]   or only the heart cells, or only the brain cells,
[02:16:14.680 --> 02:16:18.760]   and then have these new generations of therapeutics
[02:16:18.760 --> 02:16:21.840]   coupled with this immense amount of knowledge
[02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:23.920]   on the sort of which targets to choose
[02:16:23.920 --> 02:16:25.920]   and what biological processes to measure
[02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:27.560]   and how to intervene.
[02:16:27.560 --> 02:16:31.800]   My view is that disease is gonna be fundamentally altered
[02:16:31.800 --> 02:16:34.100]   and alleviated as we go forward.
[02:16:35.020 --> 02:16:37.300]   - Next time we talk,
[02:16:37.300 --> 02:16:39.700]   we'll talk about the philosophical implications of that
[02:16:39.700 --> 02:16:40.860]   and the effect of life,
[02:16:40.860 --> 02:16:44.180]   but let's stick to biology for just a little longer.
[02:16:44.180 --> 02:16:45.100]   We did pretty good today.
[02:16:45.100 --> 02:16:47.200]   We stuck to the science.
[02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:52.200]   What are you excited in terms of the future of this field,
[02:16:52.200 --> 02:16:58.580]   the technologies in your own group, in your own mind?
[02:16:58.580 --> 02:17:01.780]   You're leading the world at MIT in the science
[02:17:01.780 --> 02:17:04.340]   and the engineering of this work,
[02:17:04.340 --> 02:17:06.460]   so what are you excited about here?
[02:17:06.460 --> 02:17:08.580]   - I could not be more excited.
[02:17:08.580 --> 02:17:12.580]   We are one of many, many teams who are working on this.
[02:17:12.580 --> 02:17:16.940]   In my team, the most exciting parts are many folds.
[02:17:16.940 --> 02:17:18.980]   So basically, we've now assembled
[02:17:18.980 --> 02:17:20.180]   these battery of technologies.
[02:17:20.180 --> 02:17:22.420]   We've assembled these massive, massive data sets,
[02:17:22.420 --> 02:17:25.020]   and now we're really sort of in the stage
[02:17:25.020 --> 02:17:30.020]   of our team's path of generating disease insights.
[02:17:30.340 --> 02:17:34.420]   So we are simultaneously working on a paper
[02:17:34.420 --> 02:17:35.980]   on schizophrenia right now
[02:17:35.980 --> 02:17:37.020]   that is basically using
[02:17:37.020 --> 02:17:38.580]   the single-cell profiling technologies,
[02:17:38.580 --> 02:17:40.980]   using this editing and manipulation technologies
[02:17:40.980 --> 02:17:45.260]   to basically show how the master regulators
[02:17:45.260 --> 02:17:47.500]   underlying changes in the brain
[02:17:47.500 --> 02:17:49.900]   that are sort of found in schizophrenia
[02:17:49.900 --> 02:17:52.220]   are in fact affecting excitatory neurons
[02:17:52.220 --> 02:17:54.520]   and inhibitory neurons in pathways
[02:17:54.520 --> 02:17:57.740]   that are active both in synaptic pruning,
[02:17:57.740 --> 02:17:59.180]   but also in early development.
[02:17:59.180 --> 02:18:01.660]   We've basically found this set of four regulators
[02:18:01.660 --> 02:18:03.180]   that are connecting these two processes
[02:18:03.180 --> 02:18:06.460]   that were previously separate in schizophrenia
[02:18:06.460 --> 02:18:10.220]   in sort of having a sort of more unified view
[02:18:10.220 --> 02:18:12.660]   across those two sides.
[02:18:12.660 --> 02:18:15.420]   The second one is in the area of metabolism.
[02:18:15.420 --> 02:18:17.420]   We basically now have a beautiful collaboration
[02:18:17.420 --> 02:18:18.460]   with the Goodyear Lab
[02:18:18.460 --> 02:18:23.460]   that's basically looking at multi-tissue perturbations
[02:18:23.460 --> 02:18:28.540]   in six or seven different tissues across the body
[02:18:28.540 --> 02:18:30.300]   in the context of exercise
[02:18:30.300 --> 02:18:33.220]   and in the context of nutritional interventions
[02:18:33.220 --> 02:18:35.860]   using both mouse and human,
[02:18:35.860 --> 02:18:37.180]   where we can basically see
[02:18:37.180 --> 02:18:39.980]   what are the cell-to-cell communications
[02:18:39.980 --> 02:18:42.300]   that are changing across them.
[02:18:42.300 --> 02:18:44.940]   And what we're finding is this immense role
[02:18:44.940 --> 02:18:46.620]   of both immune cells,
[02:18:46.620 --> 02:18:49.140]   as well as adipocyte stem cells
[02:18:49.140 --> 02:18:51.100]   in sort of reshaping that circuitry
[02:18:51.100 --> 02:18:52.700]   of all of these different tissues,
[02:18:52.700 --> 02:18:54.500]   and that's sort of painting to a new path
[02:18:54.500 --> 02:18:56.820]   for therapeutical intervention there.
[02:18:56.820 --> 02:19:00.780]   In Alzheimer's, it's this huge focus on microglia,
[02:19:00.780 --> 02:19:02.620]   and now we're discovering different classes
[02:19:02.620 --> 02:19:04.220]   of microglial cells
[02:19:04.220 --> 02:19:08.220]   that are basically either synaptic or immune,
[02:19:08.220 --> 02:19:13.300]   and these are playing vastly different roles
[02:19:13.300 --> 02:19:15.980]   in Alzheimer's versus in schizophrenia.
[02:19:15.980 --> 02:19:19.100]   And what we're finding is this immense complexity
[02:19:19.100 --> 02:19:21.420]   as you go further and further down
[02:19:21.420 --> 02:19:25.580]   of how, in fact, there's 10 different types of microglia,
[02:19:25.580 --> 02:19:28.260]   each with their own sort of expression programs.
[02:19:28.260 --> 02:19:30.900]   We used to think of them as, oh, yeah, they're microglia,
[02:19:30.900 --> 02:19:32.500]   but in fact, now we're realizing
[02:19:32.500 --> 02:19:36.220]   just even in that sort of least abundant of cell types,
[02:19:36.220 --> 02:19:38.260]   there's this incredible diversity there.
[02:19:38.260 --> 02:19:41.420]   The differences between brain regions
[02:19:41.420 --> 02:19:43.940]   is another sort of major, major insight.
[02:19:43.940 --> 02:19:46.100]   Again, one would think that,
[02:19:46.100 --> 02:19:48.620]   oh, astrocytes are astrocytes no matter where they are,
[02:19:48.620 --> 02:19:52.420]   but no, there's incredible region-specific differences
[02:19:52.420 --> 02:19:53.860]   in the expression patterns
[02:19:53.940 --> 02:19:56.100]   of all of the major brain cell types
[02:19:56.100 --> 02:19:57.780]   across different brain regions.
[02:19:57.780 --> 02:19:59.420]   So basically there's the neocortical regions
[02:19:59.420 --> 02:20:00.980]   that are sort of the recent innovation
[02:20:00.980 --> 02:20:03.460]   that makes us so different from all other species.
[02:20:03.460 --> 02:20:06.500]   There's the sort of reptilian brain sort of regions
[02:20:06.500 --> 02:20:08.100]   that are sort of much more,
[02:20:08.100 --> 02:20:10.500]   very extremely distinct.
[02:20:10.500 --> 02:20:11.660]   There's the cerebellum.
[02:20:11.660 --> 02:20:15.180]   Each of those basically is associated
[02:20:15.180 --> 02:20:17.380]   in a different way with disease,
[02:20:17.380 --> 02:20:19.300]   and what we're doing now is looking into
[02:20:19.300 --> 02:20:23.740]   pseudotemporal models for how disease progresses
[02:20:23.740 --> 02:20:25.740]   across different regions of the brain.
[02:20:25.740 --> 02:20:27.060]   If you look at Alzheimer's,
[02:20:27.060 --> 02:20:29.260]   it basically starts in this small region
[02:20:29.260 --> 02:20:30.500]   called the entorhinal cortex,
[02:20:30.500 --> 02:20:33.380]   and then it spreads through the brain,
[02:20:33.380 --> 02:20:35.500]   and through the hippocampus,
[02:20:35.500 --> 02:20:39.460]   and ultimately affecting the neocortex.
[02:20:39.460 --> 02:20:41.860]   And with every brain region that it hits,
[02:20:41.860 --> 02:20:46.860]   it basically has a different impact on the cognitive
[02:20:46.860 --> 02:20:50.500]   and memory aspects, orientation,
[02:20:50.500 --> 02:20:52.780]   short-term memory, long-term memory, et cetera,
[02:20:52.780 --> 02:20:56.700]   which is dramatically affecting the cognitive path
[02:20:56.700 --> 02:20:58.220]   that the individuals go through.
[02:20:58.220 --> 02:21:00.980]   So what we're doing now is creating
[02:21:00.980 --> 02:21:04.620]   these computational models for ordering the cells
[02:21:04.620 --> 02:21:07.060]   and the regions and the individuals
[02:21:07.060 --> 02:21:10.460]   according to their ability to predict Alzheimer's disease.
[02:21:10.460 --> 02:21:14.740]   So we can have a cell-level predictor of pathology
[02:21:14.740 --> 02:21:18.140]   that allows us to now create a temporal time course
[02:21:18.140 --> 02:21:19.780]   that tells us when every gene turns on
[02:21:19.780 --> 02:21:22.580]   along this pathology progression,
[02:21:22.580 --> 02:21:25.060]   and then trace that across regions
[02:21:25.060 --> 02:21:27.780]   and pathological measures that are region-specific,
[02:21:27.780 --> 02:21:30.260]   but also cognitive measures, and so on and so forth.
[02:21:30.260 --> 02:21:33.140]   So that allows us to now sort of, for the first time,
[02:21:33.140 --> 02:21:35.580]   look at, can we actually do early intervention
[02:21:35.580 --> 02:21:38.220]   for Alzheimer's, where we know that the disease
[02:21:38.220 --> 02:21:39.980]   starts manifesting for 10 years
[02:21:39.980 --> 02:21:43.100]   before you actually have your first cognitive loss?
[02:21:43.100 --> 02:21:47.980]   Can we start seeing that path to build new diagnostics,
[02:21:47.980 --> 02:21:50.140]   new prognostics, new biomarkers
[02:21:50.140 --> 02:21:53.460]   for this sort of early intervention in Alzheimer's?
[02:21:53.460 --> 02:21:56.940]   The other aspect that we're looking at is mosaicism.
[02:21:56.940 --> 02:21:59.780]   We talked about the common variants and the rare variants,
[02:21:59.780 --> 02:22:01.860]   but in addition to those rare variants,
[02:22:01.860 --> 02:22:06.540]   as your initial cell that forms the zygote
[02:22:06.540 --> 02:22:08.260]   divides and divides and divides,
[02:22:08.260 --> 02:22:09.740]   with every cell division,
[02:22:09.740 --> 02:22:12.340]   there are additional mutations that are happening.
[02:22:12.340 --> 02:22:16.220]   So what you end up with is your brain being a mosaic
[02:22:16.220 --> 02:22:19.060]   of multiple different types of genetic underpinnings.
[02:22:19.060 --> 02:22:23.180]   Some cells contain a mutation that other cells don't have.
[02:22:23.180 --> 02:22:27.300]   So every human has the common variants
[02:22:27.300 --> 02:22:29.900]   that all of us carry to some degree,
[02:22:29.900 --> 02:22:33.420]   the rare variants that your immediate tree
[02:22:33.420 --> 02:22:35.260]   of the human species carries,
[02:22:35.260 --> 02:22:37.260]   and then there's the somatic variant,
[02:22:37.260 --> 02:22:40.460]   which is the tree that happened after the zygote
[02:22:40.460 --> 02:22:44.100]   that sort of forms your own body.
[02:22:44.100 --> 02:22:47.100]   So these somatic alterations
[02:22:47.100 --> 02:22:50.100]   is something that has been previously inaccessible
[02:22:50.100 --> 02:22:53.060]   to study in human post-mortem samples.
[02:22:53.060 --> 02:22:54.220]   But right now,
[02:22:54.220 --> 02:22:57.220]   with the advent of single-cell RNA sequencing,
[02:22:57.220 --> 02:22:58.100]   in this particular case,
[02:22:58.100 --> 02:22:59.740]   we're using the well-based sequencing,
[02:22:59.740 --> 02:23:00.780]   which is much more expensive,
[02:23:00.780 --> 02:23:02.860]   but gives you a lot richer information
[02:23:02.860 --> 02:23:04.420]   about each of those transcripts.
[02:23:04.420 --> 02:23:06.500]   So we're using now that richer information
[02:23:06.500 --> 02:23:09.700]   to infer mutations that have happened
[02:23:09.700 --> 02:23:12.060]   in each of the thousands of genes
[02:23:12.060 --> 02:23:15.380]   that sort of are active in these cells,
[02:23:15.380 --> 02:23:20.380]   and then understand how the genome relates to the function,
[02:23:20.380 --> 02:23:24.780]   this genotype-phenotype relationship
[02:23:24.780 --> 02:23:26.420]   that we usually build in GWAS,
[02:23:26.420 --> 02:23:28.620]   between, in genome-wide association studies,
[02:23:28.620 --> 02:23:31.260]   between genetic variation and disease.
[02:23:31.260 --> 02:23:33.780]   We're now building that at the cell level,
[02:23:33.780 --> 02:23:34.980]   where for every cell,
[02:23:34.980 --> 02:23:38.620]   we can relate the unique specific genome of that cell
[02:23:38.620 --> 02:23:41.100]   with the expression patterns of that cell,
[02:23:41.100 --> 02:23:42.940]   and the predicted function,
[02:23:42.940 --> 02:23:44.980]   using these predictive models that I mentioned before,
[02:23:44.980 --> 02:23:47.340]   on dysregulation for cognition,
[02:23:47.340 --> 02:23:50.820]   for pathology in Alzheimer's, at the cell level.
[02:23:50.820 --> 02:23:53.940]   And what we're finding is that the genes that are altered,
[02:23:53.940 --> 02:23:56.820]   and the genetic regions that are altered in common variants
[02:23:56.820 --> 02:23:59.060]   versus rare variants versus somatic variants,
[02:23:59.060 --> 02:24:01.140]   are actually very different from each other.
[02:24:01.140 --> 02:24:05.500]   The somatic variants are pointing to neuronal energetics,
[02:24:05.500 --> 02:24:08.580]   and oligodendrocyte functions
[02:24:08.580 --> 02:24:10.660]   that are not visible in the genetic legions
[02:24:10.660 --> 02:24:12.460]   that you find for the common variants,
[02:24:12.500 --> 02:24:15.180]   probably because they have too strong of an effect
[02:24:15.180 --> 02:24:17.500]   that evolution is just not tolerating them
[02:24:17.500 --> 02:24:20.860]   on the common side of the allele frequency spectrum.
[02:24:20.860 --> 02:24:22.060]   - So the somatic one,
[02:24:22.060 --> 02:24:24.820]   that's the variation that happens after the zygote,
[02:24:24.820 --> 02:24:26.980]   after a new individual. - Correct.
[02:24:26.980 --> 02:24:28.220]   - I mean, this is a dumb question,
[02:24:28.220 --> 02:24:31.140]   but there's mutation and variation, I guess,
[02:24:31.140 --> 02:24:32.460]   that happens there,
[02:24:32.460 --> 02:24:35.260]   and you're saying that through this,
[02:24:35.260 --> 02:24:37.100]   if we focus in on individual cells,
[02:24:37.100 --> 02:24:40.060]   we're able to detect a story that's interesting there,
[02:24:40.060 --> 02:24:42.300]   and that might be a very unique
[02:24:42.300 --> 02:24:46.620]   kind of important variability that arises for,
[02:24:46.620 --> 02:24:49.140]   you said neuronal, or something,
[02:24:49.140 --> 02:24:50.260]   that would sound-- - Energetics.
[02:24:50.260 --> 02:24:51.100]   - Energetics,
[02:24:51.100 --> 02:24:51.940]   that's not a really cool term. - Energetics.
[02:24:51.940 --> 02:24:55.060]   So you're, I mean, the metabolism of humans
[02:24:55.060 --> 02:24:59.020]   is dramatically altered from that of nearby species.
[02:24:59.020 --> 02:25:00.580]   You know, we talked about that last time,
[02:25:00.580 --> 02:25:03.240]   that basically we are able to consume meat
[02:25:03.240 --> 02:25:05.900]   that is incredibly energy-rich,
[02:25:05.900 --> 02:25:09.800]   and that allows us to sort of have functions
[02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:11.620]   that are, you know,
[02:25:11.620 --> 02:25:14.660]   meeting this humongous brain that we have.
[02:25:14.660 --> 02:25:15.660]   So basically, on one hand,
[02:25:15.660 --> 02:25:18.340]   every one of our brain cells is much more energy-efficient
[02:25:18.340 --> 02:25:20.420]   than our neighbors, than our relatives.
[02:25:20.420 --> 02:25:23.140]   Number two, we have way more of these cells,
[02:25:23.140 --> 02:25:26.420]   and number three, we have, you know,
[02:25:26.420 --> 02:25:29.980]   this new diet that allows us to now feed all these needs.
[02:25:29.980 --> 02:25:33.420]   That basically creates a massive amount of damage,
[02:25:33.420 --> 02:25:36.280]   oxidative damage, from this huge,
[02:25:36.280 --> 02:25:40.220]   super-powered factory of ideas and thoughts
[02:25:40.220 --> 02:25:41.980]   that we carry in our skull.
[02:25:41.980 --> 02:25:44.980]   And that factory has energetic needs,
[02:25:44.980 --> 02:25:47.620]   and there's a lot of sort of biological processes
[02:25:47.620 --> 02:25:51.060]   underlying that, that we are finding are altered
[02:25:51.060 --> 02:25:52.820]   in the context of Alzheimer's disease.
[02:25:52.820 --> 02:25:54.180]   - That's fascinating that,
[02:25:54.180 --> 02:25:57.220]   so you have to consider all of these systems
[02:25:57.220 --> 02:26:00.300]   if you wanna understand even something like diseases
[02:26:00.300 --> 02:26:02.700]   that you would maybe traditionally associate
[02:26:02.700 --> 02:26:05.260]   with just the particular cells of the brain.
[02:26:05.260 --> 02:26:06.100]   - Yeah.
[02:26:06.100 --> 02:26:08.760]   - The immune system.
[02:26:08.760 --> 02:26:09.720]   - The metabolic system.
[02:26:09.720 --> 02:26:11.120]   - The metabolic system.
[02:26:11.120 --> 02:26:13.320]   - And these are all the things that makes us uniquely human.
[02:26:13.320 --> 02:26:15.720]   So our immune system is dramatically different
[02:26:15.720 --> 02:26:16.960]   from that of our neighbors.
[02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:19.520]   Our societies are so much more clustered.
[02:26:19.520 --> 02:26:21.680]   The history of infections that have plagued
[02:26:21.680 --> 02:26:24.040]   the human population is, you know,
[02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:26.320]   dramatically different from every other species.
[02:26:26.320 --> 02:26:28.640]   The way that our society and our population
[02:26:28.640 --> 02:26:31.800]   has sort of exploded has basically put unique pressures
[02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:34.060]   on our immune system, and our immune system
[02:26:34.060 --> 02:26:37.360]   has both coped with that density and also been shaped by,
[02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:40.080]   as I mentioned, the vast amount of death
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:41.800]   that has happened in the Black Plague
[02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:44.560]   and other sort of selective events in human history,
[02:26:44.560 --> 02:26:47.080]   famines, ice ages, and so forth.
[02:26:47.080 --> 02:26:49.840]   So that's number one on the sort of immune side.
[02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:52.360]   On the metabolic side, you know, again,
[02:26:52.360 --> 02:26:54.760]   we are able to sort of run marathons.
[02:26:54.760 --> 02:26:56.240]   You know, I don't know if you remember
[02:26:56.240 --> 02:26:58.400]   the sort of human versus horse experiment
[02:26:58.400 --> 02:27:00.840]   where the horse actually tires out faster than the human,
[02:27:00.840 --> 02:27:02.240]   and the human actually wins.
[02:27:03.120 --> 02:27:05.780]   So on the metabolic side, we're dramatically different.
[02:27:05.780 --> 02:27:07.460]   On the immune side, we're dramatically different.
[02:27:07.460 --> 02:27:09.880]   On the brain side, again, you know,
[02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:12.380]   no need to sort of, you know, it's a no-brainer
[02:27:12.380 --> 02:27:16.700]   of how our brain is like just enormously more capable.
[02:27:16.700 --> 02:27:19.500]   And then, you know, in the side of cancer,
[02:27:19.500 --> 02:27:21.700]   so basically the cancers that humans are having,
[02:27:21.700 --> 02:27:23.980]   the exposures, the environmental exposures,
[02:27:23.980 --> 02:27:25.660]   is again dramatically different.
[02:27:25.660 --> 02:27:29.060]   And the lifespan, the expansion of human lifespan
[02:27:29.060 --> 02:27:31.960]   is unseen in any other species
[02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:35.520]   in, you know, recent evolutionary history.
[02:27:35.520 --> 02:27:39.080]   And that now leads to a lot of new disorders
[02:27:39.080 --> 02:27:43.760]   that are starting to, you know, manifest late in life.
[02:27:43.760 --> 02:27:46.240]   So, you know, Alzheimer's is one example
[02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:49.000]   where basically, you know, these fast energetic needs
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:52.080]   over a lifetime of thinking
[02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:54.320]   can basically lead to all of these debris
[02:27:54.320 --> 02:27:56.360]   and eventually saturate the system
[02:27:56.360 --> 02:27:59.420]   and lead to, you know, Alzheimer's in the late life.
[02:27:59.420 --> 02:28:04.700]   But there's, you know, there's just such a dramatic
[02:28:04.700 --> 02:28:08.660]   set of frontiers when it comes to aging research
[02:28:08.660 --> 02:28:11.740]   that, you know, will, so what I often like to say
[02:28:11.740 --> 02:28:14.740]   is that if you want to engineer a car
[02:28:14.740 --> 02:28:17.380]   to go from 70 miles an hour to 120 miles an hour,
[02:28:17.380 --> 02:28:19.080]   that's fine, you can basically, you know,
[02:28:19.080 --> 02:28:20.380]   fix a few components.
[02:28:20.380 --> 02:28:22.740]   If you want it to now go at 400 miles an hour,
[02:28:22.740 --> 02:28:25.720]   you have to completely redesign the entire car.
[02:28:25.720 --> 02:28:30.720]   Because the system has just not evolved to go that far.
[02:28:30.720 --> 02:28:33.660]   Basically, our human body has only evolved
[02:28:33.660 --> 02:28:36.140]   to live to, I don't know, 120.
[02:28:36.140 --> 02:28:39.180]   Maybe we can get to 150 with minor changes.
[02:28:39.180 --> 02:28:41.460]   But if, you know, as we start pushing these frontiers
[02:28:41.460 --> 02:28:45.100]   for not just living, but well living,
[02:28:45.100 --> 02:28:48.120]   the F-Zine that we talked about last time.
[02:28:48.120 --> 02:28:51.460]   So to basically push F-Zine into the 80s and 90s
[02:28:51.460 --> 02:28:54.380]   and 100s and, you know, much further than that,
[02:28:54.380 --> 02:28:58.780]   we will face new challenges that have, you know,
[02:28:58.780 --> 02:29:00.300]   never been faced before.
[02:29:00.300 --> 02:29:02.220]   In terms of cancer, the number of divisions,
[02:29:02.220 --> 02:29:05.120]   in terms of Alzheimer's and brain related disorders,
[02:29:05.120 --> 02:29:08.220]   in terms of metabolic disorders, in terms of regeneration.
[02:29:08.220 --> 02:29:10.800]   There's just so many different frontiers ahead of us.
[02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:14.300]   So I am thrilled about where we're heading.
[02:29:14.300 --> 02:29:16.580]   So basically I see this confluence in my lab
[02:29:16.580 --> 02:29:20.480]   and many other labs of AI, of, you know,
[02:29:20.480 --> 02:29:23.100]   sort of, you know, the next frontier of AI for drug design.
[02:29:23.100 --> 02:29:26.460]   So basically these sort of graph neural networks
[02:29:26.460 --> 02:29:31.460]   on specific chemical designs that allow you to create
[02:29:31.460 --> 02:29:34.520]   new generations of therapeutics.
[02:29:34.520 --> 02:29:38.980]   These molecular biology tricks for intervening
[02:29:38.980 --> 02:29:41.140]   at the system at every level.
[02:29:41.140 --> 02:29:45.380]   These personalized medicine prediction, diagnosis,
[02:29:45.380 --> 02:29:49.420]   and prognosis using the electronic health records
[02:29:49.420 --> 02:29:51.900]   and using these polygenic risk scores,
[02:29:51.900 --> 02:29:55.980]   weighted by the burden, the number of mutations
[02:29:55.980 --> 02:29:57.740]   that are accumulating across common, rare
[02:29:57.740 --> 02:30:01.220]   and somatic variants, the burden converging
[02:30:01.220 --> 02:30:05.560]   across all of these different molecular pathways,
[02:30:05.560 --> 02:30:09.460]   the delivery of specific drugs and specific interventions
[02:30:09.460 --> 02:30:10.840]   into specific cell types.
[02:30:10.840 --> 02:30:12.700]   And again, you've talked with Bob Langer about this.
[02:30:12.700 --> 02:30:14.620]   There's, you know, many giants in that field.
[02:30:14.620 --> 02:30:18.500]   And then the last concept is not intervening
[02:30:18.500 --> 02:30:20.620]   at the single gene level.
[02:30:20.620 --> 02:30:23.300]   And I want you to sort of conceptualize the concept
[02:30:23.300 --> 02:30:27.540]   of an on target side effect.
[02:30:27.540 --> 02:30:29.140]   What is an on target side effect?
[02:30:29.140 --> 02:30:31.780]   An off target side effect is when you design a molecule
[02:30:31.780 --> 02:30:34.520]   to target one gene and instead it targets another gene
[02:30:34.520 --> 02:30:36.580]   and you have side effects because of that.
[02:30:36.580 --> 02:30:38.900]   An on target side effect is when your molecule
[02:30:38.900 --> 02:30:40.940]   does exactly what you were expecting,
[02:30:40.940 --> 02:30:43.580]   but that gene is pleiotropic.
[02:30:43.580 --> 02:30:46.860]   Pleio means many, tropos means ways, many ways.
[02:30:46.860 --> 02:30:48.100]   It acts in many ways.
[02:30:48.100 --> 02:30:49.980]   It's a multifunctional gene.
[02:30:49.980 --> 02:30:52.500]   So you find that this gene plays a role in this,
[02:30:52.500 --> 02:30:56.580]   but as we talked about, the wiring of genes to phenotypes
[02:30:56.580 --> 02:30:58.980]   is extremely dense and extremely complex.
[02:30:58.980 --> 02:31:03.000]   So the next stage of intervention will be intervening,
[02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.620]   not at the gene level, but at the network level.
[02:31:05.620 --> 02:31:08.620]   Intervening at the set of pathways and the set of genes
[02:31:08.620 --> 02:31:12.100]   with multi input perturbations to the system,
[02:31:12.100 --> 02:31:14.820]   multi input modulations, pharmaceutical
[02:31:14.820 --> 02:31:17.660]   or other interventional.
[02:31:17.660 --> 02:31:20.220]   That basically allow you to now work
[02:31:20.220 --> 02:31:23.900]   at the sort of full level of understanding,
[02:31:23.900 --> 02:31:26.300]   not just in your brain, but across your body,
[02:31:26.300 --> 02:31:29.020]   not just in one gene, but across the set of pathways
[02:31:29.020 --> 02:31:31.900]   and so on and so forth for every one of these disorders.
[02:31:31.900 --> 02:31:35.340]   So I think that we're finally at the level of systems
[02:31:35.340 --> 02:31:38.140]   medicine of basically instead of sort of medicine
[02:31:38.140 --> 02:31:40.340]   being at a single gene level,
[02:31:40.340 --> 02:31:42.180]   medicine being at the systems level,
[02:31:42.180 --> 02:31:45.260]   where it can be personalized based on a specific set
[02:31:45.260 --> 02:31:47.100]   of genetic markers and genetic perturbations
[02:31:47.100 --> 02:31:49.460]   that you are either born with,
[02:31:49.460 --> 02:31:52.940]   or that you have developed during your lifetime,
[02:31:52.940 --> 02:31:54.660]   your unique set of exposures,
[02:31:54.660 --> 02:31:56.940]   your unique set of biomarkers,
[02:31:56.940 --> 02:32:00.860]   and your unique set of current set of conditions
[02:32:00.860 --> 02:32:04.420]   through your EHR and other ways.
[02:32:04.420 --> 02:32:09.980]   And the precision component of intervening
[02:32:09.980 --> 02:32:12.980]   extremely precisely in the specific pathways
[02:32:12.980 --> 02:32:14.620]   and in specific combinations of genes
[02:32:14.620 --> 02:32:16.620]   that should be modulated to sort of bring you
[02:32:16.620 --> 02:32:20.620]   from the disease state to the physiologically normal state,
[02:32:20.620 --> 02:32:22.620]   or even to physiologically improved state
[02:32:22.620 --> 02:32:25.620]   through this combination of interventions.
[02:32:25.620 --> 02:32:26.980]   So that's in my view, the field
[02:32:26.980 --> 02:32:29.060]   where basically computer science comes together
[02:32:29.060 --> 02:32:31.220]   with artificial intelligence, statistics,
[02:32:31.220 --> 02:32:32.420]   all of these other tools,
[02:32:32.420 --> 02:32:34.980]   molecular biology technologies and biotechnology
[02:32:34.980 --> 02:32:36.140]   and pharmaceutical technologies
[02:32:36.140 --> 02:32:39.380]   that are sort of revolutionary in the way of intervention.
[02:32:39.380 --> 02:32:41.820]   And of course, this massive amount of molecular biology
[02:32:41.820 --> 02:32:44.500]   and data gathering and generation and perturbation
[02:32:44.500 --> 02:32:46.300]   in massively parallel ways.
[02:32:46.300 --> 02:32:49.660]   So there's no better way, there's no better time,
[02:32:49.660 --> 02:32:52.700]   there's no better place to be sort of,
[02:32:52.700 --> 02:32:56.740]   you know, looking at this whole confluence of ideas.
[02:32:56.740 --> 02:32:58.980]   And I'm just so thrilled to be a small part
[02:32:58.980 --> 02:33:01.300]   of this amazing, enormous ecosystem.
[02:33:01.300 --> 02:33:04.260]   - It's exciting to imagine what humans of 100,
[02:33:04.260 --> 02:33:08.660]   200 years from now, what their life experience is like,
[02:33:08.660 --> 02:33:12.300]   because these ideas seem to have potential
[02:33:12.300 --> 02:33:14.100]   to transform the quality of life.
[02:33:15.060 --> 02:33:18.220]   And I think that when they look back at us,
[02:33:18.220 --> 02:33:21.140]   they probably wonder how we were put up
[02:33:21.140 --> 02:33:23.500]   with all the suffering in the world.
[02:33:23.500 --> 02:33:25.180]   Manolis, it's a huge honor.
[02:33:25.180 --> 02:33:29.220]   Thank you for spending this early Sunday morning with me.
[02:33:29.220 --> 02:33:30.700]   I deeply appreciate it.
[02:33:30.700 --> 02:33:31.540]   See you next time.
[02:33:31.540 --> 02:33:32.380]   - Sounds like a plan.
[02:33:32.380 --> 02:33:33.740]   Thank you, Lex.

[02:34:14.380 --> 02:34:18.820]   And now, let me leave you some words from Haruki Murakami.
[02:34:18.820 --> 02:34:20.460]   Human beings are ultimately nothing
[02:34:20.460 --> 02:34:24.500]   but carriers, passageways for genes.
[02:34:24.500 --> 02:34:27.620]   They ride us into the ground like racehorses
[02:34:27.620 --> 02:34:30.020]   from generation to generation.
[02:34:30.020 --> 02:34:34.060]   Genes don't think about what constitutes good or evil.
[02:34:34.060 --> 02:34:37.420]   They don't care whether we're happy or unhappy.
[02:34:37.420 --> 02:34:39.940]   We're just means to an end for them.
[02:34:39.940 --> 02:34:42.540]   The only thing they think about
[02:34:42.540 --> 02:34:44.780]   is what is most efficient for them.
[02:34:44.780 --> 02:34:49.200]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
