[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100]   The following is a conversation with Robert Breedlove,
[00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.800]   someone who caught my attention and was recommended highly
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.560]   as a rigorous scholar and thinker
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.160]   in the space of decentralized finance and Bitcoin.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.200]   His podcast titled "What is Money?"
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.280]   is a good representation of the way his mind works.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.600]   He's willing to talk through ideas for many hours,
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.080]   willing to listen, willing to think,
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.800]   which makes him a great companion and conversation
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.060]   to explore the history, philosophy, and future of money.
[00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.760]   Quick mention of our sponsors,
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.240]   Fundrise, Element, MonkPak, and BetterHelp.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.800]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.360]   As a side note, let me say that I'll have a number
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.040]   of conversations in the coming months
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.360]   on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.320]   None of these conversations are financial advice.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.660]   That's not a legal warning.
[00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.400]   That's a genuine description of my goals
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.480]   and approach with these chats.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.560]   At least for a while, I personally won't actively invest
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.360]   in Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies,
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.480]   except to learn about the technology itself.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.920]   I don't think this should be a journalistic standard
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.320]   like the New York Times trying to establish,
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.120]   which I very much disagree with.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.640]   In my humble opinion, I think journalists should be free
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.240]   to invest in Bitcoin if they want to.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.460]   Luckily, I'm not a journalist.
[00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.660]   I just know my own psychology and I feel
[00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.360]   that my thinking will be muddled by excitement
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.000]   if I invest before I understand.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.340]   I feel the same way about Tesla, for example.
[00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.840]   I still don't own any Tesla stock,
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.340]   and I am still indeed fascinated by Tesla Autopilot
[00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.500]   as an artificial intelligence system.
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.620]   I work hard to be cognizant of the biases
[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.280]   that arise in my mind and always try to choose the path
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.040]   that maximizes or maintains a freedom of thought
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.200]   as much as possible.
[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.180]   Also, let me say that I try to be very careful
[00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.420]   in selecting guests based not only on the contents
[00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.020]   of their ideas, but the richness, complexity, music,
[00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.140]   style of their mind and character.
[00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.020]   Yes, I will talk with people with whom you
[00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.080]   and I may disagree, people who some may call bad
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.820]   or even evil human beings.
[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.100]   I want to understand them because I believe that,
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.500]   as Solzhenitsyn said, the battle line between good and evil
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.140]   runs through the heart of every man.
[00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.020]   I think if you always run from evil,
[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.460]   you become blind to the truth of human nature.
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.780]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,
[00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.320]   and here is my conversation with Robert Breedlove.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.460]   Rousseau opens his 1762 book, "The Social Contract,"
[00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.300]   with the following statement, "Man is born free,
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.460]   "and everywhere he's in chains."
[00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.800]   So you talk about freedom and sovereignty quite a bit.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.640]   What do these ideas mean to you, the idea of sovereignty?
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.280]   - Freedom and sovereignty,
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.120]   I think they're very closely related.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.740]   It started just focusing on sovereignty,
[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.820]   which is a word I don't think we talk about enough.
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.100]   And the general definition of that I would give
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.080]   is the authority to act as you see fit.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.840]   And it's a word that's etymologically associated
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.260]   with words like monarchy, money, reign.
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.540]   So historically, it's referred to whatever the locus
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.220]   of supreme power is in the sphere of human action.
[00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.140]   So whether, if you go like back in ancient Egypt,
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.420]   the pharaoh had absolute sovereignty,
[00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.380]   and everyone else was pretty much
[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.820]   operating according to his interest.
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.180]   You fast forward to today, modern Western democracy,
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.380]   we have more decentralized sovereignty
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.380]   in that we all get to go vote and elect officials
[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.700]   that make decisions on our behalf.
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.980]   So the theme of sovereignty across history
[00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.780]   is that it's been gradually decentralizing
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.400]   across our different models of socioeconomics.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.100]   And it's largely, you could say it's rooted heavily
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.100]   in the money, I would argue,
[00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.700]   which is something we'll get a lot into here,
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.320]   where if you have money, you have the authority
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.060]   to act as you see fit in the world.
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.180]   And even in our current political sphere,
[00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.000]   if you have enough money,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.020]   you can actually reshape the rules, right?
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.220]   You can reshape laws, you can lobby Congress.
[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.660]   If you're in a certain situation, like many billionaires,
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.660]   you can negotiate your own tax treaty,
[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.540]   such that you can get favorable tax treatment
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.460]   with certain jurisdictions in the world.
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.720]   So this concept of sovereignty,
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.460]   which today we call, it's common to call states
[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.100]   or nation states or governments sovereign,
[00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.140]   meaning that they have power over people.
[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.100]   But as I argue in a lot of my writing,
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.060]   I actually think that sovereignty
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.980]   and here's within the individual,
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.740]   and that we each have our own interiorized space of choice,
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.580]   which is something like Viktor Frankl called
[00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.140]   the final human freedom.
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.460]   And that we, no matter what our circumstances are,
[00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.380]   no matter what exogenous situation we face,
[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.420]   we always have this endogenous power
[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.700]   to choose how we respond to it.
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.860]   - That's one of my favorite books is "Man's Search
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.180]   for Meaning."
[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.380]   Maybe we can break that apart a little bit.
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.900]   So you've kind of spoken about sovereignty
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.020]   as closely linked to power,
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.260]   but is there something about your own mind
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.420]   being able to achieve sovereignty,
[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.300]   no matter what the monetary system is,
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.260]   no matter what, who has the control
[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.720]   over centralized power, the money,
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.100]   or whatever the mechanisms of sovereignty
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.340]   at the societal level.
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.260]   You as an individual, isn't ultimately all boiled down
[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.100]   to what you can do with your own mind,
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.620]   how you see the world?
[00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.660]   - Yes. - How you interpret it.
[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.060]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.580]   And as we get a little bit deeper into this,
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.660]   I think we'll come to see money as an extension
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.620]   of your mind.
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.620]   So there's a feedback between money and mind.
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.880]   For instance, you think in dollars today,
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.480]   almost guarantee it, most of us do here in the US.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.260]   And it's a tool, right?
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.340]   It's a tool we're using to decomplexify the world around us,
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.700]   to deal with it, to understand the sacrifices
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.780]   and successes across an entire history
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:10.900]   of economic transactions.
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.460]   We can boil that all down to the price.
[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.380]   So it's data compression.
[00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:19.380]   And if you can change, if there's a central body,
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.500]   or central governance mechanism that can manipulate
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.860]   that money, it can have an impact on your mind.
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.220]   For instance, today, so I agree with you on the first hand,
[00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.180]   say that I do believe in free will.
[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.900]   I do believe in individual autonomy.
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.700]   But I also think that there are certain devices
[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.000]   and powers in the world around us
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.140]   that can actually influence how we think.
[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.260]   And it's fascinating to think about the fact
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.940]   that money might be actually deeply integrated
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.860]   into the way we think and into our mind.
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.100]   Like this is, you think about what are the core aspects
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.100]   of the human mind?
[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.980]   What influences cognition,
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.340]   the way you reason about the world?
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.180]   You have the Chomsky-like languages
[00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.100]   at the core of everything.
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.880]   But you're kind of placing money as pretty close
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.620]   to the core of what it means to be
[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.960]   an intelligent, reasoning human.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.020]   I think money is a direct derivation of action
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.100]   and speech, actually.
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.060]   It's another expression of the logos.
[00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:22.140]   If we even think of what it means to think,
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:26.880]   is that we are generating two different courses of action,
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.620]   potential courses of action,
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.140]   and we're populating them with avatars, right?
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.660]   Maybe ourselves or others.
[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.020]   And then we're comparing how we may act in each situation
[00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.420]   and what we think the result would be.
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.220]   So actually, it's comparison.
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.880]   Basically, it's comparison and contrasting
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.280]   of possible courses of action.
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.400]   And that's the same thing with words themselves.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:53.180]   Most words, the vast majority of words,
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.760]   only have meaning in relationship to other words.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.520]   It's all contextual definitions of a word or more words.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.120]   Now, people have argued with me about this
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.800]   because there is a first word, right,
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.920]   where you pick up rock and say rock.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.300]   But most other words, in higher abstraction,
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.400]   tend to be relative.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.400]   And what's funny about action and speech,
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.400]   and this gets, I got into a bit of this in our paper here,
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.760]   is that it's linked to evolutionary biology,
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.400]   and that once human beings adopted upright stance,
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.920]   we freed our hands.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.280]   We no longer needed our hands for locomotion.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.100]   So we started to evolve more dexterity,
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.920]   and notably, we have opposable thumbs.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.540]   So this gives us an ability to manipulate
[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:39.960]   and particularize the environment
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.360]   in a way that most other animals cannot.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.120]   And what's interesting about this is that
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:49.020]   as we gain this ability to manipulate natural resources
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.040]   and count, point, pointing was a big deal,
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.720]   and that we could indicate prey or items
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.560]   that are far off distance, and we could organize ourselves,
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:04.220]   we, at the same time, we co-evolved this fine musculature
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.960]   in the face and tongue.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.940]   So it's as if speech developed,
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:09.960]   co-evolved really with our dexterity.
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:15.840]   And as a natural extension of that came us making tools.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.400]   We started to create things
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.280]   to better satisfy our wants over time.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.960]   And the most tradable tool in any society,
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.680]   or the most tradable thing is money.
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:31.240]   So I really, I argue that action and speech
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.220]   are quintessential modes of self-sovereign expression.
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.260]   And the money is just sort of a tech layer
[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.860]   we've put right on top of that,
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.260]   and that it's a natural derivation of action and speech.
[00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.940]   - Okay, that's fascinating to think about sovereignty
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.220]   from the evolutionary perspective.
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.180]   And then ultimately, money is the technology layer
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.980]   that enables sovereignty.
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:56.980]   So, you know, it's really fascinating to think about
[00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:01.100]   our modern human society as deeply rooted
[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.260]   in these evolutionary roots
[00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.380]   from the very origins of life on earth.
[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:09.780]   So what, you know, some of the ideas you just mentioned,
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.080]   what do you see are some interesting characteristics
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:17.120]   of just life on earth that propagated to us humans?
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.940]   Like what ideas propagated through,
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.540]   have roots in the evolution?
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:28.060]   - Yeah, I think one of the deepest impulsions in life
[00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.900]   is the territorial imperative.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.460]   So all life is seeking to expand
[00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.220]   its dominion over space and time.
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:40.940]   And we think about, you know, again, physically with space,
[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.720]   it's advantageous to an animal or an organism
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.920]   to have more territory under its control to raise offspring.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.660]   So it's all about reproductive fitness
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:50.860]   at the end of the day.
[00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.820]   And then we'd also think of reproduction itself
[00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:57.000]   as the genetic impulse to have more,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.880]   to replicate oneself across time.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.140]   So it's territoriality across time in a way.
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.040]   And this is very common in most animals.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.380]   Not all animals are territorial, but many are.
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.980]   And you see very interesting behaviors
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.560]   resulting from territoriality.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.780]   This is like animal combat.
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.640]   You know, the reason birds sing is territoriality,
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.660]   a number of other things.
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.420]   And it's my hypothesis,
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.260]   and others have shared this hypothesis as well,
[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.640]   that mankind is clearly, I think,
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.280]   would argue a territorial species,
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.940]   and that he expresses this territoriality
[00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.140]   in property rights.
[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:38.200]   So property, when we hear that word,
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.480]   we typically think of an asset.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.240]   We think of, oh, this house or this stock or whatever.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.080]   But property is actually the socially acknowledged
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.160]   relationship between a human and an asset,
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.100]   such that you have exclusive rights and responsibilities
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.860]   to a particular asset.
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.520]   It is not the asset itself.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.520]   So property, it's information, it's a relationship.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.160]   - By the way, my mind was just blown.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.240]   Property is information, it's not the actual asset.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.600]   That's really important.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.600]   - Very important.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.560]   - That's really interesting.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.120]   - Yeah, and then it comes down to
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.600]   how do we organize ourselves such that
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:19.440]   property, that the contributions people are making
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.200]   are commensurate with the consideration they're receiving.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.740]   So if you're adding value to a piece of property,
[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.920]   you're developing a piece of land for use,
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.880]   in theory, to be fair, you should have the rights
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:32.820]   to that fruit, right?
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.580]   If you go out and plant a garden or whatever it may be.
[00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:41.620]   And this is very, this is rooted in natural law,
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.420]   where we have rights to life, liberty, and property.
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.000]   Those are kind of just the base,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.920]   the fundamental layer of morality and capitalism, frankly.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:54.340]   And you could think of, to get really primordial with it,
[00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:58.020]   the first capitalist in the world,
[00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.740]   just to kind of get some definitions out here,
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:03.980]   I'll say capitalism versus communism or socialism,
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.100]   as the spectrum I'll speak on.
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.440]   The first capitalist in the world would be the guy,
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.420]   the caveman that maybe dug a little hole for himself
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.960]   to shield himself from the elements, right?
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.260]   Maybe there was a rainstorm or a snowstorm
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.620]   and he dug a little enclave and he protected himself.
[00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.900]   - I thought you were gonna go, 'cause you said primordial,
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:23.820]   I thought you were gonna go back
[00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.180]   to earlier biological systems.
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.100]   - I guess primordial for human, perhaps.
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.580]   - For humans, yeah.
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:31.420]   Okay.
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.060]   - And then the first communist or socialist
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.220]   would be someone that decided the fruits
[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.780]   of his labor belonged to him.
[00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.260]   So he would have violently encroached on that individual
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.100]   and taken his plot for himself, for his own use.
[00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:50.140]   And that's the spectrum across which capitalism
[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:53.540]   in the pure sense and communism in the pure sense operate
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:57.620]   in that capitalism, each individual has the exclusive rights
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.180]   to the fruits of their labor.
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:02.140]   So anything they spend their time, effort, energy,
[00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.960]   creating in the world, they own the rights to that
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.100]   and they can trade those rights with others,
[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.380]   other self-owned people that have done similar things.
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:13.740]   Communism or socialism would imply that other people,
[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.040]   typically the state, have the rights,
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.580]   at least some rights to the value you've created.
[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.380]   - So there's this interesting moment
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.820]   when that first caveman, that first capitalist,
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:28.300]   drew a line, a circle in this cave and said,
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.940]   this is mine.
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.260]   You could say it was free to be claimed
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:33.660]   at the time he claimed it.
[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:39.620]   But it's an interesting moment when asset becomes an asset,
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:43.600]   when space-time, as you were referring to it,
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.980]   becomes something that's now,
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.940]   can be possessed by a human being.
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:51.100]   Is there something special about this moment?
[00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.820]   Because it feels like, first of all,
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.300]   in terms of space and time,
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:15:01.060]   it feels like there's a lot of available space-time
[00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.660]   yet to be claimed.
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.380]   So if we just look at like the universe, right?
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:06.940]   We're talking about, there's a funny thing
[00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:08.940]   with Elon Musk and Mars.
[00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:12.700]   I think they sneaked in there for SpaceX
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:17.560]   that nobody on earth has any authority on Mars or any,
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:18.980]   this is a very interesting question.
[00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.980]   It seems almost like humorous at this time,
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.600]   but perhaps not.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.200]   Perhaps there'll be sections of space,
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.020]   not just on planets, that are gonna be even fought over.
[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.000]   So is there something special about this moment?
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.160]   Because in discussing sort of violence
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.680]   and respect for property,
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.280]   it feels like this is a special moment
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.740]   because ultimately conflict arises
[00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:46.620]   when you make claims on a particular territory.
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:50.220]   It's not always in conflict where people say,
[00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.820]   when you look at Hitler or something, for example,
[00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.660]   his claim would be in many of the lands
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:58.220]   that he attacked and invaded,
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.740]   that this is ultimately,
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:01.780]   this has always belonged to Germany.
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:04.860]   So is there something you could say
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:09.480]   as to what it means to own an asset or a property?
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:14.000]   - Yeah, so in the ancient days of hunters and gatherers,
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   we could say that property was mostly a loyal title,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.600]   which meant it's just whatever you can defend.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.640]   So if you've got knives and daggers and satchels
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.760]   and maybe some pelts you've hunted,
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.160]   whatever you can hold and defend is yours.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.920]   And there's not like there's a government
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.780]   to appeal to, you're just sort of a free agent
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.140]   operating in the wild,
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.720]   defending the assets you can protect on you more or less.
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:48.380]   And what really changed the nature of property
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.780]   is when we get into the agricultural age.
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:55.260]   So there's a big flip where we went from just foraging
[00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.300]   and hunting all the time, constantly moving,
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.420]   trying to stay alive to deciding we're gonna settle here.
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.200]   We figured out how to cultivate crops.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.100]   We can create, we can increase the population
[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:08.500]   'cause we can harvest more energy from the sun
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.300]   and we can establish a longer term civilization.
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.600]   What happens in that transition
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.500]   is that we begin creating economic surplus.
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.660]   So for the first time in history,
[00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:22.020]   we have grain, stock houses of grain to defend
[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:25.260]   or maybe meat or cattle or whatever it is we're creating,
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.040]   we now have savings.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:32.980]   And it's at that time when government emerges as well.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.120]   Because once you have savings,
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.340]   so you have an economic surplus,
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:39.320]   you have something that other people want to steal.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.800]   This one thing we'll touch on a lot today
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.320]   is people always want something for nothing.
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:47.480]   People are always seeking the path
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.400]   to get something for nothing.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.640]   And I think that drives a lot of our decision making.
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.720]   And it actually encourages us to be innovative
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.560]   in a lot of ways.
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.100]   We're trying to, you could say it's our laziness
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.800]   that's helping us be inventive in a way.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.440]   We're trying to accomplish greater results
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.960]   with less efforts over time.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.280]   But we can cross that line
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.480]   in seeking something for nothing
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.960]   where we start to violate the life,
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.320]   liberty and property of others.
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.200]   And that's where we shift from kind of capitalistic society
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.600]   to something more communistic.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.880]   And so that's what government is.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.720]   It's a protection producing enterprise
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.900]   for the economic surplus generated by a trading society.
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.500]   So when people begin to trade,
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.960]   they create what's called the division of labor,
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.040]   which is a very common economics term.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.440]   Basically means you're better at making hats,
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.440]   I'm better at making boots.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.840]   If you specialize in hats, I specialize in boots
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.600]   and we trade, we've created a positive sum game
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:43.840]   where you and I both benefit.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.000]   So we become collectively more than the sum of our parts
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.320]   through trade.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.360]   And that's why human beings do trade
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.020]   because we become more energy efficient as a result.
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.560]   We create more outputs per unit of input.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.280]   And you can think of government in that respect,
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.240]   if we're looking at it, maybe in a tech sense
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.920]   that the economy is the trade network
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.380]   that generates wealth, generates innovation,
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:09.120]   generates all this whole lap of luxury we live in today
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.680]   that we've inherited from our forebears is from the market.
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.120]   It's not from a government.
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.500]   The government is the network security, if you will.
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:21.880]   So we're paying expenses to a vendor to protect peace,
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.480]   to preserve life, liberty and property in that network
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.760]   so that we can have,
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.120]   when there's inevitably disputes over private property,
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.720]   we can have nonviolent dispute resolution
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.960]   in the rule of law.
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:36.040]   And we can have a reasonable expectation
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.440]   of being able to conduct commerce without violence.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.960]   The problem has been that the protector tends to,
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.080]   they're in a monopolistic position, we'd say.
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.260]   They tend to start abusing that position
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:53.040]   to obtain property for themselves.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:55.840]   Again, trying to get that something for nothing.
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:00.320]   When you control, you are the security guard
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.200]   for the economy,
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.680]   the first thing they tend to monopolize is money.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.840]   Because if you can control the money,
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.220]   you're effectively controlling people,
[00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:09.240]   their energy, their perceptions.
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:14.560]   And that becomes a, particularly through inflation,
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.520]   becomes an avenue to get something for nothing.
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.000]   And that you can just print more money
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.360]   that everyone else is forced to sacrifice
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.100]   their time and energy to obtain.
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.560]   - What are your thoughts about anarchism?
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.440]   So I talked quite a bit,
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.220]   he'll be here in a few days actually, Michael Malice,
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:36.800]   about ideas of anarchy and his idea,
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.400]   or the idea of anarchists is that
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.080]   any amount of government will eventually become
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:45.660]   the very kind of thing that you're referring to.
[00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:48.480]   So there's almost no way to have a government
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:52.200]   that doesn't then try to monopolize power,
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.360]   money and all those kinds of things.
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.900]   Do you think it's possible to have a government
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.760]   sort of on that spectrum of like anarchy,
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.000]   maybe libertarianism,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.600]   I'm not sure how exactly the spectrum goes,
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.160]   but where you have a small government
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.040]   that protects the liberty and property rights
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.680]   and those kinds of things,
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.600]   and doesn't expand to then also control
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:17.640]   the monetary system and all those other things?
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.860]   - Agreed, agreed completely.
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:23.080]   It was not possible until Satoshi Nakamoto.
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.600]   So for the first time in history,
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:29.180]   we have a money that cannot be monopolized,
[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:32.020]   cannot be corrupted, cannot be changed,
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.440]   cannot be weaponized, frankly.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.680]   Our current monetary system is weaponized
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.400]   by those who can print money against those who cannot.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:45.080]   And I think when you have,
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.880]   at the heart of every modern economy,
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.600]   which even we could say the US,
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.920]   we pride ourselves as free market capitalist,
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.320]   we out-competed communism in the 20th century,
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.440]   we think that this is the superior model.
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:00.540]   Most business people will tell you
[00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:03.800]   that the free market is the best allocator of resources,
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.280]   all of these things.
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.520]   But what we have at the heart of every modern economy,
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.760]   including the US, is an anti-capitalistic institution,
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.060]   which is the central bank.
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:16.360]   The temptation to monopolize money throughout all of history
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.680]   has been too strong for anyone to resist.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.520]   So any, even benevolent, quote-unquote,
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.400]   dictators that have taken over,
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.960]   many dictators have inherited, say, an inflationary regime,
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.280]   where society's coming apart
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.560]   because someone was clipping the coins
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.240]   or someone was printing too much money,
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.160]   and they'll commit to going back to a hard money standard.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.840]   So they'll keep society on a gold standard, for instance,
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.400]   such that they cannot violate
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.120]   the money to benefit themselves.
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.400]   But inevitably over time,
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.880]   because it is a political institution,
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.680]   there's an incentive there, right,
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.160]   for, again, to get something for nothing,
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:57.280]   to spend more than you're making through tax revenues.
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.720]   And with that incentive,
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.140]   people typically ultimately end up pursuing
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:02.560]   that inflationary path.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:06.720]   So we get deeper into that about,
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.440]   inflation is a term that we've been conditioned
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.000]   to think today is just something normal,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.160]   the prices just go up,
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:16.600]   and then it's pertinent to a healthy economy,
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.880]   but it's actually,
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.360]   if you look at it from real first principles,
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.600]   it is just theft integrated into the money.
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.040]   It's a technology backdoor,
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.480]   is another way to think about it.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.000]   You wouldn't buy a cell phone
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.560]   knowing that someone could siphon your data
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.080]   off of your private calls and sell it into the market.
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.760]   Now, I know we do that with a lot of social media stuff
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.280]   today, and that's something else we can get into,
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.360]   but you wouldn't do it willingly, right?
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.360]   You would prefer that your cell phone and your data
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.080]   was monetized by you,
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.200]   or if you're gonna sell it,
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.480]   you would be able to selectively sell it.
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:49.120]   Inflation is that, it's similar, it's a tech backdoor.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:53.520]   So it's a money that only a few people
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.280]   can siphon value off of surreptitiously,
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.360]   typically slowly,
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.120]   but eventually as we've seen throughout history,
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.600]   that slowly builds up into a rapidly
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.840]   and then causes the monetary system to collapse.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.440]   - Do you think there's a benefit to inflation possibly?
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.360]   So when you have perfect information,
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.280]   but perhaps you don't need inflation,
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.040]   perhaps it is purely theft,
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.600]   but I think of inflation as like the snooze button
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:19.560]   on the alarm.
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:23.520]   So if you have a hard standard,
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.880]   you better wake up when the alarm rings,
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:29.400]   but all of us kind of like, probably shouldn't,
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.760]   but use the snooze button.
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.320]   It's like, okay, well, five more minutes,
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.160]   10 more minutes.
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:37.000]   And then you're saying there's naturally a slippery slope
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.160]   where it becomes a drug that you fall in love with
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.840]   and you abuse.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:46.280]   But nevertheless, the usefulness of the snooze button
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.840]   is that you don't know how you'll be actually feeling
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.320]   when the alarm rings.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.200]   You might be able to ready to pop up.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.240]   It might be like, you really need those few more minutes
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.560]   like to psychologically get yourself out of bed.
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.520]   This metaphor is just not working at all.
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:01.360]   - No, no.
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:05.000]   - Do you think there's a use to inflation sometimes
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   from like an economics perspective?
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.760]   - I think the drug metaphor is a little more apt
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.400]   in that inflation does provide
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:17.400]   an immediately stimulative effect when used early on.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:23.120]   But what it's doing is it's, again,
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:26.280]   we talk about the balance between incentives
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.480]   and disincentives, right?
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:31.040]   That being necessary for a system to function properly.
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:34.080]   With inflation, you're essentially giving
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:37.280]   the people that can print money
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:40.760]   a way to dampen the disincentives they face.
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:45.760]   So it destroys feedback loops, I guess you might say.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:49.360]   And another way to look at this is when you,
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.280]   so using inflation, using quantitative easing,
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:56.880]   you can decrease short-term volatility in the marketplace.
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:01.120]   So the market is basically this idea,
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.440]   this form of free exchange
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.480]   that's trying to zero in on the best ideas.
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.040]   And the ideas are those that are most fit to reality,
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.800]   to satisfying the most wants.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.360]   It's gonna overshoot, it's gonna undershoot,
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.000]   you have these little business cycles.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.520]   But when it's undershooting
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.840]   and you're experiencing a business recession,
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.160]   in a capitalist environment,
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.960]   the market needs to clear that malinvestment,
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.280]   that misallocation of capital.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:25.440]   That means someone made a bet on a certain idea
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.840]   that it would satisfy wants in a particular way,
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.440]   and that bet did not pan out.
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:33.000]   If you then paper over the losses that business is creating,
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.840]   you're now delaying and exacerbating the volatility
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.160]   that that idea created.
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.400]   So this is kind of a Talebian concept
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:46.080]   where you can dampen short-run volatility,
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.320]   but volatility is truth.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:53.320]   Volatility is us matching our ideas to reality.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.200]   We're constantly, again, overshooting and undershooting.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.640]   So you delay volatility,
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:58.880]   you're just amplifying it
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.160]   and exacerbating it in the long run.
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.720]   And that's what central bank is doing.
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:06.880]   The central bank mandate is low unemployment
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:11.280]   and low unexpected inflation, basically.
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:16.840]   And so they're trying to achieve economic growth
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.520]   in a stable way, quote unquote stable way.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.220]   This is their ostensible purpose.
[00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.960]   And that's just not possible.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.700]   Growth is an inherently instable process.
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:29.400]   Can you elaborate a little bit
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:33.360]   about the nature of volatility?
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.820]   Why is it communicating truth?
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:39.040]   That's something that a lot of people are afraid of,
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.320]   is the volatility.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:44.240]   Almost like it's a sign of chaos.
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:48.240]   And so they want to escape chaos.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.720]   But you're saying that that's actually,
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.640]   whether it's chaos or not, I don't know,
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:57.600]   but it's getting us closer to the fundamental reality
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.080]   that we should not be trying to escape.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:04.960]   - Yeah, so if we consider that the universe
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.960]   is pervaded by entropy, right?
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.760]   This is the second law of thermodynamics,
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.560]   is that every closed system tends
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:12.600]   towards greater disorder over time.
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.880]   And that life itself, again, I would argue,
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.720]   expressed through the logos,
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:22.160]   we, life, is the anti-entropic principle.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.720]   It's the only thing that's converting entropy into order,
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.480]   chaos into order.
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.940]   And that's what entrepreneurs are doing, right?
[00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:32.680]   We're living at the edges of the known,
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:36.040]   and we're trying to, we're testing ourself
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.200]   against the entropy of nature,
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.880]   trying to figure out new and better ways
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.000]   of saying, doing, or making things.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.240]   And then if we do crack a code or figure something out,
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.640]   we then have a big incentive.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.120]   The incentive is to get rich, right?
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:48.360]   Because then you have a new idea
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.880]   that you could then sell back into the marketplace.
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:55.880]   So it's this sequence of courageously
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.680]   confronting the entropy of nature
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.800]   and converting it into good and useful order,
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.280]   which by the way, is like the ancient idea of God
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.380]   and Genesis, which I think is interesting,
[00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:10.080]   that actually enables us to construct civilization
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:14.880]   in these layers of anti-entropy or order, you might say.
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:19.880]   So today we live in a bubble of anti-entropy or order.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:23.280]   You know, like the coastlines are guarded by the nation
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.360]   and the city has a certain police force
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.680]   that keeps it in order.
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:32.800]   Even the way we talk, like clearly the words matter,
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.440]   but also the nonverbal cues, all these things are like order
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:38.920]   that has been established over many, many, many thousands
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:40.760]   of years of human evolution.
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:46.640]   And I think that when I say volatility is truth,
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:50.280]   what I'm saying is that the experience of uncertainty
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.560]   is something that's ineradicable from life, right?
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:57.040]   Uncertainty, like it's kind of a paradox
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.960]   because we're fighting against it, right?
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.440]   We're trying to innovate our way away from uncertainty
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.600]   to give us, to create more capital,
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:08.600]   which capital is very simply a way of mitigating uncertainty.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:12.320]   So this is why you might have like a stash of food
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.560]   in case the power goes out or a generator,
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:17.760]   like it helps you overcome uncertainty over time.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:21.400]   But uncertainty is also where all the sweetness of life is.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.640]   So there's gotta be this balance
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.240]   with one foot in, one foot out.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.480]   - So human society is this kind of bubble of order
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:30.460]   that we've constructed and slowly expanding,
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:33.160]   but at the edges, you're always going to have that chaos,
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:36.160]   that volatility, and that the entrepreneurs
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:39.480]   are kind of like jumping into that chaos
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.000]   and some of them die and some of them succeed.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.360]   And so like, if you wanna grow this bubble of order,
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:51.360]   you have to be embracing the volatility at the edges.
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:52.200]   - Yes.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.080]   And reverence for entrepreneurship,
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:58.960]   because these are the people putting their neck out,
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:01.280]   so to speak, risking themselves.
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:03.200]   And they're gonna contribute to society, by the way,
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.080]   whether they go up in flames or not.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.320]   If they go up in flames,
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.560]   society has witnessed their experience
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:09.600]   as something not to do,
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.360]   or something that doesn't work in a particular time and place
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:13.680]   so that you could say they're,
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:14.800]   them going up in flames
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.800]   is a way of enlightening the rest of us.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.000]   Or if they figure something out,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.840]   Steve Jobs creates the iPhone,
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.760]   it changes the world forever.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.400]   - Enlightening the rest of us.
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.800]   (laughing)
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:26.640]   - And Taleb would say--
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.600]   - With the fire of their failure, okay.
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.040]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.460]   Taleb would say,
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:36.240]   individual fragility is inseparable
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.600]   from ensemble anti-fragility.
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.660]   So this means that, again,
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:42.800]   every time that entrepreneur goes up in flames,
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:46.080]   or say a restaurant goes out of business,
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.440]   when a restaurant goes out of business,
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.280]   that particular cuisine strategy they were implementing
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.620]   in that particular time and place,
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:53.560]   that's a signal to all the other restaurants in the area
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.940]   that that doesn't work.
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:59.720]   So restaurant food improves from bankruptcy to bankruptcy.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.480]   So it's this death of the individual components
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:05.520]   that contributes to the growth of the ensemble.
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.920]   - As a small aside, maybe you can guide me through it.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.360]   I don't know if you're paying attention,
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:13.800]   but there was some chaos around Taleb
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.600]   and the Bitcoin community.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.960]   I wasn't quite paying attention,
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.200]   but from my outsider's perspective,
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:24.520]   I thought it seemed Taleb was a supporter of Bitcoin.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.880]   And then a lot of people were very upset about something.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.240]   I'm sorry if I don't know the details,
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:33.040]   but can you pull out some profound philosophical ideas
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.880]   from the disagreement of the chaos?
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.960]   - I admittedly don't know too much about it either.
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.160]   I'm a big fan of his writing.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:45.800]   He's always been a little different in person.
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.520]   Like I actually, he signed one of my books,
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:48.360]   I met him in person.
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.640]   He's got a very abrasive personality.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.320]   He's kind of known for it.
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.120]   I don't think I'm passing any judgment here.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.000]   He sort of embraces it.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   But he had written the forward
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.680]   to a really important book in Bitcoin
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.800]   called "The Bitcoin Standard" for Safetine Amoose.
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.880]   And then I think they had a little Twitter beef
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:10.880]   because Safetine is very much against COVID mask
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.720]   and state intervention,
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.360]   whereas Taleb's on the other side of the fence.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.920]   And so, and then after that beef,
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.600]   Taleb came out against Bitcoiners saying,
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.840]   "Oh, Bitcoiners are crazy and wrong."
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:24.680]   - I think the great mask debate of the 2020
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:25.840]   will probably be the thing
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.360]   that ultimately leads to World War III.
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:33.360]   I've been very surprised how tense, how much like division
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:38.760]   this one little arguably silly thing has led to.
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.560]   I think a lot of people sort of project their,
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:44.000]   like it's almost like not wearing a mask
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.480]   is a statement of sovereignty, of freedom,
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:49.320]   of like saying, "Fuck you" to the man, the government,
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:53.160]   the centralized power, or the dishonesty,
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:56.240]   or in the scientific community, all those kinds of things.
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:59.520]   And then wearing a mask is a sort of kind of signaling
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:03.600]   of various kind of social aspect.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.520]   I don't know, I'm not paying attention to it.
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.840]   I actually tuned out.
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.480]   I was part of a group of scientists
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.600]   that were looking into like, do masks work?
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.000]   This very interesting question.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.880]   To me, it was an interesting question.
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:17.600]   I sort of roll in to ask that very interesting question
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.520]   'cause I think it is an interesting scientific question,
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:23.840]   but then I quickly realized that just as I was doing this,
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.800]   like scientific exploration of this very interesting
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:30.320]   question about Viron particles, like what kind of things,
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.320]   like from a scientific perspective,
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.400]   how do we prevent the spread of a pandemic?
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:38.040]   Forget COVID, any pandemic, super deadly or not deadly.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.680]   Like there's tools, there's testing, there's masks,
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.200]   there's all these tools, how well do they work?
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:46.760]   And then I realized, in April or so,
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.960]   it became a tool of politics, a tool of philosophy.
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.920]   And that's when I sort of pulled out.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:52.740]   So it's fascinating.
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:56.740]   I think it's a canvas on which people project
[00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:58.520]   their emotions and I guess,
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:01.000]   until I got caught up in that kind of,
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.480]   so there's nothing fundamental,
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:04.540]   I suppose, to their disagreement.
[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:07.040]   - Not that I'm aware of, but he is,
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:11.320]   he's written some about, in his books,
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.200]   the problem with centralization.
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.840]   I mean, a lot of his writing addresses that
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:18.600]   and he actually points to, I think Switzerland
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:20.280]   is the best government in the world
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.720]   because it's decentralized.
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:25.120]   So there's that.
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:28.420]   I don't think he has any, not to speak for him,
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:32.840]   but I don't think he's voiced any specific critiques
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.640]   on Bitcoin per se.
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:35.720]   Could be wrong about that.
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.800]   - It's just maybe his flavorful language
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.560]   and the way he likes to communicate.
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:42.280]   - And the other theory is that maybe he's playing 4D chess
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.600]   and having a Twitter boating accident.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.160]   So he's, I don't believe in Bitcoin,
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:48.140]   I've sold all my Bitcoin.
[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:48.980]   - Oh, I see.
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:49.800]   - Yeah.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:53.780]   Sorry, the boating accident in Bitcoin is this,
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:56.720]   I guess it's proverbial by this point,
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:59.360]   where it's the way you lose your Bitcoin.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:00.880]   So if someone comes after you and says,
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.880]   hey, whether it's a government
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.200]   or an individual's coming after you saying,
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:06.760]   give me all your Bitcoin or pay these taxes in Bitcoin,
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.040]   you go, oh, I had a boating accident and lost them all.
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:09.880]   - Lost them all.
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:10.720]   - So, yeah.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:13.400]   (laughing)
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:16.480]   - But back to the fundamental nature of space-time.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:20.200]   Let me ask you, 'cause we're kind of left it,
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.700]   I'd like to go back to this idea of,
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.880]   that you said that everything we think, say, or do
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:29.100]   occurs within the bounds of space-time.
[00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:33.600]   So first of all, maybe you can comment on
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:37.120]   what do you mean in this context about space-time,
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:40.640]   but also about the nature of truth.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:43.480]   Like how much of all of this is knowable?
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:46.400]   How much of this is accessible to us humans?
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:49.160]   How much uncertainty, like we're talking about,
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.680]   is there in the world?
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:53.360]   Are you, do you fall in a place where
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:57.000]   we can reason deeply about this world and it's knowable,
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.360]   or is it mostly chaos and we're just holding on
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:00.200]   for dear life?
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:04.160]   - Yeah, I think I said that all action occurs
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.480]   within the bounds of space-time.
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:08.120]   The other thing, everything we say, do, or make,
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:10.320]   the other thing is that everything we say, do, or make
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.400]   starts out as an idea.
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:15.440]   So there's this concept of universal Darwinism,
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:20.000]   which basically applies Darwinian principles,
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.880]   but outside of the biological sphere.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:23.600]   So we could say that this kind of gets
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.080]   into Richard Dawkins' memetics,
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:29.120]   that even ideas are competing, reproducing, recombining.
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.800]   - That idea is so powerful, by the way.
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.540]   I don't think it's been understood fully.
[00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:38.840]   I think in the digital, in the 21st century,
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.520]   in the digital world, from my perspective,
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:43.520]   in artificial intelligence, there's yet to be
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.160]   some profound things to be discovered
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:47.160]   about this whole construct.
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:48.800]   - Agreed completely.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.480]   It's been called an acid, actually,
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:55.560]   in that it strips away all of the non-informational
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.120]   components of something, just strips it down
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.360]   to its bare bones.
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:02.080]   I have a quote in there somewhere about that.
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:03.480]   - I'm sorry, which is called an acid?
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.320]   The ideas?
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.840]   - The universal Darwinism.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.160]   - Darwinism applied broadly, outside of the--
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:12.700]   - Applied broadly, and I will condition all of this
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:15.000]   with saying that most of my thinking is shaped
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   by a book I read recently called "The Case Against Reality,"
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.600]   which introduced me to this concept,
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:23.360]   but it tied into Darwinism that I've used
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.740]   more broadly in the past, looking at things
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:26.320]   like money and economics.
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:30.640]   So the book "The Case Against Reality" by Donald Hoffman,
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:33.760]   he has a quote in the book that describes
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:35.760]   universal Darwinism.
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.560]   It says, quote, "Universal Darwinism can,
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:39.260]   "without risk of refuting itself,
[00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:41.420]   "address our key question.
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:44.760]   "Does natural selection favor true perceptions?
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.700]   "If the answer happens to be no,
[00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:49.080]   "then it hasn't shot itself in the foot.
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:51.200]   "The uncanny power of universal Darwinism
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:54.040]   "has been likened by the philosopher Dan Dennett
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.740]   "to a universal acid."
[00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:58.860]   And Dan Dennett says, quote, "There is no denying
[00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:02.320]   "at this point that Darwin's idea is a universal solvent,
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.920]   "capable of cutting right to the heart
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:05.620]   "of everything in sight.
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:08.420]   "The question is, what does it leave behind?
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:10.100]   "I have tried to show that once it passes
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:12.100]   "through everything, we are left with stronger,
[00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:15.700]   "sounder versions of our most important ideas.
[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:17.840]   "Some of the traditional details perish,
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.340]   "and some of these are losses to be regretted,
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:22.180]   "but good riddance to the rest of them.
[00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:25.180]   "What remains is more than enough to build on," unquote.
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:31.380]   So the way I would interpret that is that life itself,
[00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:34.060]   I've come to view life as information
[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:35.600]   propagating through flesh,
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:42.060]   and that we are, I guess, DNA is a quadratic code.
[00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:44.260]   I think it's four letters, maybe,
[00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:46.580]   versus a binary, zeros and ones.
[00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:49.120]   And we are ideas, we are strategies
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.800]   competing with each other.
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:54.320]   And nature is that which selects.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.480]   It's what selects the winning ideas,
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:00.960]   the ones that are most fit to environmental conditions,
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.400]   frankly.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:06.280]   - You know, talking about sovereignty and individualism,
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:10.680]   there might need to be some rethinking here
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:13.940]   about what is actually the basic individual entity
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:15.600]   that is to be sovereign.
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:20.600]   Like maybe our biological meat vehicles
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:23.380]   were like way overly attached to them.
[00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:28.040]   Like maybe, especially with genetics
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.000]   and all those kinds of things,
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.160]   or artificial intelligence,
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:32.760]   or living more and more in virtual worlds
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:35.860]   will become detached from that kind of idea.
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:38.320]   So for example, if I can clone you,
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:42.280]   you know, make 1 million robbers,
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:46.160]   and, you know, but you'll all have the same idea.
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.880]   What is your real value as the,
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.000]   like I could just shoot you,
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.840]   and there'll still be 999 of you,
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.800]   but the idea is the important thing.
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:55.640]   - Yeah.
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:57.120]   - The things you believe, so.
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:00.200]   - I would argue that, I don't know,
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.080]   even if you clone someone perfectly,
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:05.500]   I don't think you can reproduce the individual themselves,
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:09.000]   because we're all a product of nature and nurture, right?
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.380]   So my particular concourse of experience is
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:15.440]   the path dependence that I represent cannot be replicated,
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:17.520]   as nor can anyone's for that matter.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:19.800]   - Well, that's a hypothesis, so.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:25.720]   That's of course a human meat bag would say.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:28.040]   - Good point.
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:31.920]   - So, like desperately trying to preserve himself.
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.960]   You know, I think it reduces
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.440]   to some fundamental questions about what is consciousness,
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:38.000]   and whether that can be cloned,
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.200]   all those kind, you know,
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.860]   it gets to the core of what it is to be human.
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:45.160]   What are the things that make you particularly you?
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:46.880]   - Yeah, I think it would assume
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.200]   kind of a materialist viewpoint on reality,
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.160]   and that if you could reproduce every atom of an individual,
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:55.160]   that you would have their experience encapsulated in that.
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:58.640]   And you know, Hoffman's, which is a book, is very radical.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:03.600]   He argues that space and time is not an objective reality,
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:06.040]   it's a biological interface.
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:11.040]   So we are scanning our environment for fitness payoffs,
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.520]   and this space and time is the rendering
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.040]   specific to human beings
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:18.960]   that allows us to navigate reality effectively.
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:20.860]   So the further argument would be
[00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:23.240]   that we all have pretty similar interfaces,
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.000]   but they're all slightly different too,
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.120]   'cause we're all, you know, adapting in different ways,
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:30.280]   and that different animals have their own unique interfaces.
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:32.780]   So we have a certain amount of photoreceptors in our eye,
[00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:35.920]   whereas I think the number's three, might be five,
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.320]   or something like the mantis shrimp has like seven or nine.
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:42.680]   So they can see, and we only see
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:46.000]   1/10 trillionth of the light spectrum.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.660]   So talk about a tiny fraction.
[00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:51.640]   I mean, 1/10 trillionth is a very minuscule number,
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:53.360]   and that makes up all of the light
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:55.320]   that we can interpret with our eyes.
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:56.480]   But something like a mantis shrimp
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:58.760]   could see much more of that.
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:01.860]   So I think there's this,
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:04.400]   we're very conditioned to have
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:07.280]   a fully materialist viewpoint on reality today,
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:10.280]   where we think, you know,
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:12.920]   the atomic clockwork kind of universe.
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:16.440]   But I think there's, I don't think that's true exactly.
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:19.720]   And another school that goes into that
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.000]   is actually Austrian economics,
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.640]   where we could say that, you know,
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:27.580]   we mentioned earlier that an asset is not property.
[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:29.120]   It's actually based on the relationship
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:31.120]   between the individual and the property.
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:36.920]   There's this whole realm of relevance associated with,
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:41.600]   we're all moving through life
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:43.520]   in the course of a goal-directed action.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:47.400]   So when we walk across a room, I go from A to B.
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:50.160]   It's because I valued B more than A.
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:52.920]   So value is inseparable from human action.
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:56.960]   We have a rank-ordered value system in our mind, each of us,
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:58.340]   and we're constantly taking action
[00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.440]   in accordance with those rank values.
[00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:04.560]   Anything that accelerates us on the course
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:08.480]   of our goal-directed action towards our goal is useful.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:12.720]   Anything that impedes us, or we could say is valuable,
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:16.200]   anything that impedes us is actually obstructing to value,
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:19.160]   and anything that's irrelevant is just valueless.
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:23.880]   So this table that we're using right now,
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:26.360]   like this is a, it's an accessory to you and I,
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:27.480]   'cause it's holding this paper
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:28.480]   that's holding the information
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:30.320]   that's guiding our conversation.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:34.340]   But we could pay someone $100 to jump over this table,
[00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:36.540]   and this table could simultaneously be an accessory
[00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:39.500]   to you and I and an obstacle to someone else.
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:43.100]   So it's this domain, this silent contention
[00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:44.900]   of willpower and agendas occurring
[00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:46.740]   across the face of the Earth
[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:50.060]   that is what Austrian economics really looks at.
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:54.020]   It's the realm of human action, as they call it.
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:55.560]   It's called praxeology.
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:58.540]   So it's a non-materialist viewpoint on reality,
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:03.220]   in that things, we think in terms of matter being reality,
[00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:06.160]   but it's often more so in the sphere of human action,
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:08.620]   what matters that is reality.
[00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:10.220]   It's the relevance of a thing
[00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:12.420]   to the course of one's goal-directed action.
[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:15.960]   - And that's ultimately, it exists in the space of ideas.
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:16.940]   - Yes.
[00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:19.060]   - Not in the space of physical matter.
[00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:20.400]   - And just to jump back to this line here,
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:23.340]   I think his fundamental line here is,
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:26.260]   the question is, talking about universal Darwinism
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:28.360]   as an asset, what does it leave behind?
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:30.760]   I've tried to show that once it passes through everything,
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:32.900]   we're left with stronger, sounder versions
[00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:35.320]   of our most useful ideas.
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:36.520]   That's the key point to me,
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:40.420]   in that ideas and information, so far as we can tell,
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:43.240]   are the most fundamental substrate of reality.
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:47.580]   And information itself, back to entropy,
[00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:50.340]   information is the resolution of entropy.
[00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:51.540]   That's what the bit is, right?
[00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:52.460]   It's a one or a zero.
[00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:55.060]   Whatever reduces your entropy by half is a bit,
[00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:57.500]   and we measure information in bits.
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:00.840]   So, and you're right, people don't have ideas,
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:01.960]   ideas have people.
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:05.880]   Honestly, it's a really profound idea,
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:11.640]   or a statement about reality, a reframing of reality.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:15.340]   If we're actually being deeply honest about it,
[00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:16.440]   it's quite painful.
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:19.280]   I do appreciate that you defended
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:21.760]   your biological meat bag earlier,
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:26.020]   but it seems like ideas are the things that have power.
[00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:31.020]   That me, Lex, for example, is worthless.
[00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:35.820]   And relative to the ideas that used my brain
[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:37.620]   for a bit of a time.
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:39.780]   - But so far as we know,
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:42.400]   only human beings can generate and share ideas.
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:44.460]   So you can't say Lex is worthless.
[00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:48.380]   Like, you are the node of the idea sphere,
[00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:49.220]   the newest sphere.
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:52.020]   So I'm, what is it?
[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:55.180]   From a Bitcoin perspective, I'm like, I'm mining,
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:57.380]   I'm solving the cryptographic problem,
[00:46:57.380 --> 00:47:02.380]   and I'm a use, in that sense, I'm a useful node.
[00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:06.580]   - Yeah, you're competing to solve the puzzle of entropy,
[00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:07.780]   right, and when you do solve it,
[00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:09.620]   it benefits the entire network.
[00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:13.340]   - But I guess from my perspective,
[00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:15.420]   just because just working in AI,
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:17.620]   I'm looking at the long-term vision.
[00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:22.500]   I see us humans and AI systems as really the same,
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:24.980]   and AI systems ultimately as something
[00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:27.140]   that supersedes humans.
[00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:28.580]   - So what is intelligence?
[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:36.780]   - So in the context of our current discussion,
[00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:41.060]   I think intelligence is very closely linked
[00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:44.520]   to this notion of ideas.
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:49.540]   It's the ability to generate ideas, to mold ideas,
[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:54.540]   to compress seeming chaos into something
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:58.660]   into some model, into some theory
[00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:01.420]   that efficiently compresses the chaos
[00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:04.860]   in a way where you can then integrate it with other ideas,
[00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:07.060]   and they can play and all those kinds of things.
[00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:11.820]   So in that sense, it's the turning chaos into order.
[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:13.460]   It's the molding of ideas
[00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:17.820]   such that our human brains can work with it.
[00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:19.580]   And just from my perspective,
[00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:22.860]   I don't see any reason why that cannot be algorithmatized,
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:25.580]   converted into computational systems.
[00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:26.420]   - I would agree.
[00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:28.220]   - Which is scary.
[00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:33.380]   - Scary or potentially really promising, right?
[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:34.820]   It's kind of the case with all novelty.
[00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:37.140]   It's terrifying as much as it is promising.
[00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:39.460]   That's why you're pursuing it so heavily.
[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:42.500]   I would maybe take it a step further
[00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:44.740]   and say that intelligence,
[00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:48.260]   and maybe its most simplistic form is error correction.
[00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:53.260]   So we, humans have wants.
[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:56.220]   Again, we're constantly expressing our value through action.
[00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:57.980]   There's no other way to express it, by the way.
[00:48:57.980 --> 00:49:00.380]   It's whatever you choose to do in any moment,
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:02.260]   you are expressing the values you hold
[00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:03.660]   in your mind and your heart.
[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:09.540]   As we move from less valued A to more valued B,
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:16.140]   entropy happens, uncertainty happens, we fall off course.
[00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:19.300]   And it is intelligence that enables us
[00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:21.660]   to render information from that experience
[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:23.740]   and error correct, right?
[00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:25.900]   So that we can move slightly,
[00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:29.140]   shift our trajectory slightly more towards B
[00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:30.860]   that we're trying to move towards.
[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:35.580]   So I think that there's something there
[00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:40.580]   that I don't know that we can make synthetically.
[00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:45.780]   And that if we define intelligence as error correction,
[00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:47.460]   it's like error correction to what?
[00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:50.580]   Error correction towards what we find is valuable.
[00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:52.500]   So we're trying to satisfy human wants.
[00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:54.220]   Might not just be our own, could be others as well.
[00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:55.060]   If I'm an entrepreneur,
[00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:57.500]   I'm trying to solve the wants of others, not just myself.
[00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:00.340]   And I'm trying to error correct myself towards that goal,
[00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:04.620]   using intelligence and processing environmental feedback
[00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:06.500]   through intelligence to error correct.
[00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:09.980]   So I don't know how, if you eliminate
[00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:13.660]   the human element completely, who's doing the wanting?
[00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:15.300]   Right, where does value come from?
[00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:18.180]   I know machine learning people who are listening
[00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:20.220]   are saying that's exactly what machine learning is,
[00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:21.460]   which is error correction,
[00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:24.020]   because you have a loss function, objective function
[00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:28.300]   that measures how wrong your thing is.
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:30.220]   And you wanna make it less wrong next time.
[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:31.980]   That's the whole process of machine learning.
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:35.540]   But you're saying what humans are able to do
[00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:38.900]   is in a world where there's no,
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:44.300]   maybe objective values, absolute values,
[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:46.460]   you're generating that very loss function,
[00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:50.060]   that objective function, that function that measures
[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:53.440]   the error comes from the human mind.
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:57.260]   Some aliens might disagree with you,
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:00.020]   'cause they might have a different objective function.
[00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:02.780]   - I would say purpose comes from consciousness, I think.
[00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:05.540]   And without purpose, there's not error correction.
[00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:07.980]   - Yeah, I mean, this is, again, a hypothesis.
[00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:09.540]   Like, where does purpose come from?
[00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:12.040]   It seems to come from consciousness, you're right.
[00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:15.140]   That's where suffering comes from,
[00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:17.020]   and you want to lessen suffering.
[00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:20.100]   That's where pleasure comes from.
[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:21.900]   It seems like it's consciousness.
[00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:25.180]   Maybe there is something to this biological meat bag.
[00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:27.340]   - So to take it one layer deeper on this,
[00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:29.140]   and the reason I like this book so much,
[00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:31.660]   again, "The Case Against Reality,"
[00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:33.580]   so he's making the case that space and time
[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:35.180]   are not fundamental.
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:37.340]   - Yes. - Which I started
[00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:39.540]   my intellectual explorations in physics, actually,
[00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:41.660]   astrophysics, so for the longest time,
[00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:42.660]   even the way I describe money,
[00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:46.580]   as I talk about space and time, so that blew my mind.
[00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:50.020]   But this dovetailed nicely with another book called "Lila."
[00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:53.900]   The author is Robert Persig, so he wrote
[00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:55.580]   "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,"
[00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:57.260]   which is a very popular book.
[00:51:57.260 --> 00:51:58.740]   20 years later, he wrote "Lila,"
[00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:01.380]   which no one's heard of, which is crazy.
[00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:03.920]   And he basically says he was wrong about his first book.
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:06.380]   And he lays out this entire other
[00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:08.900]   metaphysics of quality, he calls it.
[00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:10.500]   So it's the metaphysics, I think it's
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.500]   the metaphysics of quality.
[00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:17.500]   But his supposition is that it's not physical reality
[00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:22.260]   that's fundamental, it's not information that's fundamental,
[00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:23.240]   it's value.
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:26.980]   So he actually, and it's a beautiful book,
[00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:28.360]   I highly recommend it.
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:33.180]   He essentially is refuting causality itself.
[00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:34.980]   We think A causes B.
[00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:41.180]   This book makes the case that B values precondition A,
[00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:45.980]   so that we are actually creating our future
[00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:48.440]   through our value systems.
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:50.900]   And this goes back to something,
[00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:52.260]   I think Solzhenitsyn said this,
[00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:54.300]   that the line between good and evil
[00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:56.220]   runs down the heart of every man.
[00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:59.520]   So it's as if our moral decisions are actually
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:03.260]   what's creating the outcomes in reality over time.
[00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:05.540]   And then that gets into all the wisdom traditions
[00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:08.100]   related to religion, where it's always talking about
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:11.340]   loving thy neighbor and loving God
[00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:13.880]   and all of these other things that are good morally
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:15.300]   to create the best outcomes.
[00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:17.900]   - So values are fundamental.
[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:19.300]   - Value, yes.
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:21.360]   - Value is fundamental.
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:24.140]   Oh boy, yeah, that's interesting.
[00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:30.180]   It does feel like physics is not capturing something.
[00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:34.940]   There's some people, panpsychists,
[00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:38.340]   argue that consciousness might be one of the fundamental
[00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:39.700]   properties of nature,
[00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:42.860]   like from which emerges everything we see.
[00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:46.500]   So that could be just other words
[00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:49.460]   for this same notion of value.
[00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:51.740]   And then the basic laws of physics
[00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:54.100]   are not capturing that currently.
[00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:56.540]   So maybe humans, in order to understand
[00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:57.860]   from where humans came from,
[00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:00.620]   we have to understand these other properties of nature,
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:03.500]   which are yet to be discovered at the physics level.
[00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:08.140]   - And it's, we contend with that underlying nature,
[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:10.780]   whatever it is, with the logos.
[00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:15.780]   So we're looking at uncategorized nature,
[00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:18.540]   and then we're assigning a word to it.
[00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:23.260]   So we're slicing up chaos into little boxes of order.
[00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:25.740]   And then we're establishing this social consensus
[00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:28.860]   as to those labels, which we call words.
[00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:30.780]   And we're using that to communicate.
[00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:32.180]   And when we communicate,
[00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:35.260]   we can start to build these other things.
[00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:37.980]   This is like the Yuval Harari imagined orders.
[00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:41.060]   So we can create these useful fictions, right?
[00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:44.060]   Whether it's the nation state or human rights or money.
[00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:48.580]   And that allows us to cooperate flexibly in large numbers
[00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:50.500]   so that we can better contend with reality.
[00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:53.740]   We can produce more complicated things.
[00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:58.340]   We can enlarge that bubble of civilization against entropy.
[00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:01.060]   And that's what capitalism is all about.
[00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:04.500]   It's about further specializing knowledge,
[00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:07.540]   further enriching mankind's treasury of knowledge,
[00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:09.540]   and doing it.
[00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:14.220]   But to do that, the communication media that we're using,
[00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:16.740]   the words have to have stable meaning.
[00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:21.500]   The money needs to have value that's dependable, right?
[00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:23.100]   It needs to be something that's,
[00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:26.900]   it's not dictated by any one group.
[00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:30.620]   It's reached by consensus of the entire group.
[00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:35.580]   That's how, so you can think it's like optimizing
[00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:36.740]   for error correction again,
[00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:39.980]   where a free market would be harnessing the intelligence
[00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:41.420]   of all market actors.
[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:45.340]   And a central planning or a centrally planned market
[00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:46.780]   would be harnessing just the intelligence
[00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:49.860]   of a small group of bureaucrats.
[00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:51.260]   - And it's not obvious how to achieve
[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:53.460]   this kind of consensus mechanism.
[00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:55.020]   I mean, there's obviously,
[00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:57.900]   we'll talk about sort of Bitcoin as an idea.
[00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:01.900]   Ultimately, the idea of Bitcoin is connecting it to physics.
[00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:07.740]   So like you can trust that physical matter won't change,
[00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:12.940]   but there could be other ideas that will yet,
[00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:14.660]   maybe physics could be changed.
[00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:17.420]   If Eric Weinstein has anything to say about it.
[00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:20.540]   Like it's, we right now believe that physics
[00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:23.140]   can't be changed, the physical matter of the world,
[00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:24.860]   but maybe it can in a way
[00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:26.460]   that we're totally not understanding.
[00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:28.460]   You mentioned sort of reality
[00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:32.460]   from Donald Hoffman's perspective.
[00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:35.420]   Like if we don't have even close to direct access
[00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:38.180]   to the fabric of reality,
[00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:40.980]   maybe we're living in a world that's very like
[00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:44.020]   many dimensions that the notions of space and time
[00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:46.500]   is just like a silly, useful construct
[00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:48.500]   that's not at all connected.
[00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:51.020]   You're starting to look at like Stephen Wolfram's,
[00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:54.180]   I don't know if you're familiar with his view of the world,
[00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:57.140]   that it's like hypergraphs underneath it all,
[00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:58.660]   like these mathematical structures
[00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:00.460]   from which everything emerges.
[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:05.460]   Like there are like many, many, many orders of magnitude
[00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:10.140]   smaller than what we think of as,
[00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:13.220]   they're even smaller than like strings and string theory.
[00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:15.300]   So like those are the basic mathematical objects
[00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:16.540]   from which it emerges.
[00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:19.700]   I don't, I think that's an interesting philosophical
[00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:22.380]   framework, it's also, people should check out,
[00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:26.500]   a cool way to play with beautiful hypergraph
[00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:27.700]   mathematical structures.
[00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:30.020]   So he has, I don't know if you know Stephen Wolfram is,
[00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:34.220]   but he created Wolfram Alpha and all these tools
[00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:36.340]   that you can actually visualize and play with.
[00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:39.260]   So you can play with physics in a visual way,
[00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:43.500]   which, or at least discrete mathematics,
[00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:45.060]   which I think is incredible.
[00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:46.820]   He doesn't get enough love.
[00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:50.420]   One of the reasons he, I think doesn't get enough love
[00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:53.340]   is because of this little quirk of human nature,
[00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:54.780]   which is the ego.
[00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:59.860]   And he sometimes frustrates a few folks
[00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:03.980]   because he's very, let's say, proud of his work.
[00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:04.820]   - I guess.
[00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:10.380]   - But it's interesting to think about a world
[00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:13.580]   where we don't have direct access to reality,
[00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:14.980]   as Hoffman argues.
[00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:17.300]   And maybe, I don't know if you can comment,
[00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:19.380]   I don't know if you're familiar with Ayn Rand's work
[00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:21.980]   and her whole philosophy of objectivism,
[00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:26.980]   or her whole contention is that, we do have access.
[00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:30.500]   I don't want to misstate it, but at least
[00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:37.500]   she will claim that it's not useful,
[00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:41.580]   or I think she'll probably say it's not correct
[00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:44.180]   to argue that we don't have access to reality.
[00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:46.020]   We have, hence objectivism,
[00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:49.100]   we have direct access to reality.
[00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:52.340]   That's the only thing we can reason about.
[00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:55.100]   And the only way to live life morally
[00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:57.700]   is to reason through everything,
[00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:59.580]   starting with the axioms of reality,
[00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:02.020]   which we do have direct access to.
[00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:04.540]   You have thoughts about her work?
[00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:08.860]   - I am slightly ashamed to say I have not read Ayn Rand yet.
[00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:10.460]   So she is high on my list,
[00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:13.220]   and she's been recommended a number of times.
[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:16.260]   But, so I don't know a lot specifically
[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:18.260]   about her philosophy or objectivism,
[00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:21.580]   but to me, it resonates closely
[00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:25.740]   with what the American pragmatist commented on truth.
[00:59:25.740 --> 00:59:29.660]   And they distinguished, what you could say is absolute truth,
[00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:31.260]   which is at the bottom of reality,
[00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:34.300]   whether it's Mr. Wolfram's mathematical formulas or value,
[00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:36.980]   whatever it may be, it's something ineffable,
[00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:41.380]   something beyond the reach of epistemology, perhaps even.
[00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:45.340]   And maybe that's why religion just sort of points to it,
[00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:46.740]   right, is trying to use,
[00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:50.620]   I think Joseph Campbell said something like,
[00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:55.620]   "Religion is using stories
[00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:58.420]   to point towards the same transcendental mystery
[00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:01.220]   we all experience but cannot articulate."
[01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:05.860]   So something like the artist uses lies
[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:08.060]   to point to the truth, something like that,
[01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:09.020]   that kind of thing.
[01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:10.980]   - That's really good.
[01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:13.740]   - But the American pragmatist said that,
[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:16.300]   because at the end of the day, this is all about,
[01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:21.300]   when we say truth, we need something that is socially,
[01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:23.460]   close to social consensus
[01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:26.020]   and is not shakable by political action.
[01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:28.420]   So that's what physics and mathematics are.
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:33.420]   It's an unshakable point of reference,
[01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:35.140]   I guess you might say.
[01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:39.460]   So the American pragmatist defined truth
[01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:41.220]   as the end of inquiry.
[01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:47.500]   And in markets, we could say that the market itself
[01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:50.660]   is a forum that generates truth.
[01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:51.980]   We call this pragmatic truth,
[01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:53.980]   to separate pure objective truth
[01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:56.620]   that we can't even talk about without polluting it
[01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:59.380]   versus pragmatic truth, which is something that's useful.
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:01.980]   So the example here would be,
[01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:05.620]   if I give you a map and you're trying to go
[01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:09.100]   from your house to the local brisket restaurant,
[01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:10.780]   and the map gets you from your house
[01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:13.940]   to the brisket restaurant, is that because the map is true?
[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:15.780]   Or is that because the map is useful?
[01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:18.620]   They're very hard to disentangle
[01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:21.420]   when you're just looking at it pragmatically.
[01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:23.900]   And in markets, markets, I argue,
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:26.460]   generate three forms of pragmatic truth.
[01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:28.420]   One is the price.
[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:33.420]   So this is the collective subjective demand
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:35.860]   and purchasing power of humanity
[01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:39.860]   running up against the objective supply of capital
[01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:41.820]   and resources in the marketplace.
[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:44.380]   So there's demand overlaid on supply.
[01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:46.060]   The result of that is the price.
[01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:51.060]   So that is the most truthful exchange ratio,
[01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:54.180]   which is the closest approximation to the value
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:56.100]   of any good in the marketplace.
[01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:58.660]   So it gives us a data point on which we can operate.
[01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:01.420]   It's compressing all known market realities
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:03.860]   down into a single actionable number.
[01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:05.980]   You know, based on the price of bread or copper,
[01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:07.580]   whether you wanna buy more of it,
[01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:09.060]   you wanna abstain from buying it,
[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:11.420]   or maybe you wanna try and find substitutes.
[01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:13.940]   And you can think of that price signal,
[01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:15.580]   it's like an economic nerve signal
[01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:17.620]   that's coordinating human action across time.
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:22.620]   So if we're one socioeconomic superorganism or collective,
[01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:24.620]   that the price signal is the nerve.
[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:27.060]   And that's the first form of pragmatic truth
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:28.460]   that markets generate.
[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:32.300]   The second form would be tools and innovations themselves.
[01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:35.700]   So entrepreneurs are experimenting across time.
[01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:37.700]   They're trying to satisfy the wants of consumers.
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:40.540]   Consumers are sovereign in the marketplace.
[01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:43.940]   Whatever the consumer wants, the consumer gets, right?
[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:44.980]   I'm trying to satisfy that.
[01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:46.460]   I'm trying to do it at a profit.
[01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:48.260]   So I'm trying to take,
[01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:49.740]   viewing the existing price signals
[01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:50.700]   of goods in the marketplace,
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:53.260]   I'm trying to assemble those in a way
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:55.780]   at a cost lower than the final solution
[01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:57.380]   I'm delivering to my customer.
[01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:58.700]   I'm selling it at a price higher
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:01.360]   than the productive factors I combine to create it.
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:05.120]   And in that iterative process,
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:09.000]   we're constantly discovering new and better ways
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.440]   of solving problems or satisfying wants.
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:14.920]   So we could say to go out and dig a hole, right?
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:16.560]   Someone wants a hole dug,
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:20.280]   that a shovel is gonna let you do it much faster per hour
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.480]   than you would with your bare hands.
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:24.920]   So what is the pragmatic truth of digging holes?
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:27.400]   It's a shovel, right?
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:30.020]   It's the best way we know how to solve
[01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:33.040]   any particular problem based on
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:35.360]   the existing treasury of knowledge.
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:39.180]   So every tool, again, we're back to ideas being fundamental.
[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:42.160]   The shovel itself is just a knowledge structure.
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:45.640]   We've figured out a way to create this particular implement
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:47.800]   and then we've indexed the raw materials
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:50.000]   we found in nature to this knowledge structure
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.240]   to create a shovel, which allows us to better satisfy
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:57.280]   human wants faster, cheaper, better, effectively.
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:59.460]   - I'm trying to generalize,
[01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:01.180]   you're blowing my mind a little bit here.
[01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:03.660]   I'm trying to generalize the idea of tool
[01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:04.780]   to how to think about it.
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:07.780]   'Cause I keep just, when you say tool,
[01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:09.540]   I keep imagining different,
[01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:12.220]   like specific instantiations of a tool.
[01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:16.060]   I'm trying to see, so the price is a pragmatic truth
[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:21.780]   that's communicating value in this network.
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:26.660]   - Subjective demands against objective supply.
[01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:27.500]   - Subjective.
[01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:29.280]   - So it's an economic democracy.
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.120]   - Got it.
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.280]   So that's the demand supply.
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:35.440]   And then the tools are the ways of extracting
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:39.520]   or solving problems is the more general kind of.
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:40.880]   - Or satisfying wants.
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:42.760]   - Satisfying wants.
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:45.480]   So wants are somehow,
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:48.080]   that's part of the supply and the demand.
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:49.920]   - And what wants are back to value, right?
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.160]   'Cause everything someone wants,
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:53.240]   they're expressing their value.
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:57.480]   - Okay, yeah, so the shovel is a pragmatic truth.
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:58.880]   The shovel is truth.
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.580]   It feels like a good book title.
[01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:01.420]   Okay, sorry.
[01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:03.240]   So what other, what is the third one?
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:04.880]   - And then the third one, I would argue,
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:08.560]   is virtue, actually.
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:09.760]   - Oh, wow.
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:13.360]   - And another way to maybe think about this
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:14.740]   is competitive competency,
[01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:17.160]   but it's also cooperative competency.
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:20.740]   So we're learning over time what characteristics,
[01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:24.760]   what patterns of action, what mindsets,
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:27.980]   what mental tools, what heuristics are most useful
[01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:30.660]   to satisfying customer wants.
[01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:32.780]   So I think that becomes, over time,
[01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:34.500]   becomes sharpened into virtue.
[01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:36.480]   We know it's best to be honest,
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:39.320]   because if you lie, it's very energy inefficient.
[01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:41.700]   You're creating this little fork of reality.
[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:43.460]   And then if someone else asks you about that lie again,
[01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:46.140]   you have to put another layer of lies on top of it.
[01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:47.220]   Where if you just tell the truth,
[01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:49.300]   you're just recollecting what happened.
[01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:50.900]   And so that sort of keeps,
[01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:55.660]   again, when we're talking about delaying volatility,
[01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:59.260]   if you lie, you're delaying short-term volatility,
[01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:00.900]   but you're increasing long-term volatility.
[01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:01.740]   - What about murder?
[01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:04.180]   I haven't been able to figure out why murder is bad,
[01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:07.180]   'cause I just keep wanting to murder people.
[01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:08.380]   And I've murdered many, sorry.
[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:09.700]   - You should see someone for that.
[01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:10.620]   (laughs)
[01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:11.820]   - Well, that's why I'm trying to get an interview
[01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:13.420]   with Vladimir Putin.
[01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:17.020]   So that's fascinating, virtue in this market
[01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:19.780]   with the supplies and demands, and there's the tools,
[01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:23.340]   which is also a pragmatic truth, and there's virtue.
[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:25.020]   It's a pragmatic truth.
[01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:28.260]   - Yeah, and if we interfere with that free market process,
[01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:31.380]   again, if we overstep, which this maybe ties into murder,
[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:34.620]   if you start to be coercive against life,
[01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:36.020]   liberty, or property,
[01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:38.940]   so if you're forcibly taking someone's life,
[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:41.380]   you're breaking down the trust in that market
[01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:44.100]   that generates these pragmatic truths.
[01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:47.500]   If you forcibly infringe on someone's liberty, right,
[01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:52.220]   for any reason other than them originally breaking
[01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:55.060]   or infringing upon life, liberty, or property,
[01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:56.860]   then that's not gonna work either.
[01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:59.340]   And then if you violate private property rights,
[01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:01.160]   if you steal property from others,
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:04.340]   you're breaking down the trust
[01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:08.780]   that the intersubjective fabric of money and markets
[01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:11.120]   and the rule of law, all of these useful fictions
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:12.140]   are meant to preserve,
[01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:14.780]   you're corrupting it and breaking it down.
[01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:16.500]   - What's kind of interesting to think about the market
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:19.540]   is helping evolve the virtues.
[01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:22.980]   It's sharpened into virtues,
[01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:26.220]   and then these virtues can then go into motivational posters
[01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:30.340]   or like in books that we all agree on
[01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:32.740]   and then eventually take for granted
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:35.340]   as if they were somehow fundamental to human nature,
[01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:37.720]   but they're not perhaps fundamental,
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.440]   they're just pragmatic truths.
[01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:45.460]   - Yeah, another way to consider competition itself
[01:07:45.460 --> 01:07:48.420]   is that it is a discovery process.
[01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:52.660]   So entrepreneurs are competing with one another
[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:56.500]   and they're trying to best satisfy consumer wants
[01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:57.740]   at the lowest possible price.
[01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:00.500]   So they're placing bets of time, energy, and capital
[01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:03.780]   on themselves, on their idea, their business plan,
[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:06.420]   and then the market decides, right,
[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:10.300]   the consensus of market actors decide which one was better.
[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:11.800]   One lives, one dies.
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:16.940]   So competition itself is helping us get closer to truth,
[01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:18.100]   to pragmatic truth.
[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:21.400]   So we're discovering what is the right price for this asset.
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:23.340]   And that price, by the way, is derived,
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:26.540]   again, in the sense of data compression.
[01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:28.980]   Everyone in the world can see that price.
[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:31.640]   Everyone in the world can then put their skin in the game
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:34.340]   by choosing to buy or sell or short or go long
[01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:37.420]   or do any number of financial actions on that price.
[01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:40.460]   And that information is then propagated back out
[01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:41.300]   to everyone else.
[01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:45.020]   So it's this feedback loop between market actor and price
[01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:48.180]   that makes it so useful.
[01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:52.540]   And that's what carries us.
[01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:56.100]   So it's these collisions of interest that carry us,
[01:08:56.100 --> 01:09:00.940]   it removes the unuseful aspects of ourselves
[01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:02.980]   or of our tools or of a price
[01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:05.460]   and reveals pragmatic truth to us.
[01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:08.220]   - Can you play my therapist for a second?
[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:11.340]   And if we talk about creative destruction,
[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:16.340]   I think Bukowski, Hunter S. Thompson has a quote,
[01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:20.900]   something like, "For all instances of beauty,
[01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:22.900]   many souls must be trampled."
[01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:24.880]   - Wow.
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:27.220]   (laughing)
[01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:32.220]   - But it, there does seem to be an aspect of competition
[01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:35.060]   that destroys, you were talking about
[01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:39.020]   entrepreneurs sort of on the outside
[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:40.540]   of the circle of order,
[01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:45.100]   striving to make sense, to compress volatility
[01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:47.840]   of the chaos of the universe.
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:53.440]   Is there some way to protect a little bit
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:55.420]   against the pain of that destruction
[01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:57.140]   of that creative destruction?
[01:09:57.140 --> 01:10:00.380]   That entrepreneur screaming on fire
[01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:03.680]   as he enlightens the rest of us,
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:06.780]   is there some role for us humans together
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:08.300]   in the togetherness of it?
[01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:15.100]   Also government, but any kind of collectives
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:18.300]   in helping that entrepreneur who's on fire
[01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:22.900]   maybe after a few minutes to spray him with some water
[01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:25.140]   and put him out of his misery?
[01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:29.300]   - I would say that, you know, pain
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:34.420]   is the inarguable basis of being, right?
[01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:39.420]   Pain is, no matter how you try to explain it away
[01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:42.040]   or describe it, or,
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:46.700]   it's not something you can rationalize away, right?
[01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:50.660]   It's no one, I think, ever,
[01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:52.300]   like someone may want to cut themselves
[01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:53.220]   to have an endorphin high,
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:55.100]   but no one wants to suffer, we'd say, right?
[01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:56.980]   So pain in that sense,
[01:10:56.980 --> 01:10:59.680]   it is what we're constantly trying to deal with.
[01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:04.820]   And to move away from, or create buffers between us
[01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:07.660]   and potential pain or potential uncertainty.
[01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:11.900]   And that pain is information.
[01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:15.100]   When we experience something that is misfit
[01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:18.700]   to the outcome we desired, that pain is what puts us,
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:21.780]   it encourages us to change our trajectory,
[01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:24.980]   to get back on course towards our valued aim.
[01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:28.600]   So as far as, you know,
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:31.920]   you need entrepreneurs that are exploring,
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:33.240]   and you're trying to do something new,
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:34.720]   if you're a pioneer of any kind,
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:37.040]   you are courageously facing pain.
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:38.920]   You're willfully confronting it.
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:41.720]   So I don't think it's avoidable in that sense.
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:45.320]   It's not like we can have pain-free economic growth,
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:48.120]   like what the central bank would maybe have us
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:51.000]   lend to believe that we can just run these experiments
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:51.840]   and when they fail,
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.680]   we'll just paper over all the losses and continue.
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:56.860]   Or you're just delaying and exacerbating
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:59.000]   the inevitable volatility back to reality.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.380]   But what I would say is that capitalism,
[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:04.560]   'cause we're building,
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:07.340]   we're increasing the capital stock of the world,
[01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:09.860]   which again, capital is the mitigation of risk.
[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:12.220]   So we're reducing the overall risk of existence
[01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:14.380]   by accumulating more capital in the world.
[01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:16.740]   And that's what protects that entrepreneur
[01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:19.420]   that's deciding, hey, I saved up a million bucks,
[01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:21.860]   I'm gonna go try this business idea,
[01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:24.120]   I'm gonna put all my money on the line.
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:26.260]   And if he goes up in flames,
[01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:28.960]   then his cost of living, when he comes back to reality
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:30.100]   and he's starting over from zero,
[01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:32.820]   his cost of living is substantially lower
[01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:33.820]   starting over from zero
[01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:36.980]   than he would be out in the wilderness on his own.
[01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:40.000]   So it's the accumulation of capital stock
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.260]   is the buffer against uncertainty for everyone.
[01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:47.020]   And it gives you actually more potential
[01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:48.380]   to go out and experiment,
[01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:51.160]   to go out and confront the chaos of nature
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:53.900]   because you are better healed effectively.
[01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:56.500]   - So I think we're speaking
[01:12:56.500 --> 01:13:03.060]   in sort of idealistic terms about the power of capitalism,
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:04.740]   when it works well.
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:07.020]   Is there any aspects that you think
[01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:10.500]   that don't work well in a free market?
[01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:12.460]   In all the basic pragmatic truths
[01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:13.580]   that we were talking about,
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:15.540]   is there ways it can go wrong?
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:21.900]   - So I would first argue that we have never seen
[01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:25.480]   an actual purely free market.
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:30.880]   Closest example would be,
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:35.760]   kind of geopolitically we have a free market
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:38.620]   and that governments are not necessarily governed.
[01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:46.600]   But they are premised on governing large groups of individuals
[01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:49.940]   so that's not, doesn't exactly--
[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:52.100]   - You mean between governments?
[01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:53.140]   - Yes.
[01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:54.620]   - See, but isn't there still,
[01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:57.780]   so a free market, maybe you can correct me,
[01:13:57.780 --> 01:14:00.420]   is the free market still grounded in the ideas
[01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:03.960]   of property rights and all those kinds of things, right?
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:06.260]   So governments tend to also sometimes
[01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:07.780]   be violent towards each other.
[01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:08.620]   - That's right.
[01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:11.820]   - So they don't respect all the basic aspects of capitalism.
[01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:12.660]   - That's right.
[01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:14.980]   So maybe another way to look at this is that
[01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:19.980]   gold is the original governor of government, actually.
[01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:24.100]   And this is the reason governments have abused
[01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:26.940]   and gone off of the gold standard.
[01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:31.940]   So historically, if you are a bank or a nation state
[01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:37.780]   and you produce more currency
[01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:40.020]   than your gold reserves can justify,
[01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:43.820]   then people, then gold will flow out of your bank
[01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:44.980]   or out of your country.
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:46.740]   So there's this natural check
[01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:54.140]   via the money that, via capitalistic money, which is gold.
[01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:56.060]   Gold was selected by the free market,
[01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:58.380]   it's not decreed by government.
[01:14:58.380 --> 01:15:02.460]   It provided this natural check on government action.
[01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:07.460]   So my, I guess to get back to the original question is,
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:11.500]   we've never seen a pure free market
[01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:14.540]   because money has always been monopolized
[01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:17.900]   and coerced, frankly.
[01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:21.820]   So to try and answer what goes wrong with a free market
[01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:24.620]   is really difficult because we've never actually seen it.
[01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:28.700]   And I would define free market as one
[01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:31.660]   in which government only protects life, liberty,
[01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:35.900]   and property, and so that has a very minimal role in society.
[01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:38.300]   Again, just as network security
[01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:40.780]   for the economic trade network.
[01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:44.500]   And anything that, any government function
[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:47.300]   that goes beyond those three core functions,
[01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:48.620]   which by the way are pretty much
[01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:50.420]   the core tenets of morality as well.
[01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:52.980]   So government's just really intended to preserve
[01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:55.940]   natural law, if you will.
[01:15:55.940 --> 01:15:57.580]   Anything that goes beyond that
[01:15:57.580 --> 01:16:01.460]   is moves us closer to an unfree market.
[01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:06.140]   So every regulation, every act of coercion
[01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:11.140]   is actually a gradation closer to a purely unfree market,
[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:13.140]   which would be a monopoly.
[01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:15.940]   So in terms of what I guess theoretically
[01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:17.860]   we could say goes wrong in the free market
[01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:20.780]   is that it's volatile.
[01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:25.660]   It's trading off, it's accepting short-term volatility
[01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:29.340]   in exchange for less long-run volatility.
[01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:30.380]   - Yeah.
[01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:32.860]   - And this tends to be the way of nature, by the way.
[01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:35.100]   So if we look at something like
[01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:40.580]   there's a region in North America called Baja, California,
[01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:43.460]   and it runs into the United States
[01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:45.220]   and it runs down into Mexico as well.
[01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:49.140]   So the same topology, but two different jurisdictions.
[01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:55.140]   In the US, we very heavily manage forest fires.
[01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:57.700]   We're trying to manage nature effectively.
[01:16:57.700 --> 01:16:59.780]   Whereas in Mexico, it's much more unregulated.
[01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:04.060]   It just, when wildfires spring up, they let them burn off.
[01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:06.260]   In North America, when wildfires spring up,
[01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:08.220]   we're actually extinguishing them.
[01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:09.740]   So we're constantly trying to dampen
[01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:12.340]   the short-run volatility of these small brush fires.
[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:13.740]   Whereas in Mexico, we just let them burn.
[01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:15.580]   We let nature do its thing.
[01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:18.300]   The consequence of this is that
[01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:20.100]   the wildfires still occur eventually,
[01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:22.380]   but they're much larger and much more devastating
[01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:25.240]   in North America where human intervention has occurred.
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:30.240]   Because it's dampening nature's natural corrective mechanism
[01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:34.700]   of clearing this underbrush with these more frequent
[01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:38.100]   and smaller fires at the cost of much larger fires.
[01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:39.900]   So again, we're delaying short-term volatility
[01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:42.620]   and exacerbating long-run volatility.
[01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:44.380]   And in Mexico, it's the opposite, right?
[01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:46.500]   Just these wildfires burn much smaller
[01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:49.360]   and more continuously over time.
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:51.020]   The further effect of that in North America
[01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:53.220]   is that the fires can get so big and so hot
[01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:55.140]   that it burns away the topsoil.
[01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:58.500]   So it actually destroys the fertility of the soil itself.
[01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:02.980]   So the point of this is that human intervention, right?
[01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:06.580]   Even the intention behind North American authorities
[01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:10.300]   managing that forest fire is to create less destruction.
[01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:11.980]   That is the intention.
[01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:15.340]   But the intention is divergent from the outcome.
[01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:18.940]   So in Talebian speak, he would say that human intervention
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:23.940]   moves us from mediocristan into extremistan.
[01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:27.380]   So mediocristan would be something much more like nature
[01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:30.180]   where, for instance, you can't double your body weight
[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:33.740]   in a day, probably can't even do it in a year, right?
[01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:34.780]   But in extremistan,
[01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:37.180]   which is something much more information-based,
[01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:41.940]   you can double or send your net worth to zero
[01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:44.800]   in a single trade, in a single moment, right?
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:48.660]   So when we try and intervene with natural biological systems
[01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:51.780]   that have these feedback loops,
[01:18:51.780 --> 01:18:53.880]   we actually start to push the system more,
[01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:56.380]   to behave more like an extremistan system.
[01:18:57.340 --> 01:18:59.900]   That has less short-run volatility,
[01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:03.580]   but more extreme long-run volatility.
[01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:07.140]   - But the question is where you look at capitalism
[01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:10.600]   or communism, for example, and by the way, yes,
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:13.260]   I will talk to somebody who's a Marxist or a communist.
[01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:16.620]   Richard Wolff is a pretty eloquent defender of these ideas
[01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:19.940]   'cause it's always good to really understand ideas
[01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:22.240]   as opposed to just reject them offhand.
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:26.300]   When you look at the system of capitalism
[01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:27.900]   or the system of communism,
[01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:32.140]   there's ideals and a lot of people argue
[01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:35.780]   in this perfect form would actually be good for the world.
[01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:38.620]   The question is how resilient are they
[01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:42.220]   to the corruption of human nature?
[01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:45.900]   And I mean, you're saying that there's never been
[01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:48.820]   a free market, it's a very true statement.
[01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:52.940]   The question is how resilient is capitalism
[01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:54.700]   or whatever implementations of capitalism
[01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:57.340]   we had up to this point to human nature
[01:19:57.340 --> 01:19:59.380]   where one person would become successful
[01:19:59.380 --> 01:20:03.200]   through legitimate means,
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:06.100]   then starts to try to manipulate the system
[01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:07.740]   that takes it away from a free market
[01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:11.100]   or takes it away from the things
[01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:14.060]   that gave them the riches in the first place
[01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:17.380]   and then try to through corruption, get more,
[01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:20.940]   get this, the thing you said, the lazy human ways.
[01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:23.140]   Now try to figure out how to get something for nothing.
[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:24.380]   - That's right.
[01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:26.980]   So how resilient do you think is capitalism to that?
[01:20:26.980 --> 01:20:31.460]   - Well, the best implementation we've had of it
[01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:35.020]   really has been the United States,
[01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:36.620]   I think up until this point,
[01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:41.620]   but it's still the central banking itself.
[01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:45.820]   This was in the 1848 Manifesto to the Communist Party.
[01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:47.900]   Measure number five reads,
[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:49.760]   an exclusive state monopoly
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:51.900]   and centralized control over cash and credit.
[01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:56.660]   So the central bank is a Marxist or communist institution.
[01:20:56.660 --> 01:20:58.820]   It is antithetical to the free market principles
[01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:00.620]   on which the United States was founded.
[01:21:00.620 --> 01:21:02.140]   And indeed the United States resisted
[01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:04.540]   the implementation of a central bank.
[01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:06.560]   I think it was Andrew Jackson.
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:08.500]   I know there was the first national bank,
[01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:10.900]   the second national bank were both disbanded.
[01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:14.140]   And then Andrew Jackson, which is my favorite Tennessean,
[01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:18.260]   he has some famous quotes about routing out the bankers
[01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:19.580]   like a den of vipers.
[01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:23.100]   I think he punched one of the central bankers in the face
[01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:27.020]   back when our leaders were a bit more badass,
[01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:28.860]   I guess you might say.
[01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:33.860]   And finally in 1913, the Federal Reserve was implemented
[01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:39.500]   and it's been kind of all downhill from there.
[01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:41.980]   - So what is, can you, oh, sorry, go ahead.
[01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:45.660]   - I was just gonna say that communism and capitalism,
[01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:47.240]   it's also a matter of scale.
[01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:51.580]   The ideal behind communism is from each
[01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:54.140]   according to their ability to each according to their need.
[01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:55.460]   Sounds beautiful, right?
[01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:58.420]   Sounds like a great, peaceful, harmonious way
[01:21:58.420 --> 01:22:00.060]   to organize ourselves.
[01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:02.700]   The problem is, and by the way,
[01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:05.540]   I am a communist in my family, in my home, right?
[01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:07.180]   - At that very smallest of scales.
[01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:10.260]   - Yes, in your very small circles of trust,
[01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:13.980]   you're much more likely to behave selflessly
[01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:14.820]   towards one another.
[01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:17.300]   - By the way, I look forward to the Bitcoin community
[01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:20.900]   clipping out that part, saying that Robert Breedlove
[01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:23.980]   is a communist and the ideals of communism are beautiful.
[01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:25.580]   - Yeah, context matters, people.
[01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:28.440]   - Sorry, go ahead.
[01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:32.900]   - But to your point, it does not scale, right?
[01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:37.900]   As we move into this larger system
[01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:41.580]   of socioeconomic cooperation, which is necessary
[01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:44.740]   to deepen the division of labor, to generate more wealth,
[01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:46.580]   right, we need to interact with one another
[01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:51.580]   on much larger scales than this communistic utopian ideal,
[01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:54.380]   we get into the realm of capitalism,
[01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:58.060]   where we need really sound rules, hard rules,
[01:22:58.060 --> 01:23:03.060]   consensus, verifiability, and frankly, prices.
[01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:06.420]   'Cause the other thing in Soviet Russia
[01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:08.820]   is they tried to replace the profit motive
[01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:12.460]   or the price signal with this devotion
[01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:15.460]   to this nationalistic faith and devotion,
[01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:18.380]   where it's like you don't need self-interest anymore,
[01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:20.340]   you don't need prices or profits,
[01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:23.300]   you can just protect Mother Russia, right,
[01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:26.460]   and serve Mother Russia, and that would create wealth.
[01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:27.900]   And what happened?
[01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:29.820]   Right, they destroyed price signals,
[01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:32.240]   there were shortages, there were famines,
[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:36.020]   there's all levels of corruption.
[01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:38.440]   Because to your point, it's once you,
[01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:42.560]   people have to run the system no matter what.
[01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:45.480]   So when people are always pursuing something for nothing,
[01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:47.960]   and you put someone in a seat of much closer
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:49.880]   to absolute power, where they're making
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:52.680]   all the pricing decisions, they own all
[01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:54.840]   of the productive factors in the economy,
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:57.840]   they're not beholden to any market force,
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:01.720]   there's no market check on their action,
[01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:04.840]   that that institution tends to become more corrupt.
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:08.920]   And further, it's an inferior resource strategy.
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:12.880]   And I alluded to this earlier, where the other way
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:16.040]   to think about free market versus central planning
[01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:20.520]   is it's decentralized or distributed computing
[01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:22.840]   versus centralized computing.
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:26.220]   So each one of us, I think that the number
[01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:29.520]   is 120 bits per second of active awareness.
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:32.300]   So we can take in, clearly we process a lot more than that,
[01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:35.200]   but our active awareness, I think, is 120 bits per second.
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:40.400]   In a centralized planning body like in Soviet Russia,
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:43.880]   they had the pricing czar, maybe they had 10, 20,000 people
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:46.160]   deciding the prices for the entire country,
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:49.000]   you're only getting that much data throughput,
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.400]   20,000 people times 120 bits per second.
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:55.440]   Whereas in a free market, if everyone is free
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:57.480]   to interact with deep capital markets
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:59.600]   based on an accurate price, you're getting
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:02.120]   the data throughput of 120 bits per second
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:03.580]   times the entire economy.
[01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:08.840]   So you're getting, it's a more efficient means
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:11.840]   for disseminating knowledge effectively.
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:14.080]   And then again, knowledge is just,
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:17.360]   the more knowledge a socioeconomic structure can contain,
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:19.240]   the more wealthy it is, right?
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:21.840]   Prices, tools, all these things are just knowledge.
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:26.840]   So in that respect, that's why something like capitalism,
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:30.780]   even in its marginalized form, state capitalism,
[01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:33.160]   outcompetes communism.
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:36.440]   It's distributed computing versus centralized computing.
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:40.640]   - You know, we kind of brought up religion
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:45.640]   and Joseph Campbell and myth and the propagation of ideas.
[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:48.040]   And it kind of, before I forget,
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:50.600]   I wanted to ask your thoughts about this.
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:55.080]   You know, Jordan Peterson, I haven't really understood
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:58.600]   exactly, like be able to pin him down exactly
[01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:03.600]   what he sees as the role of religion in human society.
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:08.600]   But it feels like he's describing it
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:11.520]   as having value for us.
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:15.520]   The ideas of myth are valuable.
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:18.680]   They're valuable mechanisms toward,
[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:21.560]   I think you mentioned kind of directing us
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:23.840]   in this world as a human society.
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:26.280]   Do you think about myth?
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:27.660]   Do you think about religion?
[01:26:27.660 --> 01:26:32.040]   What's the use of it in this construct of markets
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:37.040]   in this framework of where ideas are ultimately
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:43.080]   the fundamental thing that makes societies work?
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:49.720]   - Yeah, I think Jordan Peterson, who I'm a huge fan of,
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:51.960]   he's been very influential on my thinking
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:56.400]   and influential on my own religious views as well.
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:02.800]   I think his position would be, and he's said this before,
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:06.460]   that he acts as if God exists.
[01:27:06.460 --> 01:27:11.060]   And I've had some arguments about this before,
[01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:15.240]   but to me that points towards the preeminence of action
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:16.720]   and how important action is
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:20.180]   versus your cognitive beliefs necessarily.
[01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:23.400]   And I think there is a lot of utility in that,
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:25.900]   that if you follow the moral code
[01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:27.340]   of something like the Bible,
[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:30.480]   you do reap benefits from that.
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:32.520]   Society reaps benefits from that.
[01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:37.040]   And this is not, and sometimes I bring up this point
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:38.560]   and people are like, oh my God, are you kidding me?
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:39.720]   Have you read the Old Testament?
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:41.640]   They're clobbering people with rocks
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:43.580]   when they do the wrong thing.
[01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:46.560]   The Bible doesn't claim to be this,
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:48.520]   like do everything that was done in the Bible.
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:50.960]   It's more like charting this moral progression
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:53.620]   where we came from this very barbaric society
[01:27:53.620 --> 01:27:56.040]   into something more like the New Testament
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:58.680]   where we're honoring individual sovereignty
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:00.080]   above the state and things like that.
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:04.920]   So I think that mythology itself
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:07.460]   is another form of data compression.
[01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:10.120]   If you look at these stories,
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:11.880]   Cain and Abel is a good example,
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:14.920]   or Peterson makes the point that it's a tiny story.
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:17.880]   It's a paragraph-ish long,
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:20.160]   but it contains so many layers of meaning
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:24.660]   in regards to violence, to evil, betrayal, work.
[01:28:25.540 --> 01:28:29.300]   The divergence between intention and result,
[01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:31.620]   'cause I think Cain is actually making,
[01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:36.380]   he's making the effort to sacrifice for God,
[01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:38.740]   but the sacrifices he's making are not,
[01:28:38.740 --> 01:28:41.180]   God doesn't find them useful, right?
[01:28:41.180 --> 01:28:43.500]   And so he sort of rejects them.
[01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:49.900]   For a, again, we're organized by these useful fictions,
[01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:53.420]   these Heraurian imagined orders.
[01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:56.820]   I think mythology is kind of the original version of that
[01:28:56.820 --> 01:29:01.820]   where we were learning to organize ourselves around stories
[01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:08.340]   to best coordinate our action across space and time.
[01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:12.420]   And so I think it's very foundational.
[01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:16.180]   And back to what we were saying in the beginning,
[01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:18.420]   that if value truly is fundamental,
[01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:20.900]   I think it's interesting that all these stories
[01:29:20.900 --> 01:29:24.620]   point towards often common moral values.
[01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:26.360]   They're not perfectly aligned,
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:31.420]   but it does speak to just the evolutionary
[01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:34.600]   importance of morality and the subjectivity of morality,
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:37.100]   where morality sort of evolves over time
[01:29:37.100 --> 01:29:40.900]   based on, frankly, the capital stock we've accumulated.
[01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:42.580]   The more capital stock we've accumulated,
[01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:45.700]   the easier life is, the less barbaric we have to be.
[01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:49.520]   Whereas if we're living in conditions of true scarcity,
[01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:54.120]   then we tend to be a bit more barbaric towards one another.
[01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:58.360]   And that too, to dovetail this into something
[01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:01.160]   largely unrelated, but I think is really important,
[01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:02.120]   is inflation.
[01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:07.380]   Inflation by artificially increasing the prices
[01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:09.240]   of goods and services in the world, right?
[01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:12.060]   We're injecting more dollars,
[01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:15.000]   chasing the same level of goods and services.
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.920]   We are artificially increasing scarcity.
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:21.680]   Perceived scarcity, right?
[01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:24.760]   And when you increase perceived scarcity,
[01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:27.640]   you are amplifying divisiveness.
[01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:33.280]   The natural state of man is when everything is scarce
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:34.680]   and you really have to fight hard
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:37.560]   just to eat or drink water that day.
[01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:40.520]   So it's de-civilizing in a way,
[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:43.520]   by artificially amplifying the perceived scarcity
[01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:44.760]   in the world.
[01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:46.800]   - Can you elaborate, how does inflation
[01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:49.200]   increase the perceived scarcity in the world?
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:52.960]   - So we can think the price itself is an indication,
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:54.600]   it's a data packet, if you will.
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:57.760]   The price is a data packet on supply and demand, right?
[01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:00.400]   It's telling you how much supply there is
[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:03.520]   of something in the world relative to the demand.
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:08.520]   So when you print money and artificially increase that price,
[01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:10.800]   it's diverging away from supply and demand.
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:13.800]   It's becoming just more of a product of policy
[01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:16.120]   than it is of free market fundamentals.
[01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:19.920]   The more expensive something is,
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:21.840]   that is a signal to the marketplace
[01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:24.640]   and to market actors that it is scarce, right?
[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:29.640]   That's why a Leonardo painting might sell for $16 million.
[01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:32.920]   There's only one, there's a lot of demand for it.
[01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:35.960]   Maybe my numbers are off, but you get the point.
[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:38.360]   It's the reason mask spiked in price
[01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:39.880]   after the COVID announcement, right?
[01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:41.840]   There was not enough supply,
[01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:43.600]   toilet paper, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:47.720]   So inflation, and by inflation,
[01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:50.920]   I specifically mean arbitrary fiat currency
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:53.920]   supply inflation by legal monopoly,
[01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:57.360]   not inflation's a commonly misunderstood word.
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:01.400]   That is amplifying the perception of scarcity
[01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:03.600]   among market actors in the world.
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:07.880]   And I would argue that it actually amplifies divisiveness.
[01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:12.080]   I think this is the key maybe to looking at
[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:15.160]   the connection between the monopolization of money
[01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:17.200]   and things like cancel culture,
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:22.200]   because it's increasing our natural predilection
[01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:24.360]   to be combative with one another
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:26.760]   because we think there's more scarcity in the world
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:28.000]   than there actually is.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.960]   Versus in a world where you're not increasing
[01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:33.280]   the money supply, prices are declining every year.
[01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:36.480]   As prices decline, this is a signal to market actors
[01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:39.060]   and the market that scarcity is declining.
[01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:41.980]   There's less need to fight over things.
[01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:46.240]   And all of this ties back into the old Bastiat saying
[01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:50.320]   that if goods don't cross borders, soldiers will.
[01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:52.080]   So if we're not trading with one another,
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:54.000]   if we're not acting interdependently
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:59.000]   and we're not becoming more intelligent as a market
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:03.840]   and that increased intelligence or increased knowledge
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:06.640]   is reflected in decreased prices,
[01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:11.040]   because prices are just the exchange ratios of things.
[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:13.020]   So the smarter we can solve problems,
[01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:15.920]   the better we can solve problems, the less prices would be.
[01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:18.840]   So it induces more cooperation.
[01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:21.680]   - I love how you tie inflation cancel culture together
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:26.680]   as essentially artificial creation of increase of conflict,
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:30.440]   increasing artificially increasing scarcity
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:33.320]   and thereby artificially increasing conflict.
[01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:34.920]   That's really fascinating.
[01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:38.520]   You're short-circuiting my brain
[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:40.520]   many times throughout this conversation.
[01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:42.240]   Okay, I'm struggling.
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:45.360]   This robot is struggling to keep up.
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:50.360]   Okay, maybe to step back at the useful fictions
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:55.400]   or pragmatic truths, let me ask the question
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:57.520]   that you've answered in many ways already,
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:01.940]   but let's explicitly look at what is money?
[01:34:01.940 --> 01:34:04.240]   - Oh, as you know, that's my favorite question.
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:06.480]   (laughing)
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:10.000]   Is the name of the show I just launched,
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:11.520]   the "What Is Money?" show.
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:17.040]   Clearly, we could say the Bitcoin rabbit hole
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:20.680]   is what's led me to explore a lot of these ideas in depth.
[01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:23.960]   And I think as we've demonstrated today,
[01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:26.720]   it goes well beyond just the economic sphere
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:28.840]   when you start to think about things like exchange
[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:33.220]   and morality and time preference and civilization.
[01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:36.040]   So I love the question, what is money?
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:40.440]   I think it is the key to incepting a deeper understanding
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:42.360]   of the world into people, that if you actually
[01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:46.680]   just start to ask the seemingly simple question,
[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:50.680]   it surfaces more and more layers of truth.
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:55.920]   And I recently, I just wrote a piece,
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:59.760]   I think I have 30-something answers to this question.
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:03.460]   - So sometimes it's actually a more systematic way
[01:35:03.460 --> 01:35:06.640]   of asking the question of what is the meaning of life?
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:11.320]   There's some questions that are almost unanswerable,
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:16.320]   but in their asking allow you to get closer to truth,
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:21.520]   deeply understand the nature of our human existence.
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:23.680]   And the meaning of life is almost like this
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:28.160]   initial philosophers striving towards that.
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:32.240]   If money is indeed as fundamental,
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:35.600]   as you've described, especially in the context
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:39.680]   of value being fundamental, then that is a really,
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:42.040]   that's a more, let's take a 21st century way
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:43.360]   of asking the same question about
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:45.080]   what is the meaning of life?
[01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:47.760]   You mentioned that it's a meta property
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:51.080]   out of the list of many ways to answer that question.
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:53.280]   How would you help people to think about that?
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:58.280]   - Yeah, the first most serious answer
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:01.460]   comes from the School of Austrian Economics
[01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:06.460]   and it defines money as a universal medium of exchange.
[01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:11.520]   So this would be any good that is used,
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:17.560]   held and used purely for purposes of facilitating exchange.
[01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:22.560]   So in the configuration of demand for any particular asset,
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:26.820]   it's bifurcated between its utility,
[01:36:26.820 --> 01:36:29.720]   which is something, a service that it can render to you
[01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:34.720]   in real time, whether it's, if it's water, you're thirsty.
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:38.100]   That's the utility of water is that it can quench your thirst
[01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:41.920]   whereas the marketability would be the expectation
[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:44.460]   of future exchange, that other people would want
[01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:46.060]   this asset in the future to trade it
[01:36:46.060 --> 01:36:47.460]   for whatever they may have.
[01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:53.660]   Money is just going to be the good in any trading economy
[01:36:53.660 --> 01:36:56.020]   that has the highest proportion of marketability
[01:36:56.020 --> 01:36:57.920]   relative to utility.
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:00.580]   So today that would be gold.
[01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:03.460]   Gold has utility, it's used in electronics,
[01:37:03.460 --> 01:37:06.540]   it's used in dental, dentistry and whatnot,
[01:37:06.540 --> 01:37:09.920]   but it's largely used as a store of value across time
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:12.180]   and that's what it's been used for for 5,000 years.
[01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:16.700]   So if we say gold has a $10 trillion market cap,
[01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:19.380]   maybe 2 trillion of that is its utility value
[01:37:19.380 --> 01:37:22.620]   or it's actually demand for use in computers and dentistry
[01:37:22.620 --> 01:37:24.500]   and then 8 trillion of that is demand
[01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:26.240]   for its use as a store of value.
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:32.240]   Money, the marketability aspects of money
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:35.820]   boils down to five services that money can render.
[01:37:35.820 --> 01:37:40.340]   Money needs to be divisible, it needs to be durable,
[01:37:40.340 --> 01:37:42.820]   it needs to be recognizable, it needs to be portable
[01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:44.280]   and it needs to be scarce.
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:47.220]   So I'll gloss over a lot of history with this
[01:37:47.220 --> 01:37:50.020]   and just say that historically,
[01:37:50.020 --> 01:37:51.900]   money's always been a technology,
[01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:53.700]   still is a technology or a tool.
[01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:55.180]   I use these terms interchangeably
[01:37:55.180 --> 01:37:56.740]   and you can think of a technology
[01:37:56.740 --> 01:37:59.000]   as just a more sophisticated tool effectively.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:03.940]   To best satisfy those properties,
[01:38:03.940 --> 01:38:05.580]   monetary metals were determined
[01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:08.300]   to be the most satisfactory tool,
[01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:10.020]   the most divisible, most durable, most recognizable,
[01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:13.140]   most portable tool in the marketplace.
[01:38:13.140 --> 01:38:17.020]   Of the monetary metals, gold was the most scarce
[01:38:17.020 --> 01:38:20.580]   as quantified by either its stock to flow ratio
[01:38:20.580 --> 01:38:22.240]   or its inflation resistance.
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:24.560]   So simple way to say this is that
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:27.920]   people always prefer the money most resistant to inflation.
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:30.740]   - That's a nice definition of scarcity in the context
[01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:33.980]   of money is if you were to measure it,
[01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:35.980]   the resistance to inflation.
[01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:38.900]   So how hard is it to artificially increase the supply?
[01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:39.940]   - That's right.
[01:38:39.940 --> 01:38:41.820]   That is the hardness of money.
[01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:43.380]   And that's why gold is hard money.
[01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:44.860]   - 'Cause the alchemy is hard.
[01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:46.100]   - That's right.
[01:38:46.100 --> 01:38:48.860]   'Cause no one cracked the alchemy, so gold became money.
[01:38:49.780 --> 01:38:54.780]   So that's such a nice, clean explanation of what is money
[01:38:54.780 --> 01:38:59.280]   with the five elements and gold ultimately won out
[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:01.680]   because of the last piece of scarcity.
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:02.520]   - That's right.
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:04.600]   And to get to maybe dig a little deeper there.
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:08.400]   So scarcity, we commonly think of scarcity
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:12.400]   as strictly a supply property,
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:15.200]   where if there's not much of something, then it's scarce.
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:16.520]   But it's not actually true.
[01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:20.780]   Scarcity occurs when demand exceeds supply.
[01:39:20.780 --> 01:39:24.380]   So when there's more demand than the supply can justify,
[01:39:24.380 --> 01:39:26.300]   the thing becomes an economic good
[01:39:26.300 --> 01:39:30.060]   and it establishes itself a market price.
[01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:31.580]   So there's more demand for the thing
[01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:33.800]   than the supply can satisfy.
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:37.060]   The unique thing about money as a concept at least
[01:39:37.060 --> 01:39:40.800]   is that demand always exceeds supply.
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:43.500]   There's never enough money to satisfy everyone, right?
[01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:46.380]   Because another definition for money,
[01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:48.600]   it's the most marketable good.
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:52.340]   So it can be traded for any other good,
[01:39:52.340 --> 01:39:55.160]   service, piece of knowledge in the marketplace.
[01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:58.240]   So humans being what we are, we're never satisfied, right?
[01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:01.220]   We always want more of something, whatever it may be.
[01:40:01.220 --> 01:40:04.980]   So money as the ultimate token of obtaining that something
[01:40:04.980 --> 01:40:07.280]   is always scarce as a concept.
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:12.560]   But the problem with money is that if you can,
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:15.480]   as you alluded to, easily increase its supply,
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:17.040]   then all of a sudden you can compromise
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:18.520]   the scarcity of it over time
[01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:22.160]   and you can rob people through inflation.
[01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:26.560]   So that's why the market settled on gold as money.
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:30.600]   - And robbing is reallocating the value that,
[01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:34.320]   so essentially the one property,
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:39.320]   like why scarcity is important is it adds a lot more
[01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:42.500]   friction to the reallocation.
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:48.880]   Like through essentially violence or implied violence.
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:51.360]   - Well, it prevents it through cost of extraction too.
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:54.440]   So if you want to go out and dilute gold holders today,
[01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:57.400]   you have to go out into the world and mine gold.
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:59.680]   It's a very expensive process.
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:02.680]   That process tends to find equilibrium
[01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:05.160]   where production cost equals the market value of gold.
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:08.480]   So if market value is $2,000 an ounce today of gold,
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:10.920]   its production cost is gonna be around there.
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:12.360]   That's the natural market equilibrium.
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:16.800]   So that way gold miners cannot just dilute people over time.
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:19.680]   Whereas if you look at something like fiat currency,
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:21.140]   which we're jumping ahead a little bit,
[01:41:21.140 --> 01:41:23.800]   but its production cost is zero.
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:26.520]   So there's a reason the market value of fiat currency
[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:29.480]   historically has always converged to zero
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:31.440]   because its production cost is near zero.
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:34.040]   So the extension to that question might be
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:37.680]   how did we get from gold to paper currency?
[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:40.420]   And again, this is rooted in the properties of money.
[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:43.120]   As good as monetary metals were,
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:44.840]   and as good as gold is as money,
[01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:47.620]   at holding value across time,
[01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:50.680]   it's rather limited in terms of portability.
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:54.060]   It is not as useful for moving value across space.
[01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:55.800]   This is another definition of money, by the way,
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:59.040]   a social device for moving value across space and time.
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:04.840]   So to rectify this technological shortcoming of gold,
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:08.160]   we introduced, first of all,
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:10.920]   the custody of gold was gradually centralized
[01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:15.600]   into fewer and fewer warehousing operations.
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:17.760]   This is because there are economies of scale
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:21.000]   associated with using gold as money.
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.120]   And that if you centralize the custody,
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:26.480]   the warehouse owner can then issue a paper receipt,
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:28.560]   called a warehouse receipt for that gold.
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:31.120]   And then market participants can trade that paper
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:32.480]   as if it's good as gold.
[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:34.160]   And everyone has an option at any time
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:36.840]   to go and redeem real gold from the warehouse.
[01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:38.320]   So that system works.
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:42.640]   Until the problem with it is that it introduces the need
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:44.120]   to trust the custodian.
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:45.840]   So it's introducing counterparty risk
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:47.680]   in the form of the custodian.
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:50.240]   And now should that warehouse choose
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:54.140]   to increase the supply of paper notes to gold
[01:42:54.140 --> 01:42:55.400]   beyond its supply.
[01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:57.560]   So if it's got three tons of gold
[01:42:57.560 --> 01:43:00.880]   and it issues six tons worth of paper receipts,
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:03.440]   all of a sudden it's participating in a fraud.
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:04.520]   It's basically lying.
[01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:06.160]   It's representing that it has more gold
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:07.460]   than it actually does.
[01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:11.560]   And this is, that is the pathway
[01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:14.000]   that we got into banking and central banking.
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.560]   Is we needed a convenience mechanism
[01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:19.460]   to rectify the portability shortcomings of gold.
[01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:22.200]   We needed to be able to move value across space.
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:24.660]   Gold is doing a great job at moving value over time,
[01:43:24.660 --> 01:43:26.040]   but not space.
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:27.400]   Paper currency gave us the ability
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:29.140]   to move value across space.
[01:43:29.140 --> 01:43:31.560]   But it introduced this attack vector
[01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:34.200]   for warehouse operators, which became banks,
[01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:36.040]   which became central banks,
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:39.980]   to modify the supply to suit their own political agendas.
[01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:41.420]   - Added the snooze button.
[01:43:41.420 --> 01:43:45.840]   Allows you to do just do a little fraud.
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:47.320]   - To get something for nothing.
[01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:49.160]   - Something, just a little bit at first.
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:50.000]   - Yeah.
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:53.480]   - Just this one morning, just a little bit.
[01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:55.720]   I mean, I don't know if you can speak to
[01:43:55.720 --> 01:44:00.120]   the birth of fiat currency.
[01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:04.160]   Is there some interesting characteristics
[01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:07.600]   to that, those early steps that created it?
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:09.940]   Like, could it have been averted?
[01:44:09.940 --> 01:44:14.940]   Or is this the natural progression of governments?
[01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:18.320]   - You know what's funny is that
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:21.080]   central banking was initially designed
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:23.480]   to be the custodian of gold, right?
[01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:26.560]   So they were going to custody the gold,
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:28.620]   issue paper on top of it,
[01:44:28.620 --> 01:44:31.440]   and then they would maintain,
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:33.420]   you could trust the public stamp effectively.
[01:44:33.420 --> 01:44:34.840]   You could trust that the central bank
[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:37.400]   had as much gold on reserve as they said they had.
[01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:39.260]   And they were supposed to be the trustworthy institution.
[01:44:39.260 --> 01:44:42.120]   So we went from placing our trust
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:44.700]   in a free market game theoretic process,
[01:44:44.700 --> 01:44:45.920]   or trusting gold,
[01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:48.280]   and we began trusting this institution instead.
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:54.400]   That institution would not have arisen
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:58.140]   if the portability of gold was really high.
[01:44:58.140 --> 01:45:00.360]   If we could have somehow sent gold
[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:02.280]   across a telecommunications channel,
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:05.040]   there would have been no need for a central bank.
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:07.520]   Everyone could have custody their gold
[01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:10.700]   in any information bearing medium, frankly,
[01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:13.720]   and they could beam it around the world at any time.
[01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:16.880]   So this whole institution itself
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:21.040]   is rooted in a technological shortcoming of gold.
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:22.220]   So I think it's,
[01:45:22.220 --> 01:45:26.400]   another way to think about that is maybe had there been,
[01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:28.560]   all the gold in the world today
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:30.960]   fills two Olympic-sized swimming pools.
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:32.920]   All the gold mined throughout all of human history.
[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:34.080]   So there's not a lot.
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:38.720]   What if there had been just like way more?
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:39.560]   There'd just been, I don't know,
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:41.780]   20,000 Olympic swimming pools worth?
[01:45:41.780 --> 01:45:46.000]   Portability wouldn't have been as much of an issue.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:46.960]   And this is to say,
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:48.920]   assuming gold was still the most scarce metal
[01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:49.960]   in all these things,
[01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:54.600]   portability would have been less of an issue.
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:55.940]   We would have had less dependence
[01:45:55.940 --> 01:45:57.960]   or need for a central bank.
[01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:00.200]   So I think it's kind of idiosyncratic
[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:03.720]   in that we just happened to end up here on this planet
[01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:05.120]   with a certain amount of gold.
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:07.400]   It best satisfied the properties of money.
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:08.960]   - And a certain amount of humans,
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:12.120]   the geographic dispersed such that portability
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:14.280]   had certain properties that you want to achieve
[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:16.080]   for humans in the geographical space
[01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:18.720]   to be able to be exchange value.
[01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:20.920]   - It became more of an issue as we globalized.
[01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:22.560]   As we became more of a global society,
[01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:26.440]   we needed money that could move across space really fast.
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:29.640]   So we could trade in international capital markets.
[01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:33.560]   So that drove the central bank
[01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:35.720]   to become the dominant institution of the world.
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:39.120]   And if you follow the flows of gold throughout history,
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:41.240]   you know, I've been watching this documentary
[01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:43.680]   on World War I and World War II on Netflix.
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:45.880]   I think it's called World War II in Color.
[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:47.720]   - Oh yeah, that's really good.
[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:48.560]   - So good.
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:53.520]   When I say gold has been the governor of governments
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:55.120]   or gold is geopolitical money,
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:59.160]   like it is the base layer operating system,
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:02.160]   has been the base layer operating system for analog society.
[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:04.560]   So it's always been about who controls the gold.
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:06.960]   It's who makes the rules.
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:11.200]   And that's in that context
[01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:12.720]   is why Bitcoin is so interesting
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:16.440]   because it is the disruptor to
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:18.840]   this base level operating system
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:22.040]   that's functioned for all of human history.
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:24.440]   - I think this is a good place to ask.
[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:26.320]   We asked the what is money question.
[01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:29.080]   What is Bitcoin?
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:35.120]   - That's a question as complicated as what is money.
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:39.120]   I think if you get a general understanding of money
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:42.800]   from a number of angles
[01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:47.800]   that we could say Bitcoin is the most superior
[01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:50.480]   monetary technology that has ever existed.
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:54.760]   - So one of the most superior implementation
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:56.720]   of the ideas of money that you talked about,
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:58.320]   you talked about money as speech,
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:00.080]   you talked about money as an idea.
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:04.000]   We talked about money as sovereignty.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.440]   - Yeah, so we're attaching the concept of money
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:11.440]   to your point to whatever tool best satisfies
[01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:13.720]   those properties of money
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:16.800]   or best renders those services we need for money.
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:19.280]   - And as you said, you're using the word tool
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:20.680]   and technology interchangeably here.
[01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:22.280]   - Yes, yes.
[01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:24.800]   And another thing to think about here is that
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:28.480]   we think often in terms of goods or services,
[01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:31.880]   but actually everything is a service.
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:35.520]   So it's not the physical properties of this pen
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:36.800]   that I find valuable,
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:38.800]   it's the services that it renders to me
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:40.440]   that I want to write a letter.
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:45.440]   This serves me by allowing me to lay ink on paper
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:47.880]   and communicate information.
[01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:52.480]   So value, humans attach value,
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:56.360]   as we alluded to earlier, to services, not goods.
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:48:58.920]   So the properties or the services that money renders
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:01.560]   that human beings value are those five properties,
[01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:02.680]   divisibility, durability,
[01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:05.080]   recognizability, portability, scarcity.
[01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:10.080]   Metals best satisfied those services historically,
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:13.080]   but Bitcoin as the most superior monetary technology
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:16.540]   in human history, essentially perfects them.
[01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:19.160]   It's as close to perfection as we've ever been.
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:21.760]   So in terms of divisibility,
[01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:23.400]   each Bitcoin can be broken down
[01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:26.180]   into 100 million subunits called a Satoshi.
[01:49:26.180 --> 01:49:31.480]   If that divisibility were ever a problem,
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:35.160]   which actually there was a question that came up recently,
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:37.440]   if you divide the world population
[01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:38.760]   by the total supply of Bitcoin,
[01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:42.000]   you end up at like 0.3 Bitcoin per person,
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:46.040]   call it 300,000 Satoshis per person.
[01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:47.760]   What if that was not enough
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:50.560]   to facilitate economic activity?
[01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:53.200]   And the answer to that is Bitcoin can soft fork
[01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:54.560]   into further divisibility.
[01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:57.000]   So if Bitcoin ate all the money in the world
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:00.480]   and the average Bitcoin or wealth
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:02.100]   was say 300,000 Satoshis each,
[01:50:02.100 --> 01:50:06.160]   but that wasn't divisible enough maybe to buy coffee
[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:07.560]   and do all these day-to-day transactions,
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:08.400]   what would happen?
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:09.800]   Well, we would increase its divisibility.
[01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:12.500]   So Bitcoin's perfected divisibility.
[01:50:12.500 --> 01:50:16.240]   The divisibility of money lets us transact across scales.
[01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:18.720]   All right, we can buy coffee or we can buy a house.
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:23.120]   Durability is an interesting one.
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:25.360]   So clearly something like gold is very durable.
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:28.280]   It's resistant to degradation over time.
[01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:30.240]   Bitcoin is just pure information,
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:33.520]   but it's stored in a distributed format.
[01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:36.960]   So information stored in a distributed fashion
[01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:40.800]   tends to be virtually infinitely durable.
[01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:41.760]   The example I like to give here
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:43.560]   is something like the Bible.
[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:46.080]   The Bible is just distributed information.
[01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:49.240]   It's stored everywhere and nowhere, so to speak.
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:52.040]   And for that reason, it has outlasted empires.
[01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:54.320]   And Bitcoin's similar, right?
[01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:57.040]   You can't make changes to it unilaterally.
[01:50:57.040 --> 01:50:59.360]   - But to make explicit,
[01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:01.920]   the ways in which it is not durable
[01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:05.400]   is the fact that it relies on computing infrastructure.
[01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:08.360]   Like it needs computers.
[01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:11.200]   So if you were to destroy all the computers in the world,
[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:15.360]   it needs mechanisms that store
[01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:16.640]   and transfer information.
[01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:17.600]   - That's right.
[01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:20.040]   - And so you could attack it.
[01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:22.040]   I mean, you could attack gold in the same kind of way,
[01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:23.760]   as opposed to the physics,
[01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:26.240]   but it's probably easier to destroy
[01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:27.360]   all the computers in the world
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:30.280]   than it is to destroy all the gold in the world.
[01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:32.320]   Maybe not, I don't know.
[01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:33.640]   Anyway.
[01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:34.680]   - Yeah, you're right.
[01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:38.440]   Maybe, I'm not sure which one would be harder to destroy.
[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:41.880]   But the other thing is there's a dynamic incentive.
[01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:44.840]   So every time you destroy Bitcoin miners,
[01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:46.600]   you're creating incentives for anyone else
[01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:48.920]   with access to electricity to mine.
[01:51:48.920 --> 01:51:50.720]   'Cause you're making the algorithm easier.
[01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:54.120]   - Yeah, so the destruction is difficult
[01:51:54.120 --> 01:51:56.600]   because of the decentralized nature of the whole thing.
[01:51:56.600 --> 01:51:57.920]   - And the difficulty adjustment.
[01:51:57.920 --> 01:52:00.520]   - Yeah, so you're gonna have to use nuclear weapons
[01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:02.080]   and cover the whole globe.
[01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:02.920]   But anyway.
[01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:05.000]   - Yeah, and by then we've got much bigger problems
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:05.840]   than money, right?
[01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:08.560]   - That's right.
[01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:09.680]   So, okay, so that's durability.
[01:52:09.680 --> 01:52:12.320]   - So portability, Bitcoin's pure information.
[01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:13.680]   It can move at the speed of light.
[01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:15.920]   It can't get much faster than that.
[01:52:15.920 --> 01:52:20.600]   Recognizability refers to the ability to verify
[01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:23.400]   the veracity of the money or its authenticity.
[01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:27.360]   So you can actually, when we used to transact gold,
[01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:30.040]   there were time-honored techniques for verifying
[01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:33.000]   that it was gold and not gold-plated lead, for instance.
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:34.920]   This is where we get the term sound money.
[01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:36.800]   A gold coin made a very particular sound
[01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:38.320]   when dropped from a certain height.
[01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:40.240]   You know, you've seen people biting coins.
[01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:42.720]   These are all techniques for testing
[01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:44.120]   the authenticity of gold.
[01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:46.480]   And with Bitcoin, we have something unique
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:48.360]   in that if you're running a full node,
[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:51.200]   you can verify that the Bitcoin is Bitcoin, right?
[01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:53.440]   It cannot be tampered with.
[01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:54.920]   It cannot be faked.
[01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:57.300]   And in addition to that, as a node operator,
[01:52:57.300 --> 01:53:00.040]   you can audit the total supply of Bitcoin at any time,
[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:01.600]   which is unlike any money in history.
[01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:04.200]   So you know with full certainty
[01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:06.840]   if you're holding 1,000 Bitcoin,
[01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:10.460]   you have 1,000 out of a possible 21 million forever.
[01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:13.060]   You have a guaranteed fraction of the total supply.
[01:53:13.060 --> 01:53:14.740]   - Yeah, so a full node contains information
[01:53:14.740 --> 01:53:16.580]   about every transaction that's ever been had,
[01:53:16.580 --> 01:53:19.140]   so you can figure out, yeah, I mean,
[01:53:19.140 --> 01:53:23.860]   all the truth of this money is all right there.
[01:53:23.860 --> 01:53:25.780]   - Yeah, it's like a fractal constituent
[01:53:25.780 --> 01:53:27.100]   of the whole network, right?
[01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:30.820]   The whole Bitcoin blockchain is comprised in a node, too.
[01:53:30.820 --> 01:53:32.180]   Not the proof of work piece,
[01:53:32.180 --> 01:53:33.880]   but the entire transaction history.
[01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:37.060]   And so that's unique as well.
[01:53:37.060 --> 01:53:39.960]   And that's what makes Bitcoin the ultimate store of value,
[01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:43.800]   is that you know with certainty what the total supply is
[01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:45.100]   and will ever be.
[01:53:45.100 --> 01:53:49.460]   And you know that your share of that supply is fixed.
[01:53:49.460 --> 01:53:50.480]   It cannot change.
[01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:51.900]   It can only improve, actually.
[01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:53.740]   If someone loses, you know,
[01:53:53.740 --> 01:53:56.020]   if the Satoshi stash is truly gone forever,
[01:53:56.020 --> 01:53:58.020]   the million Bitcoin never moves,
[01:53:58.020 --> 01:53:59.980]   then we're talking about 1,000 Bitcoin
[01:53:59.980 --> 01:54:03.140]   out of 20 million instead, and so on and so forth.
[01:54:03.140 --> 01:54:05.780]   As more people lose access to their Bitcoin,
[01:54:05.780 --> 01:54:08.060]   they're basically making a contribution to everyone else.
[01:54:08.060 --> 01:54:09.560]   It's anti-dilutive.
[01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:13.220]   - And there's certain properties of Bitcoin
[01:54:13.220 --> 01:54:15.520]   that are sort of a little bit more into the details
[01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:19.080]   that ensure that the full nodes,
[01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:22.880]   like the size of all the transactions that ever happened,
[01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:24.320]   at least currently, can be stored
[01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:25.720]   in a single computer, for example.
[01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:28.040]   So it doesn't blow up too quickly.
[01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:28.880]   - That's right.
[01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:32.080]   - But you know, there's arguments that that's not necessary.
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:35.660]   You can make arguments for that to be a very nice property,
[01:54:35.660 --> 01:54:38.280]   but you can also say that there's like drawbacks to it.
[01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:41.520]   That's hence the block size debates
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:42.480]   and all those kinds of things.
[01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:45.280]   - Yeah, that was the Bitcoin Cash Civil War, right?
[01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:47.580]   Was that particular piece.
[01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:48.420]   - Yeah.
[01:54:48.420 --> 01:54:50.760]   - And you know, ostensibly they were saying,
[01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:52.840]   oh, we need more transaction throughput
[01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:55.360]   to buy more coffee and do more transactions.
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:57.520]   But what they were actually doing
[01:54:57.520 --> 01:55:01.900]   was increasing the size computing power necessary
[01:55:01.900 --> 01:55:03.040]   to run a full node,
[01:55:03.340 --> 01:55:04.940]   which would have theoretically
[01:55:04.940 --> 01:55:06.780]   compromised decentralization.
[01:55:06.780 --> 01:55:09.580]   - So yeah, but it would, in theory,
[01:55:09.580 --> 01:55:12.660]   in theory, it would allow you
[01:55:12.660 --> 01:55:15.100]   to have much more transactions.
[01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:15.980]   - That's right.
[01:55:15.980 --> 01:55:18.540]   - But the drawback, it would,
[01:55:18.540 --> 01:55:20.700]   because no longer can be stored
[01:55:20.700 --> 01:55:22.460]   in a single computer, personal computer,
[01:55:22.460 --> 01:55:25.940]   then it naturally leads to decentralization.
[01:55:25.940 --> 01:55:26.780]   - Yes.
[01:55:26.780 --> 01:55:28.020]   - Same kind of thing we see with gold.
[01:55:28.020 --> 01:55:30.620]   - Which would have compromised its survivability.
[01:55:30.620 --> 01:55:31.740]   - Right.
[01:55:31.740 --> 01:55:34.280]   So, what else is there?
[01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:36.280]   - The last one, which leads straight into this one,
[01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:38.400]   actually is the most important one of money,
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:39.960]   which is scarcity.
[01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:44.340]   And that you need to know the supply
[01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:49.340]   is fixed and safeguarded from counterfeiting and inflation,
[01:55:49.340 --> 01:55:51.840]   which counterfeiting and inflation
[01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:53.680]   are the same thing, by the way.
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:57.440]   Counterfeiting is criminalized inflation.
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:00.100]   Inflation is legalized counterfeiting.
[01:56:00.100 --> 01:56:01.720]   So, central banks today,
[01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:03.180]   when they say they're printing money, they're not.
[01:56:03.180 --> 01:56:05.440]   They're counterfeiting currency.
[01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:07.080]   That's a very important part.
[01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:10.380]   And Bitcoin, as I've argued in some of my writing,
[01:56:10.380 --> 01:56:13.520]   is more than just an invention.
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:16.800]   It's actually the discovery of absolute scarcity,
[01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:20.000]   in that we have unveiled a property of money
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.040]   that we will only discover once.
[01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:27.120]   And it's got really major ramifications
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:28.680]   for the world at large.
[01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:33.620]   So, with gold, for instance, as we've covered,
[01:56:33.620 --> 01:56:35.380]   it became money because it was
[01:56:35.380 --> 01:56:37.940]   the most relatively scarce monetary metal.
[01:56:37.940 --> 01:56:41.060]   Its supply was hardest to increase over time.
[01:56:41.060 --> 01:56:44.160]   However, if we could somehow flip a switch today
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:45.740]   and make everyone in the world go out
[01:56:45.740 --> 01:56:46.880]   and start mining gold,
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:49.740]   we could increase the supply much more quickly.
[01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:51.940]   Its historic inflation rate's about 2%.
[01:56:51.940 --> 01:56:53.740]   We could double that pretty quickly.
[01:56:53.740 --> 01:56:58.540]   Bitcoin, with Bitcoin, it is not possible.
[01:56:58.540 --> 01:57:02.460]   So, no matter how much effort and energy and capital
[01:57:02.460 --> 01:57:03.980]   and operational expenditure we pour
[01:57:03.980 --> 01:57:05.500]   into the mining network,
[01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:09.980]   we cannot deviate from its fixed and diminishing supply curve
[01:57:09.980 --> 01:57:13.580]   from between now and the last Bitcoin being mined in 2140
[01:57:13.580 --> 01:57:14.980]   because of the difficulty adjustment.
[01:57:14.980 --> 01:57:18.380]   It's constantly, it's adapting to human action, actually.
[01:57:18.380 --> 01:57:21.900]   So, the harder we pursue it, the more that it proceeds,
[01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:23.300]   and then the less we pursue it,
[01:57:23.300 --> 01:57:25.980]   the more available it makes itself.
[01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:30.260]   And this is, it's a real major breakthrough
[01:57:30.260 --> 01:57:34.580]   because it's the closest thing to perfect information
[01:57:34.580 --> 01:57:37.300]   we've ever had in an economy.
[01:57:37.300 --> 01:57:39.380]   And perfect information is this,
[01:57:39.380 --> 01:57:44.400]   it's a theoretical but unattainable state of the market
[01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:48.420]   where all market actors have all the relevant information
[01:57:48.420 --> 01:57:51.340]   about everything so that they can compete
[01:57:51.340 --> 01:57:53.060]   as efficiently as possible.
[01:57:53.060 --> 01:57:55.420]   And in this state, in a state of pure information,
[01:57:55.420 --> 01:57:57.260]   we have, I'm sorry, perfect information,
[01:57:57.260 --> 01:57:58.980]   we have perfect competition.
[01:57:58.980 --> 01:58:03.100]   And in perfect competition, we maximize wealth generation.
[01:58:03.100 --> 01:58:06.400]   So, we're competing as freely as possible
[01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:10.100]   from coercive and violent impediments.
[01:58:10.100 --> 01:58:13.180]   And so, I think Bitcoin, in that sense,
[01:58:13.180 --> 01:58:17.220]   is going to pull the world closer to a state
[01:58:17.220 --> 01:58:21.700]   of perfect competition than we've ever been before,
[01:58:21.700 --> 01:58:24.540]   which would increase wealth generation
[01:58:24.540 --> 01:58:26.440]   to an extent we've never seen before.
[01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:30.420]   - Many of the things you said about Bitcoin
[01:58:30.420 --> 01:58:32.820]   also hold for other cryptocurrency technologies
[01:58:32.820 --> 01:58:34.300]   that followed after.
[01:58:34.300 --> 01:58:40.660]   Can you say something to why you think Bitcoin
[01:58:40.660 --> 01:58:43.860]   is the superior technology
[01:58:43.860 --> 01:58:46.220]   from a pragmatic truth perspective,
[01:58:46.220 --> 01:58:51.220]   than say, Ethereum, but also other crypto,
[01:58:51.340 --> 01:58:55.340]   like Bitcoin Cash, like other hard forks of Bitcoin,
[01:58:55.340 --> 01:58:59.740]   and, or maybe things that might yet to be invent,
[01:58:59.740 --> 01:59:01.380]   tools yet to be invented.
[01:59:01.380 --> 01:59:05.060]   - Yeah, so, this is a good point of argument
[01:59:05.060 --> 01:59:08.380]   because a lot of people have countered me and said,
[01:59:08.380 --> 01:59:11.260]   "Bitcoin cannot be absolute scarcity
[01:59:11.260 --> 01:59:13.220]   because you can fork it and create something
[01:59:13.220 --> 01:59:15.500]   with the same properties as Bitcoin,
[01:59:15.500 --> 01:59:17.660]   or potentially even better properties, right?
[01:59:17.660 --> 01:59:20.500]   You create something with a deflationary monetary policy."
[01:59:21.220 --> 01:59:23.660]   That's what Bitcoin Cash was actually.
[01:59:23.660 --> 01:59:26.260]   It forked Bitcoin with all of the same properties,
[01:59:26.260 --> 01:59:29.300]   except for the block size that we alluded to earlier.
[01:59:29.300 --> 01:59:33.060]   The problem is, is that money is valued.
[01:59:33.060 --> 01:59:36.620]   Again, it's the good with a configuration of demand
[01:59:36.620 --> 01:59:40.420]   that is predominantly marketability.
[01:59:40.420 --> 01:59:43.600]   So, it is valued based on its liquidity.
[01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:46.660]   That is how many other trading partners are there
[01:59:46.660 --> 01:59:48.820]   in that monetary network.
[01:59:48.820 --> 01:59:52.540]   So, it is a network valued
[01:59:52.540 --> 01:59:54.860]   because of its liquidity and network effects.
[01:59:54.860 --> 01:59:58.660]   So, any new entrant into the market for money
[01:59:58.660 --> 02:00:02.800]   will always, is incentivized to always choose the money
[02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:06.500]   with the deepest liquidity and the most network effects.
[02:00:06.500 --> 02:00:10.580]   This is why money has tended to be a winner-take-all market
[02:00:10.580 --> 02:00:13.500]   because it's essentially a single purpose tool, right?
[02:00:13.500 --> 02:00:15.660]   It is a tool for,
[02:00:16.620 --> 02:00:19.700]   if we consider that tools are time-saving devices, right?
[02:00:19.700 --> 02:00:21.700]   The shovel lets you dig more holes per man hour
[02:00:21.700 --> 02:00:23.220]   than you can with your bare hands.
[02:00:23.220 --> 02:00:26.300]   Money is a tool, there's yet another definition of money,
[02:00:26.300 --> 02:00:28.600]   that lets us calculate, negotiate,
[02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:30.540]   and execute trades more quickly.
[02:00:30.540 --> 02:00:36.560]   So, that function tends to coalesce towards one solution.
[02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:43.260]   And so, the short answer would be that for the same reasons,
[02:00:43.260 --> 02:00:44.640]   quantifiable reasons, right?
[02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:48.500]   Like inflation resistance and liquidity and network effects,
[02:00:48.500 --> 02:00:50.660]   that we have one analog gold,
[02:00:50.660 --> 02:00:53.580]   we're only likely to have one digital gold.
[02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:55.500]   And I think the Bitcoin Cash Fork
[02:00:55.500 --> 02:00:57.220]   proves that out empirically.
[02:00:57.220 --> 02:00:59.560]   It's a good case study because--
[02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:00.860]   - Well, it's one case study, right?
[02:01:00.860 --> 02:01:02.980]   But okay, so that's really well put.
[02:01:02.980 --> 02:01:04.600]   So, like gold was sticky.
[02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:08.460]   Once it was accepted, the network effects,
[02:01:08.460 --> 02:01:11.000]   the winner-take-all took over.
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:15.340]   And here's a fundamentally different kind of like,
[02:01:15.340 --> 02:01:18.660]   analog versus digital is a leap in technologies.
[02:01:18.660 --> 02:01:19.860]   - That's right.
[02:01:19.860 --> 02:01:23.000]   - And you're suggesting that there may not be,
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:29.060]   there's unlikely to be other leaps of that kind
[02:01:29.060 --> 02:01:32.220]   into a whole nother kind of space of technologies.
[02:01:32.220 --> 02:01:34.660]   - I would argue that Bitcoin,
[02:01:34.660 --> 02:01:38.000]   it's kind of like the ideological synthesis of gold,
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:39.340]   taking the monetary properties of gold
[02:01:39.340 --> 02:01:41.860]   and combining them with the internet itself.
[02:01:41.860 --> 02:01:43.220]   And in doing so,
[02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:47.140]   it has essentially perfected the properties of money.
[02:01:47.140 --> 02:01:49.700]   You can't get more divisible, durable, recognizable,
[02:01:49.700 --> 02:01:51.780]   portable, or scarce than Bitcoin.
[02:01:51.780 --> 02:01:54.260]   So, Satoshi has kind of,
[02:01:54.260 --> 02:01:58.360]   he left no design space for a superior technology
[02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:01.320]   to intercede and out-compete Bitcoin at this point,
[02:02:01.320 --> 02:02:02.700]   now that it's established a liquidity
[02:02:02.700 --> 02:02:04.740]   in the network effects. - Far superior technology.
[02:02:04.740 --> 02:02:07.340]   - Yeah, but it's a combination of the tech itself
[02:02:07.340 --> 02:02:09.300]   and the social layer. - And the social layer.
[02:02:09.300 --> 02:02:10.140]   That is coalesced to it.
[02:02:10.140 --> 02:02:11.740]   - You can't separate those two out.
[02:02:11.740 --> 02:02:13.100]   - That's right. - They're all connected
[02:02:13.100 --> 02:02:15.020]   and then the political as well.
[02:02:15.020 --> 02:02:17.460]   I mean, but the portability, for example,
[02:02:17.460 --> 02:02:20.060]   that's another way to phrase that is the,
[02:02:20.060 --> 02:02:20.900]   what is it?
[02:02:20.900 --> 02:02:21.980]   The scaling.
[02:02:21.980 --> 02:02:24.400]   So, the number of transactions,
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:27.080]   that's a limitation for Bitcoin
[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:30.900]   that many argues a feature, many argues a bug.
[02:02:30.900 --> 02:02:33.500]   You have a bunch of cryptocurrency technologies
[02:02:33.500 --> 02:02:37.020]   that are able to achieve much higher,
[02:02:37.020 --> 02:02:40.420]   much faster frequency of transactions,
[02:02:40.420 --> 02:02:43.440]   much more transactions, all that kind of stuff.
[02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:46.400]   What are your thoughts on that?
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:51.740]   The low level of transactions that's possible with Bitcoin.
[02:02:51.740 --> 02:02:52.860]   Do you think that's a feature?
[02:02:52.860 --> 02:02:54.480]   Do you think that's a bug?
[02:02:54.480 --> 02:02:56.860]   - Necessary for security, actually.
[02:02:56.860 --> 02:02:59.000]   And even these other crypto assets
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:00.280]   that settle more quickly,
[02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:03.660]   they settle with less assurance of finality.
[02:03:03.660 --> 02:03:06.100]   So, Nick Carter has a great piece on this, actually,
[02:03:06.100 --> 02:03:09.260]   called "The Settlement Assurance is Stupid."
[02:03:09.260 --> 02:03:11.540]   It's really good, where the gist of it is
[02:03:11.540 --> 02:03:14.680]   that there is more work being done
[02:03:14.680 --> 02:03:16.780]   in each block of Bitcoin
[02:03:16.780 --> 02:03:20.700]   that it is less vulnerable to reversion.
[02:03:20.700 --> 02:03:23.900]   So, it's giving you higher degrees of assurance
[02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:25.460]   that your settlement or your trade
[02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:27.380]   has occurred with finality,
[02:03:27.380 --> 02:03:30.140]   whereas other blockchains are much more vulnerable.
[02:03:30.140 --> 02:03:32.820]   And again, with Bitcoin,
[02:03:34.220 --> 02:03:36.740]   the evolutionary path of money with gold
[02:03:36.740 --> 02:03:40.600]   is that it was first used as a collectible.
[02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:43.140]   It then became used as a store of value.
[02:03:43.140 --> 02:03:44.820]   After it had stored enough value,
[02:03:44.820 --> 02:03:48.760]   it began to be used as a medium of exchange.
[02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:50.260]   And then finally, when it was used widely enough
[02:03:50.260 --> 02:03:52.580]   as a medium of exchange, it becomes a unit of account.
[02:03:52.580 --> 02:03:54.940]   We actually start to think in the money.
[02:03:54.940 --> 02:03:57.720]   Bitcoin's following a similar path.
[02:03:57.720 --> 02:04:00.420]   So, it started out as kind of a collectible.
[02:04:00.420 --> 02:04:02.260]   Today, I would argue it's a store of value,
[02:04:02.260 --> 02:04:04.060]   one of the most effective store of value
[02:04:04.060 --> 02:04:05.620]   we've ever seen.
[02:04:05.620 --> 02:04:08.580]   So, that evolutionary path that Bitcoin's following
[02:04:08.580 --> 02:04:10.260]   is similar to gold.
[02:04:10.260 --> 02:04:12.260]   First a collectible, today a store of value.
[02:04:12.260 --> 02:04:13.940]   To be an effective store of value,
[02:04:13.940 --> 02:04:18.540]   it has to optimize for supply cap.
[02:04:18.540 --> 02:04:19.900]   That has to be the first,
[02:04:19.900 --> 02:04:22.300]   and this is all Bitcoin really needs to do
[02:04:22.300 --> 02:04:23.780]   to be successful, by the way.
[02:04:23.780 --> 02:04:25.860]   Exactly what it's been doing for 12 years,
[02:04:25.860 --> 02:04:27.420]   virtually flawlessly,
[02:04:27.420 --> 02:04:30.340]   which is keep creating a block every 10 minutes
[02:04:30.340 --> 02:04:33.120]   and keep enforcing a supply cap of 21 million.
[02:04:34.020 --> 02:04:35.860]   As long as those two things hold,
[02:04:35.860 --> 02:04:40.620]   it is sound money, the ultimate sound money,
[02:04:40.620 --> 02:04:44.620]   the most inflation-resistant money there's ever been.
[02:04:44.620 --> 02:04:47.800]   It's actually completely immune.
[02:04:47.800 --> 02:04:50.340]   It's taken unexpected inflation to 0%.
[02:04:50.340 --> 02:04:51.620]   We know with perfect certainty
[02:04:51.620 --> 02:04:53.420]   what Bitcoin's supply will ever be.
[02:04:53.420 --> 02:04:59.580]   For it to be used more broadly as a medium of exchange,
[02:04:59.580 --> 02:05:01.980]   it can't make trade-offs at the base layer
[02:05:03.380 --> 02:05:05.340]   to increase its portability, for instance.
[02:05:05.340 --> 02:05:07.980]   Even though portability's maybe kind of a misnomer,
[02:05:07.980 --> 02:05:10.620]   'cause Bitcoin has extremely high portability,
[02:05:10.620 --> 02:05:13.500]   just doesn't have extremely high transaction throughput.
[02:05:13.500 --> 02:05:16.700]   So, we could say you can move it pretty quickly
[02:05:16.700 --> 02:05:17.520]   anywhere in the world,
[02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:20.980]   as long as you're willing to bid up for the block space,
[02:05:20.980 --> 02:05:24.960]   but you can't satisfy all the world's economic volume.
[02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:27.100]   You can't do 300 million transactions per second
[02:05:27.100 --> 02:05:29.560]   like you can on a centralized database like Visa.
[02:05:30.740 --> 02:05:34.780]   But Bitcoin needs to be this,
[02:05:34.780 --> 02:05:36.420]   it has to be a store value first
[02:05:36.420 --> 02:05:38.780]   before it can be a medium of exchange.
[02:05:38.780 --> 02:05:42.660]   So, it has to protect the supply cap first
[02:05:42.660 --> 02:05:44.380]   before making any trade-offs for that.
[02:05:44.380 --> 02:05:48.380]   And I would argue that that's why Bitcoin is so rigid,
[02:05:48.380 --> 02:05:50.180]   is that it's optimized for survivability
[02:05:50.180 --> 02:05:51.780]   and optimized for that supply cap,
[02:05:51.780 --> 02:05:56.140]   and it's pushing experimentation and other features
[02:05:56.140 --> 02:05:57.820]   that would increase its transaction throughput
[02:05:57.820 --> 02:05:59.460]   to higher layers.
[02:05:59.460 --> 02:06:01.460]   So, I think Lightning Network
[02:06:01.460 --> 02:06:03.500]   is something that's very interesting.
[02:06:03.500 --> 02:06:07.620]   It's still early, but there's a lot of throughput
[02:06:07.620 --> 02:06:10.580]   already being used on the Lightning Network.
[02:06:10.580 --> 02:06:14.300]   And it makes some slight trade-offs
[02:06:14.300 --> 02:06:16.100]   in terms of the trust minimization of Bitcoin.
[02:06:16.100 --> 02:06:18.220]   You end up trusting these smart contracts
[02:06:18.220 --> 02:06:19.540]   instead to move the Bitcoin,
[02:06:19.540 --> 02:06:22.980]   but you pick up nearly unlimited transaction throughput.
[02:06:22.980 --> 02:06:25.660]   So, that's how, and that's how biology evolves,
[02:06:25.660 --> 02:06:26.820]   that's how the internet evolved.
[02:06:26.820 --> 02:06:27.900]   It evolves in layers.
[02:06:27.900 --> 02:06:31.020]   So, I think Bitcoin, you can sort of conceive of it
[02:06:31.020 --> 02:06:33.820]   as the latest layer to the internet,
[02:06:33.820 --> 02:06:36.860]   and it's one that preserves this store value property
[02:06:36.860 --> 02:06:38.900]   better than any asset we've ever had.
[02:06:38.900 --> 02:06:41.820]   - Let me ask sort of a critical question of,
[02:06:41.820 --> 02:06:46.060]   if you're wrong about your statements about Bitcoin,
[02:06:46.060 --> 02:06:51.860]   you find out years from now that you were wrong,
[02:06:51.860 --> 02:06:53.140]   what would that look like?
[02:06:53.140 --> 02:06:57.500]   What would be the things that make you realize you were wrong?
[02:06:57.500 --> 02:07:01.300]   Likely ideas or crazy out there ideas?
[02:07:01.300 --> 02:07:03.180]   Do you think about this kind of stuff?
[02:07:03.180 --> 02:07:04.020]   - All the time.
[02:07:04.020 --> 02:07:08.460]   - 'Cause you speak very confidently about Bitcoin.
[02:07:08.460 --> 02:07:11.580]   And one of the things, let me put it this way.
[02:07:11.580 --> 02:07:16.580]   I think certainty, I feel like that's like a stoic statement
[02:07:16.580 --> 02:07:19.780]   certainty leads to ruin or something like that.
[02:07:19.780 --> 02:07:24.780]   Like certainty, I think is an antithesis to progress often.
[02:07:26.620 --> 02:07:28.220]   And especially in your writing,
[02:07:28.220 --> 02:07:29.900]   but this is true for the Bitcoin community.
[02:07:29.900 --> 02:07:34.900]   There's a certainty about the Bitcoin.
[02:07:34.900 --> 02:07:36.820]   And that makes me very skeptical,
[02:07:36.820 --> 02:07:38.820]   no matter how good the ideas are.
[02:07:38.820 --> 02:07:42.180]   Whenever things are good, this might be the Russian in me.
[02:07:42.180 --> 02:07:45.860]   I think like, what are the ways this is gonna go wrong?
[02:07:45.860 --> 02:07:48.780]   So, what do you think are the ways this might go wrong
[02:07:48.780 --> 02:07:53.020]   or you're wrong in your conception of what Bitcoin is?
[02:07:53.020 --> 02:07:58.020]   - Yeah, so science evolves via negativa,
[02:07:58.020 --> 02:08:04.220]   meaning that we're not proving hypotheses.
[02:08:04.220 --> 02:08:06.940]   And that's what becomes the body of science.
[02:08:06.940 --> 02:08:09.740]   Science is whatever is left over
[02:08:09.740 --> 02:08:12.540]   as we disprove hypotheses, right?
[02:08:12.540 --> 02:08:17.340]   Whatever we can empirically through experimentation,
[02:08:17.340 --> 02:08:21.040]   disprove gets discarded and whatever remains,
[02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.300]   whatever theory remains that hasn't been disproven
[02:08:24.300 --> 02:08:26.640]   is science effectively.
[02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:33.060]   This process is similar to market actors
[02:08:33.060 --> 02:08:35.180]   zeroing in on a store value, right?
[02:08:35.180 --> 02:08:37.740]   They're experimenting with different forms
[02:08:37.740 --> 02:08:41.180]   of storing wealth across time.
[02:08:41.180 --> 02:08:42.540]   Some do better than others,
[02:08:42.540 --> 02:08:45.540]   and eventually everyone ends up on the one that is best.
[02:08:45.540 --> 02:08:46.780]   That's what gold was.
[02:08:46.780 --> 02:08:51.260]   In terms of understanding Bitcoin,
[02:08:51.260 --> 02:08:53.440]   I look at it as a similar approach.
[02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:55.680]   And that is the main question I'm asking myself
[02:08:55.680 --> 02:08:57.580]   is how do you stop this thing?
[02:08:57.580 --> 02:08:59.240]   How do you turn it off?
[02:08:59.240 --> 02:09:00.300]   How do you end it?
[02:09:00.300 --> 02:09:02.240]   If you're a nation state particularly
[02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:05.200]   who has the most to lose in this transition,
[02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:08.520]   what is the attack vector by which they neutralize Bitcoin?
[02:09:08.520 --> 02:09:12.140]   I mean, that is the $250 trillion question.
[02:09:12.140 --> 02:09:15.680]   And I've spent five years
[02:09:15.680 --> 02:09:17.320]   thinking about this thing very deeply.
[02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:19.400]   I've read everything on monetary history
[02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:20.760]   I can get my hands on.
[02:09:20.760 --> 02:09:27.840]   The general thought of how it is stopped,
[02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:31.320]   and this is the snag point that a lot of people get to
[02:09:31.320 --> 02:09:32.800]   in their explorations down the rabbit hole
[02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:35.160]   is they just say the government will never allow it.
[02:09:35.160 --> 02:09:36.560]   And that becomes kind of their bottom.
[02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:37.760]   It's like, all right, Bitcoin's interesting,
[02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:39.120]   it's superior money, blah, blah, blah,
[02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:40.720]   but the government will never allow it.
[02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:43.280]   - Was Ray Dalio, did he say that?
[02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:45.760]   - Dalio is currently stuck there, yeah.
[02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:50.760]   - So Ray Dalio said that Bitcoin seems to be too promising.
[02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:55.840]   If it is in fact as promising as it looks,
[02:09:55.840 --> 02:09:58.220]   governments are going to,
[02:09:58.220 --> 02:10:00.840]   I don't forget what the exact quote is,
[02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:03.600]   but not allow it, ban it.
[02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:05.280]   Governments will ban it.
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:09.920]   So how do you get Ray Dalio unstuck from your perspective?
[02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:10.760]   - Well-
[02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:12.720]   - And how do you get unstuck from that idea
[02:10:12.720 --> 02:10:14.840]   that governments, will governments,
[02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:18.440]   how do you prevent governments from stopping a thing
[02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:21.280]   that threatens centralized power?
[02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:24.500]   - Well, Bitcoin is an idea.
[02:10:24.500 --> 02:10:30.280]   So governments that are really good
[02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:35.080]   at fighting centralized threats to their power, right,
[02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:36.680]   whether that's a currency counterfeiter
[02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:40.400]   or a competing nation state or business they don't like
[02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:42.520]   or an individual they don't like,
[02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:44.960]   you know, they can kill them, they can throw them in jail,
[02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:46.760]   they can use any number of coercive
[02:10:46.760 --> 02:10:49.320]   or violent tactics to suppress it.
[02:10:49.320 --> 02:10:52.600]   But how do you point a gun at an idea?
[02:10:52.600 --> 02:10:56.560]   How do you, how do you coerce an idea?
[02:10:56.560 --> 02:11:03.400]   And that's, you know, there's some anecdotal history here
[02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:08.400]   where there's the PGP case, which in the United States,
[02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:12.320]   the court was trying to classify it as munitions
[02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:15.720]   when we were shipping this pretty good privacy software
[02:11:15.720 --> 02:11:19.440]   overseas, government wanted to classify it as munitions
[02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:21.140]   and restrict that exportation.
[02:11:21.140 --> 02:11:25.360]   But, and this was a circuit court case precedent,
[02:11:25.360 --> 02:11:30.000]   when the PGP attorneys actually printed out the source code
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:33.560]   on paper and presented it as evidence in the court,
[02:11:33.560 --> 02:11:36.400]   all of a sudden it became protected under freedom of speech
[02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:40.360]   and that it's just code is speech, code is language
[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:43.120]   and therefore at least in the United States,
[02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:45.120]   it's protected under the first amendment.
[02:11:45.120 --> 02:11:52.800]   I think a government ban would be largely unenforceable,
[02:11:52.800 --> 02:11:56.960]   frankly on Bitcoin, being that it's pure information.
[02:11:56.960 --> 02:12:00.480]   If you suppress market actors
[02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:02.200]   from using it in one jurisdiction,
[02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:05.880]   you're just creating incentives for them to go elsewhere.
[02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:07.480]   And you're actually increasing the incentive
[02:12:07.480 --> 02:12:11.320]   for other jurisdictions to be favorable towards it
[02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:12.880]   because then they can create,
[02:12:12.880 --> 02:12:14.440]   they get to benefit from the tax revenue
[02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:16.400]   and the businesses and the innovation
[02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:19.360]   that's occurring in and around Bitcoin as a result.
[02:12:19.360 --> 02:12:21.880]   - So you don't think if a particular central bank,
[02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:25.920]   like in Europe or United States bans it,
[02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:30.440]   not maybe using those terms, but in some kind of way,
[02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:32.760]   you think that provides a really strong incentive
[02:12:32.760 --> 02:12:36.320]   for the other big players to enable it?
[02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:37.160]   - That's right.
[02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:40.600]   And that they're more likely, by the way, since,
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:42.520]   and governments know this, by the way, too.
[02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:46.160]   The other thing that causes a government
[02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:48.320]   to shoot itself in the foot is that if they ban something,
[02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:50.520]   they draw a lot of attention to it.
[02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:51.520]   People are smart.
[02:12:51.520 --> 02:12:53.920]   I mean, people ask why, why would a government ban it?
[02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:55.220]   Why can't I use this?
[02:12:55.220 --> 02:12:57.640]   So that's kind of typically be the last arrow
[02:12:57.640 --> 02:12:58.480]   in their quiver.
[02:12:58.480 --> 02:13:02.280]   They may try to ban it if Bitcoin
[02:13:02.280 --> 02:13:04.080]   really starts to monetize very quickly
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:06.640]   and the power structures that they impose today
[02:13:06.640 --> 02:13:11.640]   start to dissolve faster than others might think they will,
[02:13:11.640 --> 02:13:13.440]   then they might try and ban it.
[02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:16.640]   But I think that ban will be largely unenforceable.
[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:19.480]   They're more likely to tax it,
[02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:21.480]   which they already do tax it.
[02:13:21.480 --> 02:13:23.600]   They're likely to increase taxation of it.
[02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:28.520]   They're likely to try and make it more white market
[02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:32.400]   by actually tracing Bitcoin, seeing who has it,
[02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:35.040]   attaching identities to Bitcoin ownership,
[02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:38.280]   and making sure that they're getting their pound of flesh
[02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:41.600]   on all the transactions it results in.
[02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:45.760]   But I don't think, the other thing about this is,
[02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:50.460]   so we saw the internet out-compete intranets,
[02:13:50.460 --> 02:13:55.160]   in that we'd say that open source networks
[02:13:55.160 --> 02:13:57.080]   tend to out-compete closed source networks.
[02:13:57.080 --> 02:13:59.280]   And there's a really good reason for this.
[02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:02.240]   And it's because in a closed source network,
[02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:05.880]   there are costs associated with defending
[02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:06.920]   the network itself.
[02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:12.120]   So you have to, the network owners,
[02:14:12.120 --> 02:14:13.400]   the owners of the closed source network
[02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:17.520]   have to expend resources protecting it from competitors,
[02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:20.960]   and they have to expend resources imposing its rules,
[02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:23.160]   because people, they're not voluntarily adopted rules,
[02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:25.320]   so you actually have to impose these rule sets.
[02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:26.800]   Whereas an open source network,
[02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:28.840]   which is something much more akin to capitalism,
[02:14:28.840 --> 02:14:32.960]   in its pure sense, these are voluntarily adopted rules.
[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:34.840]   So all market participants have agreed
[02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:36.680]   and consented to this rule set.
[02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:38.360]   So there's no enforcement cost,
[02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:39.600]   and there's no turf protection,
[02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:42.960]   'cause anyone can freely enter or exit the open network.
[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:46.320]   For that energetic reason, I think open networks
[02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:50.520]   out-compete closed networks, typically.
[02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:53.600]   And in the digital age, that's why I think,
[02:14:53.600 --> 02:14:55.200]   that's why internet out-competes intranet,
[02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:57.240]   and that's why open source networks
[02:14:57.240 --> 02:14:58.840]   are gonna eat closed source networks.
[02:14:58.840 --> 02:15:01.200]   So what Bitcoin would be in that lens
[02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:04.240]   is the ultimate open source monetary network,
[02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:08.480]   devouring closed source central bank monetary networks.
[02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:12.000]   And I just don't see how,
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:16.200]   there's no possibility of unilaterally stopping Bitcoin
[02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:17.560]   or destroying it.
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:21.480]   So then they're more likely to regulate or tax it.
[02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:25.800]   And again, the other fallacy here is that a lot of people
[02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:27.640]   tend to think of governments as these singular,
[02:15:27.640 --> 02:15:32.640]   indivisible entities that just move under one plan,
[02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:35.000]   but in reality, it's a lot of people, right?
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:36.920]   A lot of people with loosely coupled interests
[02:15:36.920 --> 02:15:38.160]   and agendas and whatnot.
[02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:43.120]   Regulators and others,
[02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:45.680]   when they're wearing their citizen hat,
[02:15:45.680 --> 02:15:47.360]   they're gonna see this thing monetizing.
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:48.680]   They're gonna be on the front lines
[02:15:48.680 --> 02:15:52.160]   of trying to regulate it, trying to control it.
[02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:53.520]   And I think what's likely to happen
[02:15:53.520 --> 02:15:55.640]   is they're gonna start to adopt it
[02:15:55.640 --> 02:15:59.520]   to buy some of it even as an individual
[02:15:59.520 --> 02:16:02.080]   or possibly even ultimately at a central bank
[02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:03.800]   or sovereign wealth fund level
[02:16:03.800 --> 02:16:06.080]   as an insurance policy against its success.
[02:16:06.080 --> 02:16:09.680]   And once you start to acquire something
[02:16:09.680 --> 02:16:12.800]   and then you have a vested economic interest
[02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:16.440]   in its monetization, I think it kind of dissolves
[02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:18.720]   any of the power structures that are arrayed against it
[02:16:18.720 --> 02:16:20.560]   from the inside.
[02:16:20.560 --> 02:16:22.760]   So I've written a lot about this
[02:16:22.760 --> 02:16:24.520]   in a new series called "Sovereignism,"
[02:16:24.520 --> 02:16:26.680]   which is based loosely on a book
[02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:28.800]   called "The Sovereign Individual."
[02:16:28.800 --> 02:16:30.280]   And that's the general thesis
[02:16:30.280 --> 02:16:33.000]   is that microprocessing technology
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.840]   would devour our organizational models,
[02:16:35.840 --> 02:16:38.320]   the most important of which is the nation state.
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:40.000]   So I think we're going into this world
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:44.460]   where coercion and violence is just much less rewarding.
[02:16:44.460 --> 02:16:50.440]   You can't, the economics of violence are declining
[02:16:50.440 --> 02:16:54.480]   because of the low cost of protecting property, right?
[02:16:54.480 --> 02:16:59.480]   You can now protect your monetary property in Bitcoin
[02:16:59.480 --> 02:17:02.040]   at orders of magnitude less costs
[02:17:02.040 --> 02:17:04.280]   than is necessary to run a banking network.
[02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:09.280]   So it changes the way we organize ourselves.
[02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:12.520]   And again, if we, zooming back to gold
[02:17:12.520 --> 02:17:15.000]   as kind of the original governor to governments,
[02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:16.480]   where if they manipulated the money,
[02:17:16.480 --> 02:17:18.320]   gold would leave their country.
[02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:23.320]   That's why governments have taken relatively concerted action
[02:17:23.440 --> 02:17:25.600]   to go off of the gold standard.
[02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:28.960]   There's a great book on this called "The Gold Wars"
[02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:32.880]   that outlines how governments have been waging a cold war
[02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:34.880]   against gold for the past 50 years.
[02:17:34.880 --> 02:17:39.280]   Bitcoin sort of renews hope
[02:17:39.280 --> 02:17:41.640]   for that free market governor of governments.
[02:17:41.640 --> 02:17:42.880]   And that is this digital gold
[02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:45.560]   that governments cannot stop or co-opt.
[02:17:45.560 --> 02:17:47.720]   So I think it's something,
[02:17:47.720 --> 02:17:49.520]   that's why I think it's such a big deal
[02:17:49.520 --> 02:17:54.480]   is that it is changing.
[02:17:54.480 --> 02:17:56.800]   It's a new useful fiction, you might say.
[02:17:56.800 --> 02:17:58.560]   A useful fiction that's superordinate
[02:17:58.560 --> 02:18:02.240]   to the mythology of the nation state and government
[02:18:02.240 --> 02:18:04.240]   as the dominant institution in the world.
[02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:05.400]   - Well, I hope you're right
[02:18:05.400 --> 02:18:08.920]   that all forms of centralized power
[02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:12.640]   start breaking apart naturally.
[02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:14.960]   So governments, the more and more power
[02:18:14.960 --> 02:18:16.520]   is given to the individual,
[02:18:16.520 --> 02:18:18.400]   whatever the technology is.
[02:18:18.400 --> 02:18:20.720]   And Bitcoin seems to be a promising technology
[02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:22.880]   that empowers that, enables that.
[02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:24.720]   That seems to be the trend.
[02:18:24.720 --> 02:18:26.160]   And that's a promising trend,
[02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:29.120]   at least from a perspective of somebody
[02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:33.400]   who values this particular biological meat bag
[02:18:33.400 --> 02:18:34.760]   that's full of consciousness.
[02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:37.680]   - I think Bitcoin is exposing the greatest scam
[02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:40.720]   in human history, which is political authority.
[02:18:40.720 --> 02:18:43.880]   Like who gives anyone the right to be politically,
[02:18:43.880 --> 02:18:46.080]   have political authority over anyone else?
[02:18:46.080 --> 02:18:49.040]   People should be free to adopt the rules
[02:18:49.040 --> 02:18:52.040]   and systems and tools that best suit their needs.
[02:18:52.040 --> 02:18:56.160]   And that arc of history we covered earlier,
[02:18:56.160 --> 02:19:01.160]   where as socioeconomic systems have become more favorable
[02:19:01.160 --> 02:19:03.400]   towards individual sovereignty,
[02:19:03.400 --> 02:19:06.080]   the more wealthy we have become,
[02:19:06.080 --> 02:19:07.840]   the more we have given the individual,
[02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:10.480]   we've maximized individual choice,
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:12.400]   the more wealth that society has created,
[02:19:12.400 --> 02:19:14.400]   and the more it has out-competed
[02:19:14.400 --> 02:19:15.800]   the systems that have come before it.
[02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:19.320]   The latest would be capitalism triumphing over socialism.
[02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:23.880]   - Before maybe we eat, you are in Texas,
[02:19:23.880 --> 02:19:25.680]   you brought over some brisket.
[02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:27.960]   Before we maybe indulge in that,
[02:19:27.960 --> 02:19:29.960]   let me bring up one quick topic,
[02:19:29.960 --> 02:19:31.680]   and then we'll take a break.
[02:19:31.680 --> 02:19:35.720]   And the topic of what some may term
[02:19:35.720 --> 02:19:37.720]   the toxicity of the Bitcoin community.
[02:19:37.720 --> 02:19:43.160]   That you've written that Bitcoin toxicity is tough love.
[02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:46.600]   Do you wanna break that apart a little bit,
[02:19:46.600 --> 02:19:51.600]   sort of the idea, the philosophy of the toxicity
[02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:57.280]   that seems to be present in part in the Bitcoin community?
[02:19:57.280 --> 02:20:01.360]   - Yeah, we were talking about this a little bit
[02:20:01.360 --> 02:20:04.800]   before we recorded, and I've been through the gauntlet
[02:20:04.800 --> 02:20:06.680]   with Bitcoin toxicity as well.
[02:20:06.680 --> 02:20:12.560]   I came into this space professionally in 2017.
[02:20:12.920 --> 02:20:15.040]   I was originally running a multi-strategy
[02:20:15.040 --> 02:20:17.200]   crypto asset hedge fund.
[02:20:17.200 --> 02:20:22.200]   And my initial investment thesis on the world was that,
[02:20:22.200 --> 02:20:24.360]   Bitcoin was a big deal, but there were all these other
[02:20:24.360 --> 02:20:26.960]   exciting coins and projects and ways the technology
[02:20:26.960 --> 02:20:28.920]   was going to be used.
[02:20:28.920 --> 02:20:33.920]   And that view of reality met this immune,
[02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:38.000]   I guess you could say as an ideological immune system,
[02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.960]   this Bitcoin toxicity, and that it's kind of a filter
[02:20:40.960 --> 02:20:45.960]   that's trying to catch bad or useless or even scamming ideas
[02:20:45.960 --> 02:20:51.120]   that this space is very well known for.
[02:20:51.120 --> 02:20:55.200]   As we've touched on today, Bitcoin, in my opinion,
[02:20:55.200 --> 02:20:57.960]   is this world shattering innovation,
[02:20:57.960 --> 02:21:01.560]   but it's in a sea of the most scammy stuff ever.
[02:21:01.560 --> 02:21:04.400]   People, anybody can go and create a coin.
[02:21:04.400 --> 02:21:08.480]   So you can go and launch one immediately online,
[02:21:09.520 --> 02:21:12.920]   and you can throw up a website, an advisor page,
[02:21:12.920 --> 02:21:15.400]   post a white paper talking about how great
[02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:17.240]   your technology is going to be and how it's going to change
[02:21:17.240 --> 02:21:20.280]   the world, and you can raise $30 million in Bitcoin
[02:21:20.280 --> 02:21:22.720]   or Ethereum in 30 seconds kind of thing.
[02:21:22.720 --> 02:21:26.280]   So it's drawn in a lot of this scam artistry,
[02:21:26.280 --> 02:21:27.560]   you might say.
[02:21:27.560 --> 02:21:31.240]   And I think people living through that,
[02:21:31.240 --> 02:21:33.560]   because there is this natural predilection for people,
[02:21:33.560 --> 02:21:35.960]   when they first come into Bitcoin, you're excited about it,
[02:21:35.960 --> 02:21:39.480]   then you get lost in the shit coin universe.
[02:21:39.480 --> 02:21:43.960]   And then just looking at the market success of Bitcoin
[02:21:43.960 --> 02:21:47.080]   versus, and when I use the word shit coin, I'm just--
[02:21:47.080 --> 02:21:49.080]   - You say with all the love in the world.
[02:21:49.080 --> 02:21:50.680]   - All the love in the world.
[02:21:50.680 --> 02:21:53.220]   I guess you could call me a toxic maximalist in some ways,
[02:21:53.220 --> 02:21:55.440]   although I consider myself a freedom maximalist,
[02:21:55.440 --> 02:21:56.280]   not a Bitcoin maximalist.
[02:21:56.280 --> 02:21:57.280]   - Yeah, I saw that line.
[02:21:57.280 --> 02:21:59.760]   That's a good line.
[02:21:59.760 --> 02:22:03.160]   - Bitcoin, tracking the market success of Bitcoin
[02:22:03.160 --> 02:22:05.320]   versus alternative crypto assets,
[02:22:05.320 --> 02:22:07.920]   the signal is very clear that Bitcoin
[02:22:07.920 --> 02:22:09.520]   has out-competed all of them.
[02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:13.160]   So I think that Bitcoin cultural toxicity has evolved
[02:22:13.160 --> 02:22:15.680]   as an immune response to those bad ideas,
[02:22:15.680 --> 02:22:17.840]   which is actually, if you think about it,
[02:22:17.840 --> 02:22:19.160]   kind of is a tough love, right?
[02:22:19.160 --> 02:22:21.700]   You don't want new entrants to the space
[02:22:21.700 --> 02:22:26.180]   to get lost in shit coin jungle and learn the hard way,
[02:22:26.180 --> 02:22:28.080]   the way many Bitcoin maximalists have,
[02:22:28.080 --> 02:22:31.360]   that the real innovation is Bitcoin.
[02:22:31.360 --> 02:22:36.360]   But like an immune system, I think it can also go too far.
[02:22:36.520 --> 02:22:40.880]   And so I think it's useful when it is defending the space
[02:22:40.880 --> 02:22:43.480]   from false narratives, we might say,
[02:22:43.480 --> 02:22:48.200]   but it becomes detrimental when it's attacking people
[02:22:48.200 --> 02:22:50.120]   that are inquiring about Bitcoin
[02:22:50.120 --> 02:22:52.280]   or people that are approaching Bitcoin
[02:22:52.280 --> 02:22:57.280]   with a good spirit and good intention and a desire to learn.
[02:22:57.280 --> 02:22:58.400]   Because then at that point,
[02:22:58.400 --> 02:23:01.760]   it's actually impeding the free flow of ideas,
[02:23:01.760 --> 02:23:04.640]   which the example in your clip
[02:23:04.640 --> 02:23:06.480]   was totally taken out of context.
[02:23:06.480 --> 02:23:07.880]   And then you're literally just saying,
[02:23:07.880 --> 02:23:09.200]   "I'm here to learn and contribute.
[02:23:09.200 --> 02:23:10.800]   I think I've got some stuff to do."
[02:23:10.800 --> 02:23:11.880]   And then people attack that.
[02:23:11.880 --> 02:23:13.920]   Like that doesn't make any fucking sense.
[02:23:13.920 --> 02:23:16.160]   It's like you're attacking someone who's approaching it
[02:23:16.160 --> 02:23:18.400]   in a good spirit and asking questions.
[02:23:18.400 --> 02:23:21.500]   - Yeah, and I think sometimes talking about it,
[02:23:21.500 --> 02:23:26.480]   the toxicity in the Bitcoin community as an immune response
[02:23:26.480 --> 02:23:29.620]   has a negative effect of giving it a pass.
[02:23:29.620 --> 02:23:32.600]   Because like, it almost says,
[02:23:32.600 --> 02:23:36.000]   "Look, it equates it with the human immune system,
[02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.680]   which seems to do a really good job."
[02:23:38.680 --> 02:23:42.560]   And so you could say that the toxicity has a lot of features
[02:23:42.560 --> 02:23:47.560]   in the sea of fraudulent projects
[02:23:47.560 --> 02:23:52.240]   that steal money from people.
[02:23:52.240 --> 02:23:53.920]   It's really useful to make sure
[02:23:53.920 --> 02:23:56.480]   that you give people the harsh truth
[02:23:56.480 --> 02:23:58.600]   about who is and isn't a scammer.
[02:24:00.080 --> 02:24:03.640]   You have to take it away from that metaphor
[02:24:03.640 --> 02:24:06.680]   of the immune system and look at basic human nature.
[02:24:06.680 --> 02:24:09.200]   And human nature can go to some dark places,
[02:24:09.200 --> 02:24:14.120]   which is, it's sad to say that some people,
[02:24:14.120 --> 02:24:20.240]   maybe many of us can enjoy for its own sake, the toxicity,
[02:24:20.240 --> 02:24:23.320]   the mockery, the derision.
[02:24:23.320 --> 02:24:27.980]   And you stop being part of the immune system
[02:24:27.980 --> 02:24:31.040]   that makes a successful idea propagate
[02:24:31.040 --> 02:24:35.160]   and start being a sort of a destructive virus yourself.
[02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:37.720]   And that's something I think about
[02:24:37.720 --> 02:24:42.720]   'cause I am new to this particular immune system,
[02:24:42.720 --> 02:24:46.000]   but I've explored other immune systems.
[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:51.000]   And I think you understand this world much better than me,
[02:24:54.800 --> 02:24:57.780]   but I tend to prefer sort of love
[02:24:57.780 --> 02:25:00.340]   as a mechanism for spreading ideas,
[02:25:00.340 --> 02:25:06.200]   to err on the side of love and kindness,
[02:25:06.200 --> 02:25:09.260]   and almost like an open-mindedness
[02:25:09.260 --> 02:25:13.160]   in a way where you're constantly lowering yourself
[02:25:13.160 --> 02:25:16.840]   in the face of other ideas, constantly questioning yourself.
[02:25:16.840 --> 02:25:22.780]   But I think I understand that that might be more applicable
[02:25:24.140 --> 02:25:26.540]   in certain contexts, like maybe in the space of science
[02:25:26.540 --> 02:25:28.040]   or something like that.
[02:25:28.040 --> 02:25:31.240]   But in the space of Bitcoin as it currently stands,
[02:25:31.240 --> 02:25:33.960]   there's so many people that are trying to scam others
[02:25:33.960 --> 02:25:37.520]   out of their money that the kind of harshness required
[02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:39.060]   is different.
[02:25:39.060 --> 02:25:44.060]   Nevertheless, I do want to put it on people like yourself
[02:25:44.060 --> 02:25:48.120]   and others who I know you wouldn't consider yourself this,
[02:25:48.120 --> 02:25:51.400]   but you're one of the faces or leaders in this space
[02:25:51.400 --> 02:25:53.640]   to call people out a little bit,
[02:25:53.640 --> 02:25:57.180]   to inspire them to be more loving, I suppose.
[02:25:57.180 --> 02:25:58.860]   But it's difficult 'cause you want to walk
[02:25:58.860 --> 02:26:00.200]   that line carefully.
[02:26:00.200 --> 02:26:03.200]   You don't want to be too loving and open-minded.
[02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:04.520]   Otherwise, your brain falls out.
[02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:05.360]   I get it.
[02:26:05.360 --> 02:26:06.960]   It's a difficult balance to walk.
[02:26:06.960 --> 02:26:09.600]   - It is subtle and it's nuanced,
[02:26:09.600 --> 02:26:11.100]   and it is difficult to walk.
[02:26:11.100 --> 02:26:14.200]   And I think that, that's why I try to say tough love
[02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:19.160]   because when we're young, we may have certain ideas
[02:26:19.160 --> 02:26:21.640]   about the way we want our life to go,
[02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:24.520]   but then maybe our parents are not letting us
[02:26:24.520 --> 02:26:26.400]   do certain things and we think they're,
[02:26:26.400 --> 02:26:27.960]   I know when I was a kid, I wanted to get my,
[02:26:27.960 --> 02:26:30.220]   when I was in fifth grade, I wanted to get my ear pierced.
[02:26:30.220 --> 02:26:31.600]   My mom wouldn't let me do it.
[02:26:31.600 --> 02:26:33.560]   And I was, oh, come on, Mom.
[02:26:33.560 --> 02:26:34.480]   I thought it was so cool.
[02:26:34.480 --> 02:26:36.680]   And then two years later, I'm like, thank you, Mom,
[02:26:36.680 --> 02:26:39.480]   for not letting me get my ear pierced.
[02:26:39.480 --> 02:26:41.680]   I think it comes from a place of good intention
[02:26:41.680 --> 02:26:43.400]   that they are actually,
[02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:46.800]   they have asked themselves that question, right?
[02:26:46.800 --> 02:26:51.160]   That they've been inquiring in why not this crypto asset
[02:26:51.160 --> 02:26:53.400]   or this crypto asset, and they've done the exploration.
[02:26:53.400 --> 02:26:54.960]   They keep coming back to Bitcoin
[02:26:54.960 --> 02:26:57.860]   and they've seen people being taken advantage of.
[02:26:57.860 --> 02:27:03.920]   But to your point, it's like it can,
[02:27:03.920 --> 02:27:06.800]   this tough love can become detrimental,
[02:27:06.800 --> 02:27:09.040]   just like the immune system can become detrimental, right?
[02:27:09.040 --> 02:27:12.480]   It can overreact and it can actually harm the human body.
[02:27:12.480 --> 02:27:16.280]   So I would say that it's such a tricky and nuanced topic
[02:27:16.280 --> 02:27:18.200]   that even biology hasn't figured it out, right?
[02:27:18.200 --> 02:27:20.240]   A lot of people have autoimmune diseases.
[02:27:20.960 --> 02:27:24.720]   And then there's the other thing that we have this natural,
[02:27:24.720 --> 02:27:25.840]   I agree with you about love.
[02:27:25.840 --> 02:27:28.720]   I think love is like the deepest value.
[02:27:28.720 --> 02:27:30.560]   That's a whole nother philosophical thing,
[02:27:30.560 --> 02:27:35.560]   but we're biologically programmed to pay more attention
[02:27:35.560 --> 02:27:38.880]   to things that are adversarial or harmful, right?
[02:27:38.880 --> 02:27:42.360]   That's part of us protecting the meat suit, so to speak.
[02:27:42.360 --> 02:27:47.360]   So there is some maybe better delivery method
[02:27:48.080 --> 02:27:51.000]   by being a little bit toxic to really get the point across,
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.640]   like, hey, don't get lost over here.
[02:27:53.640 --> 02:27:55.640]   These things can hurt you.
[02:27:55.640 --> 02:27:57.200]   Really try to focus on Bitcoin,
[02:27:57.200 --> 02:27:59.680]   but the toxicity of that message,
[02:27:59.680 --> 02:28:01.160]   I guess it increases its ability
[02:28:01.160 --> 02:28:04.200]   to penetrate the individual, but it can also go too far.
[02:28:04.200 --> 02:28:05.040]   So it is-
[02:28:05.040 --> 02:28:06.600]   - It's interesting, but I,
[02:28:06.600 --> 02:28:08.840]   almost to push back a little bit,
[02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:11.160]   toxicity is a funny word.
[02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:15.160]   I think maybe another way to say it is,
[02:28:15.160 --> 02:28:17.720]   I brought up like Christopher Hitchens
[02:28:17.720 --> 02:28:21.040]   and somebody who like, okay,
[02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:23.720]   you might say is toxic or something like that.
[02:28:23.720 --> 02:28:27.160]   'Cause he's basically a intellectual powerhouse
[02:28:27.160 --> 02:28:28.800]   who's also a troll.
[02:28:28.800 --> 02:28:31.240]   So he's constantly, it's like guerrilla warfare
[02:28:31.240 --> 02:28:33.400]   in the space of ideas.
[02:28:33.400 --> 02:28:37.080]   He's very harsh in his disagreements and criticisms,
[02:28:37.080 --> 02:28:42.080]   but it's done with incredible grace and skill and poetry.
[02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:43.280]   So-
[02:28:43.280 --> 02:28:44.480]   - We could use more of that.
[02:28:44.480 --> 02:28:45.840]   - We could use more of that.
[02:28:45.840 --> 02:28:49.000]   So toxicity just like,
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:53.600]   these are just words.
[02:28:53.600 --> 02:28:55.240]   They can mean a lot of different things,
[02:28:55.240 --> 02:28:59.100]   but disagreement doesn't have to be done with love,
[02:28:59.100 --> 02:29:04.400]   but it should be done with skill if it's to be effective.
[02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:08.400]   So there's a lot of ways to be effective in guerrilla warfare
[02:29:08.400 --> 02:29:10.200]   but you want to learn how to shoot
[02:29:10.200 --> 02:29:12.880]   or whatever the weapon you're using and to do it well.
[02:29:12.880 --> 02:29:14.560]   Some people do it better than others
[02:29:14.560 --> 02:29:17.800]   and it's worthwhile to learn to do it well.
[02:29:17.800 --> 02:29:20.140]   Again, I prefer love, but even love,
[02:29:20.140 --> 02:29:25.400]   just because you think you're communicating a good idea
[02:29:25.400 --> 02:29:26.760]   which you very well may be,
[02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:28.840]   doesn't mean it also doesn't require skill
[02:29:28.840 --> 02:29:30.280]   to do the communication well.
[02:29:30.280 --> 02:29:33.200]   Whether it's disagreement and harsh
[02:29:33.200 --> 02:29:36.880]   or more agreement and loving and so on.
[02:29:36.880 --> 02:29:39.840]   - Yeah, I think very fundamentally
[02:29:39.840 --> 02:29:42.160]   that all of our decisions,
[02:29:42.160 --> 02:29:44.520]   we alluded to earlier that every decision
[02:29:44.520 --> 02:29:47.120]   is an expression of value, every action we take.
[02:29:47.120 --> 02:29:49.400]   They ultimately come from fear or love.
[02:29:49.400 --> 02:29:53.680]   Fear would be something much more in the biological domain
[02:29:53.680 --> 02:29:56.840]   where it's like we're trying to protect ego,
[02:29:56.840 --> 02:29:58.440]   we're trying to behave selfishly.
[02:29:58.440 --> 02:30:00.100]   This is the domain of sin.
[02:30:00.100 --> 02:30:03.400]   I don't know all the sins, gluttony, greed, sloth,
[02:30:03.400 --> 02:30:05.340]   wrath, lust, pride, envy.
[02:30:05.340 --> 02:30:07.680]   These are all selfish behaviors.
[02:30:07.680 --> 02:30:09.600]   Whereas something like love,
[02:30:10.920 --> 02:30:14.480]   it's morally superior in that it's more selfless.
[02:30:14.480 --> 02:30:16.360]   I don't know that we can properly define love
[02:30:16.360 --> 02:30:19.720]   with words at all, but I would say maybe like selfless action
[02:30:19.720 --> 02:30:22.680]   could be kind of a generalization of it.
[02:30:22.680 --> 02:30:25.640]   And that way, it is really hard, to your point,
[02:30:25.640 --> 02:30:30.640]   it's hard to love in a world that has a lot of conflict
[02:30:30.640 --> 02:30:34.520]   that might make you fearful
[02:30:34.520 --> 02:30:36.100]   if you're really focused on your meat suit.
[02:30:36.100 --> 02:30:37.800]   But if you're focused on the bigger picture
[02:30:37.800 --> 02:30:40.960]   and you're focused on others and legacy and life,
[02:30:40.960 --> 02:30:43.080]   that there is a way to do it.
[02:30:43.080 --> 02:30:44.880]   And that's why I actually think Christ,
[02:30:44.880 --> 02:30:46.640]   that is the highest moral aim.
[02:30:46.640 --> 02:30:50.080]   He met all of the vitriol in life,
[02:30:50.080 --> 02:30:53.840]   betrayal, hate, violence, he met it all with love
[02:30:53.840 --> 02:30:55.760]   and he met it with compassion.
[02:30:55.760 --> 02:30:58.280]   And that's why, regardless of if you believe
[02:30:58.280 --> 02:31:00.880]   that he actually lived or any of this,
[02:31:00.880 --> 02:31:05.880]   he is symbolic of the highest moral consciousness possible.
[02:31:07.560 --> 02:31:12.560]   And Carl Jung would say that that was a suitable alternative
[02:31:12.560 --> 02:31:16.840]   to psychoanalysis, was actually setting your moral aim higher
[02:31:16.840 --> 02:31:19.040]   and striving towards it diligently.
[02:31:19.040 --> 02:31:22.280]   So, I mean, I agree completely,
[02:31:22.280 --> 02:31:24.840]   we need more of that in the Bitcoin space.
[02:31:24.840 --> 02:31:26.240]   We need more of that in the world, frankly.
[02:31:26.240 --> 02:31:27.280]   - In the world, yeah.
[02:31:27.280 --> 02:31:30.860]   - And these things, they're all intertwined.
[02:31:30.860 --> 02:31:34.200]   We touched on the beginning, all of us get to decide,
[02:31:34.200 --> 02:31:35.840]   but the world does influence,
[02:31:35.840 --> 02:31:37.940]   kind of if we adopt fear or love,
[02:31:37.940 --> 02:31:42.040]   but it takes, I don't know, it takes good systems
[02:31:42.040 --> 02:31:45.360]   and it takes, I guess, good leaders to set an example.
[02:31:45.360 --> 02:31:48.800]   - Yeah, I do believe that there's like individual people
[02:31:48.800 --> 02:31:50.560]   can have a ripple effect.
[02:31:50.560 --> 02:31:53.440]   So that's what I try to do, sort of embody the,
[02:31:53.440 --> 02:31:57.480]   I'm just one ant, but one of the things I have faith in
[02:31:57.480 --> 02:32:02.300]   is I'm trying to do that more.
[02:32:03.320 --> 02:32:04.680]   I know this is a podcast,
[02:32:04.680 --> 02:32:07.940]   but I'm trying to do less talking and more doing.
[02:32:07.940 --> 02:32:13.320]   I've been disappointed in myself, if I'm being honest,
[02:32:13.320 --> 02:32:15.000]   how much talking I've been doing,
[02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:20.160]   as opposed to like in my own private life,
[02:32:20.160 --> 02:32:22.120]   I live the thing I talk about,
[02:32:22.120 --> 02:32:24.660]   but I also haven't created much.
[02:32:24.660 --> 02:32:29.800]   And I believe in the power of individuals
[02:32:29.800 --> 02:32:32.480]   that create stuff, like create an idea.
[02:32:32.480 --> 02:32:34.640]   Through those individuals that try to create something new,
[02:32:34.640 --> 02:32:35.680]   the world progresses.
[02:32:35.680 --> 02:32:37.100]   And hopefully there's more and more,
[02:32:37.100 --> 02:32:39.280]   more and more of those people.
[02:32:39.280 --> 02:32:41.560]   So you mentioned kind of people who,
[02:32:41.560 --> 02:32:45.020]   what the Bitcoin community might call scammers.
[02:32:45.020 --> 02:32:50.440]   I have a lot of passions in my life
[02:32:50.440 --> 02:32:52.700]   that I focus a lot of my attention to.
[02:32:52.700 --> 02:32:58.800]   You know, Bitcoin doesn't happen to be yet one of them,
[02:32:58.800 --> 02:33:01.480]   Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, you know.
[02:33:01.480 --> 02:33:02.720]   - I'm glad you said yeah.
[02:33:02.720 --> 02:33:06.520]   - I'm always looking for things
[02:33:06.520 --> 02:33:08.480]   to really fall in love with.
[02:33:08.480 --> 02:33:12.840]   So how is a person like me supposed to figure out,
[02:33:12.840 --> 02:33:16.280]   I also happen to have a platform a little bit,
[02:33:16.280 --> 02:33:18.440]   and how am I supposed to figure out
[02:33:18.440 --> 02:33:21.440]   who is an interesting,
[02:33:21.440 --> 02:33:25.040]   what is an interesting set of ideas and what are not?
[02:33:25.040 --> 02:33:27.000]   Because people are financially tied
[02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.880]   into a lot of the cryptocurrencies that we're talking about,
[02:33:29.880 --> 02:33:32.000]   certainly with Bitcoin.
[02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:33.720]   You know, their livelihood,
[02:33:33.720 --> 02:33:35.320]   their wellbeing is tied up to it.
[02:33:35.320 --> 02:33:37.920]   So it becomes much more emotional, much more personal.
[02:33:37.920 --> 02:33:41.480]   It's no longer purely an exploration of ideas.
[02:33:41.480 --> 02:33:44.040]   It's really almost like a threat on your property.
[02:33:44.040 --> 02:33:45.920]   Like it's a personal threat
[02:33:45.920 --> 02:33:47.920]   and it makes it very difficult to explore those ideas.
[02:33:47.920 --> 02:33:49.280]   So I understand that,
[02:33:49.280 --> 02:33:51.900]   but it makes it very difficult for somebody like me
[02:33:51.900 --> 02:33:55.560]   to just walk in and be curious.
[02:33:55.560 --> 02:33:59.680]   So how do I proceed in this difficult world
[02:33:59.680 --> 02:34:01.160]   in exploring this landscape
[02:34:01.160 --> 02:34:07.240]   and not give a platform to ideas that may harm others?
[02:34:07.240 --> 02:34:12.840]   - I guess first I'd like to commend
[02:34:12.840 --> 02:34:15.480]   your forthrightness about this,
[02:34:15.480 --> 02:34:17.320]   because I don't think many people
[02:34:17.320 --> 02:34:19.160]   try to walk that line necessarily.
[02:34:19.160 --> 02:34:22.680]   People, again, kind of the territorial imperative,
[02:34:22.680 --> 02:34:25.920]   they'll put whoever on, they'll help expand their reach.
[02:34:25.920 --> 02:34:27.640]   - Oh yeah, that's true.
[02:34:27.640 --> 02:34:29.680]   - Or say whatever needs to be said to expand their reach.
[02:34:29.680 --> 02:34:32.580]   So I think you're coming from a good place, I'll say that.
[02:34:32.580 --> 02:34:35.320]   There's a great piece written
[02:34:35.320 --> 02:34:38.680]   on the topic of scammers and scamming.
[02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:40.240]   I think it was by Goldstein.
[02:34:40.240 --> 02:34:42.580]   He wrote a piece called "Everyone's a Scammer."
[02:34:42.580 --> 02:34:44.940]   And it's sort of back to this, you know,
[02:34:44.940 --> 02:34:46.280]   general human proclivity
[02:34:46.280 --> 02:34:48.680]   to try and get something for nothing always.
[02:34:48.680 --> 02:34:51.040]   Which again, it can be positive,
[02:34:51.040 --> 02:34:53.080]   it can be innovative, or it can be negative.
[02:34:53.080 --> 02:34:55.040]   You can be trying to steal from people.
[02:34:55.840 --> 02:35:00.080]   That might be, I think that's a useful piece,
[02:35:00.080 --> 02:35:03.440]   just to kind of see the crypto world through that lens.
[02:35:03.440 --> 02:35:06.280]   And that's how Bitcoiners are thinking all the time.
[02:35:06.280 --> 02:35:09.120]   They are by nature adversarial thinkers.
[02:35:09.120 --> 02:35:12.000]   So they're trying to minimize the need for trust
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.800]   in any situation and maximize verification.
[02:35:14.800 --> 02:35:21.360]   As far as sifting through the ideas,
[02:35:21.360 --> 02:35:26.280]   I guess this is back where the cultural immune system
[02:35:26.280 --> 02:35:28.360]   has some utility.
[02:35:28.360 --> 02:35:30.600]   Because there were times when I thought
[02:35:30.600 --> 02:35:33.000]   this particular crypto asset,
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:34.920]   you know, Augur was one I was really into,
[02:35:34.920 --> 02:35:37.280]   that it could facilitate prediction markets,
[02:35:37.280 --> 02:35:39.360]   and prediction markets could make,
[02:35:39.360 --> 02:35:41.700]   you know, markets more efficient, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:35:41.700 --> 02:35:45.040]   But when that investment thesis
[02:35:45.040 --> 02:35:49.600]   basically met the cultural filter or immune system,
[02:35:49.600 --> 02:35:51.760]   it forced me to reevaluate my position,
[02:35:51.760 --> 02:35:54.280]   forced me to really look into it more deeply.
[02:35:54.280 --> 02:35:55.960]   And through that exploration,
[02:35:55.960 --> 02:35:58.520]   I realized that it would need to be built on Bitcoin
[02:35:58.520 --> 02:36:00.000]   to work, basically.
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:03.580]   So, but it really comes down to like you doing your homework,
[02:36:03.580 --> 02:36:07.560]   but we can't all deeply evaluate every idea out there, right?
[02:36:07.560 --> 02:36:09.800]   - Yeah, one of the things I struggle with,
[02:36:09.800 --> 02:36:13.800]   with Alex Jones, for example, I had dinner with him.
[02:36:13.800 --> 02:36:19.120]   I could tell that would be a very fun conversation,
[02:36:19.120 --> 02:36:22.920]   but like, then I also understand that there's
[02:36:22.920 --> 02:36:27.880]   like consequences to that conversation
[02:36:27.880 --> 02:36:30.760]   that should be explored with care.
[02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:34.120]   And so you need to take on the responsibility
[02:36:34.120 --> 02:36:35.840]   of being a chef or the puffer fish
[02:36:35.840 --> 02:36:37.600]   and all those kinds of things.
[02:36:37.600 --> 02:36:39.600]   That said, just like you said,
[02:36:39.600 --> 02:36:42.220]   it's very difficult to know this ahead of time.
[02:36:42.220 --> 02:36:46.700]   And I will probably make mistakes.
[02:36:46.700 --> 02:36:49.920]   And that's a shitty thing to have to live with,
[02:36:49.920 --> 02:36:52.960]   that I'm going to make mistakes and some of them very large.
[02:36:52.960 --> 02:36:57.600]   Like, yeah, I mean, I can imagine a bunch of different ways,
[02:36:57.600 --> 02:36:59.120]   but all we can do in this world
[02:36:59.120 --> 02:37:02.320]   is once we make the mistakes, we acknowledge those mistakes.
[02:37:02.320 --> 02:37:04.120]   - Yes, learn.
[02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:05.040]   - And learn.
[02:37:05.040 --> 02:37:09.800]   And also, I have to put this on the rest of us,
[02:37:09.800 --> 02:37:14.800]   that you don't take one thing that a person did
[02:37:15.280 --> 02:37:17.900]   and then burn them at the stake for it.
[02:37:17.900 --> 02:37:20.660]   That you realize that we all make mistakes,
[02:37:20.660 --> 02:37:23.260]   that a particular mistake does not make the person.
[02:37:23.260 --> 02:37:27.700]   And this applies to taking stuff out of context
[02:37:27.700 --> 02:37:30.700]   over hundreds of hours of talking,
[02:37:30.700 --> 02:37:35.700]   but it applies to actual, like in context, big mistake.
[02:37:35.700 --> 02:37:39.300]   So what if I murdered somebody at some point?
[02:37:39.300 --> 02:37:40.140]   Just give me a break.
[02:37:40.140 --> 02:37:42.380]   No, there are some things that are too far, of course,
[02:37:42.380 --> 02:37:47.140]   but in general, we need to give each other a chance.
[02:37:47.140 --> 02:37:51.980]   Yeah, but I'm still, I walk with a heavy heart
[02:37:51.980 --> 02:37:54.180]   knowing that I'll probably make a mistake,
[02:37:54.180 --> 02:37:56.540]   especially one that I didn't mean to.
[02:37:56.540 --> 02:37:58.340]   That's the one that worries me most.
[02:37:58.340 --> 02:37:59.980]   - Well, this is human nature.
[02:37:59.980 --> 02:38:03.940]   Like, hamartia, to miss the mark.
[02:38:03.940 --> 02:38:05.460]   That's the root word of sin.
[02:38:05.460 --> 02:38:07.300]   Like, we are sinful by nature.
[02:38:07.300 --> 02:38:08.300]   We can't help it.
[02:38:08.300 --> 02:38:11.020]   There's no way, again, pain is information, right?
[02:38:11.020 --> 02:38:13.780]   There's no way to learn other than trying,
[02:38:13.780 --> 02:38:18.420]   failing, learning, and then you put yourself
[02:38:18.420 --> 02:38:21.560]   in better formation, right, in formation
[02:38:21.560 --> 02:38:22.900]   to better deal with it next time.
[02:38:22.900 --> 02:38:27.800]   So I hope, I don't get the sense that you're actually
[02:38:27.800 --> 02:38:30.420]   afraid of making a misstep.
[02:38:30.420 --> 02:38:35.060]   Like, I think you're just maybe disappointed
[02:38:35.060 --> 02:38:35.900]   is a better word.
[02:38:35.900 --> 02:38:36.940]   Like, you know you're gonna make the mistakes.
[02:38:36.940 --> 02:38:39.340]   - Yeah, that's exactly, that's a much, much better word.
[02:38:39.340 --> 02:38:40.820]   - But we have to embrace that.
[02:38:40.820 --> 02:38:41.660]   - Yeah.
[02:38:41.660 --> 02:38:42.480]   - That's the only way anything,
[02:38:42.480 --> 02:38:43.900]   it's the only way we can advance.
[02:38:43.900 --> 02:38:46.700]   As we're dealing with an incomprehensible reality,
[02:38:46.700 --> 02:38:48.500]   all we can do is throw spaghetti at the wall
[02:38:48.500 --> 02:38:49.780]   and see what sticks.
[02:38:49.780 --> 02:38:50.620]   - Yeah.
[02:38:50.620 --> 02:38:52.820]   - And in that process, we're all inherently gonna
[02:38:52.820 --> 02:38:54.140]   hurt ourselves and hurt others,
[02:38:54.140 --> 02:38:57.780]   and that's where love and forgiveness come into play, right?
[02:38:57.780 --> 02:39:01.900]   And yeah, I think the other thing is that
[02:39:01.900 --> 02:39:05.420]   this culture of reducing people down to a label, right?
[02:39:05.420 --> 02:39:07.820]   Whether it's racism or whether you're calling them a scammer
[02:39:07.820 --> 02:39:11.100]   or any number of terms,
[02:39:11.100 --> 02:39:14.820]   you're discounting their sovereignty to zero, right?
[02:39:14.820 --> 02:39:19.020]   You're taking a super complex human that is vast,
[02:39:19.020 --> 02:39:21.940]   contains multitudes, is changing over time,
[02:39:21.940 --> 02:39:24.540]   and you're trying to put them in a bucket of a word.
[02:39:24.540 --> 02:39:28.740]   And that is just, I think, a cognitive fallacy.
[02:39:28.740 --> 02:39:30.580]   Like, it's not only gonna hurt the person
[02:39:30.580 --> 02:39:33.020]   that you're winnowing down to a word,
[02:39:33.020 --> 02:39:34.420]   it's also gonna hurt you.
[02:39:35.180 --> 02:39:38.860]   In your attempt to decomplexify reality
[02:39:38.860 --> 02:39:40.260]   by assigning this person to a term,
[02:39:40.260 --> 02:39:42.900]   you're actually gonna create bad outcomes for yourself
[02:39:42.900 --> 02:39:45.220]   because you're not gonna understand that person.
[02:39:45.220 --> 02:39:46.900]   - I do also think there's a failure
[02:39:46.900 --> 02:39:49.580]   of our social media technology
[02:39:49.580 --> 02:39:53.140]   that incentivizes that kind of reduction to a label.
[02:39:53.140 --> 02:39:56.820]   It's just the viral nature of that reduction.
[02:39:56.820 --> 02:39:59.420]   So it's not only do we humans naturally do that,
[02:40:01.140 --> 02:40:05.100]   our social media platforms make that easier,
[02:40:05.100 --> 02:40:09.940]   more fun, more effective to do that at scale,
[02:40:09.940 --> 02:40:11.340]   the mass hysteria.
[02:40:11.340 --> 02:40:15.580]   So I think there's actually technological ways
[02:40:15.580 --> 02:40:18.180]   of adding friction to that.
[02:40:18.180 --> 02:40:20.260]   - Yeah, I wonder, I mean, I agree with you
[02:40:20.260 --> 02:40:22.820]   that social media is an amplifier
[02:40:22.820 --> 02:40:27.180]   to this natural way of dealing with one another,
[02:40:27.180 --> 02:40:30.500]   but I wonder, and my thinking has evolved a lot on this,
[02:40:30.500 --> 02:40:32.420]   that there's something below
[02:40:32.420 --> 02:40:35.180]   the way we're treating each other too, right?
[02:40:35.180 --> 02:40:37.860]   We could say civilization sort of advances
[02:40:37.860 --> 02:40:40.140]   in the tools we make and the way we treat each other.
[02:40:40.140 --> 02:40:42.820]   We tend to have better tools, better quality of life,
[02:40:42.820 --> 02:40:46.300]   and better morality, better quality of living,
[02:40:46.300 --> 02:40:49.220]   and ways of dealing with one another.
[02:40:49.220 --> 02:40:53.620]   And I think that when you corrupt the money,
[02:40:53.620 --> 02:40:56.620]   that it really does push us the negative direction,
[02:40:56.620 --> 02:40:58.100]   pushes us away from,
[02:40:59.620 --> 02:41:04.620]   again, encouraging or magnifying scarcity artificially
[02:41:04.620 --> 02:41:07.500]   causes us to be more divisive.
[02:41:07.500 --> 02:41:08.700]   When things are more divisive,
[02:41:08.700 --> 02:41:11.660]   we tend to be less civilized, less nuanced,
[02:41:11.660 --> 02:41:14.540]   more black or white, or this or that,
[02:41:14.540 --> 02:41:17.980]   or you're this, or label A or label B.
[02:41:17.980 --> 02:41:20.620]   So I really think, and this is a harder one to unravel,
[02:41:20.620 --> 02:41:24.020]   but I think if we can fix the money, right,
[02:41:24.020 --> 02:41:26.900]   which again is the base layer operating system
[02:41:26.900 --> 02:41:29.220]   for human moral action in the world,
[02:41:29.220 --> 02:41:32.540]   that it has downstream effects.
[02:41:32.540 --> 02:41:34.420]   So we'd actually maybe start to treat each other
[02:41:34.420 --> 02:41:36.300]   a little better on social media,
[02:41:36.300 --> 02:41:41.300]   despite the fact that it enables this faster communication.
[02:41:41.300 --> 02:41:42.140]   - That's interesting.
[02:41:42.140 --> 02:41:46.520]   So perhaps fixing social media, as I've been thinking about,
[02:41:46.520 --> 02:41:49.580]   is treating the symptom, not the cause.
[02:41:49.580 --> 02:41:52.820]   - Yeah, that is the Bitcoin rabbit hole in a nutshell.
[02:41:52.820 --> 02:41:54.940]   Is it, you know, they say fix the money, fix the world.
[02:41:54.940 --> 02:41:58.740]   You keep tracing these different social malaises
[02:41:58.740 --> 02:42:03.580]   or technological difficulties, lack of innovation.
[02:42:03.580 --> 02:42:06.020]   You know, Weinstein's entire Portal podcast,
[02:42:06.020 --> 02:42:08.500]   "Something Went Wrong in the Early '70s."
[02:42:08.500 --> 02:42:11.180]   We went off the gold standard in 1971.
[02:42:11.180 --> 02:42:15.940]   And there's a great website, wtfhappened1971.com.
[02:42:15.940 --> 02:42:18.360]   Goes through this whole gamut of socioeconomic data
[02:42:18.360 --> 02:42:22.820]   that's completely gone askew since the early '70s.
[02:42:22.820 --> 02:42:24.500]   - Yeah, you had this whole video.
[02:42:24.500 --> 02:42:28.460]   What do you think about Eric Weinstein and Bitcoin
[02:42:28.460 --> 02:42:31.540]   and the gold standard?
[02:42:31.540 --> 02:42:35.540]   Does he, I actually haven't heard him talk about his thesis
[02:42:35.540 --> 02:42:38.100]   about the '70s in connection
[02:42:38.100 --> 02:42:42.020]   to the going off of the gold standard.
[02:42:42.020 --> 02:42:43.500]   Yeah, what are your thoughts there?
[02:42:43.500 --> 02:42:46.020]   What are your thoughts about his general relationship
[02:42:46.020 --> 02:42:49.700]   with the Bitcoin idea and the community?
[02:42:49.700 --> 02:42:52.860]   - Yeah, the first exposure I had to Eric was his,
[02:42:52.860 --> 02:42:55.380]   I think it was his first episode with Peter Thiel.
[02:42:55.380 --> 02:42:57.060]   And they're going through that thesis
[02:42:57.060 --> 02:43:00.900]   that there's been this general institutional rot
[02:43:00.900 --> 02:43:03.820]   and suppression of innovation since the early '70s.
[02:43:03.820 --> 02:43:05.940]   And he's trying to identify what it is.
[02:43:05.940 --> 02:43:08.060]   I don't think they ever pended on the money
[02:43:08.060 --> 02:43:11.220]   on going off the gold standard.
[02:43:11.220 --> 02:43:14.580]   But in recent interactions with Eric,
[02:43:14.580 --> 02:43:16.580]   I've interacted with him on Clubhouse.
[02:43:16.580 --> 02:43:19.900]   We recently released an episode of the show
[02:43:19.900 --> 02:43:22.020]   I did with Chris Espley.
[02:43:22.020 --> 02:43:24.260]   And it was titled "Dear Eric Weinstein."
[02:43:24.260 --> 02:43:26.780]   So we're going through his worldview
[02:43:26.780 --> 02:43:27.980]   that he's expressed in the portal
[02:43:27.980 --> 02:43:31.780]   and tying it back to the money in different ways.
[02:43:31.780 --> 02:43:33.300]   And he's engaged.
[02:43:33.300 --> 02:43:35.180]   Eric retweeted the show.
[02:43:35.180 --> 02:43:36.740]   We exchanged some messages.
[02:43:36.740 --> 02:43:38.340]   He's been very open-minded.
[02:43:38.340 --> 02:43:40.420]   He's asked some really good questions.
[02:43:40.420 --> 02:43:42.660]   So I get the sense that he's approaching this
[02:43:42.660 --> 02:43:45.940]   very wholeheartedly.
[02:43:45.940 --> 02:43:48.900]   He does bring with him his existing worldview
[02:43:48.900 --> 02:43:50.020]   and his existing theory.
[02:43:50.020 --> 02:43:52.140]   The one that really blew up was gauge theory.
[02:43:52.140 --> 02:43:53.300]   They got really popular.
[02:43:53.300 --> 02:43:54.820]   I don't know a lot about gauge theory.
[02:43:54.820 --> 02:43:56.580]   I actually messaged Eric and said,
[02:43:56.580 --> 02:43:58.100]   "I want to learn more," genuinely,
[02:43:58.100 --> 02:44:01.300]   because he seems to be serious
[02:44:01.300 --> 02:44:03.980]   that that needs to be considered in the sphere of money.
[02:44:03.980 --> 02:44:05.820]   And so I want to learn more about it.
[02:44:05.820 --> 02:44:08.220]   But I think overall, it's great.
[02:44:08.220 --> 02:44:10.860]   It's great to see an intellectual heavyweight
[02:44:10.860 --> 02:44:13.700]   of his caliber gravitating towards Bitcoin.
[02:44:13.700 --> 02:44:18.980]   Yeah, he has some gauge-theoretic conceptions
[02:44:18.980 --> 02:44:23.900]   about the world broadly, but also about economics,
[02:44:23.900 --> 02:44:27.140]   which ultimately boils down to just a set of mathematics,
[02:44:27.140 --> 02:44:30.740]   which allows you to more effectively reason about the world.
[02:44:30.740 --> 02:44:32.740]   And he has a certain set of views there.
[02:44:32.740 --> 02:44:37.140]   So it's fascinating to see him grapple with it.
[02:44:37.140 --> 02:44:38.740]   I think he's also kind of,
[02:44:38.740 --> 02:44:42.380]   actually kind of like all of us,
[02:44:42.380 --> 02:44:45.820]   grappling with the idea of what is Bitcoin in this world.
[02:44:45.820 --> 02:44:47.700]   It's a very young technology,
[02:44:47.700 --> 02:44:52.700]   and it's unclear exactly how the ideas of the past
[02:44:52.700 --> 02:44:57.460]   fit with it, integrate, how the two integrate together.
[02:44:57.460 --> 02:44:59.900]   And so it's interesting to explore,
[02:44:59.900 --> 02:45:01.420]   not just Bitcoin in particular.
[02:45:01.420 --> 02:45:06.420]   So for me, what I've always saw Bitcoin as
[02:45:06.420 --> 02:45:11.020]   from the beginning, from a narrow worldview,
[02:45:11.020 --> 02:45:14.460]   is computer science, which is where I come from.
[02:45:14.460 --> 02:45:18.500]   And so I wasn't almost aware in the social,
[02:45:18.500 --> 02:45:21.620]   political, financial aspects of Bitcoin.
[02:45:21.620 --> 02:45:26.420]   But now I see that there's not just power,
[02:45:26.420 --> 02:45:29.220]   but there's fascinating ideas to explore
[02:45:29.220 --> 02:45:30.200]   on that side of things.
[02:45:30.200 --> 02:45:31.500]   Not just the computer science,
[02:45:31.500 --> 02:45:33.800]   not just the technical details,
[02:45:33.800 --> 02:45:38.800]   but the political, the socioeconomic, the philosophical.
[02:45:38.800 --> 02:45:42.500]   - That's where I find all the fascination
[02:45:42.500 --> 02:45:43.620]   in the world, frankly.
[02:45:44.420 --> 02:45:47.940]   I would, one other thing about Weinstein,
[02:45:47.940 --> 02:45:50.340]   and intellectuals more generally
[02:45:50.340 --> 02:45:52.300]   that are skeptical of Bitcoin,
[02:45:52.300 --> 02:45:55.420]   I would challenge them to read the book, "Human Action,"
[02:45:55.420 --> 02:45:58.820]   written by Mises, I think in 1949,
[02:45:58.820 --> 02:46:00.480]   he published the English version.
[02:46:00.480 --> 02:46:04.820]   It's essentially the Bible of Austrian economics.
[02:46:04.820 --> 02:46:09.620]   And I think Austrian economics is a noticeable gap
[02:46:09.620 --> 02:46:13.780]   in most modern intellectuals' worldviews,
[02:46:13.780 --> 02:46:15.260]   that it's not taught in school.
[02:46:15.260 --> 02:46:17.540]   I mean, I have a master's degree in accounting and finance,
[02:46:17.540 --> 02:46:19.260]   studied a lot of economics in school.
[02:46:19.260 --> 02:46:21.340]   There's not one peep of Austrian econ.
[02:46:21.340 --> 02:46:26.340]   - The least, we love talking about all the degrees he has.
[02:46:26.340 --> 02:46:27.840]   - I was a CPA.
[02:46:27.840 --> 02:46:30.220]   (laughing)
[02:46:30.220 --> 02:46:35.220]   But it's, that curriculum that we get in college
[02:46:35.220 --> 02:46:38.660]   is noticeably deficient in Austrian economics.
[02:46:38.660 --> 02:46:40.100]   And I think there's a reason why, right?
[02:46:40.100 --> 02:46:43.280]   It's heavily government influenced.
[02:46:44.120 --> 02:46:46.640]   Again, master's degree in accounting,
[02:46:46.640 --> 02:46:48.680]   they never taught me about what money is
[02:46:48.680 --> 02:46:50.000]   or where money comes from.
[02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:53.840]   All you learn is that the central bank issues money
[02:46:53.840 --> 02:46:56.000]   and the central bank takes money away.
[02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.800]   So it's conceived of in the textbooks
[02:46:58.800 --> 02:47:00.560]   quite literally as God, right?
[02:47:00.560 --> 02:47:03.720]   An entity that suffers no opportunity costs,
[02:47:03.720 --> 02:47:06.800]   that basically is the foundation
[02:47:06.800 --> 02:47:09.080]   of the entire Keynesian worldview
[02:47:09.080 --> 02:47:10.920]   that you're taught in economics.
[02:47:10.920 --> 02:47:13.560]   And Austrian economics
[02:47:13.560 --> 02:47:16.040]   is the opposite end of the spectrum of that, right?
[02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:18.420]   It's actually the culmination,
[02:47:18.420 --> 02:47:20.760]   which economics is the youngest science in the world,
[02:47:20.760 --> 02:47:21.580]   by the way.
[02:47:21.580 --> 02:47:24.960]   So it is kind of the front,
[02:47:24.960 --> 02:47:27.000]   it's the frontiers of science in many ways,
[02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.480]   like to actually, when I say praxeology,
[02:47:29.480 --> 02:47:31.280]   many people have never even heard of that.
[02:47:31.280 --> 02:47:35.840]   But it's something, it's an a priori study
[02:47:35.840 --> 02:47:37.360]   equivalent to something like mathematics,
[02:47:37.360 --> 02:47:39.560]   that you're building things from first principles
[02:47:39.560 --> 02:47:42.400]   to reason about economic reality.
[02:47:42.400 --> 02:47:44.800]   And I think that book,
[02:47:44.800 --> 02:47:47.200]   it's a very difficult book written by Mises,
[02:47:47.200 --> 02:47:49.800]   1200 pages, translated from German.
[02:47:49.800 --> 02:47:52.840]   The way he wields English is fascinating and terrifying
[02:47:52.840 --> 02:47:53.960]   all at the same time.
[02:47:53.960 --> 02:47:56.540]   It'd probably take you six months to read it
[02:47:56.540 --> 02:47:58.080]   if you read it daily, seriously,
[02:47:58.080 --> 02:48:00.480]   like it's a beast of a book.
[02:48:00.480 --> 02:48:04.400]   But that will plug the gap, I think in most,
[02:48:04.400 --> 02:48:06.120]   any intellectual that's skeptical about Bitcoin,
[02:48:06.120 --> 02:48:07.360]   I think that will plug the gap
[02:48:07.360 --> 02:48:10.360]   that's necessary for you to see it in a new light.
[02:48:10.360 --> 02:48:12.600]   - Well, I'll take that as a challenge.
[02:48:12.600 --> 02:48:14.440]   Now that we took a little bit of a break,
[02:48:14.440 --> 02:48:15.880]   ate some good Texas brisket,
[02:48:15.880 --> 02:48:16.880]   thank you for that, by the way,
[02:48:16.880 --> 02:48:18.880]   - Oh yeah, quite welcome.
[02:48:18.880 --> 02:48:21.560]   - Let me ask the ridiculous question.
[02:48:21.560 --> 02:48:25.440]   At the core of the idea of Bitcoin is this guy
[02:48:25.440 --> 02:48:28.360]   or this entity named Satoshi Nakamoto.
[02:48:28.360 --> 02:48:32.240]   So the ridiculous question is, who is Satoshi Nakamoto?
[02:48:32.240 --> 02:48:33.760]   And first of all, is it you?
[02:48:33.760 --> 02:48:35.960]   - It's not me.
[02:48:36.960 --> 02:48:38.160]   - I wish.
[02:48:38.160 --> 02:48:41.760]   - And is this an interesting question?
[02:48:41.760 --> 02:48:43.440]   Or is it just something about our human nature
[02:48:43.440 --> 02:48:47.100]   that wants to, that always tends towards mystery?
[02:48:47.100 --> 02:48:50.560]   - Well, as we've touched on a bit today,
[02:48:50.560 --> 02:48:53.760]   you know, mythology, in my opinion,
[02:48:53.760 --> 02:48:57.320]   is something that is intrinsic to how we see the world
[02:48:57.320 --> 02:48:59.000]   in a lot of ways, like it's how,
[02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:00.760]   it's kind of the structure
[02:49:00.760 --> 02:49:04.380]   by which we build these useful fictions.
[02:49:05.440 --> 02:49:08.240]   And so in that way, you could just say that
[02:49:08.240 --> 02:49:11.800]   Satoshi is the Godhead of Bitcoin effectively.
[02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:15.520]   And I think a compelling argument could be made
[02:49:15.520 --> 02:49:18.000]   that his disappearance is what really solidifies
[02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.120]   Bitcoin's decentralization.
[02:49:20.120 --> 02:49:23.280]   Because if there were one individual
[02:49:23.280 --> 02:49:27.340]   to personally vilify or denigrate or attack,
[02:49:27.340 --> 02:49:32.180]   you know, to disparage or question the motives of,
[02:49:33.360 --> 02:49:37.800]   you know, if he's out on the Hollywood Hills partying,
[02:49:37.800 --> 02:49:40.520]   everyone knows he's got a million Bitcoin, you know,
[02:49:40.520 --> 02:49:43.520]   it would just kind of tarnish the entire project
[02:49:43.520 --> 02:49:44.360]   in a lot of way.
[02:49:44.360 --> 02:49:48.160]   But the fact that on that theme, something for nothing,
[02:49:48.160 --> 02:49:51.160]   this guy actually gave humanity something for nothing.
[02:49:51.160 --> 02:49:56.160]   And it appears that he didn't profit in any way,
[02:49:56.160 --> 02:49:58.240]   he, she, or they.
[02:49:58.240 --> 02:50:01.840]   Actually heard recently that he identified as a he
[02:50:01.840 --> 02:50:03.080]   in some of his communications.
[02:50:03.080 --> 02:50:04.700]   So it sounds like it is a he.
[02:50:04.700 --> 02:50:11.040]   - See, like his communications being like studied,
[02:50:11.040 --> 02:50:14.400]   like almost like exactly as if he is a religious,
[02:50:14.400 --> 02:50:15.520]   - That's right.
[02:50:15.520 --> 02:50:16.560]   - Like a prophet.
[02:50:16.560 --> 02:50:18.360]   - Yeah.
[02:50:18.360 --> 02:50:23.360]   - I mean, it's fascinating to imagine that he's still alive
[02:50:23.360 --> 02:50:27.200]   and living in this world.
[02:50:27.200 --> 02:50:29.120]   And it's even more fascinating to imagine
[02:50:29.120 --> 02:50:32.280]   that he's perhaps participating in the Bitcoin community.
[02:50:32.280 --> 02:50:36.800]   Because I mean, that's, that takes a special human being
[02:50:36.800 --> 02:50:41.440]   to out of principle do that, to do, to remain anonymous.
[02:50:41.440 --> 02:50:43.440]   That's very much the George Washington.
[02:50:43.440 --> 02:50:46.480]   Yeah, I always wonder like how many people are like that.
[02:50:46.480 --> 02:50:48.880]   There's a cliche that like absolute power corrupts
[02:50:48.880 --> 02:50:51.360]   absolutely like power corrupts,
[02:50:51.360 --> 02:50:54.560]   but it seems like the progress of humanity
[02:50:54.560 --> 02:50:57.900]   depends on the people whom power doesn't corrupt.
[02:50:58.060 --> 02:51:00.060]   - Hmm, interesting.
[02:51:00.060 --> 02:51:02.860]   - And it's enough to have just a small selection of those.
[02:51:02.860 --> 02:51:04.380]   - Yeah.
[02:51:04.380 --> 02:51:06.820]   - And even if most of us are too weak,
[02:51:06.820 --> 02:51:12.260]   we give into power if given the chance,
[02:51:12.260 --> 02:51:14.060]   all it takes is a few.
[02:51:14.060 --> 02:51:15.580]   - That's, I've never thought of it like that,
[02:51:15.580 --> 02:51:18.340]   but Marcus Aurelius immediately came to mind.
[02:51:18.340 --> 02:51:21.820]   You know, the guy that he had the keys to the kingdom
[02:51:21.820 --> 02:51:26.340]   and he apparently adhered to the stoic virtues
[02:51:26.340 --> 02:51:27.220]   until the end.
[02:51:28.180 --> 02:51:30.100]   But yeah, I agree with Satoshi.
[02:51:30.100 --> 02:51:33.340]   The other thing that's interesting is he would be
[02:51:33.340 --> 02:51:38.220]   by far the most wealthy person in the world
[02:51:38.220 --> 02:51:39.940]   on a liquid asset basis,
[02:51:39.940 --> 02:51:42.180]   because he has a million Bitcoin,
[02:51:42.180 --> 02:51:47.180]   which is 60 billion liquid net worth at current prices.
[02:51:47.180 --> 02:51:51.580]   So if he is still alive and just operating in the world,
[02:51:51.580 --> 02:51:56.580]   he is daily and moment to moment resisting massive incentives
[02:51:57.060 --> 02:52:01.140]   to go and just be the richest guy in the world.
[02:52:01.140 --> 02:52:02.700]   - He's the ultimate hodler.
[02:52:02.700 --> 02:52:03.540]   - Yeah.
[02:52:03.540 --> 02:52:04.980]   (laughing)
[02:52:04.980 --> 02:52:09.980]   - I mean, it's turning down not just financial success,
[02:52:09.980 --> 02:52:12.260]   but also fame.
[02:52:12.260 --> 02:52:15.260]   I mean, fame is another drug, it's kind of power,
[02:52:15.260 --> 02:52:17.300]   but it's in itself is also a drug,
[02:52:17.300 --> 02:52:20.500]   especially in this modern society, in this attention.
[02:52:20.500 --> 02:52:21.620]   - And he would have both.
[02:52:21.620 --> 02:52:22.880]   - He would have both.
[02:52:22.880 --> 02:52:25.740]   It's fun to imagine who it could be.
[02:52:25.740 --> 02:52:27.860]   It's fascinating if it's somebody like you
[02:52:27.860 --> 02:52:30.580]   or somebody like Elon or somebody like that.
[02:52:30.580 --> 02:52:31.900]   That's fascinating to think about.
[02:52:31.900 --> 02:52:34.100]   - I think Elon would be hilarious.
[02:52:34.100 --> 02:52:36.780]   He came out and he was Satoshi and be like,
[02:52:36.780 --> 02:52:38.860]   "Hey guys, I know I'm already the richest guy in the world,
[02:52:38.860 --> 02:52:41.540]   but I gotta go ahead and double my lead here."
[02:52:41.540 --> 02:52:46.420]   - What do you make of Elon Musk investing with Tesla,
[02:52:46.420 --> 02:52:50.380]   investing in Bitcoin and maybe broaden it out
[02:52:50.380 --> 02:52:55.380]   in some of these other big companies?
[02:52:55.620 --> 02:52:58.020]   Billionaires, but also people tied to major companies
[02:52:58.020 --> 02:52:59.940]   investing in Bitcoin.
[02:52:59.940 --> 02:53:02.460]   - Yeah, I think Michael Saylor
[02:53:02.460 --> 02:53:04.020]   really led the charge on that.
[02:53:04.020 --> 02:53:08.900]   He's the CEO of MicroStrategy that I think they've acquired
[02:53:08.900 --> 02:53:11.020]   upwards of $2 billion in Bitcoin now.
[02:53:11.020 --> 02:53:14.820]   Started acquiring August, maybe of 2020.
[02:53:14.820 --> 02:53:19.060]   And he's personally bought a lot of it.
[02:53:19.060 --> 02:53:22.540]   He bought a lot as a treasury reserve asset
[02:53:22.540 --> 02:53:24.180]   for his company, MicroStrategy.
[02:53:24.180 --> 02:53:28.300]   Then they leveraged up on a convertible note and bought more.
[02:53:28.300 --> 02:53:32.380]   So he's really gone, really leading the charge
[02:53:32.380 --> 02:53:35.980]   in this Bitcoin institutional adoption.
[02:53:35.980 --> 02:53:38.140]   - Your conversation with him is a really interesting one.
[02:53:38.140 --> 02:53:41.820]   Your series of, I mean, series of episodes, I suppose,
[02:53:41.820 --> 02:53:44.260]   but it's only a couple of conversations, I guess.
[02:53:44.260 --> 02:53:48.220]   - Yeah, we recorded twice, five and a half hours each.
[02:53:48.220 --> 02:53:49.780]   So it's about 11 hours of content.
[02:53:49.780 --> 02:53:50.820]   And yeah, thank you.
[02:53:51.580 --> 02:53:55.220]   A lot of people have said that it's the best
[02:53:55.220 --> 02:53:57.380]   first principle thing they've ever seen on Bitcoin,
[02:53:57.380 --> 02:53:59.380]   which I take no credit for that at all.
[02:53:59.380 --> 02:54:02.620]   I mean, I just sat down with a guy and unleashed him.
[02:54:02.620 --> 02:54:04.100]   He's just a beast.
[02:54:04.100 --> 02:54:07.500]   - Yeah, but it's fascinating that
[02:54:07.500 --> 02:54:11.380]   his long-term vision with it.
[02:54:11.380 --> 02:54:15.580]   I mean, I'm not sure I'm all philosophically bought in,
[02:54:15.580 --> 02:54:20.580]   but if he's right, if this set of ideas are as powerful
[02:54:20.980 --> 02:54:24.140]   as he describes, as you described,
[02:54:24.140 --> 02:54:26.700]   that this would change the world,
[02:54:26.700 --> 02:54:28.700]   which as you say, it's funny that a company
[02:54:28.700 --> 02:54:33.700]   like MicroStrategy might be the company
[02:54:33.700 --> 02:54:38.060]   that has the biggest macro effect
[02:54:38.060 --> 02:54:40.180]   on our economy, on our world.
[02:54:40.180 --> 02:54:44.420]   - Yeah, the conversation reshaped my worldview a lot too,
[02:54:44.420 --> 02:54:48.100]   because he framed money as energy,
[02:54:48.100 --> 02:54:50.940]   which I had often thought of money as time.
[02:54:50.940 --> 02:54:53.480]   And it explored those connections a lot in my writing,
[02:54:53.480 --> 02:54:55.080]   but looking at it as energy,
[02:54:55.080 --> 02:55:00.500]   and then his supposition that the purpose of life
[02:55:00.500 --> 02:55:03.120]   is to basically channel energy across space and time.
[02:55:03.120 --> 02:55:05.100]   So we're just trying to figure out how to channel
[02:55:05.100 --> 02:55:07.100]   more energy across space and time
[02:55:07.100 --> 02:55:08.860]   toward the satisfaction of aims.
[02:55:08.860 --> 02:55:12.660]   And his definition, or his answer to that question,
[02:55:12.660 --> 02:55:14.900]   what is money, is that money is the highest form
[02:55:14.900 --> 02:55:17.140]   of energy a human being can channel.
[02:55:17.140 --> 02:55:19.420]   So it's a claim to all other forms of energy
[02:55:19.420 --> 02:55:20.780]   we can manifest in the world.
[02:55:20.780 --> 02:55:24.900]   And that just completely reshaped how I see it,
[02:55:24.900 --> 02:55:26.280]   brought in this whole other side
[02:55:26.280 --> 02:55:30.780]   to my intellectual explorations of money.
[02:55:30.780 --> 02:55:32.180]   - Can you elaborate on that a little bit?
[02:55:32.180 --> 02:55:34.260]   So I understand money is time,
[02:55:34.260 --> 02:55:37.100]   which is in itself a really powerful idea,
[02:55:37.100 --> 02:55:39.740]   but money is energy, channeling energy.
[02:55:39.740 --> 02:55:40.660]   Can you break that apart?
[02:55:40.660 --> 02:55:43.100]   - Yeah, so I guess,
[02:55:43.100 --> 02:55:45.540]   definitely have to check out the whole series
[02:55:45.540 --> 02:55:46.980]   to really get his perspective,
[02:55:46.980 --> 02:55:49.440]   but I'll do my best to condense it.
[02:55:49.440 --> 02:55:54.980]   Life itself, all forms of life,
[02:55:54.980 --> 02:55:56.500]   they're dependent on energy.
[02:55:56.500 --> 02:55:58.100]   Energy fuels everything,
[02:55:58.100 --> 02:56:01.320]   fuels life and action and motion and all of that.
[02:56:01.320 --> 02:56:04.940]   And we could say that maybe like a plant
[02:56:04.940 --> 02:56:08.980]   is harnessing solar energy
[02:56:08.980 --> 02:56:11.820]   and then reallocating that into growth.
[02:56:11.820 --> 02:56:15.220]   So its aim is to grow towards the sun.
[02:56:15.220 --> 02:56:17.620]   So it's allocating energy towards its goal
[02:56:17.620 --> 02:56:20.900]   of harnessing more solar energy kind of thing.
[02:56:20.900 --> 02:56:27.220]   And humans too have evolved
[02:56:27.220 --> 02:56:30.580]   to figure out how to harness energy in different ways
[02:56:30.580 --> 02:56:35.180]   to satisfy higher and more complicated aims.
[02:56:35.180 --> 02:56:37.540]   So the original energy network
[02:56:37.540 --> 02:56:41.180]   that he referenced was fire.
[02:56:41.180 --> 02:56:44.060]   We actually learned to wield fire
[02:56:44.060 --> 02:56:45.660]   as a tool in and of itself.
[02:56:45.660 --> 02:56:48.100]   So not only are we learning to channel energy,
[02:56:48.100 --> 02:56:51.340]   but we're actually learning how to isolate energy
[02:56:51.340 --> 02:56:53.780]   as a tool in and of itself.
[02:56:53.780 --> 02:56:54.980]   And so we went into that,
[02:56:54.980 --> 02:56:59.660]   how harnessing fire had changed human beings.
[02:56:59.660 --> 02:57:03.940]   And actually, this is one of the earliest examples
[02:57:03.940 --> 02:57:07.620]   to have a co-evolution between tool and our biology,
[02:57:07.620 --> 02:57:11.500]   because when we developed fire, we developed cooking.
[02:57:11.500 --> 02:57:13.100]   And cooking is, you can kind of think of it
[02:57:13.100 --> 02:57:14.460]   as pre-digestion in a way.
[02:57:14.460 --> 02:57:16.220]   We're liberating these macronutrients,
[02:57:16.220 --> 02:57:18.340]   we're making things that otherwise
[02:57:18.340 --> 02:57:20.940]   would not be digestible, edible.
[02:57:20.940 --> 02:57:23.260]   And it increases the efficiency
[02:57:23.260 --> 02:57:26.120]   by which we extract nutrients from food.
[02:57:26.120 --> 02:57:27.460]   That's what cooking does.
[02:57:27.460 --> 02:57:29.820]   So when we figured out cooking,
[02:57:29.820 --> 02:57:33.580]   we liberated all these digestive resources
[02:57:33.580 --> 02:57:36.580]   that were reallocated towards higher cognitive development.
[02:57:36.580 --> 02:57:39.620]   So there's this evolutionary path
[02:57:39.620 --> 02:57:42.820]   between figuring out fire and us becoming smarter,
[02:57:42.820 --> 02:57:44.020]   which was interesting.
[02:57:44.020 --> 02:57:47.700]   Some other early examples he gave,
[02:57:47.700 --> 02:57:50.320]   he went into were missiles and hydraulics.
[02:57:50.320 --> 02:57:56.620]   So missiles being, we learned to hunt at a distance.
[02:57:56.620 --> 02:57:58.860]   We can't bring down a woolly mammoth,
[02:57:58.860 --> 02:58:03.860]   maybe with spears and up close and personal force,
[02:58:03.860 --> 02:58:06.280]   but we could with spears and javelins
[02:58:06.280 --> 02:58:07.820]   and slings and whatnot.
[02:58:07.820 --> 02:58:11.820]   And then he went into how we've used water
[02:58:11.820 --> 02:58:13.220]   to channel hydraulic energy.
[02:58:13.220 --> 02:58:14.820]   So we can basically overcome gravity.
[02:58:14.820 --> 02:58:16.940]   We can move, you know.
[02:58:16.940 --> 02:58:21.620]   There's theories that the pyramids were constructed using,
[02:58:21.620 --> 02:58:23.980]   the blocks were moved using hydraulic energy
[02:58:23.980 --> 02:58:25.540]   or using water.
[02:58:25.540 --> 02:58:27.980]   Clearly we use like cargo ships and whatnot
[02:58:27.980 --> 02:58:30.220]   to move things much more efficiently across water
[02:58:30.220 --> 02:58:32.380]   than we could the land.
[02:58:32.380 --> 02:58:37.380]   So his whole view is how we keep figuring out better ways
[02:58:37.380 --> 02:58:40.540]   and more efficient ways to harness energy and channel it.
[02:58:40.540 --> 02:58:44.080]   And in that perspective,
[02:58:44.080 --> 02:58:47.440]   money has always represented a claim
[02:58:47.440 --> 02:58:48.980]   on all other forms of energy.
[02:58:48.980 --> 02:58:51.900]   So whatever energy couldn't be channeled
[02:58:51.900 --> 02:58:54.820]   towards something useful in the economy historically
[02:58:54.820 --> 02:58:56.180]   would go into gold mining.
[02:58:56.180 --> 02:58:59.560]   So gold became this residual, this economic,
[02:58:59.560 --> 02:59:04.060]   this token of the excess energy created
[02:59:04.060 --> 02:59:05.500]   by the market economy.
[02:59:05.500 --> 02:59:07.420]   And then you could take that token of energy
[02:59:07.420 --> 02:59:10.620]   and use it to redeem for any other form of energy
[02:59:10.620 --> 02:59:12.700]   or any other products of energy itself.
[02:59:12.700 --> 02:59:18.060]   I guess that's my best approximation of it.
[02:59:18.060 --> 02:59:22.300]   And it just really shattered my worldview again
[02:59:22.300 --> 02:59:23.780]   'cause I'd always thought about it as time.
[02:59:23.780 --> 02:59:26.580]   Like we spend time sacrificing to obtain money
[02:59:26.580 --> 02:59:28.640]   that we then redeem for commensurate sacrifices
[02:59:28.640 --> 02:59:29.980]   from others.
[02:59:29.980 --> 02:59:32.420]   But I'd never considered it purely as energy.
[02:59:32.420 --> 02:59:34.260]   And then it also ties back into gold
[02:59:35.260 --> 02:59:38.940]   where there was an energy expenditure necessary
[02:59:38.940 --> 02:59:40.260]   to obtain gold.
[02:59:40.260 --> 02:59:43.700]   So there's a proof of work associated with obtaining gold
[02:59:43.700 --> 02:59:45.340]   that protected its market value.
[02:59:45.340 --> 02:59:47.780]   So you had to expend, again,
[02:59:47.780 --> 02:59:50.220]   if market value of gold's 2000 an ounce,
[02:59:50.220 --> 02:59:53.180]   you had to expend 1900 an ounce mining.
[02:59:53.180 --> 02:59:56.580]   So it kept producers honest in a way.
[02:59:56.580 --> 02:59:58.980]   - So do you think something like proof of stake
[02:59:58.980 --> 03:00:01.980]   that's more about reputation
[03:00:01.980 --> 03:00:06.980]   than actual exertion, like energy can work?
[03:00:06.980 --> 03:00:11.180]   - No.
[03:00:11.180 --> 03:00:13.740]   I think proof of stake is inherently centralizing.
[03:00:13.740 --> 03:00:18.380]   It's like the old Matthew principle,
[03:00:18.380 --> 03:00:20.900]   from those who have to those who have,
[03:00:20.900 --> 03:00:22.900]   more will be given from those who have not,
[03:00:22.900 --> 03:00:24.100]   everything will be taken.
[03:00:24.100 --> 03:00:26.460]   That's what proof of stake is.
[03:00:26.460 --> 03:00:29.900]   You need proof of work to embody skin in the game
[03:00:29.900 --> 03:00:33.580]   and the marketplace such that contributions
[03:00:33.580 --> 03:00:36.460]   are commensurate with consideration received.
[03:00:36.460 --> 03:00:37.920]   That's how systems work.
[03:00:37.920 --> 03:00:42.220]   - What's the idea why proof of work
[03:00:42.220 --> 03:00:46.980]   might incentivize decentralization?
[03:00:46.980 --> 03:00:53.220]   Do you worry that as Bitcoin becomes more powerful,
[03:00:53.220 --> 03:00:55.620]   it may become again more centralized?
[03:00:56.820 --> 03:00:59.580]   - Well, the decentralization of Bitcoin
[03:00:59.580 --> 03:01:03.780]   is largely driven by the nodes actually,
[03:01:03.780 --> 03:01:05.300]   which aren't actually mining.
[03:01:05.300 --> 03:01:07.800]   They're just choosing which rule set to implement.
[03:01:07.800 --> 03:01:12.060]   And then the mining network
[03:01:12.060 --> 03:01:14.580]   is actually enforcing that rule set.
[03:01:14.580 --> 03:01:18.020]   So I think the mining network
[03:01:18.020 --> 03:01:22.140]   is inherently decentralized in that
[03:01:22.140 --> 03:01:24.540]   really anyone with access to cheap energy
[03:01:24.540 --> 03:01:25.580]   can become a miner.
[03:01:25.580 --> 03:01:27.860]   You can freely enter or exit the market
[03:01:27.860 --> 03:01:29.300]   or the network at any time.
[03:01:29.300 --> 03:01:34.820]   But maintaining the block size at a manageable level
[03:01:34.820 --> 03:01:38.020]   is what's key to maintaining node decentralization.
[03:01:38.020 --> 03:01:40.540]   - This is an interesting question.
[03:01:40.540 --> 03:01:43.340]   Who do you think has more power, the miners or the nodes?
[03:01:43.340 --> 03:01:49.340]   'Cause the nodes carry the idea of the protocol,
[03:01:49.340 --> 03:01:51.340]   like the specifics.
[03:01:51.340 --> 03:01:55.340]   So in some sense, they have more power.
[03:01:55.340 --> 03:01:56.940]   And Bitcoin is an idea.
[03:01:56.940 --> 03:02:00.740]   - They're kind of mutually indispensable though,
[03:02:00.740 --> 03:02:01.940]   'cause you can't have,
[03:02:01.940 --> 03:02:05.960]   there's no security without the miners.
[03:02:05.960 --> 03:02:08.460]   So without the miners, Bitcoin is just an idea.
[03:02:08.460 --> 03:02:12.180]   And the idea of Bitcoin is maybe existed
[03:02:12.180 --> 03:02:13.260]   even before Bitcoin, right?
[03:02:13.260 --> 03:02:14.100]   Just sound money.
[03:02:14.100 --> 03:02:15.860]   We just say sound money as an idea.
[03:02:15.860 --> 03:02:18.980]   But there was no way to root that
[03:02:18.980 --> 03:02:23.200]   into thermodynamic reality without Satoshi figuring out,
[03:02:23.200 --> 03:02:25.140]   not just proof of work.
[03:02:25.140 --> 03:02:28.420]   It's the entire composite of the difficulty adjustment,
[03:02:28.420 --> 03:02:32.780]   proof of work, one-way hashing, et cetera.
[03:02:32.780 --> 03:02:35.060]   So I don't know, that's hard to say,
[03:02:35.060 --> 03:02:36.440]   hard to disentangle the two.
[03:02:36.440 --> 03:02:40.180]   - You've talked about money as morality too.
[03:02:40.180 --> 03:02:44.540]   How do you think about moral and immoral action
[03:02:44.540 --> 03:02:45.800]   in the context of money?
[03:02:45.800 --> 03:02:51.060]   - There's this great quote by Rothbard,
[03:02:51.060 --> 03:02:53.740]   who's a famous Austrian economist.
[03:02:53.740 --> 03:02:57.900]   And he says, "To be moral, an act must be free."
[03:02:57.900 --> 03:02:59.780]   Unquote.
[03:02:59.780 --> 03:03:05.900]   And I think morality, it changes over time
[03:03:05.900 --> 03:03:12.940]   and it has its roots in biology.
[03:03:12.940 --> 03:03:17.580]   Jordan Peterson makes the point that even animals
[03:03:17.580 --> 03:03:20.340]   have their own sort of pseudo morality.
[03:03:21.180 --> 03:03:24.500]   Where like with wolf packs, for instance,
[03:03:24.500 --> 03:03:26.980]   if there's a dispute between the alpha males,
[03:03:26.980 --> 03:03:30.860]   or I guess between an alpha male and a incumbent,
[03:03:30.860 --> 03:03:35.540]   the two males will have a fight basically.
[03:03:35.540 --> 03:03:39.500]   And then when one is decided that one has won,
[03:03:39.500 --> 03:03:40.900]   the loser will basically roll over
[03:03:40.900 --> 03:03:45.000]   and give up his neck to the alpha male.
[03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:47.820]   And they do this instead of fighting to the death
[03:03:47.820 --> 03:03:51.040]   because in a wolf pack, they need every wolf.
[03:03:51.040 --> 03:03:52.620]   So they can go out and bring down,
[03:03:52.620 --> 03:03:54.920]   you never know when you're gonna need the 20th wolf
[03:03:54.920 --> 03:03:56.980]   to bring down the big buffalo the next day or whatever.
[03:03:56.980 --> 03:04:01.300]   So they've developed this less than fight to the death
[03:04:01.300 --> 03:04:04.540]   social morality to optimize their effectiveness
[03:04:04.540 --> 03:04:05.640]   as a wolf pack.
[03:04:05.640 --> 03:04:12.020]   And similarly for humans, our morality sort of emerges
[03:04:12.020 --> 03:04:16.140]   through competition and play even.
[03:04:16.140 --> 03:04:19.860]   There are these implicit rules that come into place
[03:04:19.860 --> 03:04:22.760]   based on how we're organizing ourselves over time.
[03:04:22.760 --> 03:04:29.000]   And so with money, it's interesting
[03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:33.480]   because most tools we would consider to be amoral,
[03:04:33.480 --> 03:04:38.060]   as in a hammer can be used to build a house,
[03:04:38.060 --> 03:04:39.320]   which could be seen to be good,
[03:04:39.320 --> 03:04:40.800]   like a good constructive purpose,
[03:04:40.800 --> 03:04:43.080]   or could be used to bash someone's skull,
[03:04:43.080 --> 03:04:44.580]   which could be something evil.
[03:04:44.580 --> 03:04:49.400]   And that the tool itself is amoral,
[03:04:49.400 --> 03:04:51.520]   it doesn't have any independent morality of its own.
[03:04:51.520 --> 03:04:54.040]   All of the morality is associated
[03:04:54.040 --> 03:04:55.400]   with the wielder of the tool.
[03:04:55.400 --> 03:04:58.640]   So what's the quote, like any tool can be a weapon
[03:04:58.640 --> 03:05:00.440]   if you hold it right, sort of thing.
[03:05:00.440 --> 03:05:05.640]   But money's maybe a little bit different in that
[03:05:05.640 --> 03:05:11.880]   when you monopolize money,
[03:05:11.880 --> 03:05:15.320]   it's only useful as a tool for one thing.
[03:05:15.320 --> 03:05:17.860]   And that's for allocating wealth away from some
[03:05:17.860 --> 03:05:19.480]   and to others.
[03:05:19.480 --> 03:05:23.660]   So it is the only utility of monopolized money is theft.
[03:05:23.660 --> 03:05:26.880]   There's no other, you know,
[03:05:26.880 --> 03:05:28.880]   there's a lot of propaganda out there that will say,
[03:05:28.880 --> 03:05:31.040]   oh, we need to print money to get out of this disaster
[03:05:31.040 --> 03:05:35.080]   or to give to the poor, whatever this,
[03:05:35.080 --> 03:05:40.080]   whatever moralistically camouflaged political aim
[03:05:40.080 --> 03:05:41.960]   is being discussed,
[03:05:41.960 --> 03:05:44.360]   at the base layer of monopolized money
[03:05:44.360 --> 03:05:46.400]   is that it's only useful for taking from some
[03:05:46.400 --> 03:05:47.880]   and giving to others.
[03:05:47.880 --> 03:05:50.180]   So another way to think about this is that
[03:05:50.180 --> 03:05:55.200]   money is a paper claim on the savings of society.
[03:05:55.200 --> 03:05:58.200]   So it is just a ticket for redeeming savings,
[03:05:58.200 --> 03:06:00.920]   which could be time, could be capital,
[03:06:00.920 --> 03:06:03.620]   could be knowledge from any market actor in the world.
[03:06:03.620 --> 03:06:07.240]   So it's kind of a list of who owns what, if you will,
[03:06:07.240 --> 03:06:08.160]   it's a proxy list.
[03:06:08.160 --> 03:06:11.240]   If there's one group that can amend that list
[03:06:11.240 --> 03:06:12.880]   and others cannot,
[03:06:12.880 --> 03:06:16.000]   then they're basically able and incented to
[03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:18.960]   modify that list to their own benefit.
[03:06:18.960 --> 03:06:23.120]   And that's effectively what a central bank is doing.
[03:06:23.120 --> 03:06:27.180]   So a central bank is determining how much money to create.
[03:06:27.180 --> 03:06:28.800]   They're also determining who gets to receive
[03:06:28.800 --> 03:06:30.440]   that money first.
[03:06:30.440 --> 03:06:33.180]   And the first recipients of that money
[03:06:33.180 --> 03:06:37.360]   are gonna be the beneficiaries in an inflationary regime.
[03:06:37.360 --> 03:06:39.120]   So those that receive the money last
[03:06:39.120 --> 03:06:40.680]   are the ones being robbed.
[03:06:40.680 --> 03:06:41.840]   Those that receive the money first
[03:06:41.840 --> 03:06:46.640]   are the ones that are receiving the stolen proceeds,
[03:06:46.640 --> 03:06:47.480]   let's say.
[03:06:47.480 --> 03:06:53.480]   And this has a really corrosive effect on social morality
[03:06:53.480 --> 03:07:00.280]   because if we consider that people's time horizon,
[03:07:00.280 --> 03:07:03.960]   which the Austrians call the time preference,
[03:07:03.960 --> 03:07:07.920]   the more short-term thinking you are,
[03:07:07.920 --> 03:07:12.640]   the more likely you are to engage in selfish behavior.
[03:07:12.640 --> 03:07:16.400]   Right, if you know that it's all over tomorrow
[03:07:16.400 --> 03:07:20.120]   and you've been working your whole life to develop,
[03:07:20.120 --> 03:07:22.240]   you know, this business or create this reputation
[03:07:22.240 --> 03:07:23.080]   or whatever your thing is,
[03:07:23.080 --> 03:07:24.800]   but you just are given the foreknowledge
[03:07:24.800 --> 03:07:26.760]   that tomorrow it's all gonna end,
[03:07:26.760 --> 03:07:28.400]   you're much more likely to go out
[03:07:28.400 --> 03:07:30.480]   and just maybe get drunk and party that night
[03:07:30.480 --> 03:07:32.900]   because there's no more repercussions, right?
[03:07:32.900 --> 03:07:37.440]   Whereas if you know that you're gonna live
[03:07:37.440 --> 03:07:39.800]   for a very long time,
[03:07:39.800 --> 03:07:42.200]   you're much more likely to plan for the future.
[03:07:42.200 --> 03:07:46.280]   And money's very,
[03:07:46.280 --> 03:07:48.040]   so we just say that your time horizon
[03:07:48.040 --> 03:07:50.560]   is closely related to your morality, right?
[03:07:50.560 --> 03:07:52.160]   The longer term thinking you are,
[03:07:52.160 --> 03:07:54.000]   the more moral you would tend to behave,
[03:07:54.000 --> 03:07:55.840]   the more you would care about long-term relationship
[03:07:55.840 --> 03:07:59.040]   building versus going out and getting wasted.
[03:07:59.040 --> 03:08:04.040]   And money too impinges very closely on our time preference.
[03:08:04.040 --> 03:08:06.760]   And again, time preference is the Austrian term.
[03:08:06.760 --> 03:08:10.520]   So low time preference means you're long-term oriented.
[03:08:10.520 --> 03:08:12.760]   High time preference means you're short-term oriented,
[03:08:12.760 --> 03:08:14.840]   which can be a little trippy for some people
[03:08:14.840 --> 03:08:15.840]   'cause it sounds backwards.
[03:08:15.840 --> 03:08:20.840]   But if your money constantly loses value,
[03:08:20.840 --> 03:08:26.960]   you are incentivized to become more short-term oriented.
[03:08:26.960 --> 03:08:31.320]   You are handicapped in your ability to plan for the future
[03:08:31.320 --> 03:08:35.520]   because your money, which is intended to be,
[03:08:35.520 --> 03:08:37.000]   here's another definition of money,
[03:08:37.000 --> 03:08:39.800]   as an insurance policy against uncertainty.
[03:08:39.800 --> 03:08:42.080]   So no matter what problems you encounter in the world,
[03:08:42.080 --> 03:08:45.420]   this money will best help you deal with those problems.
[03:08:45.420 --> 03:08:48.640]   When that insurance policy against uncertainty
[03:08:48.640 --> 03:08:51.000]   is injected with uncertainty,
[03:08:51.000 --> 03:08:53.480]   it's polluted with the uncertainty of inflation,
[03:08:53.480 --> 03:08:55.000]   your time horizon shrinks,
[03:08:55.000 --> 03:08:57.120]   your ability to plan long-term shrinks.
[03:08:57.120 --> 03:09:00.120]   And this impinges on social morality.
[03:09:00.120 --> 03:09:02.440]   So there's a great book on this
[03:09:02.440 --> 03:09:04.320]   called "Honest Money" by Gary North.
[03:09:05.240 --> 03:09:08.420]   And in that book, he gives the parable of the winemaker.
[03:09:08.420 --> 03:09:12.840]   The winemaker, if we just imagine
[03:09:12.840 --> 03:09:15.720]   the hypothetical winemaker operating a business
[03:09:15.720 --> 03:09:17.880]   in a centrally banked economy,
[03:09:17.880 --> 03:09:20.680]   and let's say his central bank just doubled the money supply
[03:09:20.680 --> 03:09:22.580]   to quote unquote save the economy,
[03:09:22.580 --> 03:09:27.100]   say an increase in money supply from one to $2 trillion.
[03:09:27.100 --> 03:09:29.260]   This winemaker that's accustomed to selling wine
[03:09:29.260 --> 03:09:32.640]   at $20 a bottle is now faced with basically three choices.
[03:09:33.640 --> 03:09:36.640]   And an important point here too,
[03:09:36.640 --> 03:09:38.040]   before we get into his three choices
[03:09:38.040 --> 03:09:40.000]   are what prices are themselves.
[03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:44.680]   Prices are the most visible aspect of any service.
[03:09:44.680 --> 03:09:46.560]   So when you increase prices,
[03:09:46.560 --> 03:09:50.400]   you are incentivizing your customers to look elsewhere.
[03:09:50.400 --> 03:09:51.720]   They're gonna look at your competition.
[03:09:51.720 --> 03:09:53.440]   When you decrease prices,
[03:09:53.440 --> 03:09:55.800]   you're incentivizing market actors
[03:09:55.800 --> 03:09:57.560]   to look closer at your product, right?
[03:09:57.560 --> 03:10:00.160]   You're delivering a solution at a lower price.
[03:10:00.160 --> 03:10:02.560]   So this winemaker that's accustomed to selling his wine
[03:10:02.560 --> 03:10:05.240]   at a $20 price point, all of a sudden,
[03:10:05.240 --> 03:10:07.840]   because of a central bank has tripled the money supply,
[03:10:07.840 --> 03:10:09.000]   he has three choices.
[03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:14.440]   He can either keep selling his bottle at $20
[03:10:14.440 --> 03:10:16.080]   and all of his inputs will increase
[03:10:16.080 --> 03:10:19.080]   due to inflation by 50%.
[03:10:19.080 --> 03:10:22.720]   So he will lose 50% of his profit margin as a result.
[03:10:22.720 --> 03:10:26.160]   So he can choose to eat that loss.
[03:10:26.160 --> 03:10:28.400]   He can choose to double the selling price
[03:10:28.400 --> 03:10:31.720]   of his bottle of wine from $20 to $40
[03:10:31.720 --> 03:10:34.120]   because all of the price of his inputs doubled.
[03:10:34.120 --> 03:10:36.280]   So then he would maintain his profit margin.
[03:10:36.280 --> 03:10:40.680]   Or the third one is that he could choose
[03:10:40.680 --> 03:10:45.400]   to water down his wine or use inferior ingredients.
[03:10:45.400 --> 03:10:47.440]   So he could use cheaper inputs
[03:10:47.440 --> 03:10:50.000]   and maintain the output at the same price.
[03:10:50.000 --> 03:10:54.560]   So he could basically start selling his customers
[03:10:54.560 --> 03:10:57.480]   an inferior product for the same price to preserve his profit.
[03:10:57.520 --> 03:11:01.000]   Now again, case number one, it's not very palatable.
[03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:02.800]   He doesn't want to eat the economic loss.
[03:11:02.800 --> 03:11:05.080]   Case number two, it's not very good either
[03:11:05.080 --> 03:11:07.440]   because he's then incentivizing all of his customers
[03:11:07.440 --> 03:11:10.960]   to go shop other winemakers if he doubles his price.
[03:11:10.960 --> 03:11:13.400]   So human nature being what it is,
[03:11:13.400 --> 03:11:15.520]   trying to get something for nothing,
[03:11:15.520 --> 03:11:18.280]   inflation actually seeps into other industries
[03:11:18.280 --> 03:11:21.680]   by encouraging producers into option three,
[03:11:21.680 --> 03:11:24.680]   which is to deceive your customer in the short run.
[03:11:24.680 --> 03:11:27.600]   And again, this would be done initially at the margins.
[03:11:27.600 --> 03:11:29.080]   Maybe it's just a few drops of water.
[03:11:29.080 --> 03:11:31.800]   Maybe it's just some cheaper grapes.
[03:11:31.800 --> 03:11:33.400]   But over time,
[03:11:33.400 --> 03:11:39.120]   this inflation is actually inducing producers
[03:11:39.120 --> 03:11:41.800]   to weigh their financial wellbeing
[03:11:41.800 --> 03:11:43.760]   against their moral integrity.
[03:11:43.760 --> 03:11:46.160]   So it's forcing them into this dilemma
[03:11:46.160 --> 03:11:48.920]   that would not exist in a free market economy.
[03:11:48.920 --> 03:11:53.680]   And it's not a good idea to do that.
[03:11:53.680 --> 03:11:57.760]   Because as they charge more money for wine
[03:11:57.760 --> 03:12:00.920]   that is inferior, the buyers of that wine,
[03:12:00.920 --> 03:12:02.640]   also living in a central bank economy,
[03:12:02.640 --> 03:12:05.200]   are also getting scammed by not only the inflation,
[03:12:05.200 --> 03:12:06.440]   but also the wine.
[03:12:06.440 --> 03:12:09.120]   So it becomes this kind of corrosive,
[03:12:09.120 --> 03:12:10.960]   contagious moral effect
[03:12:10.960 --> 03:12:14.920]   that propagates throughout an economy.
[03:12:14.920 --> 03:12:18.520]   And that's why I've argued in a lot of my writing
[03:12:18.520 --> 03:12:23.520]   that inflation is this infectious moral cancer on the world.
[03:12:24.120 --> 03:12:29.120]   I think it is tied back to a lot of the social strangeness
[03:12:29.120 --> 03:12:32.480]   we've seen in modern times,
[03:12:32.480 --> 03:12:35.880]   where there seems to be a lot of fake people
[03:12:35.880 --> 03:12:38.040]   and a lot of fake businesses and a lot of scams,
[03:12:38.040 --> 03:12:38.880]   all of these things.
[03:12:38.880 --> 03:12:40.960]   I think it really is rooted in the money.
[03:12:40.960 --> 03:12:45.120]   And Bitcoin has the first money in history
[03:12:45.120 --> 03:12:47.360]   that has a 0% terminal inflation rate,
[03:12:47.360 --> 03:12:50.480]   or said differently, zero unexpected inflation.
[03:12:50.480 --> 03:12:54.320]   There's no theft integrated into Bitcoin.
[03:12:54.320 --> 03:12:56.000]   You can only earn it through work
[03:12:56.000 --> 03:12:58.240]   or sacrificing resources to obtain it.
[03:12:58.240 --> 03:13:03.720]   It is the antidote to this moral cancer
[03:13:03.720 --> 03:13:06.060]   that inflation riddles our society with.
[03:13:06.060 --> 03:13:08.800]   - Again, you're blowing my mind a little bit
[03:13:08.800 --> 03:13:11.800]   to think about the ripple effects of inflation,
[03:13:11.800 --> 03:13:15.080]   the way it seeps through with our interactions.
[03:13:15.080 --> 03:13:18.560]   So at the very, the early ripples
[03:13:18.560 --> 03:13:20.360]   is the effect it has on the products,
[03:13:20.360 --> 03:13:23.040]   on the dilution of the wine,
[03:13:23.040 --> 03:13:27.120]   but also it might have a ripple effects on the character,
[03:13:27.120 --> 03:13:28.620]   on the behavior of people.
[03:13:28.620 --> 03:13:33.280]   That's interesting, artificial creation of scarcity,
[03:13:33.280 --> 03:13:38.280]   creating, having effects on society at the social,
[03:13:38.280 --> 03:13:40.160]   like the social fabric.
[03:13:40.160 --> 03:13:41.200]   - Yeah. - And I guess you're arguing
[03:13:41.200 --> 03:13:42.180]   the morality.
[03:13:42.180 --> 03:13:45.920]   - It's perverting free market dynamics,
[03:13:45.920 --> 03:13:48.960]   which again, we said free markets generate pragmatic truth.
[03:13:48.960 --> 03:13:51.960]   So inflation distorts price signals,
[03:13:51.960 --> 03:13:54.920]   which means it confuses capital allocation.
[03:13:54.920 --> 03:13:56.240]   So we're trying to solve problems,
[03:13:56.240 --> 03:13:59.160]   but all of a sudden we can't tell if this price increases
[03:13:59.160 --> 03:14:01.600]   a matter of true supply and demand change
[03:14:01.600 --> 03:14:03.480]   or a matter of policy change.
[03:14:03.480 --> 03:14:07.160]   So it clouds our economic perceptions.
[03:14:07.160 --> 03:14:09.360]   It suppresses innovation,
[03:14:09.360 --> 03:14:11.080]   because now you've exacerbated
[03:14:11.080 --> 03:14:12.480]   the boom and bust business cycle.
[03:14:12.480 --> 03:14:14.920]   People are gonna overborrow and go into projects
[03:14:14.920 --> 03:14:16.800]   that they can't profitably sustain,
[03:14:16.800 --> 03:14:18.320]   so then there'll be a huge collapse.
[03:14:18.320 --> 03:14:22.240]   So that actually breaks the market's function
[03:14:22.240 --> 03:14:24.040]   of generating innovation.
[03:14:24.040 --> 03:14:25.180]   And then, yeah, I would argue too,
[03:14:25.180 --> 03:14:29.600]   that it pollutes our pursuit of virtue, let's say.
[03:14:29.600 --> 03:14:32.520]   - Maybe it's pushing back, but I don't think so.
[03:14:32.520 --> 03:14:34.840]   It's not as clear to me,
[03:14:34.840 --> 03:14:36.840]   perhaps because I haven't thought about it deeply,
[03:14:36.840 --> 03:14:41.840]   that money is core to life and human interaction,
[03:14:41.840 --> 03:14:45.560]   because there might be other forces,
[03:14:45.560 --> 03:14:48.860]   other fraudulent forces, other things in human nature
[03:14:48.860 --> 03:14:51.180]   that are creating these effects as well.
[03:14:51.180 --> 03:14:53.280]   So it's clear, I think you're articulating really well,
[03:14:53.280 --> 03:14:56.160]   that there's these negative effects from inflation.
[03:14:56.160 --> 03:14:59.000]   I wonder if there's other undiscovered,
[03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:02.280]   not undiscovered, but ones we're not making explicit now,
[03:15:02.280 --> 03:15:07.280]   forces that are creating all the things we're seeing now,
[03:15:07.280 --> 03:15:11.480]   with, like you said, cancer culture and all those things,
[03:15:11.480 --> 03:15:16.480]   but also the negative effects on the quality of products,
[03:15:16.480 --> 03:15:19.640]   on the excellence of the creativity,
[03:15:19.640 --> 03:15:21.160]   and the innovation, all those kinds of things.
[03:15:21.160 --> 03:15:23.120]   I wonder if there's other factors.
[03:15:23.120 --> 03:15:26.720]   It's kind of, listen, it's compelling to think money's
[03:15:26.720 --> 03:15:28.320]   at the core of it all.
[03:15:28.320 --> 03:15:30.520]   Like if you fix, I forgot what the phrase was.
[03:15:30.520 --> 03:15:31.680]   - Fix the money, fix the world.
[03:15:31.680 --> 03:15:33.520]   - Yeah, fix the money, fix the world.
[03:15:33.520 --> 03:15:40.480]   Again, things that sound good, I'm skeptical of by nature.
[03:15:40.480 --> 03:15:44.440]   So I wonder if there's other things that are beyond money
[03:15:44.440 --> 03:15:47.280]   that are somehow deeply integrated into our human nature.
[03:15:47.280 --> 03:15:51.600]   - Another one related to money is social cohesion itself.
[03:15:51.600 --> 03:15:56.020]   So very simple anecdote for this was,
[03:15:56.020 --> 03:15:58.540]   the more you increase the inflation rate,
[03:15:58.540 --> 03:16:02.080]   social cohesion is inversely proportionate to that.
[03:16:02.080 --> 03:16:04.580]   So the extreme example would be hyperinflation, right?
[03:16:04.580 --> 03:16:07.280]   Where the money is produced in such excess
[03:16:07.280 --> 03:16:09.780]   that it loses all meaning and relevance.
[03:16:09.780 --> 03:16:14.360]   So today in Venezuela, there is cash clogging the gutters,
[03:16:14.360 --> 03:16:16.720]   clogging the streets, clogging the sewer system,
[03:16:16.720 --> 03:16:21.120]   because the cash has lost all relevance.
[03:16:21.120 --> 03:16:23.920]   And so anecdotally, we would suspect that, okay,
[03:16:23.920 --> 03:16:28.420]   if there's a inverse relationship between inflation
[03:16:28.420 --> 03:16:32.640]   and social cohesion, if we could then take inflation to zero,
[03:16:32.640 --> 03:16:35.920]   couldn't we theoretically increase social cohesion
[03:16:35.920 --> 03:16:36.920]   to its maximum?
[03:16:38.600 --> 03:16:40.540]   So another way to say that is inflation
[03:16:40.540 --> 03:16:43.980]   is a de-civilizing force,
[03:16:43.980 --> 03:16:45.700]   whereas natural price deflation,
[03:16:45.700 --> 03:16:48.540]   which would occur in a hard money economy,
[03:16:48.540 --> 03:16:50.980]   where there's either a fixed supply of Bitcoin
[03:16:50.980 --> 03:16:55.980]   or relatively scarce supply of gold, for instance,
[03:16:55.980 --> 03:17:00.220]   that lays claim to an increasing capital stock
[03:17:00.220 --> 03:17:01.900]   of goods and services.
[03:17:01.900 --> 03:17:04.060]   Prices would naturally decline every year
[03:17:04.060 --> 03:17:06.100]   as we became smarter.
[03:17:06.100 --> 03:17:07.820]   So the market price becomes a reflection
[03:17:07.820 --> 03:17:09.780]   of our collective knowledge.
[03:17:09.780 --> 03:17:12.660]   So by letting prices decline naturally over time,
[03:17:12.660 --> 03:17:16.080]   we can actually induce civilization.
[03:17:16.080 --> 03:17:18.580]   But by trying to force prices higher all the time,
[03:17:18.580 --> 03:17:21.860]   via the central bank, we're creating the opposite effect.
[03:17:21.860 --> 03:17:24.120]   - So we talked a little bit about the Soviet Union,
[03:17:24.120 --> 03:17:26.340]   and I happen to have lived through the collapse
[03:17:26.340 --> 03:17:27.420]   of the Soviet Union.
[03:17:27.420 --> 03:17:33.740]   And so what are the factors, the causes in your mind
[03:17:33.740 --> 03:17:36.880]   to why the Soviet Union collapsed?
[03:17:37.880 --> 03:17:42.880]   - So, definitely a multivariate situation.
[03:17:42.880 --> 03:17:45.120]   I think there's a lot of factors.
[03:17:45.120 --> 03:17:48.880]   One that jumped out to me recently,
[03:17:48.880 --> 03:17:51.440]   again, from that documentary that I didn't note before,
[03:17:51.440 --> 03:17:54.080]   was that at one point, Stalin eliminated,
[03:17:54.080 --> 03:17:56.920]   I think, 75% of his intelligence force.
[03:17:56.920 --> 03:18:01.280]   Which I think when you're competing
[03:18:01.280 --> 03:18:04.120]   with another nation state,
[03:18:04.120 --> 03:18:06.840]   and intelligence and covert operations
[03:18:06.840 --> 03:18:08.800]   are very integral to your survival.
[03:18:08.800 --> 03:18:13.560]   I think that was definitely a shot in the foot.
[03:18:13.560 --> 03:18:18.560]   But at a higher level, I would say that capitalism
[03:18:18.560 --> 03:18:23.640]   and communism were each resource strategies
[03:18:23.640 --> 03:18:25.580]   of the 20th century nation state.
[03:18:25.580 --> 03:18:30.080]   And they seem, we commonly consider them
[03:18:30.080 --> 03:18:31.440]   to be diametrically opposed,
[03:18:31.440 --> 03:18:34.800]   but there's actually a lot of commonality between the two.
[03:18:34.800 --> 03:18:38.280]   The difference would be that in Soviet Russia,
[03:18:38.280 --> 03:18:40.480]   as we alluded to earlier,
[03:18:40.480 --> 03:18:43.560]   they tried to completely replace price signals
[03:18:43.560 --> 03:18:46.840]   with this nationalistic faith and devotion.
[03:18:46.840 --> 03:18:50.640]   So they removed the economic nerve signal,
[03:18:50.640 --> 03:18:53.720]   which coordinated the allocation of capital over time.
[03:18:53.720 --> 03:18:57.000]   So this inhibited their ability to generate wealth.
[03:18:57.000 --> 03:18:58.240]   Whereas in the United States,
[03:18:58.240 --> 03:19:02.320]   we left most markets open to free enterprise.
[03:19:02.320 --> 03:19:06.040]   So we honored the integrity of price signals,
[03:19:06.040 --> 03:19:09.420]   and we allowed people to trade and accumulate wealth.
[03:19:09.420 --> 03:19:14.560]   So in every market, except the market for money,
[03:19:14.560 --> 03:19:16.960]   both markets maintained a central bank,
[03:19:16.960 --> 03:19:18.240]   as we've gotten to.
[03:19:18.240 --> 03:19:23.040]   So I think in a really big picture standpoint,
[03:19:23.040 --> 03:19:27.520]   that's why capitalism outcompetes communism,
[03:19:27.520 --> 03:19:31.200]   is because it is able to generate more wealth
[03:19:31.200 --> 03:19:32.920]   than communism was,
[03:19:32.920 --> 03:19:35.560]   and therefore was able to put financial pressure
[03:19:35.560 --> 03:19:39.300]   on the USSR until it reached the point of bankruptcy,
[03:19:39.300 --> 03:19:40.800]   essentially.
[03:19:40.800 --> 03:19:44.080]   This similar model, I would argue,
[03:19:44.080 --> 03:19:49.080]   is that for the same reasons we saw capitalism
[03:19:49.080 --> 03:19:50.080]   outcompete communism,
[03:19:50.080 --> 03:19:53.840]   which I think the data that I recall
[03:19:53.840 --> 03:19:56.560]   was that the USSR's economy was valued
[03:19:56.560 --> 03:19:59.640]   at close to one third of its inputs.
[03:19:59.640 --> 03:20:02.800]   So if you just didn't do anything inside the USSR
[03:20:02.800 --> 03:20:05.340]   and just sold all the raw materials that were going into it,
[03:20:05.340 --> 03:20:07.900]   it would have been worth three times as much
[03:20:07.900 --> 03:20:09.760]   as sending the materials in,
[03:20:09.760 --> 03:20:10.880]   running it through the efforts,
[03:20:10.880 --> 03:20:12.280]   and then shipping things back out.
[03:20:12.280 --> 03:20:16.220]   It was value destructive versus value creative.
[03:20:16.220 --> 03:20:18.540]   And I would argue this is because,
[03:20:18.540 --> 03:20:21.400]   again, the centralized computing model
[03:20:21.400 --> 03:20:23.320]   versus decentralized computing model,
[03:20:23.320 --> 03:20:26.100]   it just became more and more corrupt over time.
[03:20:26.100 --> 03:20:30.880]   It got to the point where I think most of the occupations
[03:20:30.880 --> 03:20:34.000]   in USSR towards the end were as informants.
[03:20:34.000 --> 03:20:36.160]   All right, they were working for the state.
[03:20:36.160 --> 03:20:38.460]   Jordan Peterson makes this point too,
[03:20:38.460 --> 03:20:40.520]   that at some point it was actually illegal
[03:20:40.520 --> 03:20:43.080]   to be sad in Soviet Russia,
[03:20:43.080 --> 03:20:44.920]   because if you were sad,
[03:20:44.920 --> 03:20:48.840]   you were contradicting the utopian view of the state.
[03:20:48.840 --> 03:20:49.680]   So if you were sad,
[03:20:49.680 --> 03:20:51.920]   you're implying the state's not doing something wrong.
[03:20:51.920 --> 03:20:53.760]   But by the way, this does remind me,
[03:20:53.760 --> 03:20:57.120]   do you know what Jordan Peterson thinks about Bitcoin
[03:20:57.120 --> 03:21:02.120]   and about the future impact of Bitcoin on the society?
[03:21:02.120 --> 03:21:05.520]   - No, I don't actually.
[03:21:05.520 --> 03:21:10.640]   We're hopefully gonna be talking to him soon about that.
[03:21:10.640 --> 03:21:14.140]   We did a book club on his book, "Maps of Meaning,"
[03:21:14.140 --> 03:21:16.080]   and he engaged with us about it.
[03:21:16.080 --> 03:21:19.040]   So we're hoping to deliver the orange bill to Mr. Peterson.
[03:21:19.040 --> 03:21:20.680]   - The orange bill.
[03:21:20.680 --> 03:21:24.040]   I think his audience is one of the most important audiences
[03:21:24.040 --> 03:21:25.360]   in the world to understand Bitcoin.
[03:21:25.360 --> 03:21:29.380]   These people that are conscientious and responsible,
[03:21:29.380 --> 03:21:34.200]   I think they'll quickly understand
[03:21:34.200 --> 03:21:35.640]   Bitcoin's value proposition
[03:21:35.640 --> 03:21:38.480]   and help elucidate it to the world.
[03:21:38.480 --> 03:21:41.200]   - I'm trying to remember what he said about it.
[03:21:41.200 --> 03:21:45.760]   Basically, I think his support of Bitcoin is grounded
[03:21:45.760 --> 03:21:48.720]   in the kind of people who are opposing Bitcoin.
[03:21:49.880 --> 03:21:52.720]   So without understanding Bitcoin,
[03:21:52.720 --> 03:21:54.400]   he starts to like Bitcoin
[03:21:54.400 --> 03:21:56.500]   because of the people who are opposing it.
[03:21:56.500 --> 03:21:59.320]   (Lex laughing)
[03:21:59.320 --> 03:22:03.640]   I mean, that's partially why I am interested in Bitcoin.
[03:22:03.640 --> 03:22:08.520]   It's like all the people in power
[03:22:08.520 --> 03:22:13.520]   and all the kind of shady, fraudulent, non-genuine people
[03:22:13.520 --> 03:22:19.240]   who are dismissing Bitcoin are making me think, hmm.
[03:22:19.400 --> 03:22:23.520]   - One of Jordan's definitions of God is,
[03:22:23.520 --> 03:22:26.680]   he says, "God is found in the truthful speech
[03:22:26.680 --> 03:22:29.280]   "that rectifies pathological hierarchies."
[03:22:29.280 --> 03:22:34.700]   And I think that is a beautiful definition
[03:22:34.700 --> 03:22:36.720]   of what Bitcoin is doing in the world,
[03:22:36.720 --> 03:22:39.080]   and that we have this pathological hierarchy
[03:22:39.080 --> 03:22:40.840]   called central banking,
[03:22:40.840 --> 03:22:43.620]   by which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer,
[03:22:43.620 --> 03:22:48.280]   that is used as a mechanism for perpetual theft
[03:22:48.280 --> 03:22:51.360]   and funding warfare at a global scale.
[03:22:51.360 --> 03:22:54.780]   Like Ron Paul said, it's no coincidence
[03:22:54.780 --> 03:22:57.300]   that the 20th century of total war
[03:22:57.300 --> 03:22:59.300]   was also the century of central banking.
[03:22:59.300 --> 03:23:05.800]   When you have an institution of currency counterfeiting,
[03:23:05.800 --> 03:23:07.840]   which the central bank is,
[03:23:07.840 --> 03:23:10.580]   you are no longer bounded by your own balance sheet
[03:23:10.580 --> 03:23:11.480]   when you go to war.
[03:23:11.480 --> 03:23:13.560]   You don't have to just go to war on your own resources.
[03:23:13.560 --> 03:23:16.400]   You can now pillage the Commonwealth
[03:23:16.400 --> 03:23:20.160]   and pilfer the savings of society as a whole
[03:23:20.160 --> 03:23:21.400]   before you go bankrupt.
[03:23:21.400 --> 03:23:23.920]   And indeed, this is what Hitler did, right?
[03:23:23.920 --> 03:23:28.280]   Hitler hyperinflated in the Weimar Republic
[03:23:28.280 --> 03:23:30.440]   to fund his war efforts.
[03:23:30.440 --> 03:23:35.620]   And frankly, every dictator, every world war,
[03:23:35.620 --> 03:23:39.680]   every internment camp in history was made possible
[03:23:39.680 --> 03:23:43.460]   by the weaponization of money in fiat currency.
[03:23:43.460 --> 03:23:46.900]   So I hope, I know Jordan Peterson
[03:23:46.900 --> 03:23:49.320]   is a huge proponent of free speech.
[03:23:49.320 --> 03:23:51.740]   And I think that's ultimately at its deepest essence
[03:23:51.740 --> 03:23:53.180]   as what Bitcoin really is, right?
[03:23:53.180 --> 03:23:58.180]   It is just the purest form of monetary speech we've ever had.
[03:23:58.180 --> 03:24:02.940]   And by purifying that primary operating system
[03:24:02.940 --> 03:24:06.180]   of human action, I think we can eliminate
[03:24:06.180 --> 03:24:09.220]   this pathological hierarchy that is unfortunately
[03:24:09.220 --> 03:24:11.780]   the dominant institution in the world today.
[03:24:11.780 --> 03:24:14.700]   - Yeah, I'm definitely, especially with these explorations
[03:24:14.700 --> 03:24:18.020]   of Bitcoin, this journey I've been on,
[03:24:18.020 --> 03:24:21.360]   I'll revisit some of the aspects of human history
[03:24:21.360 --> 03:24:24.620]   that I've been looking at, like Stalin and Hitler,
[03:24:24.620 --> 03:24:28.820]   with a, from a perspective of a monetary perspective.
[03:24:28.820 --> 03:24:33.100]   Like what are the effects of inflation?
[03:24:33.100 --> 03:24:37.980]   How was it used as a tool in gaining power,
[03:24:37.980 --> 03:24:42.980]   in maintaining power, in manipulating the populace,
[03:24:42.980 --> 03:24:47.880]   in doing, in inflicting suffering
[03:24:47.880 --> 03:24:51.420]   and I would say evil onto the world.
[03:24:51.420 --> 03:24:52.360]   It's interesting.
[03:24:52.360 --> 03:24:54.780]   It's interesting.
[03:24:54.780 --> 03:24:56.920]   I'm gonna have to sort of go back into the whole.
[03:24:56.920 --> 03:25:01.780]   So I tend to focus more on the human nature
[03:25:01.780 --> 03:25:07.400]   and less about the tools that human nature leverages
[03:25:07.400 --> 03:25:11.140]   to effect change, but you're right that in some sense,
[03:25:11.140 --> 03:25:16.140]   money is a tool which can be effectively used
[03:25:16.140 --> 03:25:21.780]   to perform moral and immoral actions,
[03:25:21.780 --> 03:25:23.540]   depending on how it's used.
[03:25:23.540 --> 03:25:25.700]   - And there's a feedback between the two, right?
[03:25:25.700 --> 03:25:30.700]   There's, specifically with money itself,
[03:25:30.700 --> 03:25:36.740]   it's the, I don't know,
[03:25:37.680 --> 03:25:39.600]   here's the way I've been posing it lately,
[03:25:39.600 --> 03:25:41.360]   is that I actually think,
[03:25:41.360 --> 03:25:43.580]   we typically think of people as good or bad,
[03:25:43.580 --> 03:25:45.840]   or again, trying to label people all the time,
[03:25:45.840 --> 03:25:48.120]   but I think people and their characters
[03:25:48.120 --> 03:25:51.040]   are emergent properties of the incentive structures
[03:25:51.040 --> 03:25:51.960]   they inhabit.
[03:25:51.960 --> 03:25:52.800]   - Yeah.
[03:25:52.800 --> 03:25:55.620]   - So, what does Charlie Munger say?
[03:25:55.620 --> 03:25:56.920]   Don't show me the incentives,
[03:25:56.920 --> 03:25:59.480]   I'll show you the outcome kind of thing.
[03:25:59.480 --> 03:26:01.800]   This is a flawed incentive structure
[03:26:01.800 --> 03:26:03.580]   we've been operating within.
[03:26:03.580 --> 03:26:05.740]   Now I'm not speaking to the intention,
[03:26:05.740 --> 03:26:07.120]   people wanna argue with me all the time,
[03:26:07.120 --> 03:26:09.640]   like Jerome Powell's not a bad guy,
[03:26:09.640 --> 03:26:11.200]   he's doing his best at the central bank,
[03:26:11.200 --> 03:26:13.600]   he's doing what he thinks is right, that's fine.
[03:26:13.600 --> 03:26:16.360]   Whether that's true or not, it actually doesn't matter.
[03:26:16.360 --> 03:26:19.040]   The intention is divergent from the outcome.
[03:26:19.040 --> 03:26:20.640]   The institution that they are running
[03:26:20.640 --> 03:26:23.000]   is premised on deception and theft,
[03:26:23.000 --> 03:26:25.640]   and it is handicapping the productive economy.
[03:26:25.640 --> 03:26:29.000]   So when we're, even the terms we use, printing money,
[03:26:29.000 --> 03:26:30.600]   you're not creating any new value,
[03:26:30.600 --> 03:26:32.480]   you're not infusing the economy with anything,
[03:26:32.480 --> 03:26:34.520]   any new productive factors whatsoever.
[03:26:34.520 --> 03:26:36.740]   You're just harvesting the economic surplus
[03:26:36.740 --> 03:26:39.620]   created by entrepreneurs in the marketplace.
[03:26:39.620 --> 03:26:42.540]   It's impossible to add any value to an economy
[03:26:42.540 --> 03:26:45.740]   by increasing the paper claims on its savings.
[03:26:45.740 --> 03:26:50.740]   So, there's a feedback loop between man and tool,
[03:26:50.740 --> 03:26:53.340]   between creator and created,
[03:26:53.340 --> 03:26:57.020]   and I think we have to honor the relationship
[03:26:57.020 --> 03:26:58.620]   above either one, right?
[03:26:58.620 --> 03:27:00.540]   Trying to put the right people in the system
[03:27:00.540 --> 03:27:03.340]   or just build the right system, we need both.
[03:27:03.340 --> 03:27:05.220]   - Do you think the interesting question
[03:27:05.220 --> 03:27:10.220]   of whether the people that are in control of central banks
[03:27:10.220 --> 03:27:14.680]   or in positions of power there,
[03:27:14.680 --> 03:27:17.220]   if they themselves are malevolent,
[03:27:17.220 --> 03:27:19.820]   they themselves are bad actors,
[03:27:19.820 --> 03:27:24.820]   or they're simply like leaves floating along the river,
[03:27:24.820 --> 03:27:29.820]   sort of just a cog in the machine,
[03:27:29.820 --> 03:27:31.980]   an ant in an ant colony that operates
[03:27:31.980 --> 03:27:33.900]   in a certain kind of way,
[03:27:33.900 --> 03:27:36.700]   like where do you put the blame?
[03:27:36.700 --> 03:27:40.700]   Do you put the blame on the way things are operating
[03:27:40.700 --> 03:27:44.420]   onto the individuals or onto the system itself,
[03:27:44.420 --> 03:27:46.940]   the idea behind the system?
[03:27:46.940 --> 03:27:50.820]   Where, and is it useful to place the blame somewhere?
[03:27:50.820 --> 03:27:53.340]   'Cause for me, it might be useful to understand that
[03:27:53.340 --> 03:27:57.060]   in order to figure out what the solution is.
[03:27:57.060 --> 03:27:59.820]   I tend to not put the blame on the individual.
[03:27:59.820 --> 03:28:02.460]   Like I tend to believe most people are good
[03:28:02.460 --> 03:28:04.320]   and want to see themselves as good.
[03:28:04.320 --> 03:28:07.780]   And so in that case, it's very difficult
[03:28:07.780 --> 03:28:11.140]   to be truly malevolent as you would need to be to control,
[03:28:11.140 --> 03:28:13.900]   to gain centralized power at the large scale.
[03:28:13.900 --> 03:28:18.180]   But I know a lot of conspiracy theorists
[03:28:18.180 --> 03:28:22.700]   and just a lot of people think that there is evil,
[03:28:22.700 --> 03:28:26.700]   humans in the world that seek power, maintain that power,
[03:28:26.700 --> 03:28:28.880]   and they use that power for bad purposes.
[03:28:29.640 --> 03:28:32.320]   I think they're just people
[03:28:32.320 --> 03:28:34.400]   and they're just trying to get something for nothing
[03:28:34.400 --> 03:28:35.440]   like all of us do.
[03:28:35.440 --> 03:28:38.800]   - I like this framework of thought that you have.
[03:28:38.800 --> 03:28:42.120]   - Honestly, and that's what the central bank is,
[03:28:42.120 --> 03:28:44.960]   is the ultimate institution to get something for nothing.
[03:28:44.960 --> 03:28:49.680]   You get a perpetual income stream,
[03:28:49.680 --> 03:28:53.240]   the ability to acquire more and more territory in the world
[03:28:53.240 --> 03:28:56.480]   through monopolizing the supply of money,
[03:28:57.400 --> 03:29:00.040]   and you can literally print money.
[03:29:00.040 --> 03:29:02.040]   You can buy your way out of anything
[03:29:02.040 --> 03:29:04.500]   and buy your way into anything in the world.
[03:29:04.500 --> 03:29:06.920]   So it is, I think the most,
[03:29:06.920 --> 03:29:09.600]   I'd say the most,
[03:29:09.600 --> 03:29:11.540]   but a group of very intelligent people
[03:29:11.540 --> 03:29:13.480]   put this thing together and figured out
[03:29:13.480 --> 03:29:15.720]   how to get something for nothing in perpetuity
[03:29:15.720 --> 03:29:21.260]   by clouding people's conception of money.
[03:29:21.260 --> 03:29:24.800]   And if we look at the central bank,
[03:29:24.800 --> 03:29:25.680]   it's been around for a while,
[03:29:25.680 --> 03:29:29.440]   but the latest implementation here in the US is the Fed.
[03:29:29.440 --> 03:29:30.560]   It's about a hundred years old.
[03:29:30.560 --> 03:29:34.240]   It's an analog age institution that I think has lost
[03:29:34.240 --> 03:29:37.920]   a lot of its relevance in the modern age.
[03:29:37.920 --> 03:29:40.160]   And I don't think it will survive
[03:29:40.160 --> 03:29:43.040]   the ever galvanizing gaze of the digital age.
[03:29:43.040 --> 03:29:46.680]   There's just too much sunlight, too much transparency.
[03:29:46.680 --> 03:29:49.400]   Today, ideas move too quickly for something like this
[03:29:49.400 --> 03:29:51.320]   to remain relevant.
[03:29:51.320 --> 03:29:53.960]   But there are just people,
[03:29:53.960 --> 03:29:55.760]   they are just seeking something for nothing.
[03:29:55.760 --> 03:29:58.240]   But I think when you concentrate that much power
[03:29:58.240 --> 03:29:59.440]   and that much control,
[03:29:59.440 --> 03:30:02.360]   that much wealth into the hands of few,
[03:30:02.360 --> 03:30:05.000]   it does change.
[03:30:05.000 --> 03:30:07.780]   Hayek argued that the nature of power,
[03:30:07.780 --> 03:30:11.560]   again, it's something that we all sort of desire.
[03:30:11.560 --> 03:30:14.080]   To be completely powerless, you're really unhappy.
[03:30:14.080 --> 03:30:16.340]   If you're totally powerless, you're a slave.
[03:30:16.340 --> 03:30:17.680]   Someone else tells you what to do.
[03:30:17.680 --> 03:30:19.000]   You have no autonomy.
[03:30:19.000 --> 03:30:19.880]   It's miserable.
[03:30:21.880 --> 03:30:24.600]   It makes the consolidation of power alluring
[03:30:24.600 --> 03:30:25.920]   and that we want to protect ourselves
[03:30:25.920 --> 03:30:28.400]   from that slave state, let's say.
[03:30:28.400 --> 03:30:30.760]   But like many things, it can be taken too far.
[03:30:30.760 --> 03:30:35.520]   And when you concentrate power into too few hands,
[03:30:35.520 --> 03:30:38.520]   Hayek argues that it actually transforms.
[03:30:38.520 --> 03:30:41.080]   It becomes something much more intoxicating
[03:30:41.080 --> 03:30:44.360]   than it would be if it was held in a more distributed way.
[03:30:44.360 --> 03:30:47.440]   And I think that gets into a lot of these,
[03:30:47.440 --> 03:30:50.240]   I don't know if they call themselves elites
[03:30:50.240 --> 03:30:51.760]   or people call them elites or whatever,
[03:30:51.760 --> 03:30:54.960]   like let's say shareholders of central banks,
[03:30:54.960 --> 03:30:56.800]   people participating in the World Economic Forum,
[03:30:56.800 --> 03:30:57.780]   things like this.
[03:30:57.780 --> 03:31:01.740]   They come, I guess the incentives, right?
[03:31:01.740 --> 03:31:04.800]   The incentive schema they're in is rewarding them
[03:31:04.800 --> 03:31:06.720]   constantly, telling them everything they're doing,
[03:31:06.720 --> 03:31:08.040]   saying and thinking is correct
[03:31:08.040 --> 03:31:10.920]   'cause they just keep getting richer all the time.
[03:31:10.920 --> 03:31:15.160]   And it leads you closer to this definition of evil,
[03:31:15.160 --> 03:31:19.240]   which in the book "Paradise Lost,"
[03:31:19.240 --> 03:31:20.920]   Friedman said, "Evil is the force
[03:31:20.920 --> 03:31:23.720]   which believes its knowledge is complete."
[03:31:23.720 --> 03:31:27.360]   So these people become more and more convinced
[03:31:27.360 --> 03:31:32.160]   that they have the plan or they have the course of action
[03:31:32.160 --> 03:31:33.240]   that will save the world,
[03:31:33.240 --> 03:31:35.600]   that if everyone would just listen to them,
[03:31:35.600 --> 03:31:37.960]   that they would lead us to the promised land, right?
[03:31:37.960 --> 03:31:41.120]   Whether this is Bill Gates saving us from a climate crisis
[03:31:41.120 --> 03:31:44.520]   or any of these other economic policies
[03:31:44.520 --> 03:31:46.380]   that are targeted at a certain outcome,
[03:31:46.380 --> 03:31:49.280]   but almost always diverge almost perfectly
[03:31:49.280 --> 03:31:51.680]   from that outcome, creating its opposite effect.
[03:31:51.680 --> 03:31:55.600]   I think that's the problem,
[03:31:55.600 --> 03:31:58.720]   that we have this mechanism that can concentrate wealth
[03:31:58.720 --> 03:32:01.440]   and power into the hands of so few
[03:32:01.440 --> 03:32:04.420]   that it leads to the proliferation of evil,
[03:32:04.420 --> 03:32:06.960]   meaning that it convinces people
[03:32:06.960 --> 03:32:08.280]   that their knowledge is complete.
[03:32:08.280 --> 03:32:12.760]   Whereas something like a Bitcoin
[03:32:12.760 --> 03:32:14.640]   almost forces the opposite outcome.
[03:32:17.480 --> 03:32:22.240]   In a Bitcoin-denominated world, a pure free market,
[03:32:22.240 --> 03:32:24.480]   the consumer is sovereign.
[03:32:24.480 --> 03:32:28.000]   So you cannot earn value in the world
[03:32:28.000 --> 03:32:30.520]   unless you are serving your fellow man,
[03:32:30.520 --> 03:32:33.280]   unless they have expressed
[03:32:33.280 --> 03:32:35.600]   through their buy and sell decisions in the marketplace,
[03:32:35.600 --> 03:32:39.560]   right, you've created a satisfaction of a particular want
[03:32:39.560 --> 03:32:41.520]   that they value so much,
[03:32:41.520 --> 03:32:43.160]   they've acquired so much of your good or service
[03:32:43.160 --> 03:32:45.180]   that you've become rich.
[03:32:45.180 --> 03:32:47.180]   You can only maintain that position of wealth
[03:32:47.180 --> 03:32:49.960]   so long as you continue to serve your fellow man.
[03:32:49.960 --> 03:32:54.240]   So it changes the incentives such that dominance
[03:32:54.240 --> 03:32:59.080]   in the world can no longer be paired with coercion,
[03:32:59.080 --> 03:33:01.640]   it has to be paired with competence.
[03:33:01.640 --> 03:33:05.460]   And that's how this, when we say Bitcoin fixes this,
[03:33:05.460 --> 03:33:06.300]   that's what we mean.
[03:33:06.300 --> 03:33:09.320]   Like it restores that skin in the game,
[03:33:09.320 --> 03:33:11.360]   that balance of incentives and disincentives
[03:33:11.360 --> 03:33:13.920]   that help us properly navigate reality.
[03:33:13.920 --> 03:33:17.300]   And it prevents the buildup of systemic rot
[03:33:17.300 --> 03:33:19.100]   like we see with the central bank.
[03:33:19.100 --> 03:33:23.140]   - What books, people love this question,
[03:33:23.140 --> 03:33:25.820]   and you're exceptionally well-read,
[03:33:25.820 --> 03:33:28.220]   you've explored all kinds of ideas.
[03:33:28.220 --> 03:33:31.960]   Is there some books, technical, fiction, philosophical,
[03:33:31.960 --> 03:33:34.380]   coloring books, children's books,
[03:33:34.380 --> 03:33:35.680]   had an impact on your life
[03:33:35.680 --> 03:33:38.740]   and you would maybe recommend to others
[03:33:38.740 --> 03:33:39.840]   that they should read?
[03:33:39.840 --> 03:33:43.160]   - I think we mentioned a couple of them here today,
[03:33:43.160 --> 03:33:47.780]   but I think a really useful triplet of books
[03:33:47.780 --> 03:33:50.980]   that I've been recommending recently
[03:33:50.980 --> 03:33:56.100]   to help diffuse this materialist worldview of reality,
[03:33:56.100 --> 03:33:58.900]   where we still think in kind of the Newtonian model
[03:33:58.900 --> 03:34:01.220]   that it's atoms and cause and effect.
[03:34:01.220 --> 03:34:05.100]   I'd first recommend Jordan Peterson's book,
[03:34:05.100 --> 03:34:06.280]   "Maps of Meaning."
[03:34:06.280 --> 03:34:11.240]   It's a deep dive into mythology
[03:34:11.240 --> 03:34:14.300]   and how it's developed over the course of history
[03:34:14.300 --> 03:34:17.260]   and how it's reflected both in our social structures
[03:34:17.260 --> 03:34:21.340]   and our intra-psychic nature really,
[03:34:21.340 --> 03:34:23.300]   and how they come to reflect one another in a way,
[03:34:23.300 --> 03:34:25.780]   like the way we think again, shapes the world,
[03:34:25.780 --> 03:34:26.940]   and then the way the world is shaped,
[03:34:26.940 --> 03:34:28.140]   shapes the way we think.
[03:34:28.140 --> 03:34:30.780]   That's an excellent book.
[03:34:30.780 --> 03:34:33.500]   It's very dense and difficult read.
[03:34:33.500 --> 03:34:35.340]   Actually, this trilogy is pretty brutal,
[03:34:35.340 --> 03:34:38.500]   probably take you a year to read, hours a day.
[03:34:39.380 --> 03:34:41.400]   The second one I mentioned earlier was "Human Action"
[03:34:41.400 --> 03:34:42.380]   by Mises.
[03:34:42.380 --> 03:34:46.520]   The ultimate tome on Austrian economics
[03:34:46.520 --> 03:34:50.200]   will help explicate this realm of relevance,
[03:34:50.200 --> 03:34:52.120]   I think, that economics truly is,
[03:34:52.120 --> 03:34:56.960]   where, again, there are things,
[03:34:56.960 --> 03:35:00.040]   and then these things become means or ends
[03:35:00.040 --> 03:35:03.160]   once we channel our purpose through them.
[03:35:03.160 --> 03:35:07.480]   So this realm of non-materialist relevance
[03:35:07.480 --> 03:35:10.440]   that I think's really important to grasping economics
[03:35:10.440 --> 03:35:11.680]   at a first principles level,
[03:35:11.680 --> 03:35:14.000]   I think that book lays it out tremendously.
[03:35:14.000 --> 03:35:16.440]   And then the last one would be,
[03:35:16.440 --> 03:35:17.520]   I think I mentioned this at the beginning,
[03:35:17.520 --> 03:35:19.900]   was that book "Lila" by Robert Persig,
[03:35:19.900 --> 03:35:23.760]   where he's making the case that value is fundamental.
[03:35:23.760 --> 03:35:25.600]   And all of these books,
[03:35:25.600 --> 03:35:27.520]   they kind of all point to that, actually.
[03:35:27.520 --> 03:35:31.080]   They're pointing back to value being the fundamental thing,
[03:35:31.080 --> 03:35:35.300]   values expressed through moral action
[03:35:35.300 --> 03:35:37.940]   as being the fundamental substrate of reality.
[03:35:37.940 --> 03:35:40.140]   So it'll, if you're like me,
[03:35:40.140 --> 03:35:42.060]   I grew up quite scientific-minded,
[03:35:42.060 --> 03:35:43.340]   it'll help diffuse some of that
[03:35:43.340 --> 03:35:45.900]   and maybe retrain you to the other side of reality.
[03:35:45.900 --> 03:35:49.220]   - So you said these books are difficult.
[03:35:49.220 --> 03:35:52.780]   Maybe you can comment on which aspect is difficult.
[03:35:52.780 --> 03:35:54.380]   Is it just the technical nature?
[03:35:54.380 --> 03:35:55.340]   Is it the length?
[03:35:55.340 --> 03:35:56.860]   Is it the depth of the ideas
[03:35:56.860 --> 03:35:58.900]   or how long it takes to integrate them?
[03:35:58.900 --> 03:36:01.740]   And more, sort of importantly,
[03:36:01.740 --> 03:36:04.200]   is there recommendation, advice you can give
[03:36:04.200 --> 03:36:09.200]   on how to integrate these ideas,
[03:36:09.200 --> 03:36:13.820]   how to read, how to learn in the spaces
[03:36:13.820 --> 03:36:15.180]   from your own life?
[03:36:15.180 --> 03:36:17.020]   Like, how do you enjoy taking in ideas?
[03:36:17.020 --> 03:36:18.180]   And this could be for these books,
[03:36:18.180 --> 03:36:21.140]   but also in the Bitcoin world
[03:36:21.140 --> 03:36:24.540]   and reading a bunch of different ideas written by others,
[03:36:24.540 --> 03:36:26.000]   just integrating stuff,
[03:36:26.000 --> 03:36:29.660]   even watching podcasts and all those kinds of things.
[03:36:29.660 --> 03:36:31.440]   - Yeah, I'm a reader.
[03:36:31.440 --> 03:36:32.480]   I love to read.
[03:36:33.740 --> 03:36:35.980]   One of the most useful things I've ever done
[03:36:35.980 --> 03:36:37.700]   was take a speed reading course.
[03:36:37.700 --> 03:36:40.120]   I actually think there's a version of this
[03:36:40.120 --> 03:36:41.660]   available on Tim Ferriss' website.
[03:36:41.660 --> 03:36:44.280]   It's like a 30-minute speed reading course.
[03:36:44.280 --> 03:36:45.740]   It's all about eye movement.
[03:36:45.740 --> 03:36:47.920]   Instead of moving your eye continuously,
[03:36:47.920 --> 03:36:50.580]   line over line, it's more about jumping in your brain.
[03:36:50.580 --> 03:36:53.560]   You can train your brain to just absorb words
[03:36:53.560 --> 03:36:56.940]   in their totality versus kind of reading word by word.
[03:36:56.940 --> 03:36:57.940]   - And also not,
[03:36:57.940 --> 03:37:00.800]   I haven't fully taken that journey actually,
[03:37:00.800 --> 03:37:05.420]   but I remember taking a few steps on that journey,
[03:37:05.420 --> 03:37:09.140]   realizing that I'm speaking inside my head.
[03:37:09.140 --> 03:37:10.860]   I'm saying the words inside my head
[03:37:10.860 --> 03:37:12.220]   and that's actually getting in the way.
[03:37:12.220 --> 03:37:13.040]   - That's right.
[03:37:13.040 --> 03:37:15.100]   - So there's a lot of little hacks like that.
[03:37:15.100 --> 03:37:17.100]   I may be lazily, I'll have to,
[03:37:17.100 --> 03:37:19.340]   now that you mentioned, I'll have to revisit this.
[03:37:19.340 --> 03:37:21.900]   But I have convinced myself
[03:37:21.900 --> 03:37:23.700]   that I don't need to read faster
[03:37:23.700 --> 03:37:25.440]   because that's not ultimately the bottleneck.
[03:37:25.440 --> 03:37:28.340]   The bottleneck is in the me thinking about stuff.
[03:37:28.340 --> 03:37:30.460]   In fact, I like reading really slowly
[03:37:30.460 --> 03:37:31.900]   or so I convinced myself.
[03:37:31.900 --> 03:37:35.520]   Because ultimately it's not about gaining more information.
[03:37:35.520 --> 03:37:39.240]   It's about time spent thinking deeply.
[03:37:39.240 --> 03:37:40.320]   - Yes.
[03:37:40.320 --> 03:37:43.280]   - But maybe that's just me being very lazy
[03:37:43.280 --> 03:37:44.200]   'cause yes, it's true.
[03:37:44.200 --> 03:37:45.460]   It's important to think deeply,
[03:37:45.460 --> 03:37:49.340]   but maybe I could speed up the consumption of information.
[03:37:49.340 --> 03:37:50.180]   - It's fine.
[03:37:50.180 --> 03:37:51.860]   I like to be dynamic actually.
[03:37:51.860 --> 03:37:55.320]   So usually speed reading initially
[03:37:55.320 --> 03:37:58.400]   and that diffused that internal dialogue for me.
[03:37:58.400 --> 03:37:59.720]   'Cause when I was reading one word at a time,
[03:37:59.720 --> 03:38:00.560]   I was having that too.
[03:38:00.560 --> 03:38:02.240]   You almost get a feedback in your own head.
[03:38:02.240 --> 03:38:03.280]   You're reading the word out loud
[03:38:03.280 --> 03:38:04.680]   and it's clouding your thoughts.
[03:38:04.680 --> 03:38:06.600]   If you're speed reading, you can't do that.
[03:38:06.600 --> 03:38:08.700]   You're just, you're taking in groups of words at a time
[03:38:08.700 --> 03:38:13.120]   so you can't internally verbalize it, I guess.
[03:38:13.120 --> 03:38:15.600]   And then I also am really big on annotating,
[03:38:15.600 --> 03:38:17.780]   underlining, writing in the margins.
[03:38:17.780 --> 03:38:20.040]   I prefer a physical book,
[03:38:20.040 --> 03:38:21.480]   but I also read the Kindle a lot
[03:38:21.480 --> 03:38:23.140]   'cause it's just so convenient.
[03:38:23.140 --> 03:38:24.300]   Anywhere you're waiting in line
[03:38:24.300 --> 03:38:27.100]   or every night before bed, I'm reading my Kindle.
[03:38:27.100 --> 03:38:30.140]   And I also advocate rereading a lot.
[03:38:30.140 --> 03:38:34.620]   So if you found something that struck you at a deep level,
[03:38:34.620 --> 03:38:36.100]   you found particularly fascinating,
[03:38:36.100 --> 03:38:37.540]   like you have to listen to that.
[03:38:37.540 --> 03:38:41.380]   That's your, I don't know, your mind or your spirit signal
[03:38:41.380 --> 03:38:43.540]   that that is something meaningful to you.
[03:38:43.540 --> 03:38:46.380]   And you should, to your point, reread it,
[03:38:46.380 --> 03:38:49.240]   sit with it for a long time, write about it.
[03:38:49.240 --> 03:38:55.820]   And that becomes the ultimate triumvirate
[03:38:55.820 --> 03:38:57.540]   of synthesizing an idea, actually.
[03:38:57.540 --> 03:39:00.980]   If you can read about it and then write about it
[03:39:00.980 --> 03:39:03.540]   and then go and talk about it,
[03:39:03.540 --> 03:39:05.680]   you get this crystallization of understanding
[03:39:05.680 --> 03:39:08.140]   that's just not possible doing any one of the three
[03:39:08.140 --> 03:39:09.340]   or any two of the three.
[03:39:09.340 --> 03:39:15.060]   So I definitely highly recommend people to do that.
[03:39:15.060 --> 03:39:18.840]   And in terms of how are those books difficult?
[03:39:18.840 --> 03:39:21.420]   I mean, in every way, they're all long books.
[03:39:22.720 --> 03:39:27.720]   In terms of density, I would say "Lila" is the least dense.
[03:39:27.720 --> 03:39:30.840]   Maybe "Maps of Meaning."
[03:39:30.840 --> 03:39:33.480]   I don't know, but "Maps of Meaning"
[03:39:33.480 --> 03:39:35.960]   and "Human Action" are both extremely dense.
[03:39:35.960 --> 03:39:40.360]   But they're just, I had to read those books very slow.
[03:39:40.360 --> 03:39:42.640]   You just have to take your time with them.
[03:39:42.640 --> 03:39:44.240]   To give you an idea with Jordan Peterson,
[03:39:44.240 --> 03:39:47.160]   he's said this a lot with "Maps of Meaning."
[03:39:47.160 --> 03:39:50.480]   He spent three hours a day writing for 15 years
[03:39:50.480 --> 03:39:51.400]   to write that book.
[03:39:51.400 --> 03:39:53.880]   It's probably, I think it's a 600 page book.
[03:39:53.880 --> 03:39:56.600]   He said he estimates he rewrote every sentence in the book
[03:39:56.600 --> 03:40:01.600]   50 times, five zero, to try and get it just perfected.
[03:40:01.600 --> 03:40:04.280]   And when you read these sentences,
[03:40:04.280 --> 03:40:07.740]   you can tell that he rewrote it 50 times.
[03:40:07.740 --> 03:40:12.700]   - I've used actually Anki for space repetition.
[03:40:12.700 --> 03:40:15.760]   It's like a piece of, it's an app.
[03:40:15.760 --> 03:40:17.240]   I'm not sure if you're familiar with it,
[03:40:17.240 --> 03:40:22.240]   but it allows you to load in facts or terms
[03:40:22.240 --> 03:40:24.440]   or entire paragraphs.
[03:40:24.440 --> 03:40:29.440]   And then it brings them, you review them every day.
[03:40:29.440 --> 03:40:33.760]   And then it brings them up less and less often over time
[03:40:33.760 --> 03:40:36.360]   as you show yourself being able to remember
[03:40:36.360 --> 03:40:39.640]   the thing that you wanted to memorize.
[03:40:39.640 --> 03:40:41.520]   And oftentimes when I'm reading,
[03:40:41.520 --> 03:40:44.280]   what I want to memorize is the key idea.
[03:40:44.280 --> 03:40:47.160]   But also I use it for, I'm terrible with names,
[03:40:47.160 --> 03:40:49.080]   so I started to use it for names too,
[03:40:49.080 --> 03:40:53.560]   of names of people, names of people that I want to remember.
[03:40:53.560 --> 03:40:56.560]   And also throughout history and also my own personal life,
[03:40:56.560 --> 03:40:57.960]   but also events.
[03:40:57.960 --> 03:41:00.200]   You know, dates to me are usually not important,
[03:41:00.200 --> 03:41:03.040]   but sometimes dates are really important.
[03:41:03.040 --> 03:41:04.440]   And so it's really useful.
[03:41:04.440 --> 03:41:05.280]   I recommend it highly.
[03:41:05.280 --> 03:41:08.680]   Naval, I think, mentioned a piece of software
[03:41:08.680 --> 03:41:11.560]   called Readwise or something like that,
[03:41:11.560 --> 03:41:14.680]   that I hope I'm saying that correctly.
[03:41:14.680 --> 03:41:16.320]   It's something like that.
[03:41:16.320 --> 03:41:18.960]   And what it does is it goes to your highlights
[03:41:18.960 --> 03:41:23.040]   from your Kindle or the various places
[03:41:23.040 --> 03:41:27.800]   where you highlight stuff that integrates with Goodreads.
[03:41:27.800 --> 03:41:30.000]   And it does the same kind of space repetition,
[03:41:30.000 --> 03:41:31.680]   but for things you've highlighted.
[03:41:31.680 --> 03:41:32.520]   - That's super cool.
[03:41:32.520 --> 03:41:34.800]   - It sends an email every day.
[03:41:34.800 --> 03:41:38.400]   It's been really, I recommend it highly
[03:41:38.400 --> 03:41:43.400]   'cause it sends like to me an email form,
[03:41:43.400 --> 03:41:45.400]   a selection of the things I've highlighted
[03:41:45.400 --> 03:41:47.120]   and previous things I've read.
[03:41:47.120 --> 03:41:52.120]   And it's like this weird, like shock to your memory
[03:41:52.120 --> 03:41:54.280]   that sprinkles, like I'll have a,
[03:41:54.280 --> 03:41:57.560]   probably way too much Orwell in there.
[03:41:57.560 --> 03:42:00.280]   And it just kind of like, it brings you back.
[03:42:00.280 --> 03:42:01.880]   And these ideas that are,
[03:42:01.880 --> 03:42:05.680]   because what you realize depending on how you highlight,
[03:42:05.680 --> 03:42:07.360]   but at least for me,
[03:42:07.360 --> 03:42:08.960]   and I think it's probably true for a lot of people,
[03:42:08.960 --> 03:42:11.440]   the things you've highlighted had at that moment
[03:42:11.440 --> 03:42:13.920]   and like an emotional impact on you.
[03:42:13.920 --> 03:42:15.480]   And so like these things are just like
[03:42:15.480 --> 03:42:17.120]   hitting you hard again.
[03:42:17.120 --> 03:42:19.560]   It's like, whoa, it might not be meaningful
[03:42:19.560 --> 03:42:20.760]   to anyone else except you.
[03:42:20.760 --> 03:42:23.280]   And it's something I recommend.
[03:42:23.280 --> 03:42:25.800]   You never know with these like hacks or tools and so on,
[03:42:25.800 --> 03:42:29.480]   like what's actually BS and what is amazing.
[03:42:29.480 --> 03:42:31.400]   And that one is kind of amazing.
[03:42:31.400 --> 03:42:34.640]   So at least for me, it works for me and Naval.
[03:42:34.640 --> 03:42:35.760]   I think he's the one.
[03:42:35.760 --> 03:42:36.920]   - Read wise you said.
[03:42:36.920 --> 03:42:39.920]   - Read wise or something close to that.
[03:42:39.920 --> 03:42:41.480]   It could be read something else,
[03:42:41.480 --> 03:42:43.680]   like read wealth or something.
[03:42:43.680 --> 03:42:46.880]   The one other thing I really like,
[03:42:46.880 --> 03:42:48.880]   and this is more of a new one is,
[03:42:48.880 --> 03:42:50.960]   I used to always listen to music at the gym,
[03:42:50.960 --> 03:42:51.800]   but now I've just,
[03:42:51.800 --> 03:42:54.640]   'cause I'm so backlogged on podcasts, right?
[03:42:54.640 --> 03:42:56.800]   There's just, there's so many.
[03:42:56.800 --> 03:42:59.840]   I exclusively listen to podcasts when I'm walking
[03:42:59.840 --> 03:43:00.680]   or when I'm at the gym,
[03:43:00.680 --> 03:43:03.860]   anytime I'm doing something that I can't read basically.
[03:43:03.860 --> 03:43:07.040]   And I think there's something really special
[03:43:07.040 --> 03:43:09.400]   about exercise and ideation.
[03:43:09.400 --> 03:43:12.400]   I mean, I don't know if this happens to everyone,
[03:43:12.400 --> 03:43:14.520]   but my creative juices just go ballistic
[03:43:14.520 --> 03:43:15.400]   when I'm at the gym.
[03:43:15.400 --> 03:43:17.560]   Like I hit a certain point of,
[03:43:17.560 --> 03:43:19.520]   I guess heart rate and you're sweating enough,
[03:43:19.520 --> 03:43:21.800]   then the ideas just start to flow.
[03:43:21.800 --> 03:43:25.480]   So I'm basically at the gym now listening to podcasts,
[03:43:25.480 --> 03:43:29.040]   exercising as fast as I can to try to get to that state of,
[03:43:29.040 --> 03:43:32.000]   where you're just straining,
[03:43:32.000 --> 03:43:34.360]   you're strenuous exercise, I guess you would say.
[03:43:34.360 --> 03:43:36.360]   And then I'm end up typing notes into my phone
[03:43:36.360 --> 03:43:39.200]   as fast as I can with all these ideas that are flowing.
[03:43:39.200 --> 03:43:42.520]   So I've created a lot of good writing out of that.
[03:43:42.520 --> 03:43:43.560]   - Yeah, it's kind of work.
[03:43:43.560 --> 03:43:46.440]   So I do running quite a bit.
[03:43:46.440 --> 03:43:50.320]   So running outside and I'll listen to,
[03:43:50.320 --> 03:43:53.160]   I've been, okay, I told myself this has been going on
[03:43:53.160 --> 03:43:58.160]   for about a year is I only listen like the stuff
[03:43:58.160 --> 03:44:01.840]   that's either World War II or World War I related.
[03:44:01.840 --> 03:44:06.840]   So Hitler, Stalin, like difficult historical stuff.
[03:44:07.600 --> 03:44:12.600]   And also listen to brown noise.
[03:44:12.600 --> 03:44:14.480]   So those are the two modes.
[03:44:14.480 --> 03:44:17.320]   So brown noise helps me,
[03:44:17.320 --> 03:44:20.080]   this is like white noise, but like deeper, I guess.
[03:44:20.080 --> 03:44:22.560]   It helps me remove the world.
[03:44:22.560 --> 03:44:24.840]   And at the gym, there's a lot of distractions.
[03:44:24.840 --> 03:44:26.600]   When you're running, there's a lot of distractions.
[03:44:26.600 --> 03:44:27.680]   It helps me remove the world.
[03:44:27.680 --> 03:44:32.400]   So one, I'll be listening to difficult historical ideas.
[03:44:32.400 --> 03:44:34.280]   And then when my mind is all of a sudden
[03:44:34.280 --> 03:44:36.480]   starting to generate ideas,
[03:44:36.480 --> 03:44:40.080]   I'll listen to brown noise and force myself to think.
[03:44:40.080 --> 03:44:44.400]   It's kind of, it's meditative in a sense.
[03:44:44.400 --> 03:44:46.440]   And your mind wants to be lazy.
[03:44:46.440 --> 03:44:51.440]   You want to, it's hard, man, like running and thinking
[03:44:51.440 --> 03:44:53.720]   in the sense that some of the ideas
[03:44:53.720 --> 03:44:56.240]   that come into your head are pretty heavy.
[03:44:56.240 --> 03:44:57.400]   It's about your own life.
[03:44:57.400 --> 03:44:59.580]   It's your own demons come in there,
[03:44:59.580 --> 03:45:01.600]   but also just difficult ideas
[03:45:01.600 --> 03:45:02.940]   that require you thinking through
[03:45:02.940 --> 03:45:05.440]   and persevering through that,
[03:45:05.440 --> 03:45:07.160]   like not letting yourself get lazy
[03:45:07.160 --> 03:45:09.560]   and like thinking through it has been really,
[03:45:09.560 --> 03:45:11.080]   for me, rewarding in the same way
[03:45:11.080 --> 03:45:13.960]   that you're saying it is for you.
[03:45:13.960 --> 03:45:16.840]   It's true that like podcasts and music,
[03:45:16.840 --> 03:45:20.960]   like shallow, like funny podcasts or music
[03:45:20.960 --> 03:45:23.400]   have been a kind of filler distraction.
[03:45:23.400 --> 03:45:26.440]   But informational podcasts,
[03:45:26.440 --> 03:45:29.400]   like podcasts that have some depths of ideas
[03:45:29.400 --> 03:45:32.680]   or audio books have been truly rewarding.
[03:45:32.680 --> 03:45:35.000]   I try to listen now less and less to podcasts
[03:45:35.000 --> 03:45:35.920]   that are just fun.
[03:45:35.920 --> 03:45:39.680]   'Cause I feel like I enjoy it too much
[03:45:39.680 --> 03:45:41.920]   and I don't allow my mind to get bored
[03:45:41.920 --> 03:45:45.040]   and to think through stuff, to explore ideas.
[03:45:45.040 --> 03:45:48.240]   It's so easy to fill the space
[03:45:48.240 --> 03:45:52.760]   that usually would be filled with thought
[03:45:52.760 --> 03:45:55.720]   and instead fill it with fun podcasts.
[03:45:55.720 --> 03:45:58.320]   Like there's a bunch of comedy podcasts I really enjoy.
[03:45:58.320 --> 03:46:00.320]   So there's value to that, of course,
[03:46:00.320 --> 03:46:02.080]   but you have to realize it's entertainment.
[03:46:02.080 --> 03:46:07.080]   It's not, you don't get much value except entertainment.
[03:46:07.080 --> 03:46:08.200]   - Right, right.
[03:46:08.200 --> 03:46:10.920]   And there's utility to the boredom too, I think.
[03:46:10.920 --> 03:46:15.440]   To give your mind the space,
[03:46:15.440 --> 03:46:17.320]   I guess your subconscious maybe the space
[03:46:17.320 --> 03:46:19.160]   to chew on some of these problems, right?
[03:46:19.160 --> 03:46:21.800]   Where you've imbibed so much knowledge,
[03:46:21.800 --> 03:46:23.480]   you've highlighted and thought about something,
[03:46:23.480 --> 03:46:25.760]   but then you need to stop thinking about it for a while
[03:46:25.760 --> 03:46:27.960]   and let it marinate in the subconscious.
[03:46:27.960 --> 03:46:30.920]   And then these flashes of insight
[03:46:30.920 --> 03:46:32.120]   that people have described,
[03:46:32.120 --> 03:46:33.480]   sometimes I get them in the middle of the night,
[03:46:33.480 --> 03:46:35.040]   like I just wake up from a dream and have them
[03:46:35.040 --> 03:46:35.920]   and I got to write it down.
[03:46:35.920 --> 03:46:38.800]   Or sometimes it's in nature, taking a walk.
[03:46:38.800 --> 03:46:40.480]   But I think that's very important too.
[03:46:40.480 --> 03:46:43.920]   We can't just brute force our way into understanding.
[03:46:43.920 --> 03:46:45.560]   You know, there's this interplay
[03:46:45.560 --> 03:46:47.720]   between kind of the brute force reading intake
[03:46:47.720 --> 03:46:51.260]   and then just relaxing, meditating, sleeping, being bored,
[03:46:51.260 --> 03:46:56.160]   letting your subconscious do the heavy lifting.
[03:46:56.160 --> 03:46:59.240]   - And there's, you should be aware of the fact
[03:46:59.240 --> 03:47:01.160]   that there's a war for your attention going on.
[03:47:01.160 --> 03:47:04.320]   So there's a lot of, there's been better and better
[03:47:04.320 --> 03:47:06.540]   and better mechanisms that are designed
[03:47:06.540 --> 03:47:08.520]   to steal your attention.
[03:47:08.520 --> 03:47:10.860]   So I kind of see it as a war zone
[03:47:10.860 --> 03:47:14.120]   between my right for boredom
[03:47:14.120 --> 03:47:17.280]   and the internet wanting your attention.
[03:47:17.280 --> 03:47:22.000]   In fact, Clubhouse as an app has been,
[03:47:22.000 --> 03:47:24.600]   I'm probably not gonna use Clubhouse much anymore.
[03:47:24.600 --> 03:47:27.780]   There's some aspect of my own inner loneliness
[03:47:27.780 --> 03:47:31.120]   and whatever it is that pulled me into Clubhouse
[03:47:31.120 --> 03:47:33.480]   a little bit too much to where it robbed me
[03:47:33.480 --> 03:47:36.400]   from that lonely time alone,
[03:47:36.400 --> 03:47:38.080]   where I sit and listen to Bruce Springsteen
[03:47:38.080 --> 03:47:39.640]   and think about life.
[03:47:39.640 --> 03:47:40.660]   So I wanna-
[03:47:40.660 --> 03:47:41.840]   - That's way more important.
[03:47:41.840 --> 03:47:43.600]   - It's way more, well, yeah, at least, you know,
[03:47:43.600 --> 03:47:44.520]   it's all in balance.
[03:47:44.520 --> 03:47:46.860]   'Cause there is a Clubhouse,
[03:47:46.860 --> 03:47:48.760]   like a lot of these social networks when you use, right,
[03:47:48.760 --> 03:47:52.160]   can be a way to discover new ideas, new people.
[03:47:52.160 --> 03:47:55.160]   But the boredom is just being alone
[03:47:55.160 --> 03:47:57.280]   with your thoughts is priceless.
[03:47:57.280 --> 03:47:58.120]   - Absolutely.
[03:47:58.120 --> 03:47:59.480]   And you gotta know yourself, right?
[03:47:59.480 --> 03:48:02.720]   Like it took me a long time to realize I need solitude.
[03:48:02.720 --> 03:48:03.560]   - Yeah.
[03:48:03.560 --> 03:48:05.280]   - Like just how I'm wired, how I'm built.
[03:48:05.280 --> 03:48:07.360]   I need like an hour a day solitude.
[03:48:07.360 --> 03:48:08.820]   So you gotta listen to that part of yourself.
[03:48:08.820 --> 03:48:11.700]   You might be compromising something like that
[03:48:11.700 --> 03:48:12.920]   where you feel like you always need to be
[03:48:12.920 --> 03:48:14.520]   with your girlfriend or whatever it may be.
[03:48:14.520 --> 03:48:18.120]   But I would suggest listening to that voice.
[03:48:18.120 --> 03:48:20.840]   - Yeah, I try to remember things
[03:48:20.840 --> 03:48:23.020]   that made me feel good over time,
[03:48:23.020 --> 03:48:25.380]   like long-term had positive impact
[03:48:25.380 --> 03:48:27.700]   and long-term had negative impact
[03:48:27.700 --> 03:48:31.120]   and do more of the former and less of the latter.
[03:48:31.120 --> 03:48:33.160]   We don't often think like that.
[03:48:33.160 --> 03:48:35.560]   You know, we talked offline about like carnivore diets,
[03:48:35.560 --> 03:48:36.400]   for example.
[03:48:36.400 --> 03:48:40.700]   I try to remember that carbs don't make me feel good.
[03:48:40.700 --> 03:48:41.980]   - Yeah.
[03:48:41.980 --> 03:48:45.020]   - In the moment, it's hard to remember that.
[03:48:45.020 --> 03:48:47.940]   But you have to remember that that's the case.
[03:48:47.940 --> 03:48:51.900]   And in the same way, exercise,
[03:48:51.900 --> 03:48:54.920]   it's hard to remember that exercise makes me feel good.
[03:48:54.920 --> 03:48:57.040]   Like-
[03:48:57.040 --> 03:48:58.020]   - Especially when it's time to go to the gym.
[03:48:58.020 --> 03:48:59.380]   - Especially when it's time to go to the gym.
[03:48:59.380 --> 03:49:00.580]   But you should remember that
[03:49:00.580 --> 03:49:03.860]   because the kind of person you are without exercise,
[03:49:03.860 --> 03:49:06.380]   for me, just like he's beautifully said,
[03:49:06.380 --> 03:49:07.440]   that you have to know yourself.
[03:49:07.440 --> 03:49:10.580]   The kind of person I am without exercise
[03:49:10.580 --> 03:49:15.580]   is a less good person, a person I'm less proud of.
[03:49:15.580 --> 03:49:16.900]   - The food thing is so hard.
[03:49:16.900 --> 03:49:19.840]   By the way, I still, you know,
[03:49:19.840 --> 03:49:21.860]   I can't tell you how many times I've learned the lesson.
[03:49:21.860 --> 03:49:23.540]   Like, don't eat that.
[03:49:23.540 --> 03:49:25.180]   But then, you know, you go a few weeks
[03:49:25.180 --> 03:49:26.980]   of not eating whatever that is,
[03:49:26.980 --> 03:49:28.300]   and you're feeling good.
[03:49:28.300 --> 03:49:29.860]   And then you're, I don't know,
[03:49:29.860 --> 03:49:30.900]   something creeps up inside you.
[03:49:30.900 --> 03:49:32.220]   Like, ah, you could just have one,
[03:49:32.220 --> 03:49:33.100]   or you could just do this.
[03:49:33.100 --> 03:49:34.160]   But for me, it's sugar.
[03:49:34.160 --> 03:49:36.880]   Like, sugar just makes me feel terrible.
[03:49:36.880 --> 03:49:40.060]   But I always, not always, but if it's been a long time,
[03:49:40.060 --> 03:49:41.540]   I start to make that exception in my mind.
[03:49:41.540 --> 03:49:42.980]   Like, oh, you can have a little bit.
[03:49:42.980 --> 03:49:44.140]   And then I eat it and I feel terrible.
[03:49:44.140 --> 03:49:45.900]   So I don't know how many times I've done that dance,
[03:49:45.900 --> 03:49:47.420]   but it's not cool.
[03:49:47.420 --> 03:49:48.780]   - Well, it depends on how painful it is,
[03:49:48.780 --> 03:49:49.940]   and then you learn the lesson.
[03:49:49.940 --> 03:49:51.820]   I actually embrace the fact
[03:49:51.820 --> 03:49:54.560]   that I'll never learn the lesson with vodka.
[03:49:54.560 --> 03:49:57.740]   Every time I drink, especially with Russians,
[03:49:57.740 --> 03:50:00.260]   is like, I quit drinking every time.
[03:50:00.260 --> 03:50:01.380]   And then I forget.
[03:50:01.380 --> 03:50:02.900]   There's like a slow drop off.
[03:50:02.900 --> 03:50:04.980]   It'll be like two weeks, and then.
[03:50:04.980 --> 03:50:05.820]   - Na zdorovie.
[03:50:05.820 --> 03:50:06.660]   - Na zdorovie.
[03:50:06.660 --> 03:50:07.500]   (laughing)
[03:50:07.500 --> 03:50:08.540]   Very good.
[03:50:08.540 --> 03:50:12.020]   So it never makes me feel good.
[03:50:12.020 --> 03:50:13.880]   It never results in anything good,
[03:50:13.880 --> 03:50:19.660]   except the beautiful social chaos.
[03:50:19.660 --> 03:50:20.500]   - Yeah.
[03:50:20.500 --> 03:50:23.980]   - Which is ultimately somehow, there's value to chaos too.
[03:50:23.980 --> 03:50:24.820]   - Yes.
[03:50:24.820 --> 03:50:25.740]   - There's value to that.
[03:50:25.740 --> 03:50:29.100]   Whatever the hell stupid stuff you do when you get trashed,
[03:50:29.100 --> 03:50:32.820]   the over the top emotion of love usually,
[03:50:32.820 --> 03:50:36.140]   or whatever, camaraderie, there's value to that too.
[03:50:36.140 --> 03:50:39.580]   Like, as I get older, I realize,
[03:50:39.580 --> 03:50:44.380]   'cause the world, sometimes, especially when you get older
[03:50:44.380 --> 03:50:46.340]   and the world wants you to be an adult,
[03:50:46.340 --> 03:50:49.420]   in order to maintain the youthful spirit,
[03:50:49.420 --> 03:50:51.420]   you have to use all the tools you can.
[03:50:51.420 --> 03:50:52.260]   - Yeah.
[03:50:52.260 --> 03:50:53.080]   - And alcohol is one of them.
[03:50:53.080 --> 03:50:53.920]   - Right.
[03:50:53.920 --> 03:50:55.500]   - To do all the stupid shit you can,
[03:50:55.500 --> 03:50:57.900]   even if you're like getting older.
[03:50:57.900 --> 03:50:59.340]   - To lower the inhibitions.
[03:50:59.340 --> 03:51:00.180]   - Lower the inhibitions.
[03:51:00.180 --> 03:51:01.900]   - Against that taste of uncertainty
[03:51:01.900 --> 03:51:03.420]   that is the sweetness of life, right?
[03:51:03.420 --> 03:51:06.500]   To be able to go out and be a flaneur at a party
[03:51:06.500 --> 03:51:08.140]   and not really know what you're gonna do.
[03:51:08.140 --> 03:51:12.780]   And we have this draw to the wild side of life.
[03:51:12.780 --> 03:51:15.380]   As much as we try and build up order around ourselves,
[03:51:15.380 --> 03:51:18.520]   I think there's always gonna be an appetite for that.
[03:51:18.520 --> 03:51:21.060]   I've always, most of my life,
[03:51:21.060 --> 03:51:22.980]   I've always been a social drinker,
[03:51:22.980 --> 03:51:25.220]   but I actually gave up alcohol a year ago.
[03:51:25.220 --> 03:51:29.360]   And I would add that to the idea,
[03:51:29.360 --> 03:51:33.140]   the repertoire for dealing with bigger ideas.
[03:51:33.140 --> 03:51:37.700]   Because alcohol's fun, it's a good times,
[03:51:37.700 --> 03:51:42.260]   it can be analgesic, it can give you all these benefits
[03:51:42.260 --> 03:51:43.820]   if you use the right amounts.
[03:51:43.820 --> 03:51:46.500]   But I got to the point, personally,
[03:51:46.500 --> 03:51:48.380]   where I was trying to wrestle with these ideas
[03:51:48.380 --> 03:51:50.240]   that are just so much bigger than me.
[03:51:50.240 --> 03:51:52.360]   And I have this backlog of books
[03:51:52.360 --> 03:51:55.120]   that was growing faster than I could read them,
[03:51:55.120 --> 03:51:57.240]   that I just reached a point where I decided
[03:51:57.240 --> 03:52:01.480]   I wanted to start making sacrifices toward attaining that.
[03:52:01.480 --> 03:52:03.360]   And alcohol was just an easy one.
[03:52:03.360 --> 03:52:08.120]   Even if you just drink socially on the weekends,
[03:52:08.120 --> 03:52:12.240]   you're probably spending five to 10 hours drinking,
[03:52:12.240 --> 03:52:13.520]   and then maybe another, what,
[03:52:13.520 --> 03:52:17.080]   five to 10 hours recovering, perhaps, on the day after.
[03:52:17.580 --> 03:52:22.580]   So it was a difficult transition initially,
[03:52:22.580 --> 03:52:25.840]   but once you get through a couple of months,
[03:52:25.840 --> 03:52:27.160]   I feel amazing without it.
[03:52:27.160 --> 03:52:28.720]   I sleep better than ever.
[03:52:28.720 --> 03:52:30.760]   My workouts are better than ever.
[03:52:30.760 --> 03:52:33.080]   I'm sharper than ever, I'm more lucid.
[03:52:33.080 --> 03:52:35.880]   So I'm not trying to be a proponent for not drinking,
[03:52:35.880 --> 03:52:36.720]   but I just want to say--
[03:52:36.720 --> 03:52:38.240]   - But you're a proponent for sacrifice in some dimensions.
[03:52:38.240 --> 03:52:40.880]   - I am a big proponent for sacrifice, yes.
[03:52:40.880 --> 03:52:43.700]   - Is there advice you would give to a young person today,
[03:52:43.700 --> 03:52:45.280]   curious about Bitcoin,
[03:52:45.280 --> 03:52:49.500]   curious about how they succeed in the world,
[03:52:49.500 --> 03:52:55.460]   or both career-wise and just in life in general?
[03:52:55.460 --> 03:52:58.380]   - I mean, the strongest piece of advice I have for,
[03:52:58.380 --> 03:53:01.120]   this is beyond just Bitcoin,
[03:53:01.120 --> 03:53:05.920]   this is you managing your own personal and financial affairs
[03:53:05.920 --> 03:53:09.940]   is that you need to invest in knowledge first.
[03:53:11.640 --> 03:53:15.700]   It's not good enough to just follow the crowd
[03:53:15.700 --> 03:53:20.040]   and buy a 60/40 portfolio and put it in a Roth IRA
[03:53:20.040 --> 03:53:22.120]   and plan on social security.
[03:53:22.120 --> 03:53:25.620]   I mean, the world's changing much faster
[03:53:25.620 --> 03:53:28.040]   than any existing institution
[03:53:28.040 --> 03:53:31.140]   is going to be able to keep up with.
[03:53:31.140 --> 03:53:35.600]   So that's why I named the show, "The Question, What Is Money?"
[03:53:35.600 --> 03:53:38.080]   Like, I think that, to me,
[03:53:38.080 --> 03:53:40.160]   is the rabbit that took me down the rabbit hole.
[03:53:40.160 --> 03:53:42.440]   It's like just asking that question
[03:53:42.440 --> 03:53:45.040]   naturally progressed to these other questions,
[03:53:45.040 --> 03:53:47.280]   like what is value, what is government,
[03:53:47.280 --> 03:53:50.820]   what is the purpose of society, speech,
[03:53:50.820 --> 03:53:52.360]   all of these things.
[03:53:52.360 --> 03:53:57.360]   So I would encourage people to arm yourself
[03:53:57.360 --> 03:53:58.720]   with knowledge and study.
[03:53:58.720 --> 03:54:04.200]   A lot of financial people always give you a line of advice
[03:54:04.200 --> 03:54:06.000]   and then say, "This is not financial advice."
[03:54:06.000 --> 03:54:07.600]   I'm like, "This is financial advice."
[03:54:07.600 --> 03:54:10.520]   Like, study, study, learn.
[03:54:10.520 --> 03:54:13.200]   - Knowledge is power.
[03:54:13.200 --> 03:54:14.040]   - Yeah.
[03:54:14.040 --> 03:54:16.040]   - This is official financial advice.
[03:54:16.040 --> 03:54:19.120]   - And you're exercising your divine trait,
[03:54:19.120 --> 03:54:22.320]   which is the logos, right?
[03:54:22.320 --> 03:54:26.480]   That we are these animals that can tell and believe stories.
[03:54:26.480 --> 03:54:28.920]   So it feels like almost a sacred duty
[03:54:28.920 --> 03:54:31.680]   to really sharpen that part of ourselves
[03:54:31.680 --> 03:54:34.140]   and use it to create the best world possible.
[03:54:36.960 --> 03:54:39.440]   - And then the second one was the, I think,
[03:54:39.440 --> 03:54:40.720]   health and fitness stuff.
[03:54:40.720 --> 03:54:45.960]   Maybe everyone does this in their 20s.
[03:54:45.960 --> 03:54:49.400]   They just live a little fast and beat themselves up.
[03:54:49.400 --> 03:54:54.140]   Not that I wasn't, like I was living well
[03:54:54.140 --> 03:54:58.320]   and successful by a lot of measures,
[03:54:58.320 --> 03:55:00.400]   but I wish I had maybe gotten my act together
[03:55:00.400 --> 03:55:01.400]   a little bit sooner.
[03:55:01.400 --> 03:55:05.280]   I just think--
[03:55:05.280 --> 03:55:07.480]   - Fitness, morality-wise.
[03:55:07.480 --> 03:55:10.960]   - Yeah, drinking, I think morality and eating.
[03:55:10.960 --> 03:55:13.480]   You know, I just was kind of doing whatever I wanted
[03:55:13.480 --> 03:55:15.680]   in some ways, let's say.
[03:55:15.680 --> 03:55:18.040]   - Is there a value to a trajectory
[03:55:18.040 --> 03:55:19.920]   that includes a lot of mistakes?
[03:55:19.920 --> 03:55:22.600]   So maybe you're supposed to make the mistakes in your 20s.
[03:55:22.600 --> 03:55:23.440]   - That's a great point.
[03:55:23.440 --> 03:55:25.520]   - Maybe the 20s are all about the mistakes.
[03:55:25.520 --> 03:55:27.080]   Accumulate the most mistakes possible.
[03:55:27.080 --> 03:55:28.040]   - Yeah, I don't--
[03:55:28.040 --> 03:55:29.320]   - As quickly as possible.
[03:55:29.320 --> 03:55:30.680]   (laughing)
[03:55:30.680 --> 03:55:32.280]   - I don't regret any of it,
[03:55:32.280 --> 03:55:35.640]   but now that I'm kind of in this place where I feel good
[03:55:35.640 --> 03:55:37.960]   and I know the value of a good night's sleep,
[03:55:37.960 --> 03:55:42.320]   I've more deeply explored my own potential
[03:55:42.320 --> 03:55:44.200]   that I feel maybe a little regretful
[03:55:44.200 --> 03:55:46.240]   that I didn't do this earlier, is all I'm saying.
[03:55:46.240 --> 03:55:50.640]   So maybe just exploring different sides of yourself, right?
[03:55:50.640 --> 03:55:52.720]   See what it's like to go and make a bunch of mistakes
[03:55:52.720 --> 03:55:54.000]   and be wild and crazy,
[03:55:54.000 --> 03:55:55.440]   and then maybe try to walk the straight and narrow
[03:55:55.440 --> 03:55:57.680]   for a few months and just see what it's like.
[03:55:57.680 --> 03:56:02.200]   - There's probably a guy doing vodka shots right now
[03:56:02.200 --> 03:56:04.040]   listening to this podcast with his buddies,
[03:56:04.040 --> 03:56:07.600]   and if you are, please take a shot for us
[03:56:07.600 --> 03:56:11.280]   for all the mistakes you should make in your 20s.
[03:56:11.280 --> 03:56:15.620]   And what about love?
[03:56:15.620 --> 03:56:21.880]   We talked about money is ultimately a mechanism
[03:56:21.880 --> 03:56:26.880]   by which you can pave a moral path through life.
[03:56:29.640 --> 03:56:31.680]   To me, one of the purest expressions
[03:56:31.680 --> 03:56:36.040]   that is love broadly defined for a family, for others,
[03:56:36.040 --> 03:56:38.080]   for knowledge, for the world,
[03:56:38.080 --> 03:56:40.840]   is basically an optimistic open view to the world
[03:56:40.840 --> 03:56:44.800]   that embraces all that is beautiful about this world.
[03:56:44.800 --> 03:56:49.800]   So do you think about love often in a personal sense,
[03:56:49.800 --> 03:56:54.920]   romantic, family, friendship, and in the broad sense
[03:56:54.920 --> 03:56:58.400]   about its value in a successful life?
[03:56:59.400 --> 03:57:01.360]   - Yeah, of course.
[03:57:01.360 --> 03:57:04.520]   I'm blessed to have a two and a half year old daughter,
[03:57:04.520 --> 03:57:09.080]   and love is a word we throw around.
[03:57:09.080 --> 03:57:10.240]   I love these potato chips.
[03:57:10.240 --> 03:57:11.360]   I love you, man.
[03:57:11.360 --> 03:57:12.720]   I love you, my daughter.
[03:57:12.720 --> 03:57:15.520]   It's got so many different intensities,
[03:57:15.520 --> 03:57:16.560]   I guess you might say.
[03:57:16.560 --> 03:57:21.880]   I don't know, my intuition is that
[03:57:21.880 --> 03:57:27.160]   it is something very fundamental to the universe.
[03:57:27.160 --> 03:57:29.080]   Again, I know words don't do it justice,
[03:57:29.080 --> 03:57:33.240]   but if we just proxy love with selfless action,
[03:57:33.240 --> 03:57:38.360]   the whole damn universe is selflessly acting, right?
[03:57:38.360 --> 03:57:39.720]   It's just unfolding.
[03:57:39.720 --> 03:57:43.680]   And it may sound a bit hippie-dippie,
[03:57:43.680 --> 03:57:47.480]   but my intuition is just that love is the core of it somehow.
[03:57:47.480 --> 03:57:50.400]   I don't have anything to back that up, really.
[03:57:50.400 --> 03:57:51.880]   It's just...
[03:57:51.880 --> 03:57:52.960]   - In the way you're framing it,
[03:57:52.960 --> 03:57:56.600]   it's making me think that love,
[03:57:56.600 --> 03:57:59.640]   we talked about sort of meditation,
[03:57:59.640 --> 03:58:05.640]   as opposed to thinking from an egocentric perspective
[03:58:05.640 --> 03:58:08.240]   of you, the individual operating in this world,
[03:58:08.240 --> 03:58:10.960]   is allowing you to be empathetic towards the world
[03:58:10.960 --> 03:58:13.440]   and thereby think of the universe,
[03:58:13.440 --> 03:58:15.840]   think of the world acting through you,
[03:58:15.840 --> 03:58:20.680]   almost like accepting this notion that ideas have you,
[03:58:20.680 --> 03:58:21.800]   you don't have ideas.
[03:58:22.840 --> 03:58:25.280]   That you're not existing in the universe,
[03:58:25.280 --> 03:58:27.320]   the universe is existing through you.
[03:58:27.320 --> 03:58:29.960]   It's sort of like, that's what selfless
[03:58:29.960 --> 03:58:34.640]   in that context means, is embracing that thought.
[03:58:34.640 --> 03:58:36.600]   That's a weird thought.
[03:58:36.600 --> 03:58:38.160]   That's a weird thought that we're just here
[03:58:38.160 --> 03:58:40.200]   for a little bit of time.
[03:58:40.200 --> 03:58:45.160]   These meat vehicles, receptacles,
[03:58:45.160 --> 03:58:50.080]   and this much bigger thing is just using us,
[03:58:51.580 --> 03:58:55.980]   not in a malevolent way, but just like a river flows,
[03:58:55.980 --> 03:58:59.180]   is using us to create more and more beautiful things.
[03:58:59.180 --> 03:59:01.940]   - Yes, yes, more and more beautiful things.
[03:59:01.940 --> 03:59:05.480]   We are the universe experiencing itself, frankly.
[03:59:05.480 --> 03:59:08.120]   - That's a trippy thought, man.
[03:59:08.120 --> 03:59:12.220]   That in some sense, the universe created us
[03:59:12.220 --> 03:59:13.820]   to experience itself.
[03:59:13.820 --> 03:59:17.820]   - And we are one of the highest forms of beauty
[03:59:17.820 --> 03:59:19.300]   that nature has created.
[03:59:19.300 --> 03:59:23.340]   If we just think one of the most complex
[03:59:23.340 --> 03:59:26.660]   and adaptive thing, we're a reflection of nature.
[03:59:26.660 --> 03:59:30.540]   And another thing that comes to mind here is that,
[03:59:30.540 --> 03:59:33.460]   Dalio has this quote where he says,
[03:59:33.460 --> 03:59:38.220]   "Truth, or more accurately, an accurate depiction
[03:59:38.220 --> 03:59:41.320]   "of reality is necessary for any good outcome."
[03:59:41.320 --> 03:59:47.420]   So when we think that love or value is primary,
[03:59:47.420 --> 03:59:49.940]   I think that too reinforces this thesis
[03:59:49.940 --> 03:59:54.900]   that acting out of love or acting out of proper moral action,
[03:59:54.900 --> 03:59:58.360]   you're best reflecting the fundamental nature of reality.
[03:59:58.360 --> 04:00:01.060]   Therefore, you're best creating the best possible outcomes
[04:00:01.060 --> 04:00:02.260]   or the things of the most beauty,
[04:00:02.260 --> 04:00:03.960]   whether that's your artistic expression,
[04:00:03.960 --> 04:00:06.500]   your children, your business, whatever it is.
[04:00:06.500 --> 04:00:09.660]   And Jordan Peterson goes deep into that
[04:00:09.660 --> 04:00:12.660]   where you have to listen to that sense of meaning
[04:00:12.660 --> 04:00:15.300]   in your life, or you might have some decision on paper
[04:00:15.300 --> 04:00:17.320]   that's so great this way,
[04:00:17.320 --> 04:00:19.860]   but your heart says no, your heart says otherwise.
[04:00:19.860 --> 04:00:24.220]   I've tried to listen to my heart throughout
[04:00:24.220 --> 04:00:26.480]   and I think that creates the best outcomes.
[04:00:26.480 --> 04:00:30.260]   - But nevertheless, does it make you sad
[04:00:30.260 --> 04:00:34.380]   that you in particular, Robert,
[04:00:34.380 --> 04:00:36.060]   are gonna be dead pretty soon?
[04:00:36.060 --> 04:00:42.260]   We talk about scarcity, one of the certain things
[04:00:42.260 --> 04:00:45.900]   that ensure the scarcity of the human experience
[04:00:45.900 --> 04:00:48.460]   is the fact that you and your consciousness
[04:00:48.460 --> 04:00:51.460]   are gonna be done, they have a deadline.
[04:00:51.460 --> 04:00:54.300]   - Only time and Bitcoin are absolutely scarce.
[04:00:54.300 --> 04:01:01.820]   I'm fortunate that when I,
[04:01:01.820 --> 04:01:04.660]   I guess I got started on this philosophical journey
[04:01:04.660 --> 04:01:05.500]   a bit when I was younger,
[04:01:05.500 --> 04:01:09.700]   but I got into Musashi and Sun Tzu quite a bit
[04:01:09.700 --> 04:01:13.900]   who wrote, Musashi wrote the "Book of Five Rings."
[04:01:14.900 --> 04:01:17.380]   Sun Tzu wrote "The Art of War."
[04:01:17.380 --> 04:01:19.900]   And one of the things that, I mean,
[04:01:19.900 --> 04:01:22.860]   these guys were just absolute beasts.
[04:01:22.860 --> 04:01:24.380]   They lived and died by the sword
[04:01:24.380 --> 04:01:28.820]   and they were just very great equanimity
[04:01:28.820 --> 04:01:30.220]   about all things in life.
[04:01:30.220 --> 04:01:32.840]   And I also found this kind of in the Stoic philosophy
[04:01:32.840 --> 04:01:37.420]   where they just are very cool with everything.
[04:01:37.420 --> 04:01:39.380]   And one of the lines there is that,
[04:01:39.380 --> 04:01:40.500]   "The way of the warrior
[04:01:40.500 --> 04:01:42.500]   "is the resolute acceptance of death."
[04:01:43.540 --> 04:01:45.100]   And so I've always tried to think about that.
[04:01:45.100 --> 04:01:46.900]   Like, of course I experienced fear.
[04:01:46.900 --> 04:01:51.780]   I experienced everything that you do in a meat suit, right?
[04:01:51.780 --> 04:01:53.300]   Like anxiety and all the things,
[04:01:53.300 --> 04:01:58.300]   but I always try to have that higher order view of myself
[04:01:58.300 --> 04:02:02.660]   and that it's just a certain experience occurring
[04:02:02.660 --> 04:02:03.680]   at a certain level,
[04:02:03.680 --> 04:02:06.980]   but it shouldn't override your kind of highest order self.
[04:02:06.980 --> 04:02:09.700]   That's just resolutely accepted death
[04:02:09.700 --> 04:02:13.500]   and that this is your one play in life.
[04:02:13.500 --> 04:02:18.500]   So hopefully that propels me towards proper action.
[04:02:18.500 --> 04:02:23.960]   - I think scarcity cannot help but lead to something good.
[04:02:23.960 --> 04:02:26.740]   Just like with this conversation,
[04:02:26.740 --> 04:02:29.280]   sadly must come to an end.
[04:02:29.280 --> 04:02:31.380]   The scarcity of it is what makes it beautiful.
[04:02:31.380 --> 04:02:34.960]   So Robert, this was one of my favorite conversations,
[04:02:35.900 --> 04:02:40.060]   philosophically and in every other level,
[04:02:40.060 --> 04:02:44.380]   just the ideas and the way you express them around Bitcoin,
[04:02:44.380 --> 04:02:47.140]   around morality, around money,
[04:02:47.140 --> 04:02:51.300]   has been really inspiring and really educational.
[04:02:51.300 --> 04:02:54.160]   And I'm glad you're out there fighting the good fight.
[04:02:54.160 --> 04:02:57.060]   And I'm glad you're wasting all of this time with me.
[04:02:57.060 --> 04:02:58.380]   It was really fun.
[04:02:58.380 --> 04:03:01.720]   And thank you for coming down to Texas
[04:03:01.720 --> 04:03:05.060]   and having some good old brisket together.
[04:03:05.060 --> 04:03:06.620]   This was really fun, man.
[04:03:06.620 --> 04:03:07.940]   - This was awesome, Lex.
[04:03:07.940 --> 04:03:10.020]   Thanks for having me, man.
[04:03:10.020 --> 04:03:11.700]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[04:03:11.700 --> 04:03:13.060]   with Robert Breedlove.
[04:03:13.060 --> 04:03:17.380]   And thank you to Fundrise, Element, Munkpack,
[04:03:17.380 --> 04:03:18.540]   and BetterHelp.
[04:03:18.540 --> 04:03:21.980]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[04:03:21.980 --> 04:03:24.060]   And now let me leave you with some words
[04:03:24.060 --> 04:03:26.500]   from Nassim Nicholas Taleb.
[04:03:26.500 --> 04:03:30.020]   Anti-fragility is beyond resilience and robustness.
[04:03:30.020 --> 04:03:33.700]   The resilient resists shocks and stay the same.
[04:03:33.700 --> 04:03:36.300]   The anti-fragile gets better.
[04:03:36.300 --> 04:03:40.020]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[04:03:40.020 --> 04:03:42.600]   (upbeat music)
[04:03:42.600 --> 04:03:45.180]   (upbeat music)
