[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Psalm 112, "The righteous will be remembered forever."
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.540]   Praise YAH.
[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.360]   How blessed is the man who fears Yahweh,
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.500]   who greatly delights in his commandments.
[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.940]   His seed will be mighty on the earth.
[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.620]   The generation of the upright will be blessed.
[00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.500]   Wealth and riches are in his house,
[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.260]   and his righteousness stands forever.
[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.060]   Light arises in the darkness for the upright.
[00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.440]   He is gracious and compassionate and righteous.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.580]   It is well with a man who is gracious and lends,
[00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.260]   who sustains his work with justice,
[00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260]   for he will never be shaken.
[00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.100]   The righteous will be remembered forever.
[00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.100]   He will not fear an evil report.
[00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.460]   His heart is set trusting in Yahweh.
[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.560]   His heart is upheld.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.560]   He will not fear until he looks in triumph on his adversaries.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.980]   He is given freely to the needy.
[00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.340]   His righteousness stands forever.
[00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.500]   His horn will be raised in glory.
[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.700]   The wicked will see it and be vexed.
[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.220]   He will gnash his teeth and melt away.
[00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.420]   The desire of the wicked will perish.
[00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.580]   (silence)
[00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:26.580]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
