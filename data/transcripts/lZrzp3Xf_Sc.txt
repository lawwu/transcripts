[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   everyone will tell you they lost money, even with a big sample set. So you say, Okay, well,
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:12.320]   not only all have my friends lost money, if I look at the news, there's, you know, the front
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.960]   page is saying more layoffs, bankruptcies. And that actually may be the best time to invest.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.800]   Yeah, I mean, if you invested all of your money at the bottom of the graph, that would be great.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.160]   But I think we could probably talk about a little later waiting for that bottom might not actually
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.560]   be as good a strategy as just being invested now.
