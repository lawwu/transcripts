[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540]   I love old weird internet where you have these hand coded sites and your angel fire GeoCities
[00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.760]   blog and you didn't have this worry that, okay, this thing I post on here could be amplified
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.560]   to 100 million people in nine minutes.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.560]   All right.
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.480]   Welcome to Cal and Jamie explain the internet.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.840]   This is the show where two guys who by choice spend very little time online attempt to explain
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.280]   some of the biggest trends from the last week of internet culture.
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.840]   We will once again show you that the internet is not real life.
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.820]   We will sum up insane trending stories so you don't have to read about it or feel forced
[00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.800]   to tweet your political opinion about Kevin McCarthy and immediately be fired from your
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.800]   job.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.800]   Hello everybody.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.040]   My name is Jamie Kielstein and I am Cal Newport.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.140]   We have today five stories that were trending in internet culture over the last week or
[00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.200]   so we will give you our completely uninformed take on them.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.400]   This I think is a particularly, I don't know, poignant wink to be doing this because from
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.000]   what I understand you are in the middle of a social media fast.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Do I have that right?
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.920]   My church, which is something I never thought I would say, my church is doing like a 21
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.880]   day fast and most people are fasting from food and doing stuff like that.
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.680]   My pastor hit me with the last option which he calls a soul fast and he's like, "Just
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.480]   ask God what do you really need to fast from?"
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:34.920]   And dude, I would have rather fasted from food not because that would make my life better.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.160]   Getting off social media would make my life better but I just kept convincing myself that
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.640]   I'm like, "Oh, I need it for work.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.680]   I need it for what a lot of the listeners probably do."
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.680]   Like, yeah, of course I'd like to get off it.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.400]   We're not all Cal Newport.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.480]   I literally convinced myself that you would get mad at me.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.240]   You Cal Newport, who writes about social media and not being on it, would get mad at me because
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.080]   you would be like, "Well, who's going to get our stories if you're off social media?
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.400]   That's like your one job."
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.400]   I was your excuse?
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.400]   Okay.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.640]   It's like the alcoholic that's like, "Yeah, but what if I need to be drinking to close
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.840]   the deal with the Nakamoto merger or whatever?"
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.360]   Like, okay, I definitely.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.480]   I got to keep Moe's Tavern in business.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.480]   Exactly.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.520]   What's Moe going to do?
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.520]   What's Barney going to do?
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.520]   Come on.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.600]   Then I realized that was insane and I texted you and you were like, "Oh, that's a great
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.600]   idea."
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.600]   I was like, "Fucking cow."
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.440]   Does that mean it's doing the show?
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.440]   There's two options.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.440]   It's doing the show today.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.080]   Either it's this really positive thing.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.200]   It's like when you're in recovery for alcohol, like going to whatever it is, 6th Street in
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.840]   Austin at 3 a.m. and be like, "Man, I'm glad that's not me.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.240]   I feel really good about my decision."
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.920]   Or is this like taking the guys from the A meeting to a bourbon tasting?
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.200]   Is this giving you a touch or is it giving you confidence in your decision?
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.200]   We'll see, man.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.040]   I mean, you could read the first story and I could be like, "Joe Biden said what?
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.200]   Oh, that's the good stuff."
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.520]   I don't know.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.600]   But I think that this will probably keep me off.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.760]   I did the thing.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.200]   This is how I quit things often.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.640]   I don't think it's healthy, but when I quit things, I have to announce to everybody that
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.000]   I'm doing it so that I will look dumb.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.960]   I could smoke cigarettes for 15 years and then on day one of year 15, just be like,
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.680]   "Oh, you idiot smoke.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.680]   Gross.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.680]   I quit."
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.800]   So then if I do start smoking again, they will beat me to death.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.800]   So we'll see.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:44.160]   I think this is a great way to remind me that social media is bad.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.160]   Right.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.160]   Okay.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.720]   So I was worthless finding stories and helping you this week.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.040]   I should give you props.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.680]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.840]   But it's for a better cause and let's hope this goes well and not like my...
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:02.760]   I think it might be my top five unnecessary Simpsons quotes would be Barney winning the
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.220]   film festival for his movie about alcoholism and sobriety.
[00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.440]   And they're like, "And your prize is a year supply of Duff beer."
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.960]   And he says, "Put it in my veins."
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.920]   And then the guy just comes out, the tech just comes out so matter of fact and just
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.640]   hooks IV up in the Barney from the...
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.640]   All right, let's get rolling.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.640]   Nope.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.640]   I was going to...
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.080]   My Barney quote, I was going to quote the one where he gets sober and joins NASA because
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.360]   he's really smart.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.000]   And then he beats Homer and they go to congratulate him and he takes a sip of champagne and just
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   goes, "Epic."
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.720]   And like freaks out.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.920]   And then they all go, "That was non-alcoholic wine," or whatever it was.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.920]   But anyway.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.920]   It was non-alcoholic.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.240]   And of course, again, it's matter of factly just walks over and takes a jet pack and puts
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.800]   it on and it's just a matter of factness.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.800]   This is what...
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.880]   See, all internet culture issues would be solved if we just use the internet for what
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.040]   it was meant for, which was essentially like sharing Simpsons quotes.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.040]   That's all.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.440]   I have a group...
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.720]   The group chat with me and two of my brothers on Instagram is only Simpsons clips.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.000]   And it's just us being like, "Ah, the good old days."
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   That actually is what it is.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   But we can just move that shit to text.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Okay.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   All right, here we go.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.560]   I'm going to click my share screen button here.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.840]   We're going to be discussing these for the first time.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.840]   All right.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.840]   Number one.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.840]   All right.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.280]   This, I found this one.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.840]   All right.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.840]   Let's see.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.080]   Do you see this on your screen now?
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.620]   What is this?
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.620]   This was...
[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.420]   Oh my goodness.
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.480]   Okay.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.280]   I don't know what it is, but I'll tell you where it's from.
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.760]   So where it's from is...
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.640]   Oh, I see.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.000]   This is what's trending on Tumblr.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.080]   So number one, I didn't realize Tumblr still existed.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.720]   I went to what's trending on Tumblr and just grabbed something from the top five.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.680]   So this was like two or three when I was going through here.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.560]   So if you were on Tumblr, there's a good chance you saw this.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.120]   My Simpsons reference for you in that moment was when Bart was working at the burlesque
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.560]   house and Principal Skinner saunters in and immediate...
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.920]   Oh no, actually you're more of the grandpa where he just looks at Bart, grabs his hat
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.920]   and just goes, "Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo," and turns around and leaves.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.920]   Like, "Hi, Grandpa," and he just puts it on.
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.800]   You just clicking on Tumblr and being like, "I got to get out of here," and taking a fast
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.120]   screenshot and then just bailing.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.120]   So this is...
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.120]   All right.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.240]   For those who are listening and not watching, these are my little ponies.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.440]   And there's something like an insect.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.280]   And one of them is saying, "Oh my goodness, Applejack, look.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:45.600]   It's an anemore locust, one of the most recognizable creatures of the Cambrian explosion."
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.360]   And the other one says, "What's in God's name?"
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.560]   Shared 6,925 times.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.560]   That's a lot.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.120]   My main issue is this is a weird sex thing.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.680]   That's my number one concern.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:02.880]   So we're just wandering into this is just clear signaling for...
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.360]   And any time I've been confused by something on the internet and I just go, "I'm just going
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.500]   to Google that.
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.500]   Always a weird sex thing."
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.500]   Always a weird sex thing.
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.500]   Always a weird sex thing.
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.500]   And Tumblr was really interesting because...
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.240]   I think Tumblr was before MySpace.
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.960]   Tumblr started off, correct me if I'm wrong, as a journaling site.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.120]   And you would just journal and it was kind of angsty teenagers.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:32.360]   And then it definitely was far more left-wing than right-wing.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:39.160]   There weren't a lot of right-wing emo journal entries from William M. Buckley's granddaughter.
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.100]   So I'm learning from you here, just basics.
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:46.200]   It's like a blog style interface.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.720]   You're posting a blog style text and image post.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:55.040]   Well, and then there was a phase where it was just like hard sex.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:01.120]   It went from the journal entries to that was the place where just erotica and fan fiction
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.120]   and just straight clips of just sex became a thing.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.760]   And then I literally thought it closed.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.080]   I thought it was just done.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:18.520]   And now it kind of would make sense to me that kind of like the sex fetish people just
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.840]   stuck around after closing.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:28.680]   And it has a very sort of abandoned carnival feel where there's just like a Ferris wheel
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.320]   that's broken and just hasn't been used in 20 years.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.160]   But under the boardwalk, it's a bunch of dudes dressed as My Little Ponies.
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:43.480]   That's just the vibe I'm getting from this where they can just be free in the wreckage
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.480]   of Tumblr.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.480]   That's interesting.
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.480]   Okay.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:52.680]   So it's like a digital post-apocalyptic landscape that allows sort of like interesting.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.680]   You know what, though?
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.560]   I mean, A, that's based on nothing factual.
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.760]   That's just what I'm getting from looking at this.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.280]   Deeply researched history of Tumblr from Dr. Jamie Kilstein.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.280]   Two points.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:09.520]   One, that trajectory of going from like one thing to hardcore sex.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.920]   Little known fact, same fate for pbskids.com.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:13.920]   Correct.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.920]   Yeah.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.520]   It was a weird angle, a really weird turn that took.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.760]   But you know, I think that was, I believe it was Jim Blair's idea.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:22.760]   Jim Blair.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.160]   Jim Blair, yeah.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.560]   The news anchor from PBS.
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.560]   Good poll.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.560]   I appreciate that.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.560]   Thank you.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.560]   All right.
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.840]   Well, listen, but I'll tell you what, here's the interesting thing I'm taking away from
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.840]   this.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.840]   I'm not going to say a lot of little pony stuff.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.160]   I know it's a thing, but I don't know much about it.
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:42.700]   But I do sort of like this idea that in the wreckage of once big sites, you're actually
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.280]   getting a return to old school internet.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.760]   So I actually, so I have a, you know me, this is my thing on the show is I always have a
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.840]   positive spin on a lot of things.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.840]   This is great.
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.720]   I love old weird internet where, you know, you have these hand coded sites and your angel
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.240]   fire GeoCities blog.
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:04.120]   And you didn't have this worry that, okay, this thing I post on here could be amplified
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.760]   to a hundred million people in nine minutes.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.040]   And so like, you could just have this and it's anonymous.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.560]   Like who's this name?
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.560]   Punkett is here.
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.560]   Punkett Dash is here.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.560]   Right.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.560]   And what is it probably funny if you're like Jamie Kielstie.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.560]   Jamie Kielstie, wait a second.
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:20.640]   And then that's what I noticed, like a little bit of like a pony head in the background
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.600]   of right here.
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.640]   You know, I have a positive take.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:33.840]   I feel like this story has made me sort of like a 1990s libertarian leaning conservative
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.000]   dad where I'm just like, you know, I'm fine with they do as long as they don't do it in
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   front of me.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.320]   Like I would rather go to Tumblr with the weird stuff I don't get instead of it just
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.040]   like constantly popping up on my Twitter feed.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:51.760]   If that's where, if that's your guys little safe space for whatever this is, um, you know,
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.760]   have at it, man.
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.320]   If it makes you happy, that's cool.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.880]   I mean, I'm asking you because you spent much more time on Twitter, but Twitter is not a
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.000]   safe space for any sort of exploration.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Right.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Because it's associated with you and it's so scrutinized.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.680]   And so it's become a lot more conformist.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.120]   So I'm glad there's places out there like I don't mess around with stuff, you know,
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.600]   like, uh, not, not taking a big swing.
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.600]   All right.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.600]   Very good.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.600]   So we found something positive there.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.600]   All right.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.600]   So let me, uh, let's move on.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.600]   All right.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.040]   God, I hope one of your listeners doesn't like write in to tell us like that.
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:27.280]   It's really some just horrific sex thing.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.340]   And we're just like, good on them.
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.340]   It is horrific.
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:36.400]   It's like, uh, puppy murdering and not just like quick and painless puppy murdering, but
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:42.160]   like it's a whole culture of we find and kidnap puppies and, and, and who are the sweet, only
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.240]   golden retrievers, only golden retrievers.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.240]   Yeah.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.240]   Woodchipper.
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:51.240]   It's like a terrible thing and they all, but the code word for it is something about the
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.760]   Cambridge explosion.
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:58.600]   If you can't bring explosion, it's like, we're going to use the like contractor bag to collect
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.960]   the bloody chunks of puppies to come through.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.520]   And there's like other references for other ways you do it.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:08.080]   Oh, I love that you're out of the two of us, the academic and uh, yeah, that's where that
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.080]   goes.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.080]   Good work.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.080]   All right, here we go.
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.080]   Tab number two.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.080]   Oh my goodness.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.080]   These are in reverse order.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.720]   All right, here we go.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.720]   All right.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.720]   Okay.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.960]   So this is a tweet from Lex Fridman.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.200]   So if you just see this tweet, you might be wondering why is this trending?
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.700]   It just says, I'm reading a book a week in 2023.
[00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.200]   This is Lex in his tweet.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.920]   Um, blah, blah, blah.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.360]   I'll adjust the list, but I'm going to start on Monday and be done by Sunday.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.040]   So he's gonna read one book each week and he might do, he's announcing, might do low
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.120]   key videos of like, Hey, what did I learn each week from the books?
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.720]   And it's a list of like classic books.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.280]   Uh, right now this is an exception.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.520]   I know about this story because Jamie sent it to me.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.680]   So Jamie wrote something about this, right?
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.480]   You know, so what, why are we talking about this?
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.640]   Seems nice to me.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:05.800]   I texted you furiously and I wrote about it at, uh, Jamie Kilstein dot sub stack.com.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:12.520]   Um, if you guys want to follow my writing, I read a lot about mental health, but because
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:17.800]   I was very online when stuff like this happens, I write about it as well.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:23.000]   So people saw this list and lost their minds.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.040]   They absolutely lost their minds.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.840]   Um, baffles me.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:34.000]   And well, it is because of tribalism where even though, and you know, Lex, um, you know,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.200]   you can't, you're not going to speak for him, but like I would have never considered Lex
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:46.560]   even in like, I mean, maybe in my super very online days, like, and he's, he's in the group
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:54.480]   of podcasters that will talk to anyone despite their political leanings.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.480]   Right.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:14:01.320]   So he'll interview, uh, you, but he'll also interview John Danaher, a famous jujitsu coach,
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:08.320]   but he'll interview Kanye and then he'll interview, uh, someone from fucking AIPAC to cat.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.000]   Like he will, he'll go both sides.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.040]   And if you go both sides, people on the left just call you a right wing.
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:23.440]   If you've, if you've interviewed Jordan Peterson before, then anything you say will be scrutinized.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:29.260]   So, you know, not to get political on the show, but a lot of the people attacking him
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.900]   would have to, because again, the books were innocuous.
[00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:35.920]   If it was like, I'm going to read a book a week and every week it was a different translation
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.880]   of mind comp, then I'd be like, buddy, what's happening.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:48.840]   But it was, you know, a lot of just classic books and people were like, Oh, right wing
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.960]   apologist Lex Fridman is an idiot.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:52.960]   What are you going to read next?
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.620]   James and the giant peach.
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.240]   And it was just mocking him.
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.240]   Mock.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.240]   Okay.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.680]   So, so the pushback was in the form of mockery.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.680]   Like these, these books aren't like, why haven't you read these books?
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.680]   When I heard he was getting canceled and he even tweeted, I did not think that by the
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.080]   way, this was on new year's.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.640]   This was like, welcome to 2023.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:12.840]   Lex was like, we should read more.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:16.840]   And everyone was like, fuck you Lex and lost their minds.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:21.560]   There was one guy, I don't know if I sent you the tweet, but he's a pretty famous dude.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:25.280]   I haven't heard of him, but he was like, this is why I won't go on this idiots podcast,
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.680]   even though he keeps asking me to.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.920]   And then Jordan Peterson like chimed in.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.720]   This is why we should all be off Twitter.
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:37.920]   Jordan Peterson chimed in and was like, it was like, I don't even remember what he said.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.040]   And then that guy was like, shut up, Peterson, you're an idiot.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:47.000]   And it just erupted from Lex being like, Hey, I want to go revisit, you know, 1984 or whatever
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.640]   you want it to read.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:56.120]   And so what I wrote about, you know, I wrote about one that this is probably something
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:01.360]   that I would have jumped on, you know, um, back in the day.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.240]   But you would have put your finger up first, right into the wind.
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.240]   Are we happy about this?
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.400]   Are we just like, that's, that's the way that goes, right?
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:12.280]   You're like, you gotta, you have to get the parameters of why we're mad at someone and
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.280]   then you take your swing.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:18.880]   I mean, honestly, I assumed that when I saw Lex Friedman as being canceled over books,
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:24.040]   I assumed that it was, Oh, they were all like white guy authors or whatever, but it really
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:29.280]   wasn't that it was so much lamer than that, where it was just, Hey, this guy's trying
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.280]   to do something good.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:39.320]   And you know, a lot of people, um, yeah, I, I, I think I wrote, um, that my days used
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.320]   to go like this.
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.760]   Number one, see what's trending on Twitter.
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.800]   Number two, see the name of someone I'm not supposed to like.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:47.200]   Number three, see what the people, this is the, the, the finger in the air I'm supposed
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.200]   to agree with her saying number four, find a funnier way to say it.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.040]   Um, which by the way is easy.
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.640]   Um, and then number five, basking retweets while my personal life falls apart.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:59.080]   And yeah, I mean, this was essentially, this was my life.
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.080]   Why don't we try it?
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.080]   Okay.
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.960]   Let's, let's put on, you know, very online, Jamie hats, like go back to the time machine.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:04.960]   Sure.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:05.960]   Take your, take your swing.
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:06.960]   All right.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.120]   It's like, what's, what would be on the spot?
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.120]   Yeah.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.120]   What's your, what's your tweet?
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:12.120]   Very online.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.120]   Jamie would have sent three years ago.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:17.720]   If this had happened, it's a pretty able list of Lexford men to list that he can read a
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.760]   bunch of books a week while we're all struggling at minimum wage jobs.
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.240]   And some of us can't even read.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.240]   There you go.
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.240]   It's pretty good.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.240]   All right.
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.240]   That's funny.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.120]   Uh, no, I dude, I mean, it would have just, it would have been jumping on board.
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.840]   And here's the thing that upset me the most.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:36.600]   Here's why I actually wrote about this is because a lot of people who are trashing Lex
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.640]   and chime in if you want from what you know about him personally or don't, but they were
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.920]   like, he's like that fake lovey bro type.
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.760]   And essentially they are mad at him.
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:52.640]   And some dare I say would consider him privileged for he's doing what I'm trying to do in my
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:58.520]   social media career, which is he is trying to bring people together, trying to tweet
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.840]   about, Hey man, things are really hard, but let's look for love.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.880]   Let's see how we can help people.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:11.560]   And to me, to me, when I see him, it seems very authentic, but people, social media has
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:16.440]   trained us to be so antagonistic that when someone just tweets like, Hey, we should all
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.440]   love each other.
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:21.240]   I mean, every time I tweet something like that, I'll, I'll get at least three or four
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:26.480]   tweets that are like, Oh, what's your angle or easy for you to say, or, Oh, this fake
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.600]   love thing.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.160]   Like, like saying to be nice to each other is somehow a grift.
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.480]   That's another very online word.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.280]   If you change your mind, if you become more conservative or more liberal, if you're trying
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.200]   to bring people together, it's just a grift.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.420]   I see what you're doing.
[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:45.280]   And it's like, wow, we have become that nihilistic that trying to be nice or trying to read a
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:49.040]   book a week or telling people they should meditate or go to the gym.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.120]   Somehow there has to be some political angle.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.280]   Hey, we should go to the gym more.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.000]   Oh, so you don't think COVID is real.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.160]   But somehow it has to become political or, uh, we have to find a way to discredit them.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:05.120]   And that's what I just think is, I mean, honestly, like it's, it's evil when it comes to social
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.680]   media where it's like, we're attacking people for trying to do good.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:15.360]   That's so, I mean, here's having met Lex, I don't know him well, but I've met him before
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.560]   as far as I can tell, this is, he's just a nice guy.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:23.600]   And the reason why that's not, it's not surprising to me.
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:27.280]   Because there's the shared bit of background that I can have with Lex.
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.520]   He's also a computer science PhD.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.640]   He's a research scientist at MIT.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:37.780]   He came to my attention because he has on his show, all of these big name professors
[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.960]   from the CS department I knew at MIT.
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:44.080]   And to me, when I first encountered Lex, like this is great that there's probably like a
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:49.920]   big audience of Joe Rogan fans who are now hearing Silvio Macaulay, the cryptographer,
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.000]   talk about Oblivion zero knowledge proofs.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Like this is great.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.680]   He's like, you know, he's like, I'm not even on famous computer scientists.
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.480]   It's an interesting guy.
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.400]   But those of us who come out of academia, you know, we're probably too busy doing math
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.520]   equations to really be plugged in the culture.
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.080]   So there's a sort of, and also he's not American, right?
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.640]   He comes from a Russian background.
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:12.800]   So there's more of a, you know, Tocqueville in America type relationship, I think, going
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.840]   on to our culture of like, I was doing math and CS, I'm not even from the US.
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:22.960]   So I'm not, I'm not plugged into or placed into these existing cultural streams.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.960]   Like where, where do you sit and what team are you on, especially online?
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.440]   I just don't think that comes naturally to him.
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.760]   And I think that breaks people's brains like that.
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:36.360]   It can't be because you have a bit, you have to be, well, whose team are you on, man?
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.360]   What's the grip?
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.360]   Like what's going on?
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.360]   I don't know.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.720]   Every time I've talked to him, he's honestly seemed like a really curious, nice guy who
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.160]   really wants people to love each other.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:51.760]   And also like, man, if you start the less I'm on social media, the more I can appreciate
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.640]   certain things from some people.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:58.400]   I don't care how Jordan Peterson feels about pronouns or some of the stuff he said, that's
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.040]   been like very silly and stuff.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:06.700]   But when I first discovered Jordan Peterson, it was just like a strong male personality
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:11.360]   being like, Hey man, take responsibility for your stuff, make your bed, like fix your problems.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.500]   And that was really helpful for me at that time in my life.
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:21.400]   And so I don't have to agree with everything he says politically or where he works to.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:25.400]   I don't suddenly have to like disown the good he did in my life.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.040]   And I would sort of implore your audience.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:31.660]   I mean, I'm sure your audience is pretty good with that, but it's like you can separate
[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:32.660]   these things, man.
[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:35.620]   You can have relationships with people where you don't agree with everything.
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:39.160]   You can see someone tweet, Hey, I'm going to try to read a book.
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.600]   He must've been so proud before he hit send.
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.140]   What a cool little thing I'm doing for myself.
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.440]   And now he's had to respond to it.
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.120]   He literally, it's like he got canceled.
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.560]   Like he just posted a YouTube video, which I haven't watched, like in response to it.
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.040]   And, you know, he seems like he's taking it in good.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:58.480]   I mean, God, if anything, it just, it, it, it proved his point that we should be reading
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.120]   more and offline.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:05.520]   Well, if you had a friend come up to you at like a guy from work, I mean, like a good
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.600]   friend, like, Hey Jamie, like I'm, I thought you'd be interested.
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:09.800]   Maybe you want to join me.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:10.800]   Like I found these old books.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:14.000]   I've read a bunch of these before, but I really want to just like read them from scratch.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.780]   And I want to spend more time reading.
[00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:16.780]   You fucking idiot.
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:17.780]   You idiot.
[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:18.780]   What?
[00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.780]   Those books are so stupid.
[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:24.000]   Just knock them out of his hand.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.280]   Get your stupid books.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.400]   I read all the books.
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.080]   I smart.
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.080]   Get on the ground.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.300]   Pick up the books in front of me.
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:33.300]   You stupid.
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:35.880]   You know, like it would be, it would be weird.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:36.880]   Right?
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:41.880]   And by the way, man, this ties into a mental health thing I've been talking about on my
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:47.560]   podcast, but like I do this now as an adult and I was actually just listening to an old
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:55.240]   Conan podcast and he was saying, Conan was saying how his neighbors, old neighbors thought
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:59.320]   that he was just really mean to his wife.
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:03.720]   And in reality, no, it was him being mean to himself.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.760]   I'm like, Oh you idiot.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:06.760]   Like blah, blah, blah.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.840]   So like this is a real problem.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:14.680]   And you know, I, I was helping this like eight year old girl that I kind of mentor.
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.120]   She was, she was struggling with it.
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.760]   She was struggling with that as well.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.960]   I was like, do you say nice things about yourself to yourself?
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.880]   And she just goes, no.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.160]   And I was like, that's kind of like me too.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:32.520]   And it's, it's internet makes this worse.
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.520]   Internet makes this worse.
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.080]   This is internet makes this worse.
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.800]   Internet makes this so much worse.
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.960]   You don't want to put out good stuff.
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:44.160]   Do you think that I get excited every time I'm going to post something just like, Hey
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.840]   man, just went for a walk in nature and like, I know life's hard, but if you just breathe
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:53.080]   in and look at the beauty around you, it's like the idea that while typing that in my
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:58.120]   head is Rolodexing all of the things that people hate me could say.
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:02.000]   And then it just gets solidified with stories like this.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.960]   It might be a must be nice to have functioning lungs.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:12.800]   Why don't you go tell the coal miners recovering down in West Virginia about your fresh air
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:13.800]   walk?
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.800]   Exactly.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:15.800]   Exactly.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:16.800]   Neoliberal elitist shill.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:17.800]   And you're like, okay, okay, okay.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:18.800]   I support the coal miners.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.800]   Oh, so you support coal and you, uh, you hate Greta Thunberg.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.200]   It's like, no, no, no.
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.200]   Greta's fine.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.200]   Oh, so you love Andrew Tate.
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.400]   What are you doing?
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:36.920]   And like, I, but you know, I know if I were to call, you know, Trump a Nazi or Biden senile,
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.920]   it's like, Oh, bring me that.
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:39.920]   Bring me that respect.
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.260]   Bring me that love.
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:42.720]   And so we are training ourself.
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.160]   And so then what do you think happens when you go outside?
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:49.920]   Is your brain trained to look for negative or is your brain trained to look for the good?
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:53.160]   And it's like, yeah, man, it's going to be trained to look for the negative in the less
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.160]   I'm on social media.
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.600]   The more I actually do read books and the more I get out into nature and I meditate
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:01.560]   and I just write to write, um, off social media.
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:05.360]   Um, the more I'm like, yeah, man, there's a lot, even when I'm struggling, there's a
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.000]   lot of good in the world.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   And that gratitude helps me with my mental health.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   So much.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.640]   And that comes back to the key point, the number of people who are very online and giving
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.400]   this negative feedback, it's so small.
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:26.360]   And the vast majority of the people do not think in their lives about, am I going to
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.160]   get pushed back about talking about a book?
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.600]   Am I going to get pushed back about talking about taking fresh air?
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.760]   Like it's so narrow.
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:36.160]   I think that's, that's, that's what's so critical is how narrow, how narrow this is.
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:40.680]   It, and you know, if you feel that same concern, it's just Twitter.
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:41.680]   I mean, Lex should leave Twitter.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:42.680]   I'm going to tell him that.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.200]   No, I don't think he needs to be on Twitter.
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.400]   He doesn't need to be on Twitter.
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.120]   You should follow Sam Harris's example.
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.040]   Like Sam doesn't need, he didn't need to be on Twitter.
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.880]   Like he has his podcast, he loves it and he left.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:52.880]   I think he's fine.
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:53.880]   I think he's happier for it.
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:54.880]   I'd like to need to be on Twitter.
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:55.880]   He barely uses it.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:56.880]   I don't think so.
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:57.880]   It's so narrow.
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:58.880]   I, I, once again, my computer is dying.
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:04.560]   I apologize to you, but now I'm in the cool standing spot.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:10.080]   You know, it must be nice to stand with your, tell those pirates that lost their legs and
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.160]   cannonball accidents about all of your standing.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.160]   Oh, that's right.
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:16.840]   But you're probably pro pirate.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:23.320]   So again, cow and I, we don't, we talk about culture, we talk about what's being talked
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:29.680]   about, but we don't need to make this a political show, but it's super interesting that you
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:40.920]   brought up Sam Harris because I was on Twitter when Sam was canceled the most recently.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:46.280]   Sam's always talked about controversial things, but people on the right have actually really
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.320]   been going after him for his Trump stuff.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:52.960]   And so he had this clip that went viral on a guy's show that I know that people are still
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.480]   talking about.
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:27:01.120]   I know about this one because I, I saw Sam get interviewed, um, on Bill Mars podcast.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.440]   So I actually know about it.
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.440]   What happened on Twitter?
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.480]   This is the Hunter Hunter Biden.
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:11.320]   Our politically like fraught internet bingo card starting to fill up because we have Sam
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.920]   Harris, Hunter Biden.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.480]   These are all entering into, you've mentioned Jordan Peterson.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.840]   We're doing it.
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.240]   We are, we are culture warriors.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:25.840]   That should be the episode of this title or the title of today's episode.
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.160]   Definitely culture warriors.
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:32.040]   But it's so fascinating what you just said, because I feel like me and you are reversed
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.040]   a little bit.
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:39.360]   So Sam gets off Twitter and every time I see Sam come up, it's, here's another one for
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.360]   the bingo card.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.960]   Like Glenn Greenwald just posted about him the other day being like, this is one of the
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.360]   worst things that happened in 2022.
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.400]   And it was that stupid clip again.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.640]   And again, doesn't matter how I feel about that.
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.320]   Doesn't matter how Cal feels about that.
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:55.520]   But what's interesting is when Sam got off Twitter and I haven't seen Sam on Twitter,
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:03.080]   um, and I've actually had nothing but lovely interactions, uh, with Sam, um, recently.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.040]   And that reminded me to tell you off air, cause I actually emailed him after this happened
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:08.400]   and he was great.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.400]   Um, in my head, I'm like, Sam's done.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.760]   No one respects Sam anymore because I'm just looking at my Twitter feed.
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:15.760]   Oh, interesting.
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.920]   And then the other day.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:21.720]   So in your mind, in your mind, he's like, he gave away his public status.
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.720]   Interesting.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:23.720]   That's it.
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.720]   Exactly.
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.720]   And he's done.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:26.960]   And.
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:29.400]   Which is completely bonkers.
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:34.240]   I mean, Andrew Huberman just popped up on my feed, the other, my podcast feed the other
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:37.000]   day, Andrew Huberman, one of the biggest podcasts in the world.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.520]   And he has had Sam Harrison.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:46.320]   And the topic isn't like disgraced neuro, whatever the topic is like meditation.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.360]   And they're probably just going to talk about his meditation app.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.640]   And then podcast is killing it.
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.720]   Sam's podcast is killing it.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:56.120]   His app is killing it in my head.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.240]   It's over.
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.920]   So interesting that happened on Twitter and he's not on it.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:04.160]   And in fact, he's probably going to be more successful, certainly going to be happier,
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:08.960]   not being on Twitter and not, you know, it seems like he knew that was bad for him.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:09.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.560]   You know, and like good for fucking him.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:18.960]   But literally until this, even when he popped up on Huberman's, my thought was, oh, Huberman's
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:19.960]   taking a real risk.
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.320]   No, he's not.
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.320]   Because Huberman's audience isn't political.
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.720]   They're just trying to better themself.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:26.720]   Yeah.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.800]   So anyway, so that to me is really good news for me.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:30.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.800]   That's great news to hear.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:33.800]   That's interesting.
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:37.440]   And I think that's what keeps people on is exactly how you felt about Sam.
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.440]   Because you think that about yourself.
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.160]   You know, if I'm not on here, I don't exist.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.640]   And it's you don't.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:48.280]   I imagine like the first day after Sam left Twitter is like the scene at the end of the
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.240]   40 year old virgin, you know, where he has sex for the first time.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:54.640]   And it's just like they're riding unicorns under like rainbows.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.520]   Like that's how I imagine his life is like him just like high fiving people and playing
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.520]   ultimate Frisbee.
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:29:59.800]   That's it, dude.
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:05.160]   And and also like it's so great because I mean, I've told you this.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:13.640]   I've gotten not bitter, but like there have been times where you've tried to help me,
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:19.180]   whether it's with, you know, a project I'm working on or my podcast or whatever.
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:23.800]   But it's always tied to I'm not happy on social media and please help me, Cal.
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:27.360]   And you've tried to come up with ways like, hey, here's how you can promote your stuff,
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.320]   but not experience the toxic parts of social media.
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:34.280]   We talked about this on your podcast if you guys want to check that out.
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.800]   And then there's always part of me that I'm like, cool, Cal, I'll be successful.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:42.240]   Get off social media if you can get me booked on Tim Ferriss's if you you know what I mean?
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.720]   Because I'm like, well, it's easy for Cal because Cal did a fucking stupid TED talk
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:46.720]   on it.
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.480]   That's incredibly popular.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:53.760]   And so to hear this with Sam, because even now I was like before this 21 day fast, I
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:31:00.000]   was like, man, but I have all these like really cool like coals in the fire and like these
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.040]   projects that are about to take off and like, oh, if that big agent saw that I'm like off
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.760]   social media for 21 days, what's he going to think?
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:09.040]   And it doesn't matter.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:13.400]   And in fact, being off social media, this writing deadline I was on yesterday that I
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:18.240]   thought was going to take me like a week or two, like I sent in in two days because I'm
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:21.640]   just not aimlessly looking at my social media feed.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:25.520]   And I was writing and like, yeah, am I going to have to like promote?
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:26.720]   Sure.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:30.520]   But that doesn't mean that I need to be on social media all day.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:34.720]   And then Sam is like, what an awesome example, because, again, my Twitter feed, he's like
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.520]   the most hated right now.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.520]   And I like him.
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:42.000]   I don't I don't agree with everything he says, but it's like I like most of what he does.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.920]   Yeah, there we go.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.440]   And the fact that, look, I'm not on Twitter.
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:49.820]   I have no idea why he's hated or not hated.
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:53.820]   I think just emphasizes if you're someone like in his position, most of the world has
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.320]   no idea what's going on on Twitter.
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:59.560]   They're like, you wrote that book about, you know, you do meditation and you were like
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.840]   the Christian, you let our Christian nation.
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:04.840]   Yeah, you were an atheist guy and then you were a meditation guy.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.840]   That's what it should be.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.000]   And at the end, that's like nine percent of the world.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.840]   So I think use me, everyone use me as your barometer.
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:14.000]   If I don't know about something, that means ninety nine percent of people because I'm
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.360]   plugged into the news.
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.960]   Like I know what's going on.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.760]   I'm a semi-cultural figure.
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:21.480]   I'm like, yeah, like I know what's going on.
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.320]   I just don't know what's happening on Twitter.
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:24.520]   So I should be the barometer.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.560]   All right, let's do let's get another story here.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.160]   Clicking my share button.
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.880]   Do do do do.
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:31.880]   All right.
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:35.440]   This is another story that was spreading a lot on the Internet this last week.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.080]   All right.
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.280]   TMZ.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:47.200]   Leonardo DiCaprio living it up in a yacht in St. Bart dot dot dot with tons of chicks.
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:51.160]   There is a picture of Leo living his best life.
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.520]   Yeah, man.
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:53.520]   Yeah.
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:55.560]   With a there's a woman in a bikini, I suppose.
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:33:00.240]   So this is a skinny Leo's kind of like chubby jacked, which I think they pick to be like,
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:02.840]   he's not all there that but like he still looks jacked.
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.720]   But if you look close, it's like, OK, he's getting older.
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:06.720]   It's chubby jacked.
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:07.720]   You know more about it.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.760]   It's just like you were in shape for a role.
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.320]   It's a muscular.
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:12.320]   Yeah.
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.120]   Like your gut will come back before you lose all your muscles.
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.120]   Is that a thing?
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:19.400]   I mean, I guess there's definition there, but it's being kind of like overrun.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.400]   But look at this.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:23.000]   This is just old school tabloid.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.600]   Here's like a picture of him on a seat, a picture of the yacht he's on.
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:33.400]   And TMZ is trying to figure out who some of the people are.
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.080]   I love that.
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.560]   That's what you got out of this so much because you're right.
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:40.800]   I would have never thought about it.
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:47.320]   It's, you know, nowadays you go on Twitter and it's like there's a whistleblower at Twitter
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:50.080]   and they're trying to blow up Elon.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:54.280]   We know Elon's on the side of the whistleblower and he took over Twitter and OK, somehow Matt
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:58.840]   Taibbi and Barry Weiss are involved and old school paparazzi.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.880]   It was like, hey, there's a half naked chick on a boat.
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:05.800]   You want to look at that and all with the fame and with a celebrity, with a celebrity.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.000]   And then we go, yes, I do want to look at that.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.640]   That kind of makes us feel like we're on a boat with a naked chick.
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:13.680]   And I wish I was like Leonardo DiCaprio.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:14.680]   Yeah.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:16.000]   So it makes us feel good.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   This story.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.240]   Well, this it's simple.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.240]   That still exists.
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:25.520]   It's a celebrity on a big boat.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:33.560]   Once again, Cal, this no takes a sweetness that you have in your soul makes me happy.
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:37.240]   And I wish it could just be like good for that guy.
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:38.960]   Just just on a boat.
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.640]   Like you remember being a kid, I wish I could get on a boat.
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:44.400]   And then you remember being a teenager and being like, I wish I could get a hot chick.
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.800]   And he's doing both in the same picture.
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:49.280]   But also when we were teenagers, you know, it'd be typical tablet.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.280]   It serves a few audiences.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.280]   Right.
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.080]   So it's like the young guys like, that's cool.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.080]   I hope that's me.
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:58.000]   And then like our moms would be like, those women are too young.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.120]   And you know, but it would just be like, but it's it's an abstraction.
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:04.040]   It's a celebrity is like an abstraction.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.440]   Like this guy from the movies.
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.440]   Yeah, sure.
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.640]   We can be sex positive on the show.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.040]   Our moms would be like, my wish I was on that boat with Leo.
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.920]   Like we're, we're all allowed to be.
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:12.920]   Yeah.
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:17.440]   But like, um, the, the problem is Leo in the last couple of years, if we're looking at
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:24.000]   Twitter has been despised by the left or by there, I should say by very online people
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.240]   for there he's dating younger women.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:35.720]   And again, if you're a creep, if you're dating 18 year olds or whatever, like that's not
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:42.640]   good, but also like, I don't know, man, 25 year olds are adults who are making that decision.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:47.240]   If it was like Leonardo DiCaprio is on a boat with five 25 year olds, he has chained to
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.240]   the boat.
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.240]   I'm like, well, that's not good.
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:56.380]   And you can also talk about like, okay, there are a bunch of like older dudes who like,
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:58.840]   you know, they're dating young chicks to feel whatever.
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.200]   And like, that's not good either.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.200]   Right.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:08.080]   So you want to ideally be a good partner and you're not, you know, swapping out hot chicks
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:13.120]   or cheating or we, we want to advocate you being a good person on the show.
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:16.400]   But, uh, is that a cancelable offense?
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.640]   Is that just a bunch of jealous dudes?
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:21.040]   Like I don't, I don't know.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:24.200]   Um, but I didn't even know that reaction was going on.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:30.720]   So you're saying the very online have, but that Leo 10 years ago was beloved by environmental
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.680]   stuff and an environmentalist.
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:38.040]   And then like a couple months ago he was trending for like a week where there was some story
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:43.600]   that came out that like he broke up with a 25 year old and started dating another 25
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:44.600]   year old.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.320]   So everyone was just like, fuck you.
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:51.480]   And you know, I don't know, man, but, but, okay.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:52.680]   But here's an interesting thing here.
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:55.680]   Or is this why this, why this is interesting to me because it's, it's two worlds and there's
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.040]   a scrim between them and it's permeable.
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.040]   Right.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:02.880]   Like there's, there's the world that's been around forever of old school celebrity and
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.960]   tabloid like this person's famous.
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.840]   It's not a real person in TMZ.
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.000]   It's an abstraction.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.280]   It's like Leo as a one word thing and they're on a boat and whatever.
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:16.000]   And we have paparazzi pictures and oh, we kind of care.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   Right.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.720]   And then on the other side we have the very online world where everything seems to be,
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:22.860]   you know, it's, it's very personal engagement.
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:28.600]   It's very much like we are, we are all, uh, it's like a homogenized, we're all on the
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:29.600]   same level.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:30.600]   We all have the same Twitter.
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:34.560]   It looks the same and we're all trying to like fight with each other.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.280]   We're all, you're, you're in it, right?
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.640]   Like you're not involved when you're reading TMZ.
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.840]   You're like, this is so far from my reality.
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:44.120]   But on Twitter it's like, yeah, you're in this world and me and my friends are coming
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:46.800]   after you for the, and it's like a, you're in it.
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:51.280]   Like how, if you were to see a trailer for a new Quentin Tarantino movie with Leonardo
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:56.520]   DiCaprio, I assume you would be nothing but delighted.
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:01.640]   Because you would go on Twitter and it's just like, oh, racist Quentin Tarantino.
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:07.720]   Of course he gets, you know, womanizing Leonardo DiCaprio and you know, who's the lady in it?
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:10.640]   Well, she had a problematic tweet from eight years ago.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.520]   I was listening to a podcast.
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.800]   Um, oh, who was it?
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.200]   I was listening to, oh, it was Bill Burr on Conan.
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.840]   I listened to that podcast yesterday.
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:25.040]   And Bill Burr made such a good point about Twitter where he said, you know, they'll find
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:30.600]   someone's tweet from eight years ago where they go, oh, you're being a bad person eight
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.600]   years ago.
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:37.000]   And it's like, yeah, but he had seven years of just being a good person.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   He's like, that's like a Lou Gehrig type record of being a good person.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.080]   And you're going to dig back.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:47.840]   And this goes back to the Lex thing, which goes back to the whole premise of this show.
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:53.120]   Social media trains you to hate essentially.
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.640]   That's what you are told to do.
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:39:02.520]   And if some good news comes out there every time and a new SNL cast there gets announced,
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:04.160]   instead of people being like, oh, good for him.
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:05.960]   Oh, we're going to see some new comedic voices.
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.080]   Oh, I hope she's good.
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.160]   I heard she was a great comic.
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:14.520]   There's just these slimy journalists just digging through 15 years of tweets to find
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:20.540]   something problematic instead of what we should all be doing is like applauding people.
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:23.960]   If we disagree with people, don't follow them.
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:28.600]   And then trying to make ourself the best person we can be.
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.520]   And we're just not incentivized to do that on social media.
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:35.280]   We should all be on a boat with hot chicks and Leonardo DiCaprio is what I'm saying.
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.280]   Right.
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:41.360]   But in this scenario, I would be talking to him about the cinematography from The Revenant,
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:45.400]   which is, which by the way, miraculous.
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:52.340]   Real thing, natural light filmed with wide angle prime lenses that are put in.
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:54.580]   I mean, it's a miracle of cinematography.
[00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:55.580]   It won the Oscar.
[00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:56.580]   That's what's interesting to me.
[00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:57.580]   But let me give a hot take here, though.
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:00.940]   I'm going to let me just be like looking back at the girls being like, cool.
[00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:01.940]   Can we go talk to that?
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:03.700]   He's like, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:04.700]   Masterful.
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:05.700]   Leo makes a masterful cinematography.
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:10.100]   It's like, let's talk about let's talk about the five millimeter fix that you were using
[00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:11.100]   for the whatever.
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:13.100]   You'd be like, all right, Carl, get on this boat.
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:15.560]   How'd you get on here?
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:18.560]   First of all, you're soaking wet.
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:25.000]   I have questions about cinematography.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:32.240]   I want to talk about the use of CGI in the Buffalo scene.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:36.440]   The girls are all being like shuffled onto the emergency escape.
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:38.960]   They just hold on to a helicopter.
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:41.240]   It's like an apocalypse now.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.240]   But look, here's a reverse.
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.920]   Here's a reverse hot take, though, is OK, but we're looking at TMZ.
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:46.920]   I'm looking at that.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:47.920]   That's old school, right?
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.080]   That's basically unchanged from when we were kids.
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.080]   Right.
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.080]   Yeah, sure.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:55.600]   Celebrity boat, like maybe, you know, with girlfriends or something like that.
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.640]   Twitter is more interesting.
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:58.840]   I mean, like we have.
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.040]   So there's like this.
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:04.960]   This helps emphasize why this culture, which we have all these issues with, but why it
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:08.840]   persists is because TMZ, that's also boring, right?
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:10.200]   I mean, it's pretty boring.
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:14.040]   It's like, OK, like this guy's fat, like that kind of makes me know he's a star.
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:15.040]   He looks fat.
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.040]   You're not involved.
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.840]   Back to Lex's list, buddy.
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:19.240]   Maybe simple is good.
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:21.600]   Maybe we don't need these overcomplicated books.
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:24.920]   Maybe we just need to read some simple stuff that makes us happy, because look what we
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:26.160]   have done with this knowledge.
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.600]   We have turned into bad people.
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.560]   I see what you're saying.
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:33.760]   Where, yeah, when you compare to like the Twitter files and you do like a TMZ, it is
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:38.360]   very funny just to be like, there's a girl on a boat and I could see her belly button
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.760]   like, all right, sure.
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.640]   Is that dumbing us down?
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:46.520]   Perhaps should we be going on TMZ every day?
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:47.800]   No.
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.320]   What makes us worse?
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:52.080]   I don't know, buddy.
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:54.080]   And I'm just talking pure viral dynamics here.
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:58.560]   So even putting aside any sort of value judgment, it's like an interesting insight into why
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:03.040]   this is such an effective attention capturing machine for the people who get captured to
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.040]   it.
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:08.600]   Like in the early 90s, there's a version of TMZ where like they called you up, you
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:12.360]   know, like, hey, like, Cal, we got this footage, like, here's Leo, like, what's your take
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:13.360]   on it?
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.400]   Like you're in that room from the old syndicated TMZ TV show.
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:16.400]   Remember that?
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:20.640]   Where the guy had like the big cup of soda, like the giant cup.
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.640]   Yeah.
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:23.120]   And they're all like in there, like, what stories do you have?
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:24.720]   And like, you are in there, you'd be like, this is awesome.
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:25.720]   Like, this is so interesting.
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.640]   Like, I can give my take.
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:29.720]   And you'd be like, I think those women look too young.
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:31.560]   And like someone else high fives you would be great.
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:32.560]   Right.
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:34.840]   So it simulates that for hundreds of thousands of people.
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:37.880]   You all feel like you're in the proverbial TMZ room.
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:42.360]   I'm just saying to give some insight into why for the people who fall into the Twitter
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:50.900]   culture, it is so magnetic because it was better from just a pure stripped of any actual
[00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:54.400]   value evaluation, stripped of any judgment on whether this makes your life better or
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:58.520]   not, because spoiler alert, it makes your life worse, much worse stripped of all of
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:42:59.520]   that.
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:05.040]   So it's like an engagement engine like we haven't seen since what the Coliseum where
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:08.400]   it's like they're going to release these tigers on the Christians now.
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:09.800]   Like, all right, like I'm all in.
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:10.800]   Like, this is awesome.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:13.520]   He was like looking around, you know, I get to like give a thumbs up down.
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:14.520]   This is awesome.
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:17.600]   Like it's I see why it's so this is a perfect to me.
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:22.520]   It's a perfect example of why, you know, this company was worth $40 billion when Musk bought
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.520]   it.
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:25.600]   That's it's a perfect engagement machine.
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:30.520]   I don't know if it's too early to go into our new idea for a closing segment.
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:32.220]   I think it probably is too early.
[00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:38.320]   But so you know, I for the first time, and we've recorded a couple of these completely
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:44.080]   spaced out during your last speech, and just without realizing I'm doing our last segment,
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.920]   I just started fantasizing about living in the woods.
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:52.320]   Like I literally just as you were talking about, like comparing TMZ to Twitter, I was
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:54.920]   just in my head like, this is so bad.
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.200]   How do I escape all of this?
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.520]   And I just went the woods.
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:59.000]   That's how I escape all of it.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.720]   I go to the woods, and that's where I live forever.
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:02.760]   And that's you live in the woods.
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.280]   You have a ranch.
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:05.280]   You don't know.
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:10.680]   I have I teach my daughters how to go get eggs from the chickens that we raise.
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.320]   Yeah, that's it, dude.
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:13.320]   They got to be careful.
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:16.000]   I have a my dad's cousin.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.760]   So let me call that he's long lived in West Texas.
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:22.040]   You got to be careful down there what you call a ranch.
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:27.100]   You cannot call I mean, he has hundreds of acres with cattle on it.
[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:29.180]   He would never call it a ranch.
[00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:32.960]   You're going to get run over by a Ford F-150.
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.800]   For it to be a ranch, it has to be.
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:38.020]   So you call it he has some term for it.
[00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:39.920]   But anyways, I'm just saying, get your ranch.
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:40.920]   Don't call it a ranch.
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:48.080]   To be fair, if Ryan Holiday walks into West Texas and talks about his 10 acre ranch, stoicism
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:51.180]   or not, there's going to be like a six shooter.
[00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:54.360]   My ranch of a bookstore, the front porch, that's like a ranchers.
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:55.360]   Wouldn't it?
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:58.040]   No, I was going to call mine a compound of refuge.
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:00.040]   I was not going to call it a ranch.
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:02.480]   Definitely does not sound like a militia group type of situation.
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:03.840]   So it will be.
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:08.040]   Yeah, yeah, that is that's definitely the show.
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:13.400]   But you know, Tucker Max has a new podcast about he went that route where he's just like
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:17.040]   teaching himself how to like live off the land with his family.
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:20.720]   And he's like, yeah, man, all that stuff I thought I needed before.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:21.720]   I don't need it.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:27.000]   And it is very interesting that I believe social media is a huge part in it.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.320]   It's pushing a lot of us back to what would be seen as like very old school traditional.
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:39.360]   Oh, yeah, I'm just like, yeah, I want to farm in a family and God, Mike, fuck, just said
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:40.360]   that.
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:41.360]   And it's like, oh, it's me.
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:42.360]   That's where this is all push me.
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:44.360]   Yeah.
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:46.360]   No, if there's no Twitter, it'd be like, I don't know, like I'm into some punk bands
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:49.560]   and in the art, like it's probably actually bad.
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:52.480]   Just get around another take and make music.
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:58.280]   And like, you know, but but because it causes like a reactionary immune response of of I
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:03.000]   need to get away from purified cultures represented online.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.880]   I wonder if it's created an issue where it's just bringing people out of other types of
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:06.880]   culture to be interesting.
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:12.700]   Like I'm into this like interesting art or new music movement because it causes a reactionary
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:13.700]   immune response.
[00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:16.320]   It's like, I'm just going to go whittle like I don't want to have anything to do with like
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:17.560]   anything modern.
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:20.680]   So like stuff that's actually not online, but modern and interesting, you know, new
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:25.120]   types of theater, this or that maybe brings us back to Tumblr and the ponies, Tumblr and
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.120]   the ponies.
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:27.120]   All right.
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:28.440]   Let's do a couple let's do a couple happier ones here.
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:29.440]   Let's see what we got.
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:30.440]   There's some.
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:31.440]   All right.
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:32.440]   Quick hits.
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:33.440]   Oh, dear.
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:34.440]   OK, I know what this is.
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:35.440]   All right.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:36.440]   Good trial.
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:37.440]   All right.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:46.400]   So this is this is a this is one of the most watched videos on YouTube.
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:49.960]   I just glanced at that and I literally thought you were like, let's do some happier stories.
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:52.640]   And I thought it was like a cross burning on like a front lawn.
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:55.880]   And I was like, hey, bud, you're trying to get canceled here.
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:57.500]   What's your idea of a happy story?
[00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:59.040]   This is where I reveal my true.
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:00.040]   Yeah.
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:05.760]   OK, so this is it's hard to see, but this had eighty eight million views in just a few
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:06.760]   weeks.
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:07.760]   OK, it's Mr. Beast.
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:11.520]   Do I have to because I want to find like what's popular on YouTube.
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:14.200]   He is the most subscribed YouTuber.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:16.680]   So he has the most subscribers of anyone on YouTube.
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:17.680]   This one of his recent videos.
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:19.400]   It's one of the most popular videos on YouTube.
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:25.320]   The title here is Hydraulic Press versus Lamborghini.
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:26.560]   I don't think there's a lot here.
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:27.560]   I'll just skip ahead.
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:28.560]   I won't play.
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:29.560]   I'll just skip the scene, man.
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:30.560]   Look at this.
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:31.560]   We got an ad.
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:36.240]   Isn't that just this is emblematic, by the way, of the whole.
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:41.740]   I think they're literally just crushing a car.
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:46.000]   We have to do a whole episode, by the way, on on YouTube ads because they're so good
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   and they're so bad.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.160]   I know my favorite ones.
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:53.280]   My podcast producer always gets on my.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:54.280]   Oh, here we go.
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:55.280]   They're crushing it.
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:58.360]   He always gets on my act about this because we have a YouTube channel for our podcast
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:02.400]   and he's like, you're not paying the like two dollars a month to not have to watch ads.
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:06.040]   You're on because every time like, hey, let me show you something, you know, in the clip.
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:07.040]   Let's change this.
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:08.040]   We sit there and watch ads.
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:13.820]   But if you're if you're watching, there's a two hundred thousand dollar car being crushed
[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:14.820]   in a hydraulic press.
[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:15.820]   Eighty million views.
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:16.820]   Wow.
[00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:20.620]   That's what's popular, man.
[00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:21.620]   But doesn't this.
[00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:26.540]   But look, my heart rate's not up like there's nothing about this that's like, OK, who's
[00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:28.540]   getting screwed with rage?
[00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:30.740]   Also, how how long is it?
[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:31.740]   It's ten minutes.
[00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:38.900]   Because, again, the YouTube algorithm, it it prioritizes and incentivizes you to have
[00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:40.180]   things over ten minutes.
[00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:43.800]   So now we are at nine minutes and forty one.
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:45.620]   Everyone watches to watch the Lamborghini gets crashed.
[00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:51.660]   So there's ten minutes or nine minutes and 40 seconds of not that of just like total
[00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:53.120]   garbage blah, blah, blah.
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:56.100]   And by the way, I don't want to say anything about Mr. B. Someone told me recently that
[00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:59.440]   he does like charity stuff, which like that would be cool.
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.480]   I've never heard of Mr. B.
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:04.860]   That's how out of the loop I am.
[00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:09.960]   I hadn't either until my podcast producer told me about him because he's the I guess
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:11.900]   he's been doing the interview rounds.
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:12.900]   So it's kind of emerged.
[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:13.900]   Yeah.
[00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:18.220]   All I know is from what I understand is he's much more popular than us.
[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:20.500]   He's a little bit more popular, a little bit more.
[00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:24.460]   But yeah, it's a I like I like to think of us as peers.
[00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:27.780]   So our our friend, Mr. B's, our fellow YouTuber.
[00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:28.780]   Yeah.
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:33.820]   I love what people do, though, like, you know, maybe I should I should have called him, you
[00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:35.780]   know, like maybe had him on the show next time.
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:38.380]   You know, that move where you act like you really could do that.
[00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:42.860]   Like, yeah, like maybe we should next time we'll have the beast master.
[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:48.000]   But what I understand is he took like a formula that was working on like, hey, this works
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.980]   well for YouTube and just pushed it times one hundred.
[00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:57.260]   Well, and I'll see stuff like that where I'm like, it's like guy does a flip or like car
[00:49:57.260 --> 00:50:00.100]   thing does it and I'm just like, who watches this?
[00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:02.500]   And then you look at 88 million people do.
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:03.500]   That's who does.
[00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:04.500]   And yeah.
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:08.340]   And they all have like matching wacky thumbnails and all these things.
[00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:14.900]   And what's so frustrating for me is to be vulnerable that I'll have these moments where
[00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:19.700]   people are big producers are talking to me about thumbnails and you just got to do this.
[00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:22.800]   And I'm just like, no, that's fucking stupid.
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:23.860]   And then I don't do it.
[00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:25.900]   And then I stay at the exact same place I'm at.
[00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:27.820]   And you just go, damn it.
[00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:31.420]   Do Cal and I have to crush a fucking Lamborghini to get this show bigger?
[00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:32.420]   I don't know.
[00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:34.700]   I would like to not.
[00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:35.700]   We might have to.
[00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:36.700]   We might have to.
[00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:37.940]   But look, I don't know.
[00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:40.660]   This makes me happy because it's does it.
[00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:41.660]   He looks nice.
[00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:42.660]   I don't know.
[00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:43.660]   Oh, he's nice.
[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:48.540]   Like no one's being this is not like I crush a Lamborghini because it's racist.
[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:49.860]   You know, he's just like crushing a Lamborghini.
[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:50.860]   Right.
[00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:52.100]   I mean, this is like, well, what happened if we crush?
[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:53.100]   I don't know.
[00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:54.100]   It's innocent.
[00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:55.100]   I'm trying to look him up right now.
[00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:57.420]   I just wrote Dr. Beast by accident.
[00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:58.420]   Mr. Beast.
[00:50:58.420 --> 00:50:59.420]   Geez, I'm so old.
[00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:02.740]   Yeah, he does look nice.
[00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:05.740]   He is that Lamborghini full of immigrants.
[00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:08.660]   We're about to figure out now that I was actually a terrible person.
[00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:10.020]   The old lefty in me.
[00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:11.220]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:12.220]   He's twenty four.
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:13.220]   All right.
[00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:15.500]   Now, are you mad?
[00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:20.540]   He's credited with pioneering a genre of YouTube videos that centers around expensive stunts.
[00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:23.620]   Look, there's part of me.
[00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:25.660]   And maybe this is self-righteous.
[00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:30.180]   But if I have that much money, like.
[00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:34.900]   Eighty percent of that money is going to charity, not fucking.
[00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:35.900]   I don't know, man.
[00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:37.460]   I think he get I.
[00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:39.420]   I think I don't know a lot.
[00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:40.620]   I think he gives it all away.
[00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:43.380]   I think I think what I've heard is he spins out like he has.
[00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:44.940]   He doesn't do cars or houses.
[00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:48.180]   Yeah, I don't think I think he's he's weird.
[00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:51.060]   Like from what I understand, like he's of YouTube.
[00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:55.620]   He's like he's in the he's like an agent of his whole existence, I think, has merged with
[00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:58.340]   YouTube like there is no other.
[00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:00.140]   I don't think he has houses and jets.
[00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:03.060]   I think he just does this like his whole life.
[00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:04.060]   All right.
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:05.060]   Now, the scoreboard.
[00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:06.740]   I'm I think he's an interesting guy.
[00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:07.740]   I'm going to look.
[00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:12.020]   I want to listen to at least he was probably on at least one of our friends podcasts.
[00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:16.300]   Well, here's what I saw when I was finding when I was looking to find a tweet about Lex
[00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:17.980]   and his books.
[00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:23.140]   The more recent tweet from like yesterday from Lex was a picture of Lex and Mr. Beast.
[00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:24.140]   Interesting.
[00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:25.540]   And he was saying, I just had a mom.
[00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:26.540]   Let's see.
[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:27.540]   Let me see if I can.
[00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:28.540]   It's still showing.
[00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:29.540]   Yeah.
[00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:30.540]   Let me see if I can.
[00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:31.540]   How to do this.
[00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:32.540]   I don't know how this is.
[00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:34.860]   Can we change the name of the podcast?
[00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:37.540]   The two old men try to figure out the Internet.
[00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:41.980]   We have to yell to like our like a ten or my ten year old son, Max, the thing is doing
[00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:44.140]   the thing again, doing the thing again.
[00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:45.140]   Look, here we go.
[00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:46.140]   Lex Fridman.
[00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:49.020]   I got to hang out with Mr. Beast yesterday and discuss some fascinating ideas about the
[00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:50.020]   future YouTube and Twitter.
[00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:51.540]   You know, steamer, brilliant, inspiring.
[00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:53.280]   We did a podcast about a few days.
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:58.240]   So like all of you would say like now I have to dislike Mr. Beast or how's that work?
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:04.460]   Is it if you're the interviewer or you have on old me already disliked Mr. Beast and I'm
[00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:06.980]   like talking myself out of it live on this show.
[00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:11.420]   Old me already dislike Mr. Beast because of just assumptions from like thumbnails, success
[00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:14.240]   and jealousy, smashing expensive things.
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:17.180]   And I'm just like, well, we could have fed the homeless if we sold that Lamborghini or
[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:18.180]   whatever.
[00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:23.160]   And and then I would see that Lex had him on that would confirm that he's a bad person.
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:26.480]   And then I would have to two weeks late go.
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:29.540]   Lex Fridman's book list book is stupid.
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:32.800]   His book of his list of books is dumb and I hate him.
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:34.500]   So how does it go?
[00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:36.460]   Like what's worse or is it the same?
[00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:42.240]   So like let's say me going on Joe Rogan's podcast versus having Joe Rogan as a guest
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:43.240]   on my podcast.
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:47.820]   So are you more culpable for interviewing someone versus being interviewed or does it
[00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:48.820]   go?
[00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:49.820]   It doesn't really matter.
[00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:50.820]   So what?
[00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:56.300]   So for me, the old version of me, I would probably be more mad at you for going on his
[00:53:56.300 --> 00:54:01.620]   show because if you are interviewing him, you can like try to hold him accountable or
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:02.620]   whatever.
[00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:06.940]   But modern day people got really mad at Joe for having Alex Jones on and people got really
[00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:07.940]   mad at Lex for having.
[00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:08.940]   Did he actually he did have Kanye on, right?
[00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:09.940]   Yeah.
[00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:10.940]   Oh yeah.
[00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:19.820]   So now I think it's kind of like equally both, but before it was like if you went on Rogan's
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:23.940]   and this is, I feel like a year ago, but it's also like Rogan had like Bernie Sanders on.
[00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:27.260]   So come on guys, what are you doing?
[00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:32.860]   And to me now it's like I go on, I go on platforms that are more right wing than me.
[00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:36.620]   Like I go on Glen Beck's a lot and the bottom line is like, well, I get my message out to
[00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:39.460]   a bunch of people who wouldn't have listened to me otherwise.
[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:42.820]   And I get to learn a bunch of things that I wouldn't have learned because I'm talking
[00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:45.220]   to someone sort of like outside of my network.
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:50.260]   And most importantly, you find out you actually have more in common with most people you think
[00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:51.980]   you disagree with the not.
[00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:54.060]   And then you get to go, Oh, hooray.
[00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:55.300]   Like that's actually really good news.
[00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:58.540]   Like when I have people who get mad at me for going on a show they disagree with, I
[00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:00.580]   go, Hey man, aren't you happy?
[00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:04.300]   Aren't you happy that this person you like supposedly me gets to go on in front of these
[00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:05.760]   millions of people.
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:07.780]   Or also like I bring back good news.
[00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:09.620]   I bring back the like, he's a good dude.
[00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:10.620]   Isn't that great?
[00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:13.460]   And then they're like, no, because we were already given our commands.
[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:14.460]   Interesting.
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:15.460]   Right.
[00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:16.460]   Right.
[00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:17.460]   Because you could say it'd be positive.
[00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:21.420]   I'm bringing a message you would like to a new audience and maybe that would change.
[00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:23.700]   No, because it's not actually about the message.
[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:29.060]   It's just about like people turning humanity into a video game.
[00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:30.060]   Yeah.
[00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:31.060]   Okay.
[00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:33.700]   But also that like long segment you did on Glenn show where you got out the chalkboard
[00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:36.660]   and began sketching out the great reset or whatever.
[00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:40.180]   I sketched out specifically the January six attacks.
[00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:42.020]   That's the type of thing.
[00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:46.460]   And look, I'm not, I don't want to judge just based on what show you go on, but when you
[00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:50.140]   were showing like the, the barrier, you know, that whole plan with the barriers over here
[00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:53.500]   are weaker and, and you know, it's a bad look.
[00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:54.500]   Drawing the costumes.
[00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:55.500]   You drew the horns.
[00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:56.500]   Yeah.
[00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:59.060]   It's about, that was a bad look.
[00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:04.220]   I want our show to get so popular Cal that like we have, you know, and like people will
[00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:05.220]   send like fan art in.
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:10.460]   I'm like, I desperately want someone to draw the chalkboard.
[00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:11.460]   You do my goodness.
[00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:12.460]   Okay.
[00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:14.860]   I mean, you'll be on a list, but here's how I've learned.
[00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:18.100]   Here's what I've learned just now looking at Mr. B's very popular channel.
[00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:24.220]   Our show is not going to be very popular.
[00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:25.220]   Lesson learned.
[00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:26.220]   Thanks, Mr. Beast.
[00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:30.900]   Well, now we get to know it's just, it's a passion project.
[00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:31.900]   That's fine.
[00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:32.900]   It's a passion project.
[00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:36.820]   It's me, you, my producer, and like a few people who are yelling at us.
[00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:37.820]   I'll take it.
[00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:38.820]   All right.
[00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:39.820]   All right.
[00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:40.820]   One more.
[00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:42.900]   Our new thing for the, I want the very last thing when possible just to be, I'm interested,
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:50.860]   a meme and my, my motto for a meme being popular is that it was if it came over like my family's
[00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:54.620]   text chest text thread, then, so here we go.
[00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:56.660]   This one was going around the internet.
[00:56:56.660 --> 00:56:59.260]   It's a little out of date now, but there we go.
[00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:00.260]   All right.
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:03.820]   This is just old school internet humor.
[00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:07.180]   If you're watching, it's one of those captures where you have to select all the speakers
[00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:11.500]   in a picture and there's a bunch of stairs speakers and two pictures of Kevin McCarthy
[00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:14.020]   and he's not selected.
[00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:15.020]   Everyone's happy.
[00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:16.020]   It's a meme.
[00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:17.940]   It's funny.
[00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:23.620]   I was on Twitter during the Kevin McCarthy thing and I made one joke about it and it
[00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:25.620]   seemed to have brought both parties together.
[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:30.300]   Once in a while you've got a politician that will unite people just from their hatred.
[00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:36.180]   You know, I feel like a Beto a little bit now, Kevin McCarthy, everyone's just like,
[00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:37.180]   yeah, you know what?
[00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:38.180]   You're right, bud.
[00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:39.180]   Fuck that guy.
[00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:40.180]   And then we go.
[00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:41.180]   Yeah.
[00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:42.180]   Let's.
[00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:44.980]   So let's pass budget reconciliation as long as we're together on that.
[00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:46.020]   Let's just fix healthcare.
[00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:47.020]   Come on.
[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:48.020]   Like as long as we're.
[00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:49.020]   Yeah.
[00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:50.020]   That's the key.
[00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:51.020]   Yeah.
[00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:54.660]   Well, I do like, I do like the idea of a meme, an episode bringing us together.
[00:57:54.660 --> 00:58:01.420]   I was going to say someone sent me something via email that was going around on the Internet
[00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:02.420]   and it really may.
[00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:04.460]   I don't, I don't have it here, but I'd love to me.
[00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:08.540]   What makes the meme funny is just, I love just a straight.
[00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:11.660]   You have a straight lay straight face picture in an absurd thing.
[00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:16.580]   Someone sent me a cover of a magazine from Rachel.
[00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:17.580]   Rachel Ray's on the cover.
[00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:19.020]   I think this is from like decades ago.
[00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:20.140]   It's the simple things.
[00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:24.740]   But the, the, the message on the meme was like, why commas are important.
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:29.940]   And it's like a real headline where it said like Rachel Ray finds inspiration in cooking
[00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:31.180]   her family and her dog.
[00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:33.460]   And it's a picture of her holding her dog.
[00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:36.020]   And they didn't have the, they didn't have the a comma.
[00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:37.020]   No boy.
[00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:39.500]   It just kind of looked like she was going to eat her dog.
[00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:40.500]   Sure.
[00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:41.500]   That's what I want.
[00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:42.500]   That's what I want.
[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:43.500]   That's what I'm.
[00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:44.500]   And you have to go out for.
[00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:46.420]   Well, because you have to go, ah, silly internet.
[00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:48.700]   And then, you know, that dog's not getting eaten.
[00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:49.900]   And so everyone kind of wins.
[00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:50.900]   We all go.
[00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:51.900]   Yeah.
[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:52.900]   Dog's fine.
[00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:53.900]   You're fine.
[00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:54.900]   Okay.
[00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:55.900]   She didn't eat her family.
[00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:56.900]   As far as I know, didn't eat her family.
[00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:57.900]   Everyone's happy.
[00:58:57.900 --> 00:58:58.900]   It was funny.
[00:58:58.900 --> 00:58:59.900]   It's great.
[00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:03.340]   Internet more of that internet as email cow memes about being eaten.
[00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:04.340]   Yeah.
[00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:05.500]   Like memes from 20 years ago.
[00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:06.500]   Oh, actually.
[00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:07.500]   Yeah.
[00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:09.580]   And we'll, we'll, maybe we'll feature your meme on the show.
[00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:12.260]   Oh, you can also send us now that I'm on this fast.
[00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:16.020]   You can also send us articles you want us to talk about or leave it in the comments in
[00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:17.420]   the YouTube section.
[00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:22.420]   Because, uh, again, I think that's why the show is funny, but we're the two worst people
[00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:23.420]   to be hosting the show.
[00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:24.420]   So we need your help.
[00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:26.860]   So if you like the show, spread the word about the show.
[00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:31.620]   Um, I usually say to follow me on social media, but don't subscribe to my sub stack.
[00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:32.620]   You can do it for free.
[00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:36.780]   Read my writing, Jamie kilstein.substack.com and my mental health comedy podcast advice
[00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:37.780]   not taken.
[00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:41.060]   You can go to Jamie kilstein.com or you can go over to youtube.com/Jamie kilstein.
[00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:43.060]   We're starting to put videos up.
[00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:45.460]   Um, and that's it.
[00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:48.660]   And let me just, let me just briefly plug Jamie's sub stack.
[00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:52.300]   He had a piece that was actually why good internet, because it was widely spread on
[00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:53.300]   the internet.
[00:59:53.300 --> 01:00:01.060]   Um, a really good piece about depression and suicidality and, and, you know, uh, how things
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:02.920]   can really change and really get better.
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:07.700]   So, uh, and I think it's important to emphasize like you really are coming at this from a
[01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:09.140]   strong mental health perspective.
[01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:14.700]   I mean, you're a comedian, but also you've, you help a lot of people with mental health.
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:17.460]   And so, you know, you see it through that perspective where I see it more through the
[01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:20.020]   perspective of I'm just baffled in an old man.
[01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:21.020]   And I just don't understand.
[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:22.020]   I just don't understand.
[01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:24.020]   Give me the memes, give Cal memes about mental health.
[01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:30.500]   I want an animated gif, uh, yeah, an animated gif that I can download from an FTP server.
[01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.500]   Jamie just trying to jump off a bridge.
[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:33.500]   I mean, yeah.
[01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:37.620]   Um, for real guys, like I think with the mental health stuff, I try to talk about it in a
[01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:40.900]   way that, um, a lot of people can relate to.
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:43.540]   I didn't know I was helping as many people as I was.
[01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:49.460]   Um, but it's, it's because I'm, I'm not an expert and I'm going through it with you guys.
[01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:54.300]   Um, and I, I, I'm making sure not to like talk down, you know, you read some self help
[01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:59.140]   stuff that's like, Oh, I just, I go on my cold plunge every morning and then I, and
[01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:00.180]   you're just like, wow, what?
[01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:01.380]   This is very unrelatable.
[01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:05.060]   Um, whereas I'm like, I'm fucking, I need health insurance.
[01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:06.940]   And they're like that guy, he's my guy.
[01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:08.900]   If he, if he can survive, I can survive.
[01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:09.900]   So, uh, expand.
[01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:10.900]   That means a lot.
[01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:11.900]   Yep.
[01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:12.900]   And I've been in a cold plunge this entire episode.
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:16.540]   I'm very ill.
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:18.540]   You weak loser.
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:22.580]   I have been in a cold plunge and I've been holding a kettlebell in my right arm this
[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:26.100]   whole, this whole time because that's my bow pulling arm.
[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:27.100]   That's good.
[01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:28.100]   That's good.
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:29.100]   L-cunting.
[01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:30.340]   We're about to get famous now.
[01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:31.540]   I am on top of things.
[01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:32.540]   All right.
[01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:34.180]   So anyways, we're going to crush the Lamborghini and then we're out of here.
