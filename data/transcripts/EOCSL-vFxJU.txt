[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   All right, what do we got here Matt?
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   Matt says you've argued
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.680]   about not basing
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.180]   your career decisions on passions
[00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:17.200]   But what about one's temperament specifically under the big five personality model if one is low in
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:24.320]   Conscientiousness or particularly high in openness. How should that be considered to avoid getting into an ill-suited role?
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.280]   All right, so I put this back-to-back with Larry's question because they're both dealing with careers
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.560]   And they're both dealing with ideas for my book so good. They can't ignore you
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.560]   Now I think what's happening here again is
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:44.720]   Too strict of an interpretation of what I am talking about. So in so good. They can't ignore you. I
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.880]   reject what I called the passion hypothesis, which is this idea that the primary factor in
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:58.300]   Generate a feeling of fulfillment or passion in your career is matching the type of work you do to the pre-existing passion
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.180]   You can match your work successfully to what you're meant to do
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.760]   You will find your work fulfilling and if you get this match wrong, you won't
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.720]   That was a dominant hypothesis
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.800]   When I was writing so good, they can't ignore you. It is a dominant hypothesis today, though
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.720]   I would say not as strong now as it was back then. It's often summarized with the
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.560]   Axiom follow your passion. They argued that's wrong
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.200]   Now Matt, I think you're taking that argument and you're pushing it farther to say, okay, nothing nothing really matters
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.760]   Nothing intrinsic at all matters for whether or not you're gonna like your job and that's actually not true
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:42.640]   I'm pushing back against a strong form of the matching hypothesis that a match to a pre-existing passion is all that matters
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.680]   And I'm saying no. No, it's more complicated than that. The choice of job is not trivial
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.680]   But it is not the single
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.480]   Determinant factor of whether or not you end up passionate about your work the real important stuff happens after you choose your job
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.600]   Do you build rare and valuable skills like we talked about with the last?
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.480]   question
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.960]   Are you applying those rare and valuable skills as leverage to move your career towards things that resonate and away from things that don't?
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:15.600]   Towards your ideal lifestyle and away from traps that you want to avoid. Are you crafting your career in a way that is
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.560]   Consistent and complements your vision of a deep life if you're doing this that's very hard work
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.360]   It takes time and strategy over many years. That is where real passion grows
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.200]   The actual initial choice of the job is just the first small step in that long journey. That's really what I'm arguing
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.840]   however
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.280]   Making that first small step choosing what job you want to do. That's not throwing a dart at
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.860]   A job listing board and say it doesn't matter at all what job I have you still want to think about it
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.520]   So your temperament yes, it matters pick a job that's better suited for your temperament
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.440]   Do you like to be around people? Do you like to be alone? Sure
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.100]   You see your personality matters skills. You already have matters if you're coming out of school with a math degree. You're pretty good at it
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.560]   Well, that's going to get you some career capital much faster than if you become a yoga instructor
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.720]   So pre-existing skills matter a general interest in the field sure that matters
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.920]   You know like I'm interested in academia seems romantic to me. So, you know
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.360]   That is a mark in favor of going to graduate school all that stuff matters
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:27.900]   so use what you have when making your choice, but keep in mind that there may be many different jobs that make sense for you to
[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.560]   pursue and
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.040]   Once you make the choices what happens next is ultimately decide whether or not you get
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.520]   Fulfilling out of it. So Matt you can take your temperament into account take your skills into account interest into account
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.520]   I'm a big believer in
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.120]   Looking at what would the opportunities be if and when I get really good at this job?
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.880]   and do I see down the line opportunities that are really going to give me a lot of
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.840]   Control over my life or open up the things that are really important to my ideal lifestyle. That's all critical
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.600]   Don't just throw a dart
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.860]   But don't think that the choice by itself is all that it takes to love your work and don't over sweat that choice
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.800]   There's usually many right answers. The issue is not I'm going to choose the wrong job
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.840]   The real issue for most people is I'm going to do the wrong things
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.360]   Once I have a job
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.600]   All right, I think we've had a bunch of men in a row so I have some women here
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.740]   There's three in a row. I did this by accident. But actually we had a run of men. They'll have a run of
[00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.880]   Women asking questions. So let's actually get to some reasonable questions then
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.200]   [outro music]
