[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080]   All right, hi, can you introduce yourself? Hi my name is Abraham Ramos and I am from the Philippines
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.160]   born and raised specifically in Davao city and I go to Soledad Gloria Christian Church.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.320]   All right and Abraham you've been reading from the LSB a little bit what do you think?
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:25.120]   I think it's great especially comparing to with other translations and well I currently I'm at TMS
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:32.880]   and we're really into the greek and hebrew and every time I just learn and translate from the
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:40.000]   original languages and I compare it to the LSB it has been a great great help just to see oh and
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.640]   understand you know the the interpretive decisions translation decisions and seeing how LSB was
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.920]   really seeking to be faithful to what you see in the in the original languages. So in my study it
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.640]   hasn't been phenomenal it's been a great blessing to see that in English you know they're reflecting
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.160]   the original languages. All right
