[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   In a street fight, I would rather fight Francis and Gannoune and fight Bas Ruton.
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.880]   In a street fight.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:13.040]   Yeah, so very often people ask me the difference between a street fight and a fight in mixed
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.040]   martial arts.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.560]   The difference is in the street there is no referee.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:24.440]   And there is an instigator and there is the other person.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:31.120]   The best in life for a street fight is always to not be the instigator because you have
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.720]   the element of surprise.
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:40.080]   So if you're in a heated argument with someone and then you feel that you potentially going
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.880]   to be in a fight, the best thing to do is to never show your center line.
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.960]   To always go on the side and put your hand up like this.
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.160]   That's one of the best things to do.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.560]   It's a self-defense tactic that is used all around the world.
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.080]   Because from there, the distance that I have to travel to cause a lot of damage to him
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.880]   is very minimal.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:01.880]   You know, it's very short.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.720]   You know, I can go boom, I can go boom, and I'm protected because if he ever tried to
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.060]   do anything, my hands are already up.
[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.420]   But I'm ready to respond at any aggression.
[00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.960]   So the first thing is if you're in an argument and you feel the heat is rising, is to eat
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.960]   first.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.480]   You don't want to fight, but you want to eat first.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.960]   You want to hit first, you know.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.960]   So it's either boom, hit first.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.720]   Depending on the situation, if you're someone who's much less physically strong than the
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:43.180]   aggressor, you can use it in the eyes, in the genitals, in the neck, you know, and then
[00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.600]   you can leave the scene.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.880]   However, if I'm like this and the minute he touches me, he declares war.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.720]   Now I can go and perform a self-defense move.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.280]   Striking, not wrestling.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.280]   Yes, yes.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.600]   It's always striking first and leave the scene.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.920]   If you're, for example, a kid or someone who's not as physically, doesn't have the physical
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.860]   strength of your aggressor.
[00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.740]   Of course, I'm a UFC champion, so that does not apply to me.
[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.640]   But the key is on a tactical, we always use the element of surprise.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.040]   And when you strike, strike first and strike to cause the most damage as possible.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.940]   The eyes, you can use the neck and do the genitals.
[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.080]   And then after you can leave the scene.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.120]   That's the gold of having the element of surprise.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.440]   Okay, you were talking about knives.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.440]   Yes.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.440]   What about weapons are involved?
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.720]   Run faster?
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.400]   So weapons is very important.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.160]   If someone has a weapon and attack me for having my money, I give him my money.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.640]   Even if I'm just St-Pierre and I'm UFC champion.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:06.840]   However, someone put a knife on my throat here and he's telling me to go in the trunk.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.640]   I don't want to go in the trunk because I know it might, I've seen this movie and it's
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.800]   a bad ending.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.960]   So things that I can do first, it's always make sure that I try to make my hand as close
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.360]   as possible as the weapon.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.560]   And I try to be as close range as possible.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.520]   If he's here, I cannot do it because the distance is too far.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.000]   If he's here, that's idea.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.040]   So I can act like I want to...
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.040]   Look scared?
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.040]   Yeah.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.040]   Please, please, please.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.040]   Boom.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.520]   So here I use my body and then I can go and break.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.200]   So the idea is to use your entire body to deflect the weapon.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.840]   So if the weapon is like this and the blade is coming out this way, I use the element
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.840]   of surprise.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.120]   I use my body not only grabbing him like this.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.560]   So if he tried to come back with the knife, it's solid.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.000]   Then I can go and break.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.880]   If the blade is pointing the other side, it's same thing here.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:10.200]   Here I can use my body always to smother the weapon.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.840]   And join the rest.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.840]   Yeah.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.680]   But if it's out here, it's true.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.680]   If it's out here, you know, and yes, exactly.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.440]   It's too, there's too much distance.
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.360]   You want to make sure you get close to the weapon because that's what can cause the most
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.360]   damage.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.360]   This is very important.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.360]   There is other situation.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.000]   If the opponent, let's say you're a kid or someone come grab you by the body here, you
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   grab him by the body.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.800]   What I can do is grab the head and put my fingers inside the eyes.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.680]   Will make my opponent to release me immediately.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.120]   Then I can go and leave.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.600]   Like Tom?
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.360]   Yeah, Tom in the eyes.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.360]   You push in the eyes.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.360]   The blind him.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.360]   There is no rules.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:03.080]   The eyes is always my favorite choice to go for, because if you cannot see, it's very
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.240]   hard to fight.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.360]   And normally the reflex for most people, when they can't see, they grab their eyes, you
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.560]   know, so it released the grip.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.760]   I'm not going to ask you about the tie because I think you're wrong.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.760]   I think it's possible.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:25.160]   So like if you, it's possible to use it as a same as for like a head snatch, like this
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.160]   kind of situation.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.160]   It's supposed to choke.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.400]   I think it could be an advantage if it's a fake tie.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:37.960]   If it's, if it's like something that can go like, like a reptile, that like a tail of
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.240]   a reptile that can go.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.560]   So if you try to pull my tie, it goes on.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.360]   And now I know I get a head start.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.360]   Element of surprise.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.360]   Exactly.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.640]   It's all about the element of surprise.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.360]   You want to strike first the element of surprise in this street.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.480]   George, thank you so much for talking today.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.480]   My pleasure.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.280]   Thank you for looking sharp.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.280]   Men in black, baby, men in black.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.280]   Thank you.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.280]   Thank you.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.280]   Thank you.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.280]   Thank you.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.280]   Thank you.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:23.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
