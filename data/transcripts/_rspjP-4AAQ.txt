[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.040]   We have a big week ahead with Easter looming,
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.560]   but today we talk retirement.
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.020]   And of course we're moving from winter to spring,
[00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.360]   and as we make this transition,
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.360]   the snowbirds are moving from the south
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.080]   back to northern cities and towns.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.200]   And Kyle in Somerset, Kentucky emails in,
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.040]   "Hello, Pastor John,
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.020]   "do you have any thoughts on snowbirding,
[00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.880]   "the practice of retirees who leave for warmer climates
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.780]   "during the cold months
[00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.140]   "and return when the weather gets warmer?
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.000]   "As a minister in a local church,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.680]   "I have seen segments of the population
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.840]   "disappear in the winter,
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.060]   "and it seems to have an impact
[00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.860]   "on the life of the congregation.
[00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.920]   "Do you see this as an acceptable practice for believers,
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.360]   "and how can church leaders address this issue with care
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.540]   "and without giving unnecessary offense
[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.240]   "to those who have worked hard during their careers
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.060]   "and feel this is their prerogative?
[00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.520]   "Thanks for any insight you can give."
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.080]   I just turned 70, all right?
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.080]   So I feel an increasingly privileged position
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.000]   from which to make pronouncements
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.440]   about the evils of the American dream
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.120]   of so-called retirement.
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.980]   - And you live year-round in Minneapolis.
[00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.760]   - I do, I do.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.620]   It's natural to go to Florida in January from Minneapolis.
[00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.060]   That would be a natural thing to do.
[00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.460]   Helpful, maybe not, but natural, yes.
[00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.180]   So this question about snowbirds
[00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.740]   is part of a larger question
[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.860]   about how those of us who have stepped away
[00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.080]   from our lifelong means of livelihood
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.180]   should be spending the last 20 years of our lives.
[00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.780]   That's the big question,
[00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.220]   much bigger than just snowbirding.
[00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.380]   The Bible is not silent about this
[00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.820]   because it's not silent about life,
[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.620]   and the period between 65 and 85 is called life.
[00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.380]   It's not something else.
[00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.460]   In fact, it is a crucial part of life
[00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.600]   because it is the last period of preparation
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.380]   before we stand before the Lord face-to-face
[00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.680]   and give an account for every idle word and moment,
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.540]   according to Matthew 12, 36.
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.540]   Snowbirding is just one of many lifestyle issues
[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.300]   that come with being fairly wealthy Western people.
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.540]   Most people in the world don't have these choices, right?
[00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.900]   We have these choices,
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.100]   at least many of us do.
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.500]   We could just pull up and go and rent
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.420]   and live in another place.
[00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.420]   It's in the same category with questions,
[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.100]   should you have a lake home?
[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.820]   How many homes should you have?
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.300]   How many vacations should you take?
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.300]   And how long should they be?
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.140]   And where should they be?
[00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.460]   And how expensive should they be?
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.140]   And should you go to the lake every weekend
[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.060]   during the summer and teach your grandchildren
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.620]   how to skip church?
[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.420]   Should you spend thousands of dollars
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.620]   on eating out every year?
[00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.140]   How many cars should you have?
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.060]   And what kind?
[00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.140]   And where should you live?
[00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.620]   And what kind of house should you buy?
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.060]   And what neighborhood should you live in?
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.620]   Or should you just rent and on and on and on?
[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.460]   The lifestyle questions go, right?
[00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.180]   So I've tried over the years,
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.100]   both in writing and in preaching,
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.740]   to address these things generally
[00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.260]   rather than specifically.
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260]   I've never, to my knowledge in any way,
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.620]   said in public, you can't live here.
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.340]   You can't buy that.
[00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.300]   You can't have that.
[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.060]   Because it just seems to me that
[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.980]   the Bible doesn't do it that way.
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.500]   It doesn't go about specifying those kinds of things
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.020]   so that we have a nice list that we can all check,
[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.940]   whether being naughty or nice,
[00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.060]   with regard to the things we buy or not.
[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.820]   Rather, it seems to me that the Bible goes about it
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.820]   in a much broader, more general way.
[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.100]   And that's what we should do too.
[00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.540]   So my approach has been, and I commend it to others,
[00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.980]   if that's a pastor asking about
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.780]   what to say about his snowbirds,
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.780]   call for a radical Christian wartime lifestyle
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.980]   based on clear biblical passages of love and sacrifice
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.780]   and suffering in ministry and the brevity of life
[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.660]   and the lostness of the world
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.820]   and the suffering of those around us,
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.580]   all of which I think have the tendency,
[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.660]   for virtually everybody,
[00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.660]   have the tendency to guard us against luxury and opulence
[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.820]   and to move toward need rather than toward comfort
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.500]   and security, toward generosity and simplicity.
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.940]   Those are the, that's the drift of the New Testament
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.940]   rather than maximizing our own comforts and luxuries now.
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.780]   So on the issue of snowbirding,
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.260]   I wouldn't scold older people in my church who do this,
[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.620]   especially not from the pulpit.
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.980]   Rather, I would spend a few years
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.380]   trying by word and prayer and example
[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.540]   to create a mindset in the church
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.300]   which knows and feels that self-sacrifice
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.820]   and generosity and ministry and love
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.260]   are where true joy is found.
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.740]   And I would try to show over and over from the Bible,
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.120]   from modern life,
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.020]   that following the mindset of the world
[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.900]   to maximize comfort and escape hardship
[00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.900]   is the path of boredom and guilt and emptiness in the end.
[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.700]   I would labor in the exposition of the word
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.220]   to create that mindset in the church
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.380]   before I address specifics like snowbirding.
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.260]   And then I might get more specific
[00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.660]   with regard to a period called retirement.
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.620]   And I would try to create a mindset
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.140]   among older people in the church
[00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.960]   that this is a golden opportunity,
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.620]   not for coasting and resting and playing
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.380]   and self-indulgence, but for ministry and service
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.380]   and meeting needs and making disciples and showing love,
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.060]   maximizing usefulness,
[00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.740]   not maximizing physical pleasures
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.620]   through leisure and luxury.
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.540]   God has not given us 70-somethings,
[00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.700]   us 70-somethings,
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.380]   a lifetime of experience with God and with the world
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.280]   to be shelved while we putz around endlessly
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.960]   with our hobbies and games and leisures
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.860]   and let all of that experience with God
[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.440]   and with the world that should be making us useful,
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.640]   we just don't wanna shelve it.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.420]   So very practically,
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.300]   I would try to get everybody to buy J.I. Packers,
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.420]   or maybe I would buy them and give them away.
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.760]   Everybody over 60 in my church
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.020]   get a copy of J.I. Packers' book
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.820]   called "Finishing Our Course with Joy,
[00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.240]   Guidance from God for Engaging with Aging."
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.020]   Really clever title.
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.640]   Packer develops a biblical vision
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.160]   for what these older years might look like.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.680]   And I just jotted down here a cluster of quotes,
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.620]   and I'm gonna read them.
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:27.660]   Here's what he says.
[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.660]   "Aging is not for wimps.
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.500]   So far as bodily health allows,
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:38.440]   we should aim to be found running the last lap of the race
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.900]   of our Christian life, as we would say, flat out.
[00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:46.020]   Retirees are admonished in our day,
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.340]   both explicitly and implicitly,
[00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.540]   in terms that boil down to this,
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:54.420]   relax, slow down, take it easy, amuse yourself,
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.580]   do only what you enjoy.
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.980]   I see," Packer says,
[00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:01.780]   "I see this agenda, well-meant as it is,
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.100]   as wrong-headed in the extreme.
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.460]   I think it is one of the huge follies of our time,
[00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.600]   about which some frank speaking is in order
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.240]   and indeed overdue.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:17.780]   For the moment, I leave aside its lack of Christian content
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.540]   and focus on the fact that it prescribes idleness,
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.640]   self-indulgence, irresponsibility,
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.680]   as the goal of one's declining years.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.320]   This, over time, will generate a burdensome sense
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.400]   that one's life is no longer significant,
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.060]   but has become quite simply useless.
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:38.760]   The challenge that faces us," this is still Packer,
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:43.220]   "The challenge that faces us is not to let physical slowing
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.840]   down produce spiritual slowing down,
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.000]   but to cultivate the maximum zeal for the closing phase
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.740]   of our earthly life."
[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.860]   Well, I love that.
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.840]   The last phase, maximum zeal.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.280]   So, this is Piper now talking.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:03.000]   So, the key question with regard to snowboarding
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.700]   is not a matter of schedule or geography or temperature.
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.640]   It's a matter of ministry.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:14.040]   The question to ask is, do you move,
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:19.040]   wherever you move, Florida, Mexico, New Mexico, Phoenix,
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:24.720]   wherever you, do you move as a means of maximizing ministry,
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.160]   maximizing spiritual growth and impact?
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.320]   Is there a greater impact for ministry in Florida
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.920]   than in Northern Minnesota?
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.360]   Will you have a more integral influence for Christ
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.220]   in the big mega church that you visit in Florida
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.120]   than you would have if you stayed in your rural church
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.460]   in Wisconsin or Kentucky or wherever?
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.180]   Are you thinking mainly of comfort,
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:56.060]   or are you thinking mainly of your own,
[00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:59.200]   or mainly meeting needs, comfort or meeting needs,
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:03.220]   not just your own needs, but the needs of others.
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.640]   And so lastly, that's the kind of question
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.520]   I would be asking.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.460]   If a pastor has established a vision
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:17.120]   for a ministry mindset between 60 and 85,
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.380]   he might then be in a position to speak individually
[00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:24.680]   with the snowbirds with a view to challenging them
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.680]   for something fulfilling and useful and joyful
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.900]   on the home front in the cold of winter.
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.900]   And my guess is that a lot more spiritual heat of soul
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:40.920]   and warmth of love would be generated
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.920]   by ministering in the snow than by migrating with the geese.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.400]   Maybe not, maybe not,
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.380]   but I think that's the question to ask.
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:53.520]   Yeah, it sure is.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.600]   Those are really valuable points of consideration.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.960]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.520]   And for more on retirement,
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.040]   see John Piper's booklet, "Rethinking Retirement."
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.400]   It's only 30 pages long, but you can download it.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.880]   You can download the PDF right now,
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.800]   free of charge at desiringgod.org/books.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.360]   Tomorrow, we look at prayer,
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.940]   and John Piper will return to answer a question
[00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.140]   from a listener who wants to know
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.720]   how he can refresh a sluggish prayer life.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.560]   You won't want to miss it.
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.880]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.380]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.540]   (silence)
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.700]   (silence)
[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.860]   (silence)
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:39.860]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
