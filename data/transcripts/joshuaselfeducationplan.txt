[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.260]   This is a 21 and over event.
[00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.560]   - Anarchy and Yaks?
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.500]   - Who does he think he is?
[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.840]   - Get off the couch.

[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.880]   ♪ [music] ♪
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.260]   - Hey there, guys. This is Nick Hazleton, the Narco-Yakitalist with the 62nd episode
[00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.800]   of Narco-Yakitalism. You guys will like what I've got today.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.240]   This guy is great. I really dig Bash in school. Wax and philosophy is fun too,
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.920]   but nothing gets me fired up more than somebody talking about how to run a
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.080]   business. So without further ado, here it is.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:24.760]   Joshua Sheets back on. I'm super excited. I had Joshua on to talk about how to...
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.800]   I think it was...basically, the show was how to get rich as a young person.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.240]   And it was an awesome show. I think it was one of the best, if not the best shows I've
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.280]   put out. And that was a while ago. So I'm really happy to have you back.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.920]   How are you doing?
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.880]   - Yeah, I'm good. And I'm glad to be back. And I'm more glad that you've actually done
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.720]   it. I think it's what we talked about at that. In and of itself, automatically,
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.240]   it takes you out of the bottom 80% and moves you into the top 20% because the vast
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.960]   majority of people listen to a tremendous amount of advice and do nothing.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.280]   So I'm glad to see you following through. That was the only reason I was willing
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.800]   to come back.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.440]   - Well, I appreciate that. And I didn't mention this, but you're from the...you run
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.600]   and host the Radical Personal Finance Podcast, right?
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.600]   - Absolutely. Yeah.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.920]   - So you have some ethos to speak on when we talk about finances.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.560]   - It's kind of been a long-time hobby and a long-time profession as well. So hopefully,
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.600]   at this point, I have some ideas that can be useful to people. If not,
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.040]   then I don't know what I'm doing. If the amount of time that I've spent studying
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.040]   and thinking about these things can't be useful to some people, then I've done
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.880]   something drastically wrong. But the audience says that the content is useful,
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.520]   so I'm glad to have it.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.520]   - Yeah. Well, I love it. I love your show. I haven't listened in a little while,
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.160]   but I always...when I listen to any of your shows, I'm like, "Yes, this is great."
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.080]   Even if it's about retirement and I don't need to think about that for another 50
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.280]   years, I still do. So I appreciate what you're doing, and I appreciate you coming
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.640]   on to talk about my self-education plan.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.800]   - Yeah. One of the keys to any kind of life success is having a long time horizon,
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.720]   thinking far in advance. And it's a big difference between even the classes.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.040]   You can segregate in our modern society, you can segregate people based upon lower
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.360]   class, middle class, and upper class based upon their length of time horizon.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.800]   The upper class people are planning generations in advance. Just think of the
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.240]   people who rule the world. They've planned out generations in advance.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.600]   They've thought things through. My favorite story of that is Rothschild.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.480]   You know, he sends his five kids, the original Rothschild patriarch,
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.720]   he sends his five kids out to set up a banking empire in five different countries
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.800]   knowing that for the rest of his life, he'll never see them again.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.960]   But to this day still, the Rothschild family has an incredible amount of wealth
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.160]   and power, and much of it was due to the foresight of the original founder.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.600]   And you can pass through each of the classes of society.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.240]   Middle class people think about planning to make sure they have some money saved
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.120]   for their down payment on their house. They think forward about retirement.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.240]   And so middle class people think in the context of their own lifetime.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.960]   And then lower class people are often thinking about just the next step.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.480]   And sometimes that's due to just simply simple circumstances.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.600]   You know, if you've got a hungry belly, you can't afford to be thinking about how
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.720]   am I going to do generationally? You've got to be thinking about where's
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.240]   my next meal going to come from? Some of it is due to just simply ignoring
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.440]   the opportunities that are available to them.
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.960]   But the longer your time horizon can go, the more you can move up through the
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.320]   classes of society.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:55.800]   I do try to think beyond myself as well. My dad has done this with our work here on the farm.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.360]   So I had you on to come talk about this self-education plan.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.360]   I had Brett Vannott from the School Sucks podcast on to talk about this from an
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.120]   educational standpoint. And we got into a little bit of philosophy,
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:14.040]   I think, too, on why am I doing this. And I wanted to have a financial standpoint
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.440]   on this. And you also gave me some good tips here.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:23.160]   And I believe I added this on to everything. I listed out on all of these things I wanted
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.720]   to do. So like the yak dairy. I had my materials
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.800]   and what I would get the material skills and then how I need to do it and then what I'd
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.880]   learn. And then you told me, "Well, you should also
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:41.040]   add in why is it important to you?" So I think I can't remember exactly what you
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.960]   said, but I'm thinking that this is because it brings it more personal.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.960]   It makes it more personal. It puts it in a great perspective.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.640]   If your why is strong enough with anything, you'll figure out the how.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:00.000]   So think about the example that I've never heard of a better one.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.040]   The example of if you -- how old are you at this point, Nick?
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.440]   I'm 17. Okay.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.400]   So you might be able to answer this, but if your listening audience were a little bit
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.920]   older, you can at least appreciate the example. If you were a parent and you had a son or
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.640]   daughter that you really cared about or if you had a niece or nephew that you really
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:24.920]   liked and you found out that your son or daughter, your niece or nephew was diagnosed with a
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:31.520]   terminal disease, but that there is a vaccine available for that disease that can cure them
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.000]   and they're going to die one year from today without the vaccine, but with the vaccine,
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.600]   they could actually live. That vaccine costs $10,000 and you've got
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:46.640]   to earn and save the money to do it. I ask people as a mental image, I say, "If
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:52.440]   you had to, could you earn and save $10,000 in the next year to save the life of your
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:58.200]   child or a child that you like?" And the answer 100% of the time is yes.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:04.200]   And so I learned that example years ago from a Dave Ramsey class that I went through and
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:10.320]   it just stuck with me as being the perfect example of how if your why is strong enough,
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.000]   you'll figure out the how. Now, nobody knows how they would do it.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.720]   They just know that if they needed to, if the stakes were high enough, they would do
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.160]   it, whether it meant they got extra jobs, whether it meant they sold something, who
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.680]   knows, but they would figure out a way to do it.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:30.040]   So the key to good goal planning is getting very, very clear on why something is important
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:36.720]   to you and the more reasons why something is important to you that you can stack up,
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.720]   the better. As you stack those reasons up, you will follow
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:44.120]   through if the reasons are enough. And then also to think through the how. If
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.840]   you just think through the how and you don't think through the why, you might not have
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.880]   the emotional strength to follow through when times are tough because the how isn't actually
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.240]   going to work. If you look at business planning, there are
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.760]   studies that I've read and articles that I've read that talk about the percentage of businesses
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:05.920]   that actually succeed who have started with a good business plan and it's much, much higher.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.600]   One of the things you want to think about whenever you're starting a business is constructing
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.560]   very carefully an excellent, carefully thought through business plan that provides for as
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:19.400]   many eventualities as you can consider. But when they've done research with those business
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.920]   owners who have actually followed through and built those businesses, they ask them,
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:29.000]   "How often do you refer to the plan?" The surprising answer is, "Well, not very often."
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.520]   And so what seems to be the case is it's not so much having the plan that makes the difference.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:40.880]   It's having thought through the plan and thought through things in advance that makes the difference
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.720]   because once you're out in the war, so to speak, you've got bullets flying at you. You
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.400]   don't have time to go out and dig out the manual and see what to do. You just pull the
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.560]   gun and fire. That's what business owners often are doing.
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.480]   But if they've thought through in advance where they're going, then they're probably
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:02.360]   going to take better shots. Most businesses will follow a path of change where somebody
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.440]   will set out with an initial vision and then they'll move forward, but that vision will
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.440]   change, but still it's the planning. So when you combine those two things together and
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.760]   you've thought through very careful plans for how something can be achieved and you
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:19.240]   have very important reasons why, then you bring a lot of energy and a lot of clarity
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.760]   to your goals.
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:26.360]   And then perhaps the most important thing behind the why is you might find that you've
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:31.880]   set a goal, you've built a plan, but you don't really have any compelling reasons why
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:37.840]   something is important to you. So in that case, after a while, you might work on it
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.840]   and then after a while, you realize, "I don't care about this. I don't have any why for
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.400]   it, so why am I wasting my time?" and you just quit. That's the best thing in the world
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.560]   because you quit doing something that's not important, which frees you up to do something
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.800]   that you do care about. So it's also a good test to know, "Am I working on the right goals
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:58.960]   if I have enough really emotionally strong whys?"
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:09.360]   Yeah, I like that. I've never really thought that through, but I think you're totally right
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:17.720]   and I do try to do that kind of consciously. My main goal is I want to be comfortable.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.880]   I want to be happy and I want to make sure that I'm going down a path that's going to
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:32.720]   most benefit me, not necessarily financially, but in the long run, I'm shooting for happiness
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:38.880]   and content with my life. So whatever that means, that's where I'm going for. So yeah,
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:46.520]   I like that. I think that's exactly right and I have expressed that on the show, goals-oriented
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:51.240]   decision-making and looking at the long-term goal, like where do you want to be and how
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.960]   do you want to feel and is this going to help you out get there? And if it isn't, then don't
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:56.960]   do it.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.680]   Right. The biggest waste of time is to do something well that doesn't need to be done
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:01.680]   at all.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.680]   That's a good quote.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:08.240]   It's not original with me. I don't know who to cite or I would cite them, but it's not
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.720]   original, but it is an apt quote.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:18.200]   Okay. Well, all right. So let's dive into this plan. So the first thing I set out with
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:22.600]   was let's make a statement. Why am I doing this and what am I supposed to be doing in
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:27.360]   a very broad sense? And so I wrote, this is what I plan to do outside of school because
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:33.360]   this was the alternative to going to school. So I decided I'm going to list all the responsibilities,
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:38.400]   goals and actions that I plan to have and take to become a self-educated and independent
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.800]   entrepreneur, which is something that I didn't think I could do in school.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:48.160]   So this is exactly what this plan is, is how to become a self-educated, independent entrepreneur
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:54.840]   and being the main goal here is to live a good life. And I've explained that in other
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:12:00.640]   shows what that means to me. So that's mainly what I'm thinking. And do you think that kind
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:06.680]   of fits in with why I'm doing this? Or do you think I could get into more depth with
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.760]   it?
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.960]   You will be able to get into more depth as you start to work into this and experience
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:18.520]   it. So the key to planning is not the actual plan. The key to planning is the process of
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:25.360]   planning. So taking an initial step starts to transition you from a non-planner into
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:30.200]   a planner. So what you'll find is as you work towards these goals, some of these goals will
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:35.200]   change. Some of them are exactly what you'll wind up doing and they're important and you'll
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:42.320]   achieve them. Some of them will change and you'll realize that, for example, in order
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:47.880]   to live a good life, that's kind of a vague and nebulous thing. It doesn't mean what is
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:54.120]   a good life, but you may not know right now. I probably have a little bit more of an idea
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.720]   of what a good life is than you do because I have a few more years of experience. But
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:02.940]   even me, I'm still working on my vision of a good life. So be as specific as you're able
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:08.680]   to be, but don't stress out about it. Recognize that it's going to change.
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:14.000]   The most important thing about doing a process like this is not what you achieve, but it's
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.720]   who you become. I remember years ago I heard Jim Rohn talk about that. He said, "The most
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:25.640]   valuable thing of becoming a millionaire is not having a million bucks, but it's becoming
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:31.760]   the millionaire," or to clarify it, becoming the type of person who can save and accumulate
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:36.240]   a million dollars. Once you're the type of person who can save and accumulate a million
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.440]   dollars, you could take the million dollars away and you'll still be that person until
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.320]   you'll get another million dollars. That's one of many reasons why the rich get richer
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.040]   and the poor get poorer. The richer rich, they become the type of people that get and
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:52.120]   stay rich, so they're going to keep on getting richer as they express those characteristics
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.840]   and character qualities that help them to be rich.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:59.600]   Poor people, for the most part, are poor people and they do the types of things that poor
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:05.480]   people do, so they continue to be and to maintain their poverty. You could take all of the money
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:10.240]   away from everybody in the world, split it all up equally based upon the number of people
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:17.480]   that are alive, and after a year, you'd see some major changes. After 10 years, I can't
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:21.800]   imagine anything less than 10 or 20 years that all of the money wouldn't be right back
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:28.800]   in the hands of everybody who has it now because the type of person who is rich is the type
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.640]   of person who is going to get rich again.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:37.640]   The important part of this planning is becoming the type of person who is proactively planning.
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:44.440]   For right now, you've got a really great start and then next year as you revisit this, you'll
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:49.600]   get better and better and better and better at actually clarifying the plan and your plans
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.280]   will get better and better and better and your results will start to multiply over time.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:15:00.800]   >> Trey: Okay, yeah, I like that. That's something I try to keep in mind. Yeah, my plans are
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:07.160]   going to change and they have actually. I hadn't visited for a few months before I talked
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:11.040]   to Brett Panot about this and I was going through it. I'm like, "Well, I don't want
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:17.960]   to do that anymore. I haven't put as much energy as I thought I would and I don't think
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.280]   I'm going to put as much energy in there because I don't really want to do this right now."
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:26.560]   So I took it out and yeah, I think you're exactly right, keeping that in mind and I
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:33.240]   do try to keep that in mind. Okay, so yeah, I like your feedback there.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:39.680]   Then going on, moving on to the goals here. So I picked this goal that I want to be financially
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:45.040]   independent by 25. I decided that that's what I want to do and this is one of those things
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.080]   that could absolutely change, right? I'm not going to say, "I'm going to do this by 25"
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:53.000]   because I don't care that much at what age I become financially independent. It'd be
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.720]   nice to be by 25 and I think I can do it. So I chose that and then that was the main
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:04.200]   goal and then to do that and well, I guess it's not all to do that but some of the things
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:09.320]   I decided also along with that is I want to have the first commercial yak dairy and I
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:15.800]   said the next two years and that was earlier this year and I found that that's much harder
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:21.080]   than I thought it would. So I changed my goal for the next four years because I do think
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:27.480]   I can do it in four years but next two years will be very difficult. So I changed that
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:34.560]   and then I also want to have a live show, take my podcast and turn it into a live show
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:40.400]   in the next couple of years to be on the Liberty Radio Network and then I want to have some
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:47.200]   several side businesses set up in the next couple of years too. I decided I want to put
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:52.440]   the once a week restaurant on hold. That would have been having the produce and the meat
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:58.040]   from the farm being used as a once a week restaurant. I had a decent plan set up for
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:04.040]   that and I just lost interest. So I put that on hold for now and right now, I'm doing
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:08.640]   this, selling meat from pigs and yaks. I don't have any poultry of my own to slaughter but
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:13.360]   I just recently slaughtered a yak in the last few months. I'm selling meat currently. I'm
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:19.000]   always selling pigs and so that's working out really well and then I'm not growing any
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.400]   produce right now and I will be selling fibers from yaks. So those are my side businesses.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.720]   Do you have any feedback on those goals?
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:34.320]   Probably the most useful feedback would be helping you clarify a plan toward financial
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:40.760]   independence. So when you say that you have a goal of being financially independent by
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.800]   25, what does that mean?
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:50.880]   I want to be able to sustain myself and my lifestyle while being comfortable, I guess
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.880]   financially.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:58.640]   So sustain yourself and your lifestyle. So clarify what the lifestyle means. Are you
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.200]   living that lifestyle currently?
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:09.800]   I don't know. I don't have a plan for my lifestyle. I kind of do. I'm shooting for something very
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:19.680]   simple on the farm. I'm not looking for extravagant cars and houses. My plan is to live in a trailer
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:26.780]   that I'm fixing up and yeah, so that's about as far as I've gotten with that.
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:33.360]   So the starting place is to clarify the lifestyle and I'm glad you're thinking about this because
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:38.200]   too few young men spend time thinking about this, but you want to just get clear on the
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:44.480]   lifestyle. What is that lifestyle and if possible, you want to write that down. So if you're
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:49.200]   living on the farm where you want to live, that helps. So to be financially independent,
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:54.800]   if you're fixing up a trailer, then your initial stages are, "Well, I need $3,000 of materials
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:19:01.040]   to fix up this trailer," and you want to consider any costs or questions that are going to be
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:05.040]   associated with your lifestyle. So if you've got the trailer, then you've got a place to
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:09.400]   live that's paid for. You're going to need some electricity, so there's $50 a month for
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:13.040]   your electric costs or whatever the costs are that are going to be associated with your
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.960]   lifestyle. You want to build out a budget.
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.960]   When you're a young man, you want to start by saying, "Okay, what's a budget for me?"
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:23.240]   and then you also want to say, "Well, what would be a budget that would be me plus a
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:27.440]   wife?" and if you are able to clarify that, it'll help you to plan a little bit because
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.480]   the budget that you are able and willing to live on would probably be different than the
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:35.240]   budget that you are able and willing to support a family on, so it's good to plan ahead for
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.560]   that.
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:43.480]   Once you start by clarifying the lifestyle, then that gives you a starting point. So when
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:47.880]   you get to the word "sustain," so you said, "I want to be able to sustain myself and my
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.600]   lifestyle," then what does "sustain" mean? So there are different stages of financial
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:56.000]   independence. So one stage might be, let's say that you work out that you need a budget
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   of $3,000 a month. That would be about a median budget. Many people in the country are living
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.960]   on about that much, and so if you are frugal, you're living in a trailer, that would give
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.560]   you plenty of excess spending money to be able to do things. I'm not talking about improvements
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:14.320]   that your farm needs here. It would be a fairly comfortable lifestyle if you have plenty of
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:20.320]   spending money, again, if you're living in a trailer and living a simple agrarian lifestyle.
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:29.360]   But $3,000 a month could be a goal initially for you to make and profit from your dairy
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:35.880]   or from your overall farm operations. So once you have a target of a number, then what I'd
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.640]   recommend to you is that you take your approach in stages.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:45.200]   So the first thing that I would have is a goal that says, "I want to earn my income
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:50.480]   in a way that aligns with my vision for the things that I enjoy and the things that I
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:56.800]   like to do." So for you, that is the agrarian farming lifestyle. So you want to figure out,
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:02.440]   "How much money do I need to earn from that? I'll use $3,000 a month. Is that an okay number
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.040]   or you think it should be less? You think it should be more?" Any guess on that at this
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.880]   point in your opinion?
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:12.440]   I think it would be less, but that's fine. Let's work with $3,000.
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:18.240]   So the number doesn't matter. It just matters that it's a generally appropriate number.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:23.760]   And there's a balance between how little you can spend on and how much you can spend on.
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:30.000]   You're a pretty hardcore young man, so you could live on $5,000 a year if you needed
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:37.640]   to. You could live in the trailer. You could have $20 of electricity. You can live a Jacob
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:44.680]   Lund Fisker lifestyle. I think you're a fan of his. He would be a great role model. So
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:49.800]   you could live that lifestyle. I'm using a more comfortable number just in case you find
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.640]   that you'd like something different, but that number ultimately is up to you.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:59.880]   So if you pick a number, $2,000 or $3,000 a month, then your first goal is to say, "How
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:04.960]   do I get to that?" So let's use $2,000 a month. On a yak dairy, what would you estimate is
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:11.040]   your profit if you could run, I don't know how big your commercial yak dairy would be,
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:15.160]   but if you could run with yaks producing the amount of milk they produce, the sales price,
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:22.240]   and let's say you had 10 milking milk yaks, how much profit would that produce for you
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.120]   on a monthly basis?
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:30.720]   I honestly have no idea. This has never been done before. So I'm totally pioneering that
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.460]   and I don't know.
[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:36.460]   So it's an exciting thing to pioneer it and I love that you're doing that at this stage
[00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:42.800]   of your life because if you can live on $5,000 a year, you're at a place where you can pioneer
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:47.740]   this and see if it works or see if it doesn't. If you were at a stage of life where I am,
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:54.300]   I'm 30 years old and I have two young children and a wife that I support, I'm not able to
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:23:00.860]   be quite so flexible as you are. So it's awesome that you're using this time of flexibility
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:02.300]   to pioneer this.
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:07.700]   So you want to start by just taking some guesses and you figure out, "Okay, what is the local
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:12.300]   market for milk?" So what I would do is in building the business plan for something like
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:17.100]   that, look around and see what does organic goat's milk sell for, what does raw cow's
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:21.980]   milk sell for, does anybody sell sheep milk in your area for people who have allergies
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:23.420]   to cow's milk?
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:27.860]   So you look around and you try to figure out what their prices are and you look at that
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:33.380]   yak milk and you say, "Does yak milk have any extra benefits or any extra disadvantages
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:37.900]   that are a real benefit or problem?" And you look at that and you start to figure out,
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:42.420]   "Okay, here's what I think I could sell it for. I'm going to make up a number, $5 a gallon."
[00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:48.020]   So you could sell your milk for $5 a gallon. Then you look and say, "Well, how much?" I'm
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:51.860]   sure you have one yak at this point that you could milk, so you say, "How much could each
[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:53.620]   one produce?"
[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:58.060]   And you start to run these numbers on it and you just play with the calculations and
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:02.020]   start to figure out, "Could I make any money at this?" And you may not know. Maybe you
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:10.940]   need $15 a gallon of milk to break even. So in building the concept of a dairy, what would
[00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:16.380]   be a mistake would be to set out and to build a big building, a beautiful milking barn,
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:21.220]   buy milking equipment, etc., and then go ahead and hook up and then go ahead and get your
[00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:24.420]   yaks lined up and start milking. That would be a mistake.
[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:29.060]   The better thing is to see, "Can I develop the market for my product first and what price
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:33.780]   can the market bear?" So then if you say, "Okay, I can sell some milk for $15 a gallon.
[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:39.320]   I can sell it illegally to my neighbors just off the record. Okay, so there is a market.
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:43.020]   Now you can go ahead to process and you can start running out in business." They're called
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:47.460]   a pro forma financial statement, a projection. You can say, "If I had 10 yaks, I'm going
[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:52.620]   to make up some numbers here. I could sell my milk for $10 a gallon. Between my 10 yaks,
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:25:00.740]   I'm going to have 5 gallons per day. That's $50 of revenue per day times 365 days per
[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:07.460]   year. That's $18,250 of gross income based upon the sale of the milk."
[00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.940]   So then you pull off of that your transportation costs. Are your customers going to come to
[00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:14.460]   your farm and pick it up or are you going to deliver it? You pull off of that any cost
[00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:19.720]   of maintenance. What is the rent on the land that my yaks are grazing on? What's the cost
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.740]   of the building? Do I need to buy milking equipment? Is there going to be an electricity
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:27.060]   cost? How am I going to do this? Do I need to hire a farm hand to help me? Am I going
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:29.500]   to milk them by hand or do I need to buy the equipment?
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:33.520]   You start pulling your expenses off of that and you try to figure out, "Do I have a reasonable
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:38.220]   business that could be created?" So with those numbers that I just totally pulled out of
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:43.800]   thin air, you could start to see, "Okay, there's $18,250 of gross revenue." So then you can
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:48.260]   rerun that and you can say, "Well, if I could get 15 milking yaks under those numbers that
[00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:54.260]   I used, then I could get to $25,000 of revenue, pull off a few thousand dollars of expenses,
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:59.100]   then I could anticipate $2,000 of profit to compensate me for my time."
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:04.200]   And so that would be, if I were in a situation like yours, that would be one of my initial
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:10.220]   goals to say, "I want to spend $2,000 a month. I believe that a herd of 15 yaks could get
[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:14.060]   me there." And that gives you a game plan to start with. You figure out how much land
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:19.660]   do I need, what's the equipment, etc. and that's how you meet that initial stage of
[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:24.180]   funding your expenses based upon the net profit from your business.
[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:32.180]   Okay. Yeah, I like that. I think that's something I should be looking into and I will be doing
[00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:39.020]   that. So basically, I'll explain my plan so far. It's not as detailed as you're suggesting
[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:44.540]   but my plan is that the next heifer calf that I get, the next female yak calf I get, I'm
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:49.860]   pulling it at whatever age from its mother and I'm bottle feeding it so that it's very
[00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:56.460]   friendly with me and that way I'll be able to milk it when it's mature and it has its
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:27:02.500]   first calf. That's so far what I'm going to go for right now. So I'll be milking it. I'll
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:08.140]   taste the milk, make sure it tastes all right and then I'll start experimenting it with
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:12.780]   myself. Can I make cheese out of this? Can I make yogurt out of this? As soon as I do
[00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:18.140]   it, I know there's a market for it because people want it. People want to try it. I've
[00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:22.220]   had many, many people saying, "Yeah, yeah. Get me yak milk as soon as you can. If you
[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:27.380]   do it, give me a call," because people really do want it. So that's my plan right now is
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:34.700]   to see if I can even milk a yak and then I'll try and sell it and then expand from there.
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:35.700]   That's right what I'm thinking.
[00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:41.580]   That's perfect because it's a very unique idea. It's a very unique product and you're
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:46.060]   going to have to build the market for it. So the reason I talk about building out the
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:49.940]   � again, to use the technical accounting term � the pro forma financial statements
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:55.020]   is, this is the same thing you do with any business and what you want to figure out is
[00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:59.180]   could this be a viable business?
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:02.340]   With those additional details that you've now given to me, let me give you a couple
[00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:11.060]   of scenarios. If you need to raise a heifer yourself from your herd and you expect one
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:16.980]   female yak each year going forward, then you now know that there's no possible way � if
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:21.660]   that's your source of milking cows � you now know that there's no possible way for
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:29.100]   you to be sustaining yourself four years from now if you only have three milk-age heifers
[00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:32.780]   and one little one that you're raising to that point in time because you're just not
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:38.700]   going to be able to have the volume of milk that you could actually build a business off
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:44.060]   of. So it's no problem. That doesn't mean you abandon the goal. What it does mean is
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:47.180]   that you're going to have to figure out how am I going to support myself for the next
[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:53.500]   ten years until I can build up my herd enough to have my 15 milking cows if this works.
[00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:58.780]   And so now that's going to focus your attention over on your established business. It's going
[00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:02.900]   to focus you over on your pigs. It's going to focus you over on your pastured poultry.
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.940]   And it's going to focus you on your vegetable production. And so now you're going to put
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:11.060]   together a plan to say, "Well, I've got this amount of land available to me in my current
[00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:16.100]   situation. I can run on this land this number of pigs. I can run this amount of poultry.
[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:21.460]   I can farm this over here and produce these vegetables. With my time, this is going to
[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:26.720]   support me while I'm building up my yak herd towards the goal of this commercial dairy."
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:32.200]   So the reason that we have to put numbers on paper is to see could my plan work in theory.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:37.440]   If it can't even work in theory as far as supporting me and my family, then I don't
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:42.360]   abandon the plan. I just build a new plan that's going to wind up in me supporting
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:49.560]   myself. And so if you've got to grow your dairy one cow at a time, it's not going to
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:55.340]   be supporting you two or even four years from now. So it might fulfill your goal of having
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:59.440]   a first commercial yak dairy in four years because you might have four milking cows at
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:03.840]   that time, but it's not going to make you financially independent. So that's where you're
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:07.800]   going to need to add those other products to your product line as you build out your
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:08.800]   plan.
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:15.560]   Okay, yeah, that makes sense. So one thing that I've been talking about with my father
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:22.880]   is that maybe I should just buy a trained heifer already or a trained cow right now.
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:28.720]   The only problem is that's like $3,000 and I can't afford that right now, but I could
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:33.100]   obviously take out a loan with him or somebody else to make that happen and that would make
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:37.560]   it more immediate instead of waiting for that calf. And then if I decide, "Hey, this is
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:42.400]   going to work, I'll buy more." I could possibly do that.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:47.700]   So how would you analyze that decision to decide which is the better course of action?
[00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:51.780]   That is an interesting question. I have not thought about that.
[00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:57.220]   So how I would do it is I would, again, come back to some projections. I'm making this
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:03.340]   sound more complicated than it is. You're already used to doing this every day. We're
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:07.940]   already used to weighing pros and cons of decisions. I'm just clarifying it and trying
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:12.140]   to present it in a structured format so that the listeners are able to apply this to their
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:13.140]   own life.
[00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:19.360]   So let's say you look at your cow. Well, number one, you need info. Do you know how much milk,
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:23.800]   if you were to buy a heifer that someone else is milking, do you know how much milk she
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:28.320]   would produce monthly, annually, or on whatever basis?
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:32.340]   I don't have that figure off the top of my head, but I know I could figure that out pretty
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:33.340]   quickly.
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:40.240]   So that would be the first thing to do. I don't know how much milk a cow produces, a
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:49.340]   Holstein or whatever. So you would start with figuring out what is that dollar figure. What
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:51.300]   is that amount of milk figure?
[00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:58.240]   Number two, you look to see what percentage of the year is the cow dry. Does she have
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:02.500]   milk all year round or is she dry at some point of the year? Then that figures out on
[00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.460]   an annual basis how much milk you can expect.
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:11.520]   Next, you find out what is her expected lifespan for being a good milk producer. Can she produce
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:16.300]   milk for two years, five years, ten years? I don't know those answers, and you would
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:20.700]   need to check that out with whoever the farmer is that is doing that. So that means some
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:25.120]   phone calls, some emails to other farmers, some posts in whatever the yak forum is where
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:28.820]   you participate. You try to get those details.
[00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:35.460]   You try to figure out what is the income that I could expect. So what is the amount of milk
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:40.300]   that's my product that I could sell? Next, you need to look at the market and do a guess
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:46.180]   on what you could sell that for. That's where I would look at other types of organic, non-cows
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:51.660]   milk, sheep, goats, find out someone who's selling, look at the specialty products that
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:56.060]   they're making, and try to just make some guesses as to what it would sell for. What
[00:32:56.060 --> 00:33:01.460]   that will do for you is that will tell you how much of an income you can expect from
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:06.460]   that cow in terms of the actual milk product.
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:12.700]   Next, look at the remainder value of the cow when her milking lifespan is done. So what
[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:16.860]   do you do with her when she's too old and she's not going to be producing milk? Can
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:21.420]   you butcher her and sell her? If so, how much could you expect to sell that meat for? Is
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:26.300]   that $1,000 worth of meat? Is it $200 worth of meat? Can she have babies that you would
[00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:33.620]   be able to sell along the way as she's milking? If so, how would those affect the milk supply,
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:34.620]   etc.?
[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:38.620]   So we want to figure out what's the income that we could expect from that cow. Now let's
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:43.860]   say that we ran the numbers and the cow that's going to cost $3,000, you run the numbers
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:51.140]   through and you find out that you could expect $500 per year of profit or income from her
[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:58.700]   milk products for the next four years. So that would give you $2,000 of profit. Then
[00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:05.140]   at the end of $2,000 of income, then at the end of four years, she's basically going to
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:10.360]   be near the end of her productive capacity and you decide that you're going to butcher
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:14.700]   her and sell the meat. You look and say, "Well, she's going to be old. She's going to be tough,
[00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:21.140]   but we can sell her for and get $500 of value for the meat." Now you know that that's a
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:26.900]   losing proposition. If you have to pay $3,000 for her and you've only got $2,500 of income,
[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:30.780]   then you're going to be losing money. So you're probably better off in that situation waiting
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:35.900]   a little bit and growing your own and saving the $3,000 because if you compare growing
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:39.900]   your own from your own herd where she can produce and yet it's going to be waiting two
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:45.220]   years but now let's say the same numbers, you've got $2,500 of income but $0 of outflow
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:49.900]   to buy your own calf that you're raising just the time, that's much better than $3,000 of
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:52.840]   outflow and only $2,500 of income.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:35:00.180]   On the flip side, let's say that those numbers were very different. You can sell $500 a year
[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:05.420]   of milk product. You could sell $1,000 a year of milk product and in addition to that, you're
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:08.540]   going to sell some of it as straight milk, but then for some of it, you're going to create
[00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:13.700]   higher value artisanal products, cheeses or yogurts or something that you can mark up
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:18.420]   even more and you've got the market for that. So in addition to the $1,000 of milk, you
[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:23.900]   can add another $250 of value to the actual product. So now you've got $1,250 of annual
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:28.220]   revenue for the next four years plus at the end, you're going to butcher her when she's
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:33.260]   not too old and not too tough and instead of it being $1,000 of meat, on the flip side,
[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:36.340]   she's actually going to be $2,000 of meat.
[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:42.140]   So now in those numbers that I completely made up, you've now got $7,000 of expected
[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:49.660]   income. In my world, that's a pretty good rate of return. I can calculate the actual
[00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:58.580]   cash flow payments for you and tell you the actual rate of return. It would take me about
[00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:01.900]   three minutes to do and I don't want to do it on the microphone here, but you could run
[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:07.260]   that in and say, "Okay, $3,000 out and over the next four years, $7,000 of income. That's
[00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:12.300]   a pretty healthy profit." So in that situation, that would be a good thing to get going and
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:15.380]   in that situation, I'd go ahead, I'd borrow the money from my dad, I'd go ahead and buy
[00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:19.940]   her and I'd get that business going instead of just waiting for my heifer to grow up.
[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:24.660]   Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. So what I'm thinking right now, my course of action should
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:30.540]   be because my father sells goat milk right now. So using those prices of what he does,
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:35.860]   he makes cheese and yogurt. So I'm just going to, just to play it safe, I think I could
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:41.260]   totally sell yak dairy products for more than goat milk, but just to play it safe, let's
[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:46.620]   say it's just not that good. So we sell it at goat milk prices. So I can use that, take
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:54.660]   those prices. I can ask some people what the yield of a yak cow is. I can figure out all
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:37:01.980]   that information, the fact of that and then go from there and figure out which path is
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:06.900]   profitable, wait for the calf or go ahead and buy a $3,000 cow.
[00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:14.220]   Right, right. And the key, I've made up numbers that are totally wild. The key is just to
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:19.780]   sit down and start playing with scenarios and start making some guesses. And you'll
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:24.740]   be wrong. You're just guessing. But then as you actually get into this business, you start
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:29.820]   to track your own scenarios. And this thought process is what's more important than the
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:35.100]   actual details. I did this one time with a friend of mine who was considering establishing
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:42.100]   a valet business. And this friend came to me and they said, "I've been offered," he
[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:49.620]   was working as a valet, somebody running for cars presently. He was earning $2,500 a month
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:54.900]   doing that work. And he was considering establishing a valet business. He'd been offered a contract
[00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:58.860]   by a local condominium and there were certain prices involved with the contract and he knew
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:05.300]   the numbers. So we sat down and we ran the numbers. I asked him, I took the income, I
[00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:09.100]   took the taxes, I took the cost of insurance, and just ran some simple illustrations. And
[00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:18.860]   what wound up being the case was that in order for him to make money, if he worked in the
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:23.860]   business and worked a shift just like he counted himself in as a valet, he could expect a profit
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:31.180]   of about $2,000 with him working in the actual business, which was equivalent or less to
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:35.500]   what he was making as a valet, but he had a lot more risk.
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:39.860]   And so what came out of it was under the terms of the deal that were offered to him, it was
[00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:45.620]   a bad deal. And there was no rational reason for him to start that business. There wasn't
[00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:51.740]   enough even potential profit for it to be worth it. So his decision course was if he
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:56.580]   was only going to have the one account, he was better off just simply keeping his current
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:00.100]   job, running for cars and letting someone else take all the risk and all the hassle
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:04.140]   and he just earned the net profit. He would have been making more as a valet than as the
[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:05.940]   owner of the valet company.
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:10.860]   The flip side was the only way for him to make the business worth it would have been
[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:15.140]   if he was going to take it from one account to 10 accounts because with one account, he
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:19.820]   didn't have enough scale for the business to work, but with 10 accounts, he would. So
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:24.940]   if you sit down and put numbers on paper and start to make guesses without any commitment,
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:29.460]   but just start to look through things, you'll start to realize, "Is this worth it?" And
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:35.200]   in some cases, yes, in some cases, no. And you might find that pastured poultry is way
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:40.980]   more profitable and you're just going to go slow and easy on the yaks as a fun hobby and
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:45.200]   who knows, maybe at some point they'll make some money and maybe at some point they won't.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:49.540]   That's very different than saying, "This is an awesome business opportunity and if I just
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:53.460]   focus all my effort here, I'll make way more money with yaks than pastured poultry." The
[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:54.940]   numbers will tell the answer.

[00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:31.180]   But the one thing I would like to have your input on a little bit is my plan B. Did you
[00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:32.180]   read the plan B?
[00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:33.180]   I did.
[00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:37.180]   Okay. So, I mean, obviously, when I wrote this, I was like, "I don't want to deal with
[00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:41.180]   this. I don't want to write this plan." So I was a little bit – I wasn't really thinking
[00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:46.180]   it too much through, but I have thought this plan through and I think that – I still
[00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:52.180]   think that I'm right here, that everything I've got going, I have a variety of business
[00:54:52.180 --> 00:55:00.180]   ideas and I think that it's enough diversity that I think this could work. So I was being
[00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:07.180]   a little bit facetious when I say none, these, or death, but what is your thought on that?
[00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:13.180]   What would happen if you fell down the slope while you're out trying to find the new
[00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:19.180]   baby yak that was born and broke your back and you could no longer walk? My point is
[00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:25.180]   – and no need to answer – just illustrative of the fact that plan Bs are valuable and
[00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:29.180]   important. Things can always happen that could adjust things.
[00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:34.180]   So I don't think necessarily at this point – you've got so many options here that
[00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:40.180]   are associated with it that I don't think you need plan B. I don't think in terms
[00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:44.180]   of plan B. I do think in terms of if this doesn't work, then what? If this doesn't
[00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:49.180]   work, then what? If this doesn't work, then what? What would I do there? And in my
[00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:54.180]   mind, it's valuable to accumulate a list of potential other things that you could do
[00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:59.180]   that would be useful and fit your potential lifestyle.
[00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:09.180]   So I admire the idea of these things have to work. I admire that because that's often
[00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:13.180]   what keeps people focused when it doesn't look like things are working. Businesses usually
[00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:16.180]   are tough and there's a point in time where you're like, "I just don't think this
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:21.180]   can work," and your confidence and your belief is often what will drive you through.
[00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:28.180]   But also good backup plans might help you to be able to be willing to do other things.
[00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:33.180]   And it's not so much when you make a plan. You can always change the plan. And that's
[00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:35.180]   why I focused on the planning process.
[00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:40.180]   So in our first discussion, I really emphasized to you, "Make a plan," because most people
[00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:45.180]   don't make a plan. Then now that you've made a plan and I admire that you've actually
[00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:49.180]   followed through, that tells me something about you. So now I want you to focus on the
[00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:56.180]   process of planning and really understanding the process of goal setting and planning.
[00:56:56.180 --> 00:57:01.180]   Because once you identify that process, then you know and you can apply it to other areas
[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:07.180]   of life. And having backup plans is valuable and is important.
[00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:11.180]   And as you look around at the opportunities that you face, as you look around at the things
[00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:14.180]   that are before you, what you might find is that there are a number of different options
[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:19.180]   which are actually going to integrate with your life goals.
[00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:24.180]   At this stage of your life, I would expect most of your decisions to be very binary.
[00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:29.180]   It's either this or that. And that's expressed in what you've written here with regard to
[00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:31.180]   like it's either this plan or nothing.
[00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:36.180]   As you continue through life, you might find that you can integrate and implement more
[00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:40.180]   things together and that things are not always so binary.
[00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:44.180]   So you might be able to find that as you pursue different things, you might find that
[00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:48.180]   somebody offers you a job working as a libertarian activist and you get to travel Oregon
[00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:55.180]   and make $40,000 a year encouraging people in political principles that are important to you.
[00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:59.180]   And you might recognize because you look at the act business and say, "You know what?
[00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:05.180]   This is fun and I like this, but there's very little commercial opportunity and there's
[00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:09.180]   a reason why there are no commercial yak dairies here where I live.
[00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:14.180]   I'm just going to go ahead and keep my access fund and I'm going to focus on this other
[00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:17.180]   thing that I really like and that's really valuable to me."
[00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:21.180]   And that's okay. Your goals will change. Your situation will change.
[00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:27.180]   If all of a sudden your mom and your dad got sick and now you had to step up and you've
[00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:30.180]   got to run the goat farm and you've got to care for them and they're both bedridden,
[00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:32.180]   that would dramatically affect your plans.
[00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:36.180]   But you would step up and you would take care and you would be the man of the house and
[00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:39.180]   you would take care of the household, but that would affect your plans.
[00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:43.180]   So I wouldn't worry so much about, "Okay, I've written out a plan B."
[00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:47.180]   What I would do if I were you is just keep lists of things that interest you.
[00:58:47.180 --> 00:58:52.180]   Keep lists of potential ideas. Keep lists of jobs that would be fun.
[00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:59.180]   Keep lists of business ideas that you hear. Keep lists of lifestyle choices that you think
[00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:04.180]   are appealing to you. Keep lists of ideas and then reference those lists sometimes.
[00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:09.180]   I keep a file called "Someday Maybe." I learned this trick from reading David Allen's
[00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:13.180]   book, "Getting Things Done" years ago and I found it to be useful.
[00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:18.180]   Keep a "Someday Maybe" list. "Someday, maybe I might want to reference this."
[00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:21.180]   And as you do that, you'll accumulate ideas.
[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:25.180]   And then if something hits you in the face where all of a sudden circumstances have
[00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:29.180]   changed beyond your control, now you can look at that list and you can have something
[00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:34.180]   to transition into that might also be a good fit and still allow you to continue
[00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:36.180]   working towards your goals.
[00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:41.180]   Okay. Yeah, I have no issue with that. I think this was a fantastic show.
[00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:45.180]   I really appreciate the input and the suggestions and the advice.
[00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:49.180]   It's awesome to have you on again to talk about this. This was great.
[00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:53.180]   I admire what you're doing. And so I'd be happy if you want me to come back in the future,
[00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:57.180]   I'd be happy to do it and keep in touch and keep sharing with me your progress
[00:59:57.180 --> 01:00:01.180]   and the things that you're doing. I admire the work that you're doing.
[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:08.180]   And I hope that in many ways, I have a two-year-old son and I hope that my son is as
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:13.180]   entrepreneurial and forward-thinking and aggressive as you are when he is at your stage of life.
[01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:18.180]   I really appreciate that. And yeah, I hope we keep in contact and we should do another
[01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:22.180]   show in the near future, especially when I get some more things rolling in.
[01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:29.180]   So quickly, I guess it's your time crunch, so you can plug your show and everything you're doing.
[01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:34.180]   Yeah, my show is Radical Personal Finance. And so the best way to find out about that is
[01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:38.180]   just simply search the App Store on your phone for Radical Personal Finance.
[01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:42.180]   You'll find my free app that has my show. I do it Monday through Friday, in-depth,
[01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:47.180]   hardcore financial planning. And my intent is to provide somebody with all of the tools
[01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:53.180]   and education that they need to go from financial dependence to financial independence.
[01:00:53.180 --> 01:01:01.180]   And on my show and also on my website, Nick, you and some of your listeners might also
[01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:05.180]   like to look at the stages of financial independence that I've developed.
[01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:12.180]   There is a show, I can't remember it right now, the exact show that is with the growth.
[01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:15.180]   But I've written out seven stages of financial independence.
[01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:20.180]   Financial independence, we were talking earlier, is somewhat of a nebulous concept for many people.
[01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:25.180]   But I've broken it down into seven stages, so you could work toward it sequentially.
[01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:29.180]   And it's not such a big nut, big number. So that might be something that some of your
[01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:32.180]   listeners who are interested in financial independence might enjoy looking at
[01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:34.180]   at RadicalPersonalFinance.com.
[01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:39.180]   I can't give enough props to Joshua. I love his show. I need to listen to it more often,
[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:44.180]   but his advice is great. Definitely check out his work, Radical Personal Finance.
[01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:47.180]   Look it up. I'll put it in the show notes. You'll love it.
[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:53.180]   We focus on my situation mostly here, but this really can apply to any situation.
[01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:58.180]   The main thing I got out of this show was the planning aspect, which is mostly what we did talk about.
[01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:03.180]   Having the most basic plan is super helpful, even if you don't follow it.
[01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:08.180]   Like I said earlier in the show, I've promoted goals-oriented thinking.
[01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:12.180]   Figure out what you want and go for it. If you don't know what you want, that's fine.
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:18.180]   Start at basic feelings that you want, like joy or being content with your situation.
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:24.180]   Then build from there. It can be pretty hard, but it's so useful. I think it's fun, too.
[01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:29.180]   I don't have much to say other than that. I'm still moving. I did hit some irritating barriers this week
[01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:35.180]   for making any sort of progress. Our basement flooded a couple days ago, so I've spent the last few days
[01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:42.180]   like that. I've been having a hard time practicing stoicism and nonviolent communication this week.
[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:46.180]   I've been complaining like a toddler a lot lately, which I don't like.
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:52.180]   Part of it is that I want to do my own thing away from everybody else, but I have other obligations
[01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:59.180]   like helping my family clean up the basement, which it's unfair of me to expect that I don't have to participate.
[01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:06.180]   But it's been kind of irritating me recently. The other thing is that I don't like living with my parents.
[01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:12.180]   I love them, don't get me wrong, but I'm ready to get out. Yeah, I know what you're saying.
[01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:17.180]   You're going to miss it someday, buddy, and you're probably right. I'm trying to appreciate it as much as I can.
[01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:23.180]   It's just been kind of irritating recently. I'm sharing this because, like I've said before on the show,
[01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:27.180]   I think that I should share what it takes and the struggles I face using the philosophy that I promote.
[01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:31.180]   So, I mean, that's just what I've been dealing with recently.
[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:38.180]   With that, thank you for listening. I appreciate each and every one of you, especially those that help out the show.
