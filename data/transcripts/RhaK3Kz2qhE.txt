[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   If we want to invent a term for this, because hey, that's what I do, we can call this belief
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.280]   that the key to creative output is the careful maintenance and tracking of potential ideas,
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.400]   we can call this the "no book fallacy."
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.280]   Too much energy put on the organization of ideas, not enough energy put on the extraction
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.680]   of value from ideas.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:28.760]   That's actually where all the action is.
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.200]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions, the show about living and working deeply in
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.320]   an increasingly distracted world.
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.440]   I'm here at my Deep Work HQ, unlike normal.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.600]   No Jesse today.
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.160]   I have a little trip coming up that is going to intersect with our normal recording time,
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.920]   so I actually jumped back into the studio on a Saturday night to knock this episode
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.280]   out so we would have it in the can even while I was away.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.680]   Now, longtime listeners have noticed in recent months we switched to a new format for these
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.680]   episodes.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.280]   They're now built around themes.
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.300]   So the deep dive will look at a deep question, and then I will take audience questions that
[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.480]   are all roughly related to that same idea.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.080]   So the whole episode, for the most part, can circulate around a common theme.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.840]   Now, there's a reason why we did this.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.600]   It makes the show more approachable.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.560]   So if you're a longtime Cal Newport listener, there is some comfort to the old format of
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.120]   I'm jumping from topic to topic, and you're getting a tune-up or a touch-up or a homily
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.160]   of sorts in all of these different areas I talk about, and you put it on in the background,
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.680]   and it just helps keep you in the mindset of I want to be deep, I want to be intentional.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.440]   But if you're new to this universe, you don't know the Cal Newport cosmology, it can be
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.440]   a little bit unapproachable.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.600]   But I'm jumping from thing to thing.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.760]   It also made it hard for people to share episodes with others, because you couldn't just say,
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.160]   "Oh, listen to episode 242.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.160]   It's about the simple life.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.400]   We were just talking about the simple life.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.180]   Cal comes at it from a bunch of angles."
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.580]   It's hard to share when instead the episode is all over the place.
[00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.600]   It's hard to extract a single question from seven that you want someone to hear.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.920]   So moving towards a more coherent episode format is something we've been experimenting
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.920]   with.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.520]   Because Jesse's not here, I'm recording on my own, there are no rules.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.040]   I figured for nostalgia's sake, why don't we go back and do an old school episode.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.920]   I'm calling today's episode "In the Weeds," because we are just going to get into the
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.920]   weeds on all sorts of different questions, technical, philosophical, dangerous for me
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.920]   to answer.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.840]   I have no actual coherent organization to these questions, no particular way I am ordering
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.840]   them.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.480]   We're going to touch on time management software.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.360]   We're going to touch on the deep life.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.000]   We're going to touch on career decisions.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.400]   There's a student in there with a question.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.560]   There's a husband for some reason asking me to tell his wife that she's wrong.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.080]   Good luck getting me to do that.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.160]   All of the classic type of questions all thrown in here.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.360]   So I think we should just jump right in and rock and roll.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:11.400]   Question number one is from Andrew, who says, "You wrote a post back in 2011 about a mission
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.960]   directed closed loop research system.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.560]   I'm curious, do you still use this system?"
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.100]   Well, Andrew, I think a clue to what my answer is going to be is the fact that I had to go
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.520]   and look up this post you referenced to see what is this mission directed closed looped
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.720]   research system of which you speak.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.000]   I put a link to this article in the description of this episode, so you can load it up if
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.480]   you want to read along.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.120]   So this article, I have it in front of me here.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:51.560]   This article I wrote on my birthday in 2011, and I write about the research system I put
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.720]   together because, and I'm quoting the article now, "Now that I'm a month away from starting
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.120]   my new position at Georgetown, I've arrived at a relatively stable research strategy.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.400]   I assume it will evolve as I gain more experience as a professor, and I'm somewhat nervous that
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.480]   the more experience among you will scoff at my naivete, but it's just starting point,
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.800]   a way to start my new position with a proactive, not reactive mindset."
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.120]   So this post was describing the research system I had put together in preparation for becoming
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.120]   a professor.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.360]   I'm going to actually read some details of this, and then I'll tell you how I think about
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.800]   it now, looking at it through hindsight.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.320]   So in this post, I talk about this research system as levels, the bottom level up to the
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.360]   middle level to the top level, and I even have a handy diagram I drew.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.080]   So here's how I talk about the bottom level of this research system in my 2011 post.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.560]   At the bottom level is background research.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.200]   Every week I try to learn something new about my field.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.920]   I either read a paper, attend a talk, or schedule a meeting to ensure that I'm really understanding
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.920]   the new idea.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.200]   I require myself to add a summary in my own words to a growing document that I call my
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.800]   research Bible.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.940]   There's a screenshot in this post of the table of contents on my research Bible.
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.880]   It's a LaTeX document, and it has all sorts of different topics in it where I'm collecting
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.100]   notes on all sorts of different things I'm thinking about.
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.500]   Middle level of this research system.
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.860]   I'm quoting now from the article again.
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.780]   My background reading and brainstorming generates concrete projects.
[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.020]   Borrowing a nice concept from Peter Sims, I call these projects little bets.
[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.020]   Each little bet has the following characteristics.
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.180]   I list some characteristics.
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.660]   I try to keep only two or three of these bets active at a time, and I attack them aggressively,
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.340]   tracking my hours using the tally I discussed in a previous post.
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.260]   Ooh, that might be one of the first early appearances of my deep work tally.
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.580]   That's interesting.
[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.540]   This provides a simple metric I can aim to maximize.
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.220]   I also force myself to be specific about my timing for these little bets as I find I get
[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.180]   better work done faster when I'm fighting to meet a specific deadline.
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:58.900]   All right, and I show a screenshot of a Google Doc where I have these active Google little
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.220]   bets with notes on timing.
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.740]   And at the top level, I'm reading from the article again, my little bets lead to publications
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.740]   and grants.
[00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.460]   In my recent experience, maybe one out of every three bets leads directly to something
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.500]   larger, but the system is too new for me to be confident.
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.020]   And all of this feeds into my mission.
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.520]   And I have a mission for my research, and I use the feedback on what's working and what's
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.260]   not to update that mission.
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.260]   All right.
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.020]   I have a nice diagram in this article as well.
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.860]   So Andrew's saying, do I still use that?
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.700]   And the answer is no.
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.580]   I did not remember that system.
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:38.180]   I do remember the conference when I started coming up with those ideas.
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:43.180]   I reference in here being at Terminal 2 at the Zurich Airport, having an espresso and
[00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.380]   working on these ideas in my notebook.
[00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.180]   I do remember going to that conference.
[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.940]   This was right before I became a professor at Georgetown.
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:55.020]   I do remember presenting a paper there about this unreliable network model that I had helped
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.020]   develop.
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.420]   And I have this memory of the time of it being like a neat paper that no one cared about.
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.820]   Like the math was pretty, the results were nice, but I invented the model and no one
[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:05.820]   else was buying it.
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:06.820]   Like, great, Cal.
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.060]   I got to get back to working on what I want to work on.
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.660]   And I bet that was really the impetus for me really to get thinking harder about I need
[00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.940]   a more systematic way of tracking ideas because I need better ideas that'll lead to better
[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.500]   publications, which will lead to a more clear research message.
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.740]   I mean, I just had this sense.
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:23.820]   I remember this palpably.
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.700]   I had this sense I need my work to be more noteworthy.
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.700]   I need it to have more impact and be more interesting to work on.
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.380]   And I felt like I was wandering.
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.100]   I was smart and I had skills.
[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.780]   You know, I trained at the Theory of Distributed Systems group at MIT so I could write good
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.460]   papers, but they weren't gaining the traction I wanted at the time.
[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.940]   And I thought a lot about how do I make my research more important?
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:48.060]   And that was the context in which I wrote and created this kind of complicated system.
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.780]   I don't use it anymore.
[00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:57.900]   An interesting thing that I have noticed reflecting on this issue is that other professional thinkers
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:02.480]   I know, established professors, established writers, the circles that I run in, when they
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.540]   get to the higher level of these fields, they're much less likely to have any sort of organized
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.260]   system for making sense of potential ideas to work on.
[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.300]   They're unlikely to have systems like my research Bible here where they can systematically collect
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.020]   information so they don't forget it.
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.380]   They're unlikely to have some sort of Zettelkasten style setup where connections will be surfaced
[00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:25.300]   through the mechanisms of the system itself that will bring to their attention new insights
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.600]   they never had before.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:32.340]   This miserly hoarding of potential insight that could be evolved into value into the
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:37.700]   world at some point is something that becomes increasingly rare, at least in my experience,
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:44.160]   as people move up the ranks of professional idea creation.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.380]   And this is what I've learned through my own experience.
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.620]   Ideas are easy.
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.220]   Writing is hard.
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:57.140]   Having a good idea is not the hard part.
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:03.300]   It's not the crux, the bottleneck that prevents professional idea type people, writers, professors
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.740]   from succeeding.
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:08.940]   It's taking an idea with potential and realizing that potential.
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.180]   That is really difficult.
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:15.440]   Here is the typical, just reflecting on my own experience here, but here is the typical
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.740]   tempo in recent years for me when it comes to professional idea work.
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.300]   There's always a stream of ideas coming by me.
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.380]   A lot of them are bad.
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.460]   Some of them are interesting.
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.460]   Some are good.
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:31.880]   Every once in a while you get that JK Rowling on the train having the idea to write a story
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.980]   about a boy discovering he's a wizard type moment.
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.860]   Not that often, but sometimes you have those ideas.
[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.780]   That's pretty exciting.
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.020]   Deep work was maybe like that for me.
[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.980]   But these ideas are sort of coming by all the time.
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:42.980]   There's plenty of ideas.
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:47.300]   The more you read, the more you're exposed, the more you create ideas for a living, the
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:52.780]   more your brain is good at becoming a pattern recognition machine tuned to the particular
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:56.220]   pattern of potentially good ideas.
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:00.820]   Now once you're ready to do something, you've finished a book, an article, a paper, you're
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.940]   looking for something new, you just grab one of these high potential ideas.
[00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.340]   How about this one?
[00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:07.780]   It's not as random as I'm making that out.
[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:10.740]   I mean your mind again at this point is a good pattern matching machine.
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.860]   So it's pretty good at saying this idea has got potential.
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:17.140]   Some more subtle decisions than you think, but you grab one.
[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.740]   And then all the effort goes into how do we actually turn this into something good?
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.460]   And that's really, really hard.
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:22.780]   And now you have to research.
[00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:26.540]   So when you think about professional writers, professors with very detailed note taking
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.180]   systems, this is not about keeping track of potential ideas.
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:35.820]   This is for trying to get their arms around the particular idea that they want to develop.
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:40.220]   Just when I'm writing a New Yorker piece and my Scrivener project for that piece grows
[00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:44.700]   to 250 different article notes and citations that I've captured as I try to get my arms
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.300]   around this particular idea.
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.300]   It's the long sessions of writing, the thinking, the solving proofs.
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.340]   Now I'm using writing here with quotation marks.
[00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.740]   I don't typically like writing being used too generically as a verb.
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.860]   If you're a professor, solving proofs is not writing.
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:02.060]   Coming up with new experiments is not writing.
[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.220]   Executing experiments is not writing.
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.860]   So I don't mean to be too generic on that term.
[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:05.860]   But you know what I mean.
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:11.820]   It's the execution that takes that potential thought stuff and alchemizes it into something
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.260]   that actually has value to other minds in the world.
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.380]   That's really hard work.
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.980]   That's where all the skill goes into.
[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:21.060]   That's what determines how successful ultimately something is.
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.780]   And then here's the interesting thing.
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:28.100]   When you succeed, okay, I've put in all of this work and I've produced something good.
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:32.300]   And in particular, when you produce something better than you've been able to produce before,
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:37.660]   you deliberately pressed your threshold of ability higher.
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:41.820]   That pattern matching mechanism that identifies the ideas in the stream and says this one
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.060]   looks good, gets better.
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.220]   And when you come up for air and say, "What do I want to do next?"
[00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:53.100]   The ideas that's catching the attention of your pattern matcher, they're more sophisticated,
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.380]   they're more nuanced, they have more potential.
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.620]   So in this loop, all of the effort is in executing.
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:04.260]   The ideas aren't so important.
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.860]   Professors at a high level aren't scared of someone scooping their ideas.
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.660]   You know, the hard work is actually solving it.
[00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:12.180]   Writers at a high level are not trying to hoard their book ideas.
[00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.180]   Ideas are cheap.
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:16.000]   Writing good books is incredibly difficult.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.020]   And so this is what I've come to realize.
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:21.500]   Now I'm sure this is not universal.
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:25.960]   I'm sure there's a lot of professional thinkers who have complicated systems for tracking
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.960]   potential ideas.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.780]   I'm just saying it's also not universal.
[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.860]   I know a lot of people who don't and I don't.
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:34.380]   And the higher I move up the hierarchy of people who create ideas for a living and have
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:40.100]   some impact, the more my attention turns towards the execution and the more the coming up with
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.500]   the idea seems like the easy part.
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.700]   When it's time to come up with something like, "Yeah, this thing has caught my attention.
[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:45.700]   I can't really ignore it.
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:46.700]   Let's do that."
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.700]   So anyways, those are my two cents.
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:53.320]   If we want to invent a term for this because, "Hey, that's what I do."
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:59.240]   We can call this belief that the key to creative output is the careful maintenance and tracking
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.240]   of potential ideas.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.040]   We can call this the notebook fallacy.
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.920]   Too much energy put on the organization of ideas, not enough energy put on the extraction
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.320]   of value from ideas.
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.000]   That's actually where all the action is.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.600]   All right, question number two.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.960]   This is from Mac.
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:22.680]   Mac says, "In your video, a look inside Captain Newport's productivity system.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:27.520]   You demonstrated how workflow-y was integral to your task management system.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.320]   Do you still use this tool?
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:34.640]   If not, how has your task capture mechanisms changed?"
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:39.440]   Well, the video, I should say, first of all, in case you're looking for this video and
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:43.720]   can't find it, this video that Mac is referencing, "A Look Inside Cal Newport's Productivity
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.720]   System."
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:51.560]   I believe this was a video that was part of the pre-order promotion for my 2019 book,
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.240]   "Digital Minimalism."
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:59.040]   So if you pre-ordered that book, one of the things you got was a video of me explaining
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.680]   my productivity system at that time.
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.460]   I don't know where that is.
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.240]   I did not have a YouTube account back then.
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:10.200]   It was probably my publisher posted an unlisted YouTube video, if I had to guess.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:14.200]   So I don't remember that video, but Mac is saying I talked about workflow-y.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.560]   Well, I do remember using workflow-y.
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.280]   I like that tool.
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.720]   It's simple.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:27.880]   Tools that are simple and their simplicity can be leveraged in creative ways by the user
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.360]   are things that I really enjoy.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.600]   So here's how workflow-y worked.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.640]   It was a bullet point list software.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:37.120]   It was web-based, so you didn't have to have it running as an app on your phone or on your
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.120]   computer.
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.560]   It was a URL you could go to from any browser on any device.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.240]   And it was bullet points.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.640]   You type, hit enter, the next line is a new bullet point.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.300]   Hit tab, it indents the bullet points.
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:55.000]   Click next to a bullet point and it collapses or expands that level of indentation.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.800]   So if I tab in and have five sub things on a particular bullet point, I can click next
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:04.060]   to the point and those will all collapse in, so I don't have to see them until I want to.
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:07.020]   The other feature this had was tags.
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:10.280]   Put a hashtag anywhere in your text.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.280]   That's now clickable.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:16.440]   And if you click that hashtag anywhere you see it, workflow-y will only show you bullet
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.680]   points that have that same hashtag written in there by you.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.880]   I love the flexibility of that.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:28.080]   I don't want, if possible, I don't want my software to force how I have to organize information.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:32.000]   I don't want it to come and tell me here's the paradigm of how stuff works and you have
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.080]   to build up these views and you can carefully populate them.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.200]   I love the flexibility of workflow.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.120]   You could use hashtags for whatever you wanted.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.480]   Type them wherever you wanted to type them.
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.120]   Change them whenever you wanted to type them.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.440]   You could just throw information into there.
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.440]   So I used that for a while to keep track of tasks because it was very, very quick.
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:50.480]   And if I had a project or something, I could put some sub-tasks under it and I could collapse
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.480]   it.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:56.120]   I also remember I would go through and add a hashtag that said "this week" and then I
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.480]   would click on that and be like, "Oh, what are the tasks I really need to do this week?"
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.480]   I liked it a lot.
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.880]   Eventually, I had to switch to Trello.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:06.880]   And I switched to Trello because in my roles at Georgetown, these roles themselves got
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.640]   more numerous and sophisticated.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:14.680]   So I began to have multiple different roles I had to keep track of, a professor advisor
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.340]   role, a teacher role.
[00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:19.080]   Maybe I was a chair of a conference and that's a whole separate role.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:23.240]   There's various other service positions I had, search committees, director of graduate
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.920]   studies and each of these roles I wanted to keep separate.
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:30.240]   And then I learned after a while that the information relevant to what was going on
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.480]   with these roles, these tasks became bigger and more voluminous.
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:37.480]   And so the ability to have a separate board for each role, have a separate column for
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:44.560]   each type of task, process, inactive, needs to get done, to discuss next time you meet
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.720]   with this person associated with this particular subproject.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.160]   I could have cards in each of those columns on which I could put tons of information.
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.160]   I could attach files.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.580]   I could put checklists.
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:58.780]   And all of that just became more convenient as the amount of information got bigger and
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.320]   harder to organize and the roles got more and more.
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.160]   It just was too much information to have in a bullet list.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.160]   And so I switched over to Trello.
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.160]   But I like Workflowy.
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.040]   If it's still around, I guess it is, I recommend it.
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.880]   I love its simplicity and its flexibility.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.920]   All right, let's do a question here from Derek.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:20.320]   Uh oh, a dangerous question from Derek.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:26.640]   Derek says, "My wife seems to struggle with focus when she works her studies at home.
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.760]   And I often tell her she would get things done faster if she hit her phone or turned
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:31.920]   off Netflix in the background.
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:36.040]   She responds by saying that women are better at doing more than one thing at a time than
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:41.360]   men so she continues her errant ways working late into the night.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.840]   Is this a myth?
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.840]   How would you respond?"
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:53.080]   I think my response would depend on who I am talking to here.
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:59.040]   So Derek, I would say, look, the answer you need to care about is she's right.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.040]   Say sorry, dear.
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.840]   Of course, you're right.
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:03.840]   Trust me.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.720]   Why get into this argument?
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:11.600]   My secret answer to the crowd when Derek's not listening is, well, no, I mean, of course
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.400]   she's not right.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.640]   You cannot context switching back and forth from your phone to whatever you're doing,
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:21.720]   from TV to whatever you're doing, from text message conversation, whatever you're doing,
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:27.940]   induces a large cognitive task, a large cognitive tax rather.
[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.520]   It does slow down your ability to think.
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.520]   It exhausts you.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:34.980]   It burns you out faster and you produce worse stuff and you produce it slower.
[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:39.320]   So yes, if you have your phone out while you're working on something, it will take you longer.
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:43.720]   And no, women do not have some special different, fundamentally different type of brain than
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.720]   men.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.640]   This is a reality of the brain.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.920]   Network switching takes time, a lot of time.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.700]   It's not something you can train yourself out of.
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:54.560]   It's not something that some people are substantially better at than others.
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:58.920]   My third answer, which is going directly to Derek's wife, I'm making sure Derek's not
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:05.720]   around is I understand what you're really saying is Derek, leave me alone with this
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.280]   Cal Newport crap.
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.580]   I know, you know, that the multitasking does slow you down.
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:16.120]   I feel however, that your husband is annoying you and you're basically trying to brush him
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.120]   off.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.040]   So I actually understand what you're saying.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:23.680]   I know that at this, this is just your way of saying the last thing I want after a long
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:27.880]   day of dealing with a lot of crap is hearing my husband tell me about Cal Newport.
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:28.880]   So I feel your pain there.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:29.880]   All right.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.800]   So three answers, depending on who is listening.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:36.040]   We've got a bunch more questions to go.
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:41.540]   First I want to take a brief moment to talk about a brand new sponsor of the podcast,
[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:46.780]   and that is Field of Greens.
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:52.880]   I was looking at this CDC study the other day that was saying I should eat six cups
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.200]   of fruit and veggies a day.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:01.440]   I imagine taking a glass shaker, glass pint glass, and just filling it with spinach when
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.000]   I hear that and just trying to chug dry spinach.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.040]   And I think I am not going to meet this limit.
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.860]   And then I feel bad about myself.
[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:13.640]   And then I remember I have Fields of Greens.
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:18.800]   Unlike other fruit and vegetable supplements, Field of Greens chooses eat specific fruit
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.980]   and vegetable for specific functions they're trying to support like heart health, liver
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.740]   and kidney health, immune system and metabolism.
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:31.720]   The supplement gets you what you would normally need from all those cups of dry fruits and
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.960]   vegetables in an easy powdered form.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.560]   It helps you stay healthy.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.800]   Now the reason why I like these type of things I've talked about it before is that I have
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:47.720]   a very simple health routine, which is until you get the dinner, automate your health and
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.400]   your food and nutrition automated so you don't have to think about it.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.920]   Just do the same thing without wasting any time thinking about something that's going
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.400]   to support energy, something that's going to support health.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:02.200]   So throw in a Field of Greens serving a Field of Greens, have the same type of lunch every
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.560]   day, have it be drink a bunch of water, have it be healthy, don't even worry about it.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:09.400]   And then dinner, you can care about food and cook fresh stuff and enjoy life again.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:15.500]   So Field of Greens is a big part of my automate food before dinner mindset of balancing health
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.120]   and worrying a lot about fitness.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.320]   Now, here's the interesting thing.
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.500]   That's what I want to highlight here.
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.360]   They have this better health promise.
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.720]   Field of Greens has this better health promise.
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.320]   If you take Field of Greens and at your next doctor visit, your doctor doesn't say something
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:33.420]   like whatever you're doing, it's working, keep it up.
[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:36.960]   You can return the product for a refund.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.640]   I think it's pretty cool.
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.640]   All right.

[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:05.140]   You have too much going on in life to sit there while the one person behind the counter
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:14.200]   spends 25 minutes because the person in front of you has brought in a pallet full of irregular
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:22.880]   bags of chicken feathers that they need to ship with insurance media mail to Antarctica
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:26.920]   Research Station and they forgot to bring any boxes or packing tape.
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:31.040]   And 45 minutes goes by and then finally it's lunch break and you're going insane.

[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.200]   Let's do some more questions.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.400]   This next one comes from Jesse.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:40.660]   Spelled with an I not an E so it's not actually from our missing producer but from a different
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:41.660]   Jesse.
[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:46.380]   Though it would be funny if this was actually just Jesse's pseudonym.
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:51.440]   He just changed one letter in his name so he could secretly bother me with questions.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:56.240]   And the whole question is just a bunch of very narrow critiques about things they do
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.560]   during the podcast that make his life harder as a producer.
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.280]   That would be, that would be funny.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.280]   Funny to me.
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.280]   Maybe not you.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.280]   But I think this is a different Jesse.
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:07.560]   Let's see what this real Jesse has to say.
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:12.440]   You increasingly talk about the deep life including radical changes.
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:16.560]   How would you distinguish that from following your passion?
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:23.960]   Okay, we're getting to the distinction here between everyone's favorite acronym VBLCP
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.160]   and the passion hypothesis.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:30.400]   VBLCP is values based lifestyle centric planning.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:33.340]   It is my alternative to the passion hypothesis.
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:38.000]   The passion hypothesis says the number one determination if you're happy or not is whether
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.740]   or not the content of your job fits a pre-existing passion.
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:44.040]   If you get a job that fits your passion you will be happy.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.220]   If you fail to do that you will be miserable.
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:51.420]   This was a simple story that was taught to us millennials in the 1990s when we were kids.
[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:53.800]   Following your passion is what matters.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.760]   This of course turned out not to be very useful advice because simply matching the content
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:04.800]   of your job to a pre-existing interest is not in any way capable all on its own of transforming
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:09.100]   you into a sustainable meaningful life.
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:15.760]   And most people don't even have work specific pre-existing interest to make this match on
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.460]   in the first place.
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:21.860]   Values based lifestyle centric planning is my alternative.
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:28.980]   That's where you build an image of a lifestyle that is resonant, not a career, a lifestyle.
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:33.100]   All the different aspects of your life, where you live, the rhythm of your day, who you're
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:38.120]   with, what you're doing, what type of climate you're in, what your activities are like.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:42.020]   The feel of your work sure is in there but it's just one thing among many.
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:46.020]   How stressed or loaded you are, how famous you are, how much impact you're having, what
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.020]   is your day to day like.
[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:51.440]   You build an image that gives you a resonance and then you work backwards from that image
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:57.340]   to say how do I move my life to be closer to that image.
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:00.260]   Now I call this value based lifestyle centric career planning because you start with your
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:04.140]   values and you build off those values towards these lifestyles.
[00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:07.120]   So it's a much more involved approach.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.420]   Now is this a gussied up version of follow your passion?
[00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:13.280]   I mean maybe but it's something that's actually much more successful because it doesn't place
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:17.140]   all of the emphasis on job content.
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:22.260]   It recognizes all of the other things that really matter in that weird chemical process
[00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:24.380]   that leads to human happiness.
[00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:27.900]   Stress, location, climate, activities.
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:31.580]   People have different answers to this question of what lifestyle resonates.
[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:35.900]   And so once you have that image you can work backwards and start constructing or moving
[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:36.980]   your life towards that.
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:41.180]   And that's going to lead to decisions about your career, sure, but where you live and
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:44.020]   your hobbies, other things that are going on in your life.
[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:46.900]   It really can be a directing force for many aspects of your life.
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:50.340]   And it's one of the key concepts of moving towards the deep life.
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:54.060]   So what's this radicalness that Jesse is talking about?
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:58.700]   Well as we talked about, once you understand the elements of these resonant lifestyles,
[00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:03.020]   you're reconfiguring your life to be closer to those elements.
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:09.100]   A advanced strategy, a pro tip is to take one of those elements and make a change that's
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:10.300]   somewhat radical.
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:14.660]   Now the idea here is by making a radical change you are signaling to yourself that this is
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:18.820]   something I really take important and I am making it a priority.
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:22.580]   That then boosts the value that you get out of it, A, because you perceive yourself as
[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:25.780]   caring about it and B, because you do care about it and you're putting a really big
[00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:27.060]   emphasis on it.
[00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:32.100]   So being outdoors and outdoor sports in the mountains, and this is very, very important
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:35.260]   to you and in all of your visions of your ideal lifestyle what resonates is these people
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:40.100]   who are mountain biking and seeing these vistas, then making a move to a radical environment.
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:42.700]   I'm going to Moab.
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:49.180]   I'm moving myself to a place that is centered on this type of activity and on a regular
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:51.200]   basis I can build it into my life.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.980]   That's a radical move but that's actually as part of a bigger lifestyle overhaul could
[00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:59.340]   be quite beneficial because it signals to yourself I really do care about this and you
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.820]   get a lot of value out of it.
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:03.940]   So I don't know, is that different than follow your passion?
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:07.340]   Yes, it's much more systematic.
[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:12.360]   Now ironically if you're going through this systematic process, the thing you personally
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:17.140]   might end up deciding that you were going to make the radical change on could be a career
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:24.820]   shift, that you have this whole image point figured out and you realize hey this type
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:29.100]   of thing that's really important to me, I could shift my career to be centered on that
[00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:32.180]   and I'm going to make that radical change to my career.
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:35.380]   That could be the radical change you make and from the outside that is just following
[00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:37.380]   your passion and it is.
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:41.460]   But you got there as part of this much more systematic process.
[00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:44.120]   You didn't start there.
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:49.220]   So when you make your move to start becoming a novelist after you've sort of been building
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:52.660]   up your writing skills and have really figured out that you want to be able to live in two
[00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:56.780]   different locations and having a job that's not tied to an office is critical and the
[00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:01.320]   money kind of works now and you make that move to become a novelist, you are following
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:05.940]   your passion but it's at the end of a long values-based, lifestyle-based centric planning
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:07.540]   process, it's not the beginning.
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:12.340]   So I don't know if I'm obfuscating that or not, Jesse, but basically let's just be a
[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:13.860]   little bit more structured in this thinking.
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:16.980]   Let's do another deep life question here, see if we can be clear.
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:17.980]   This one's from Amit.
[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:24.860]   Amit asks, "Can you elaborate more on the contemplation and celebration buckets?
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:30.300]   Both are more elusive in your deep life framework."
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:36.880]   Alright, so as long time listeners know, when thinking about the deep life I like to divide
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:42.180]   the different areas of your life into their own separate buckets so that you can for each
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:49.340]   think about what's important to me, what lifestyle aspects related to this bucket resonate and
[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:54.340]   how am I carefully cultivating this part of my life to serve these things I care about.
[00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:56.820]   And there's a bunch of different buckets I talk about.
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:00.020]   Two of them are contemplation and celebration.
[00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:07.340]   Contemplation captures enjoying quality, generating awe, and appreciation.
[00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:14.800]   So celebration is where you build up a real appreciation of cuisine.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:20.520]   And you can really just enjoy a meal that you spent a long time cooking with some craft.
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.080]   Celebration includes awe.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:26.560]   You hike out to see the sunset on top of the mountain once a month and just being able
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:30.000]   to appreciate that, appreciate these things of life.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:36.440]   Celebration is you cultivate your cinephilic tendencies and can just really appreciate
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:40.120]   what makes this movie so original and interesting while you're watching it.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:45.280]   It's that craftsmanship, understanding craft, understanding quality, having awe for the
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:49.120]   sublime, having awe for the impressively constructed.
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:53.760]   It's a really important part of the meaningful human experience.
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:59.240]   It requires effort not just to build up those skills but to take the mental space and time
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.400]   to actually revel in them and feel that gratitude.
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.400]   It's an important bucket.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.720]   You should be thinking about what role does this play in my life?
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.680]   Contemplation is theology and philosophy.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:12.560]   What is the foundation built on wisdom of those who came before you that you are going
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:16.120]   to use as your foundation to get through the hard parts of life?
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:21.920]   Very easy during the easy parts of life to say, "I'll just figure this out on my own.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:26.640]   The rest of you guys, you have these superstitions, but I'm smart.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.240]   I have a history degree from college.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.200]   I'll figure out how I'm going to structure my whole life."
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:34.240]   That goes well until things don't go well.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.840]   And then if you're not Siddhartha, you're probably not going to come up with something
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.280]   on your own that is going to be pretty profound.
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:45.840]   So having some sort of philosophical theological core where you can build on ancient wisdom
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:51.920]   so that it can act like an operating system for your soul, rituals, practices, beliefs
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:57.960]   that you put yourself into as a way of tapping into these deeper intimations that you feel
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:02.000]   and making sense of them in your experience of the world in a way that helps you tap into
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.720]   the divine, whatever you think that means, and in doing so, be able to actually find
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:13.840]   meaning and joy through all the other contingencies of messy human life.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.520]   But you got to think about this.
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.640]   So you give it its own bucket.
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.680]   So what happened?
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.560]   What am I doing here?
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.560]   What's important to me here?
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:23.840]   Do I have a keystone habit?
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.160]   Have I added some part of this in my life?
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:29.840]   Let me come back to this and tend this part of my proverbial lifestyle guardian.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.400]   So all of these different parts matter.
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:39.200]   Contemplation celebration, I think, are buckets that people often forget or push to the side.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.200]   Craft they get.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.440]   Yeah, I want to crush it at my job.
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:43.440]   Community they get.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.440]   Family is important to me.
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.440]   I'm kind of worried.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.440]   I'm crushing up my job.
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.440]   I don't have enough time with my kids.
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.440]   I understand that tension.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.440]   I'm working on that.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.440]   Constitution.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.440]   Yeah, people get that.
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.440]   I should be in more shape.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.120]   I'm going to work out more.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.840]   But we often stop right there.
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:01.080]   And then you get to your 40s and you got your midlife crisis because you're like, well,
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.080]   what is this job?
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.880]   Am I going to keep doing this?
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.440]   And I'm not around as much.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.600]   And OK, I got in shape, but I got out of shape.
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:08.600]   And what's it all about?
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.480]   And you're not getting that marrow out of the bones of life.
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.920]   And you need celebration and you need contemplation.
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:17.560]   We've got a question here from Joe.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:18.560]   Old school.
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:23.160]   Joe says, I will be entering college soon and I'm interested in studying applied math.
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:27.160]   I often find myself reading a passage in a textbook and wondering if I understand it
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.680]   enough to move on to the problems.
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:29.680]   How can I do better?
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:34.440]   Joe, you got to read my book, How to Become a Straight A Student.
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:37.120]   Sold that book when I was still a high school senior.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:40.000]   Wrote it during my first few months as a grad student.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.320]   I get all into the proper way to study for technical classes.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:49.120]   I'll give you the 30 second version.
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.800]   Point one of two.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.960]   Go to lecture, try your hardest to understand what is being said.
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:57.040]   Copy the examples down that are given to you exactly.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:01.120]   When you get confused at any particular step of any particular problem, mark it with a
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:04.380]   giant question mark near the margin with a circle around it.
[00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:06.440]   The clock starts ticking right then.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:10.280]   You have 48 hours to get every question mark that you wrote down in your lecture notes
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.020]   filled in with your understanding.
[00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:16.280]   You cannot let these questions wait until you're studying for a midterm and realize
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:19.280]   that a quarter of the material you have no idea how it works.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.200]   How do you fill in these question marks?
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:26.480]   You have different circles of opportunity depending on how much time you want to wait.
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.080]   Opportunity number one, raise your hand and ask right there in class.
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:32.920]   Opportunity number two, ask the professor right after class.
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:35.200]   Opportunity number three, talk to a classmate or a TA.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.720]   Opportunity number four, go to office hours.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:42.560]   Opportunity number five, take out your textbook and try to figure it out on your own.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.640]   Somewhere in there you can get an answer to these questions.
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:48.720]   Fill in your understanding so that everything you're taught you know within 48 hours.
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:51.280]   Opportunity number two, when you study, do sample problems.
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.860]   That's all that matters.
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:55.400]   Sample problems, sample problems, sample problems.
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:59.440]   Can I solve this problem on a blank sheet of white paper from scratch without looking
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:03.240]   at my notes, narrating out loud what each step means?
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.880]   If you can do that, you know it.
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.220]   If you can't do that, you don't.
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:08.200]   It's everything that matters.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.720]   Get sample problems, use your problems at problems.
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.160]   Use examples given in class.
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.600]   Use examples from the textbook.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:18.320]   Get them from wherever you can, but make sample problems the key to your study.
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:22.080]   In my book, How to Become a Straight-A Student, I go into more detail about how to structure
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:27.080]   those efforts, how to construct what I call mega problem sets, how to go through those
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:31.120]   mega problem sets and start reviewing the problems and returning to the ones that give
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.120]   you problems.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.880]   That book gets into all those details.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:34.880]   Read that book, Joe.
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:35.880]   You'll get better grades.
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:41.120]   All right, let's do a question here from Alice.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:44.360]   Alice says, "I'm doing a master's degree in a small R1 school.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:51.520]   I'd like to jump to a prestigious university after I finish this degree to complete a PhD.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.240]   Is this jump possible?
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:58.200]   And if so, how?"
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.280]   Well, it is.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.520]   There's two things that would make that possible.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.840]   Ace your courses.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:09.840]   That's how you demonstrate to the admission committee of the PhD program that you can
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.360]   keep up with this material, you understand it.
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:19.040]   Number two, do research, be a co-author on peer-reviewed research that will indicate
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:25.640]   to a potential advisor at the prestigious PhD program that you will be useful to them.
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:32.000]   That Alice co-authored a paper, this is kind of a good conference on a hard topic, similar
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.720]   to what I work on.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.960]   If she came onto my research group, almost right away, she probably could be helping
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:37.960]   writing papers.
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:39.360]   So that's what I care about.
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.360]   Very good grades.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:43.240]   One or two papers published at a prestigious place.
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:45.460]   That's what you need to catch the attention of the admission committee.
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:47.140]   It's all that matters.
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:52.120]   I emphasize this point again and again, having sat on many of these committees myself.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.600]   This is not like college admissions.
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:59.920]   There is no admissions officer poring over your CV to get a sense of your potential and
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.960]   what interesting activities you're involved in.
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:07.720]   It's professors who are overworked, stressed out, who are trying to identify students who
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:12.320]   can come and be contributors to high-end research programs.
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:14.280]   So they quickly say, "Where did you go?
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.280]   What grades did you get?
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:18.520]   That's what we qualify, just baseline that you got the right brain stuff to handle the
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:19.520]   material."
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:20.520]   And then they say, "Can they do your research?"
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:21.960]   And that's just publications.
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:25.940]   So good news is it's easy to list what matters.
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:28.240]   Bad news is those things aren't necessarily easy.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:31.120]   We've got a question here from JJ.
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:38.760]   JJ says, "How can I know when I have successfully cultivated a deep life?
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:43.200]   Are there particular metrics or things or feelings I will have when I'm getting closer
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.200]   to living a deep life?"
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:48.440]   JJ, it's not a goal you accomplish.
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:51.960]   It's an approach to engaging with your life.
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:58.240]   It is a approach that you will continue to refine throughout your life.
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:02.720]   Your vision of the deep life, the buckets that matter, what you're doing in those buckets
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:06.680]   to pursue the things that matter, that vision will look very different 10 years from now
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:07.960]   as it looks today.
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:11.600]   And that is good and that is expected.
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:15.400]   Your priorities change, you gain more experience, your circumstances change, your opportunities
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:16.400]   change.
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:19.760]   All of this is going to evolve how you engage with life.
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:24.360]   The key is coming at life with the sense of, "I want to work backwards from what matters,
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:28.640]   and with intention I want to integrate those things to the best of my ability into my life."
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:32.240]   That is the ongoing process of the deep life.
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:35.600]   There is a trap in here that I want to warn you about.
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:42.720]   And that's the trap of moving too fast to refine and update these visions.
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:48.720]   It's a common tendency because there is an actual joy in hatching the new plan.
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:52.280]   There's an actual joy in saying, "I have this new vision for this part of my life, a new
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:56.320]   workout plan, a new engagement with philosophy, a new commitment to read every morning by
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:57.320]   the stream."
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:03.040]   And you get this benefit of imagining all the good things this is going to create.
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.720]   And it allows you to think about the things right now that are hard in your life and say
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:08.720]   in this imagined future where I'm doing this new thing, they're not going to be there.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:09.720]   I'm going to feel better.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:13.960]   And you get to essentially borrow against that future perceived happiness right now
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.080]   and you can get some great joy out of it.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:18.680]   And that's fine, but it can also lead to an addiction to refinement and change where you're
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:21.920]   constantly overhauling your system.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:27.120]   It's the change itself, the hatching of a new plan itself that becomes what you're pursuing.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:31.360]   That will eventually devolve into anxiety because your brain gets burnt out by this.
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:36.680]   You need to be refining your vision of the deep life, but not all the time.
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:40.640]   You want to be living your version of the deep life all the time.
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:41.640]   Refine it occasionally.
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:46.300]   But when you're not refining it, be able to sit in it and enjoy it and have gratitude
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.400]   for the things that are good.
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:51.960]   I know this will change over time, but right now I'm really enjoying how this is going.
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.120]   I'm proud of how this is happening.
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:58.560]   These things I'm doing with my kids and my job right now and how that's working and this
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:01.080]   routine with me mountain biking every morning.
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:04.480]   This is great and I enjoy it and I have gratitude for it.
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:07.360]   And then over time it will refine, but you sit with it for a while.
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:10.520]   So being able to figure out that balance of pace.
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:14.780]   You don't ossify and just get stuck, but you also aren't changing constantly.
[00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:23.500]   That balance is often key to a sustainable deep life practice throughout your life.
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:27.080]   So one thing I can suggest here that could help is the birthday plan.
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:31.400]   Use your birthday as an opportunity to really check in deeply and say, "Where do I need
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.340]   some changes?"
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:37.480]   And then you're executing those changes often in the next few months, but after your three
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:42.200]   or four months past your birthday, you're steady state again and enjoying the new updated
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:43.840]   version of your life.
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:44.840]   That's useful.
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:48.160]   Every once in a while at your birthday, you'll trigger a really big overhaul that might take
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:50.280]   a year or two to completely unfold.
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:53.780]   But a lot of times you're just replacing something, tweaking something.
[00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:56.680]   So it keeps you evolving without you having to think about it constantly.
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:58.680]   So that's a good way to get some balance.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:06.280]   All right, we got more questions to go in our question extravaganza.
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:11.600]   I'd be remiss, however, if I didn't talk about our good friends at Hinson Shaving, the razor
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:14.400]   I use every day.
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.600]   You've heard me talk about them before.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:20.440]   What I like about this company is that they also produce precision aerospace parts.
[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:27.600]   So they have these precision CNC routers they can use to make products at incredibly precise
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.480]   specifications.
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.200]   This turns out to be critical for shaving.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:37.280]   So the Hinson razor is this beautifully made aluminum razor, and you put a 10-cent safety
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:39.540]   razor blade in it.
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:42.880]   And the reason why you get a great shave out of this is that when you put the top and screw
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:51.000]   it on top of that 10-cent blade, it allows only a .0013 inch of the blade edge to extend
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.640]   beyond the metal top of the razor.
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:42:00.480]   So it's just enough edge to cut, but not enough edge to create the diving board effect that
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:03.300]   leads to razor burn or nicks.
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:08.440]   Not enough give to clog as things get in between the blade and the razor.
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:09.440]   And so this is really cool.
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:14.160]   You get this really nice razor itself, this beautifully manufactured piece of metal, and
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.160]   you pay a little bit for that up front.
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:22.040]   But then going forward, it gives you great shaves with 10-cent blades.
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:27.240]   None of this subscription service that's eating big chunks out of your wallet every month.
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:30.580]   None of this going to the drugstore and trying to find the person who's going to unlock the
[00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:35.680]   cabinet to give you the super expensive plastic wrap blades where you have 19 blades with
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:37.800]   laser vibrations on them or whatever.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:43.760]   Just get a 10-cent blade, put it into this beautiful aluminum razor, you get a great
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:44.920]   shave.
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:48.680]   So it's time to say no to subscriptions and yes to a razor that will last you a lifetime.
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:54.080]   Visit hensonshaving.com/cal to pick the razor for you and use that code CAL and you will
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:56.440]   get two years worth of blades free with your razor.
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:00.040]   Just make sure to add them to your cart and then you type in the promo code and the price
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:01.160]   becomes free.
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:09.800]   That's 100 free blades when you head to hensonshaving.com/cal and use that code CAL.
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:13.840]   I just want to talk to you about life insurance.
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:18.080]   If that just gave you a flush of anxiety, I get it.
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:20.720]   You are probably like a lot of people in my audience.
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:22.920]   You know you need life insurance.
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:26.160]   You maybe vaguely know you have a little bit for your job and you know it's not nearly
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:30.200]   enough to take care of the people that you love and you have no idea how to get started.
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:33.640]   Do you have to go to a doctor's office?
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:38.560]   Do they have to take your blood and run you through a bunch of tests and physical trials
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:41.680]   to see if you're worthy of insurance?
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:45.760]   Is this going to be something that's going to take weeks of your time?
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.640]   I mean it's like how do you get started?
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:50.480]   And so you don't and then you feel really bad about it because you're not protecting
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:53.760]   the people you love and you get anxious when you hear me mention the word.
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:57.000]   Well I have the solution for you.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.840]   Policy genius.

[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:48.840]   All right.
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:55.400]   Let's a couple more questions in here.
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:58.080]   I got one here from Mark.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:05.000]   Mark says I am a high school student interested in becoming a political nonfiction author.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:11.960]   What can I do now to improve my writing skills and determine if this is a good path for me?
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:16.560]   Well Mark all that matters and I think my audience knows I'm going to recommend to you
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:20.840]   is that you focus on your Twitter game.
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:25.800]   Most of success in writing is about your Twitter follower count.
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:28.560]   If you're more sophisticated then maybe your TikTok follower count.
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:34.560]   So I want you to put all of your attention into having particularly clever tweets.
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:39.040]   Maybe what you want to do is get yourself involved in a Twitter war with someone who
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:40.400]   is more famous than you.
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:45.120]   Maybe you can instigate a pile on and people will just be like Mark you are so clever we
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.120]   love you.
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.280]   And then if you have a lot of Twitter followers they'll buy whatever you write.
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:50.720]   So that's what matters.
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:53.760]   I am of course joking because that is the opposite of the reality though it is what
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:55.280]   a lot of people do think these days.
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:58.480]   All right Mark you're still young you want to become a professional writer.
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:03.040]   Let me tell you how I did it because I got started young.
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:05.200]   So I was a voracious reader.
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.860]   I will recommend that to you.
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:13.680]   That is how as the grist you need to eventually mill good words.
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:17.640]   And that's the type of metaphor you get from a professional writer there Mark.
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:20.480]   Grist being milled.
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:21.680]   I was a voracious reader.
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:23.400]   You should be a voracious reader.
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:28.480]   When I got to college I started writing for whatever the most competitive on campus writing
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.320]   things I could find.
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:35.080]   I worked my way up auditioned to become a regular op-ed columnist for the Daily Dartmouth
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:36.080]   newspaper.
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:41.160]   I started at the bottom at the Dartmouth Jack-o-lantern humor magazine.
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:44.640]   Eventually worked my way up to be the editor of that magazine and I just wrote wrote wrote
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:45.640]   wrote wrote.
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:49.840]   I'm going to push myself up I'm going to improve my skill I'm going to submit on time and just
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:50.840]   bit multiple things.
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:55.880]   I just wrote as much as I could while continuing to read as much as I could.
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:59.480]   In my junior year I decided I wanted to write a book.
[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:04.200]   So and I've told the story a lot of times I'll be very quick but I found an agent a
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:05.360]   fiction agent.
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:11.080]   So there's no worry that I was trying to pitch her to be my agent and just had a conversation
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:14.680]   to learn about the industry and I learned from her how it works about how you have to
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:17.880]   sign an agent first what that agent is going to look for and the agent's going to sell
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:21.240]   you to the publisher and the publisher is going to give you an advance and then you're
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:22.400]   going to write the book.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:26.420]   She laid out what all the stumbling blocks would be for me as a young writer from her
[00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:30.720]   advice is where I learned okay before I have a chance of selling this idea to an agent.
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:34.140]   I need to do some writing for non-college publications.
[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:39.280]   So I spent six months writing for student focused publications as my idea was a student
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:42.000]   focused advice book.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.920]   I use some of these article commissions for these small student focused publications to
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:51.160]   actually get the research done for my book and when it came time to pitch my agent I
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:54.120]   selected very carefully the agent I pitched.
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:55.560]   Here's why I am choosing you.
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:56.880]   Here's my idea.
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:58.400]   Here's why I'm the right person to write it.
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:01.360]   Yes I know I'm young but this is about young people so it's good that I'm young.
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:04.640]   I've done all the research I can show you exactly what the chapters are going to be
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:08.560]   and here's a bunch of writing samples I know how to write.
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:17.740]   Once I wrote that book How to Win at College I really wasn't yet at a position of having
[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:20.240]   differentiated myself.
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.280]   There's thousands of college kids who could have written that book.
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:23.760]   It's not particularly good writing.
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:27.680]   I purposely made it into very short chapters so that it would be easier for me to write.
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:30.240]   So what I think was important is then what happened next.
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:36.680]   I said now that my foot is in the door I did everything I could like trying to fit picks
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:40.880]   into a lock to open up the publishing industry to me as a 21 year old.
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:45.560]   Now that my foot is in the door and I have a book coming out how do I build on that to
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:51.960]   actually become a legitimate writer known to people outside of small niches maybe someone
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:53.120]   who can even make a living on it.
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:59.160]   And that's when I began really I don't want to say scheming but planning what to do.
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:02.880]   And so for my next book which I sold right away even before How to Win at College came
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:04.880]   out I was like I'm going to sell the next one.
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:07.480]   Whatever advance I'll do the same advance don't worry about it.
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:08.480]   Let's keep moving.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:13.040]   My next book moved to a more complicated chapter structure so I could push my skills.
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:18.080]   And after that book came out I went and started writing for some other online publications.
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:19.640]   I started my blog as well.
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:21.920]   I started trying to push my writing towards idea writing.
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:26.840]   I sold a third student book and this time I wrote it like the type of general audience
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:29.000]   idea nonfiction book I one day wanted to write.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.600]   I wrote my third student book like that.
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:35.600]   So each book in a row was becoming more complicated becoming more ambitious.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:40.080]   But each one made sense given the book I had written before and it was very systematic.
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:45.200]   This very systematic march to the point where when I wrote finally So Good They Can't Ignore
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:51.100]   You my first general audience hardcover book the industry was ready to have that from me.
[00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:53.520]   My skills were ready to deliver that.
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:56.240]   I was ready to take that step.
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:59.920]   I was ready for that swing and I sold that book in my later 20s.
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:02.800]   So Mark if I'm going to try to generalize everything I said there read all the time
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:06.280]   write all the time especially in college by the time you leave college you want to have
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:09.760]   already done some writing for non-college publications.
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:13.200]   Then you want to get your foot in the book publishing industry any way you can.
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:17.420]   You want to fit yourself like a key into a lock for a book project where you are the
[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:19.640]   only person who could write that book.
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:21.380]   There's an audience for it.
[00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:25.240]   You clearly are a good enough writer to do it and you don't care if it's a giant book.
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:26.400]   You don't care about a big advance.
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:29.680]   You're just trying to unlock the publishing industry and you want that unlocked as soon
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:30.680]   as you can.
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:34.040]   If your vision is to be a political nonfiction writer I want that lock to be open for you
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:37.480]   by the time you're 22 years old.
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:40.720]   Once you have your foot in the door then you start planning.
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:42.320]   All right I have an editor.
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:43.320]   I have a publisher.
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:45.000]   I've written a book.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.880]   Let's start laddering up more sophisticated more interesting books.
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:49.040]   Let me start carving out my niche.
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:54.360]   Let me start building my audience and that's where things start to get interesting.
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:55.600]   All right let's do one more question.
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:58.440]   This one's from Jackio.
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:04.320]   He says to what extent are you aware of deep work success being affected by survivorship
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:05.620]   bias?
[00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:12.120]   For example are you aware of consistent deep workers who are not successful?
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:20.920]   Well Jackio the deep work hypothesis which talks about the way that we undervalue deep
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:24.220]   work so unbroken concentration in the current knowledge work environment and therefore this
[00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:30.580]   probably creates opportunities niches for those who systematically develop this skill
[00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:32.200]   to move ahead.
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:37.800]   That hypothesis was more inductive than it was deductive.
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:42.680]   This was not a hypothesis that was formed by starting by studying successful people
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:44.520]   and saying what do they have in common.
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:46.880]   Oh they're very good at concentration.
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:49.920]   Therefore concentration is important.
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:52.560]   That is not actually how the hypothesis was formed.
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:58.600]   That type of deductive reasoning is of course very vulnerable to survivorship bias because
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:03.420]   it could be the case that yes successful people all concentrate but lots of other people concentrate
[00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:04.420]   too and don't succeed.
[00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:08.480]   In fact it's maybe orthogonal to whether they succeed or not or maybe it is important.
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:12.660]   It is a precondition for success but it doesn't success is still really really hard.
[00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:14.540]   So just doing that's probably not going to get you there anyways.
[00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:16.440]   There's other factors that matter more.
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:19.840]   So deductive reason is vulnerable to that type of bias but the deep work hypothesis
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:23.380]   was much more inductive was much more bottom up in its formation.
[00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:27.520]   It starts by understanding the basic building blocks of how the human brain works.
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:32.640]   This is neuroscience and psychology network switching context switching.
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:35.260]   What do we know about what happens when we have to switch our attention back and forth
[00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:36.360]   from different things.
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:39.400]   What do we know through self reflection about our own psychology when we have to see an
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:44.640]   inbox with 15 unrelated messages and that gridlock that cognitive gridlock that it creates.
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:48.020]   How does it feel when we're trying to write something but we have to keep checking our
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:51.280]   email inbox versus when we were at the cabin and there was no distractions.
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:55.900]   We have our own psychology that we can plumb there and we're getting these bottom up realities
[00:52:55.900 --> 00:53:01.080]   about how the human brain actually does that dark alchemy of taking thought stuff and creating
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:04.720]   something that other people objectively value.
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:08.660]   Build that up to okay well how did jobs function today what's happening in jobs.
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:10.980]   Why are we doing all this email and meetings.
[00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:12.520]   What is our actual function.
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:16.000]   Is this getting in the way or is this helping and we're again we're building up this hypothesis
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:22.960]   you know these serve this purpose about coordination with low friction but based on what we've
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:28.020]   now learned about how the brain functions it's probably getting in the way of that.
[00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:31.960]   And only then do you start looking for examples natural experiments of where there are people
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:36.800]   who differ from other people mainly in the variables they've constructed their setup
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:38.400]   so they can have more concentration.
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:43.600]   This is like Adam Grant specifically building a bimodal schedule and you see whoa big jumps
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:45.120]   when they do that.
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:48.360]   So now you're really starting to get multiple lines of evidence that all come together to
[00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:55.120]   say of course concentration is important if you use your brain to make a living.
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:58.720]   Of course concentration is very hard because of the way we communicate and collaborate.
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:00.640]   We all see that.
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:02.760]   This now becomes supply and demand.
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:05.240]   This is valuable it's rare.
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:07.000]   It's probably good if you're one of the few people to do it.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.480]   So I think of the deep work hypothesis as being more bottom up.
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:15.640]   It's this inductive gathering of evidence from different strains the building up towards
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:19.680]   this image of maybe there's a better way to do work.
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:26.880]   Now I think the key issue here however is that it's not necessarily the clear cut dependent
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:31.200]   variable in this experiment it's not necessarily career success.
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:37.480]   There are many many jobs in which it's actually rewarded that you just have the stamina to
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:41.080]   put up with constant frenetic context shifting more than everyone else.
[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:46.240]   I'll work later at night I'll answer emails faster I'll work my way up to management ranks.
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:50.520]   There's a lot of jobs where if you're resisting that it's actually a liability.
[00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:55.360]   And so I don't even think about career success as necessarily the dependent variable like
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:57.720]   oh successful people this is what they do.
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:00.800]   Most people who are quote unquote successful in the fields probably don't do deep work
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:01.840]   at all.
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:07.320]   What I do think is important is that if you cultivate this skill you're going to find
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:09.880]   sustainability you're going to find meaning you're going to find satisfaction you're going
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:15.040]   to equip yourself with the ability to produce value at such a level that if leveraged properly
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:19.800]   you can use that as the foundation of a good lifestyle career planning to make your working
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:21.960]   life into something that's great.
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:24.320]   If you're trying to produce something that's very elite then okay almost certainly you're
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:26.240]   going to have to do a lot of deep work too.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:31.800]   So it's a more complicated picture than these guys with the fancy car in the parking lot
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:34.680]   at the office park must all be working deeply.
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:35.680]   They probably don't.
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:41.800]   But the guy who's not in the parking lot because he's in his cabin in Vermont where he's finishing
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:46.040]   up the manuscript for his book that's going to make a big enough splash that he can continue
[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:49.000]   to stay at that cabin throughout Vermont without having to go to the office park.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.560]   That's where you're going to find the deep work much more consistently.
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:52.560]   So a good question Jacko.
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:55.080]   Survivorship bias is important to talk about.
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:59.280]   I don't know how much comes into play here.
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:00.280]   All right.
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:03.880]   Anyways I think that is enough of me talking by myself in this room.
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:08.240]   Hopefully people enjoyed this flashback to the old fashioned format of just question
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:09.240]   question question.
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:11.400]   I had fun doing it.
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:14.400]   We'll be back next week with a normal episode me and Jesse etc.
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:15.400]   But this was fun.
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:17.440]   So thanks for joining.
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:19.720]   Until next week as always stay deep.
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:24.680]   [MUSIC]
