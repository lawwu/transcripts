[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320]   [Intro]
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.440]   Pastor John, you are an outspoken opponent of the prosperity gospel and you have been
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.820]   for many years. In episode 231 of this podcast series, it's aptly titled, "Why I Abominate
[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.900]   the Prosperity Gospel," and that sums up your position pretty well and your words there
[00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.520]   are very strong. Podcast listener Derek recently wrote in to ask a follow-up question, "Pastor
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.440]   John, how do you recognize prosperity theology when it's not blatantly obvious? What are
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.880]   some key indicators to discern a soft prosperity theology?"
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.080]   I really appreciate this question. I'm eager to give some things to look for and I don't
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.440]   think it's all that difficult. Anybody could probably sit down and come up with these.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:57.000]   I thought of at least six that I jotted down, six things to look for. If you see them, the
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.640]   likelihood is that you may be dealing with incipient prosperity theology or soft or beginning
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.120]   prosperity theology.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:16.560]   Number one, the absence of a serious doctrine of the biblical necessity and normalcy of
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:26.000]   suffering. The absence of a doctrine of suffering. Acts 14.21 said that basic discipleship, as
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.880]   Paul went through the churches, was to teach them, "Through many tribulations you must
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:38.560]   enter the kingdom." Is this basic doctrinal teaching in the church? Tribulations are necessary
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:46.520]   and there are many and you must walk through them. Is Romans 8.23 essential in dealing
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:54.920]   with sickness and calamity? We, we who have the Holy Spirit grown, waiting for our adoption
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.960]   of sons, the redemption of our body. Is there a strong note that Christians full of the
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:10.360]   Holy Spirit get cancer and grown under the calamities and the miseries of the fall? John
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:17.940]   15.20, "If they persecuted me, they will persecute you." Is there a strong note that a faithful
[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:25.160]   Christian will be persecuted? Hebrews 12 and 2 Corinthians 1, "God is sovereign over all
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:32.200]   of our pain and ordains it for our holiness." So that's the first one. Is there a serious
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.600]   doctrine of the necessity and normalcy of suffering?
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:45.760]   Number two, the absence of a clear and prominent doctrine of self-denial is a tip off that
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:53.480]   something's amiss. An absence of a clear and prominent doctrine of self-denial. Jesus said,
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:00.240]   "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me."
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:07.040]   Paul said, Romans 8.13, "If you live according to the flesh, you will die. But if by the
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:14.040]   Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live." Philippians 3.8, "I count
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.520]   everything as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord." In
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:30.760]   other words, normal progress in the Christian life comes by saying no to lesser values and
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.320]   yes to Christ. And many of those lesser values are the kinds of pleasures that prosperity
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:44.380]   preachers don't like to say no to. So is there a good doctrine of self-denial?
[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:52.200]   Number three, look out for the absence of serious exposition of Scripture. Does the
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:04:01.640]   preaching take the Bible seriously by explaining what is really there in texts? Does it work
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:08.880]   through passages of Scripture explaining the flow of the thought? Or does it feel like
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.880]   the pastor has his favorite topics, he circles around to them over and over, making a few
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:25.580]   texts serve his purpose? So watch for a careful and continuous handling of the Scriptures
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:33.480]   in an expository way, and be suspicious if all you ever get is topical preaching with
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:41.000]   a few pastors' favorite topics that lean towards prosperityâ€”the mark.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:50.400]   Number four, watch out for the absence of dealing with tensions in Scripture. That is,
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:58.240]   does the preacher bring up passages that seem like problems with the ones he's dealing
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:06.240]   with and then give careful explanations to show how they really fit together? Or is he
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:13.600]   content just to say what seems to be in one text and never even raise the question there
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:20.220]   may be ten other texts that seem to say something else? I think that's a bad sign. If we
[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:26.000]   week after week, you get the impression, "Doesn't he realize what he just said from this text
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.800]   is contradicted in a few other places in the Bible, and he doesn't seem to know that or
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.560]   care about that?" That's a serious problem. Number five, do the church leaders have exorbitant
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:45.400]   lifestyles? Do they drive cars, live in houses, wear clothes, travel to places that only the
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:53.380]   very wealthy can go or only the very wealthy can possess? Is the pastor living above the
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:06:00.560]   average person in his parish? Now, why might that be? And I know that there may be cultural
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:08.680]   and traditional reasons for it, but are there biblical reasons for it? Try to sniff out,
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.560]   "What makes this pastor tick? Why is he so concerned with the clothes he wears and
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:21.360]   the car he drives and the neighborhood he lives in and the way he travels and the accommodations
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:27.520]   he gets on his traveling?" This just doesn't smell like the Jesus who had no place to lay
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:35.920]   his head. Number six, last one, is there a prominence of self and a marginalization of
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:43.400]   the greatness of God? Does the preacher seem to parade himself? Does he figure into the
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:51.760]   talk too much? Is the greatness and majesty and glory of God the centerpiece of all he
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:07:01.040]   says and does? Is the preacher in love with the glory of God in the gospel? Is he brokenhearted
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:09.880]   for his sin? Is he contrite and humble? Is he publicly self-effacing? Does he repent
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:18.040]   of his sins and model how to appropriate daily the sweetness of what Jesus did for
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:28.240]   us on the cross? Or is the majesty of grace marginalized while he exalts himself? So those
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:33.460]   would be some of the things I would watch out for in trying to discern where a church
[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:39.240]   may be going off in relationship to the prosperity gospel.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:44.560]   Excellent. Thank you, Pastor John, for those six gauges. For more on the prosperity gospel,
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:50.120]   see that episode number 231, "Why I Abominate the Prosperity Gospel." You can find that
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.240]   episode in the Ask Pastor John archive. And if you have a question on the brain that you
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:00.420]   would like to ask Pastor John, please email it to us at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:05.920]   Next time, we return to talk about food. Specifically, what does the Bible say to us about food?
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.200]   Pastor John, I think, is up for offering us a little bite-sized theology of food. That's
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.200]   tomorrow. Until then, I'm your host Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:13.700]   [END]
