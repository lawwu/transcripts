[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.080]   We close out the week with a question from an international listener, a young woman.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.760]   "Hello Pastor John, and thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.320]   I'm a medical student in Romania preparing to be an oncologist.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.120]   I want to care for bodies, but even more I want to serve souls.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.800]   I want to be wise in serving terminally ill patients, including children, as they face
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.920]   pain, helplessness, and eventual death.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.400]   From your pastoral experience, what tools should I have available to minister to the
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.160]   terminally ill?"
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:46.980]   I'm going to assume that you are not in a position where you will be penalized for sharing
[00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.240]   the gospel or sharing the promises of God or for praying and encouraging others to pray
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.480]   for those in your care.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.120]   It's tragic when for political reasons or other reasons, medical professionals and even
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:13.040]   chaplains, pastors, are instructed not to help people in the most critical hour of their
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.520]   lives with the most important issues they face, namely the issue of faith in Christ.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.640]   That's tragic.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.360]   So I'm going to assume that's not your situation, but that you have freedom.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:34.400]   I'm also going to assume that you're not asking about the practicalities or the legitimacy
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:42.640]   of palliative care, that is, the biblical lawfulness of reducing pain.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:51.720]   I assume you agree with me that even though pain was God's righteous judgment for sin
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:00.400]   after the fall, his redemptive call on his people is to do good and to bring merciful
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.800]   relief, not judgment.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.660]   So how should we then think about ministering to the terminally ill, especially those who
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:20.080]   are so near the end that they may be bedridden and even mentally or physically unable to
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:27.640]   use some of the means of grace that have sustained them, perhaps in faith for their whole lives,
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.760]   like reading the Bible or being part of worship or regular fellowship?
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:42.760]   In 1992, during the summer Olympics, I preached a sermon called "Olympic Spirituality,"
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:51.960]   and I tried to connect biblical passages about fighting the good fight and running the race,
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.960]   mastering the body.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:59.920]   I tried to connect them all with the Olympics, and I challenged our people to treat the Christian
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:09.120]   life with as much seriousness as athletes treat their relatively insignificant competition.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:20.120]   Now, one of the grand old saints in our church who had been part of the staff for 62 years—Elsie
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:28.080]   Viren was her name—was in the hospital with a broken hip and near the end of her race.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:37.040]   And I realized that my sermon, "Olympic Spirituality," might sound utterly unrealistic
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.080]   for a dying woman in a hospital bed with a failing memory.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:49.040]   What on earth could Piper mean by "Olympic Spirituality" for someone who can't even
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.840]   get out of bed?
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:59.120]   So I wrote an article for our church newsletter, and like everything else I ever wrote, it
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.620]   is that desiring God.
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:11.120]   So I wrote an article for our church newsletter to try to show that "Olympic Spirituality"
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:20.220]   is just as valid for a dying saint in bed as it is for a healthy 20-something taking
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.200]   risks for Jesus on the mission field.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:31.280]   In 1 Timothy 6.12, Paul said to Timothy, "Fight the good fight of faith.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.420]   Take hold on eternal life to which you were called."
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:43.540]   So the fight, the spiritual Olympic boxing match, is, Paul said, a fight of faith.
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.380]   It's not a fight to get out of bed.
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.360]   It's a fight to rest in God, to be satisfied in God.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:59.660]   It's not a fight that depends on mature muscular legs, but on childlike trust.
[00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:08.240]   It's not a fight to keep the powers of youth, but to trust in the power of God.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:17.240]   The race that terminally ill people are running in bed—they're running—is not a race
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.380]   against wind or hills or heat or burning muscles.
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:29.860]   It's a race against temptations, temptations that would make them doubt God's goodness,
[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.020]   God's love.
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:39.060]   It's a fight to stay restful and content in God through broken hips and cancer and lost
[00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.260]   sight and failed memory.
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.380]   It's not an easy race.
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.500]   They may not be moving their legs or even their arms, but oh, the difficulty of this
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.100]   race.
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:56.020]   It's harder than the Olympics, and it may have to be run flat on your back.
[00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.180]   For most of us at the end, it will be run that way.
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:07.300]   And Paul says in 2 Timothy 4:7, "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the
[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:13.900]   race," and then he defines, "I have kept faith."
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:20.220]   That's the goal for those who minister to the terminally ill, helping them finish the
[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.380]   race and fight the fight.
[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.620]   And Paul makes explicit what kind of fight it is.
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.620]   It's the fight of keeping faith.
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.300]   I kept faith.
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.940]   I didn't stop believing.
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:38.720]   I didn't throw in the towel of faith at the end of my life through all my troubles.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.180]   We win if we keep believing.
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.940]   It's a race against unbelief, not against time.
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.860]   Sometimes we use the language of battling cancer.
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.520]   You hear that a lot.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:07:01.260]   What we ought to mean by that, mainly, is the battle to keep cancer from destroying
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.360]   our faith, as we ought to mean.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:10.940]   Whether cancer kills us or not is not the main issue.
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.980]   That's not the main battle.
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:20.440]   It's not wrong—don't hear me wrong here—it's not wrong to want to be well and to fight
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.440]   to stay alive.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.060]   That's not wrong.
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.960]   But that's not the main warfare.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.940]   The main fight, the main race is, "Will we keep trusting?
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.460]   Will we keep resting?
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:37.140]   Will we remain content in Jesus no matter what?"
[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.740]   That's the main fight and battle.
[00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:48.140]   Paul says in Colossians 1:23, "Christ will present you holy and blameless before God,
[00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:58.100]   provided that you continue in the faith, not shifting from the hope of the gospel."
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:05.900]   Finishing the race at the end of our lives means not shifting from the hope of the gospel.
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:10.380]   It's a race, a fight against hopelessness.
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:18.100]   So the great challenge for ministering to the terminally ill is to keep Christ before
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:25.900]   their eyes, help them and help others keep Christ before their eyes with all of his blood-bought
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:32.920]   gospel promises that remind us to live as Christ and to die as gain.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:40.920]   The banner flying over every hospice bed should be Hebrews 10.35.
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:49.240]   Do not throw away your confidence, which has great reward.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:57.180]   Weakening saints need the constant reminder that the finishing line is crossed, not by
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:03.320]   a burst of human energy, but by collapsing into the arms of Jesus.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:10.540]   And of course, we must realize that as people come near the end, they are often not mentally
[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:18.240]   or physically able to feed themselves with the promise-sustaining Word of God.
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.880]   So we need to do it for them.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:28.840]   I hope my family, I hope the Piper family remembers that when I'm in my final weakness.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:40.160]   The last caregivers should be speaking, maybe even singing, gospel sweet promises into the
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:47.260]   lives of the dying person whom they may think no longer can hear me.
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.880]   You don't know that.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.880]   You don't know that.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:55.120]   I sat beside my dying father, counting his breaths, wondering when the gaps would stop.
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:01.520]   I was there at midnight when they stopped, and I never stopped speaking God's Word into
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.520]   his ear.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:07.600]   I have no idea whether in the five seconds before he was in heaven, he was hearing the
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.600]   Word of God.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.600]   He maybe was.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.180]   I hope he was.
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:15.940]   And since their next stop is heaven, we're not going to promise them a prosperous life
[00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.560]   on earth.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.500]   We're not stupid.
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:25.980]   We have to reach for the ultimate promises, the most glorious promises, and one of them
[00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.680]   is 2 Corinthians 4.17.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.840]   We do not lose heart.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:39.280]   Though our outer self is wasting away, oh my, is it ever, our inner self is being renewed
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:48.380]   day by day because this light momentary affliction is preparing for us, working for us, producing
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:53.540]   for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison.
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:11:05.260]   The reason this promise is so precious is because it gives meaning to final suffering.
[00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:12.560]   It doesn't say that the suffering is going to produce a new sanctified walk with God
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.560]   on the earth.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:18.320]   That's what suffering is for, for those who have more life to live.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.920]   These people don't have any more life to live on earth.
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:32.680]   Instead, here's what the verse says, this affliction is preparing for you, this final
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:38.040]   affliction, one hour before you die or one week before you die or one month before you
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:43.020]   die, this affliction is preparing for you an eternal weight of glory.
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:51.240]   In other words, every hour that you hand over your suffering to Jesus and bear it in the
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:59.800]   strength that he supplies and for the glory of his name, your reward is increasing in
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.160]   heaven.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:09.920]   There is meaning to what looks to the world like absolutely meaningless final suffering.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:15.920]   So my answer is spare the dying as much pain as you can.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:22.960]   Use the prayer-soaked Word of God to keep Christ before the dying, to help them fight
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:32.600]   the fight of faith, to keep believing that even this final painful push will be rewarded
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.600]   by God's grace.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.600]   Amen.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.600]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:41.880]   Olympic Spirituality was a two-part sermon series preached in August of 1992 during the
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:47.240]   Summer Olympics, the year of the dream team, the basketball team, hard to forget that.
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:54.000]   You can find that short series Olympic Spirituality right now at DesiringGod.org along with the
