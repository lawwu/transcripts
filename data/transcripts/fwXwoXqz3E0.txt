[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.640]   Today, I'm going to show you how to track and analyze
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.960]   your LLMs using the Weights and Biases Prompts Tracer.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.560]   Once you've logged your LLM chain output using WNB Tracer,
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.520]   you'll have this tracer view.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.560]   The table at the top gives you
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.200]   high-level information about what you've logged,
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.720]   such as whether the chain was successful,
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.160]   the inputs and outputs of the chain,
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.760]   what the main components of the chain are,
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.680]   any errors that occurred in the chain.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.000]   Now, when we click different rows in the table,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   we can see the trace timeline view update with more details.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.360]   Here, we see the entire execution trace of the chain,
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.040]   as well as all of the component chains,
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.080]   LLMs, and tools used.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.680]   Clicking on a component shows more information about
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.880]   the inputs and outputs as well as metadata,
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.840]   such as how many tokens were used.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.000]   If your chain failed,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.880]   the component that failed will be highlighted.
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.480]   You can check the inputs to that component
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.240]   and try and debug what went wrong.
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.280]   Finally, the model architecture tab
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.960]   shows the full config of your chain.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.240]   Here, you can see what LLM model was used,
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.880]   which prompt template was used, and much more.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.640]   That's it. Now, you can see the full overview of
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.680]   your LLM chain and quickly debug when things go wrong.
