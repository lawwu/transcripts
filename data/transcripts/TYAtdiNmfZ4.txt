[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.300]   - We're back with Francis Chan,
[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.040]   who joins us from San Francisco.
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.480]   And Francis and his wife Lisa wrote a new book
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.820]   titled You and Me Forever, Marriage in Light of Eternity.
[00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.520]   And in the book, you write this, Francis,
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.360]   quote, "No woman wants to be led by a joyless man,"
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.400]   end quote.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.880]   Unpack that for us a little bit.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.160]   Why is joy so central to leadership in the home?
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.160]   - Well, joy is one of the fruit of the spirit,
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.000]   but it's one of those fruit that is so contagious.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.740]   I mean, we have the ability to bring life or death
[00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.680]   to a situation, whether it's your family or your workplace.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.440]   You know, those people that just walk in
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.200]   and their joy just lights up a room
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.880]   and then others where, gosh, they're just joyless.
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.320]   They're just negative and it rubs off.
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.240]   So when it's in the home, I mean,
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.040]   that's a lot of time spent with that person.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.520]   And, you know, scripture tells us that our joy,
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.400]   our forbearance, and that lack of anxiety
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.680]   should be evident to everyone in Philippians 4.4.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.140]   I mean, this is what makes us attractive.
[00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.980]   And I think about, you know, as a kid,
[00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.320]   I was just not a joyful person.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.940]   I just remember comments my dad would make,
[00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.920]   like, you're never happy.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.940]   And my aunt would say the same thing.
[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.480]   But when you come to know the Lord, that changes.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.720]   And I remember a pastor interviewing one of my daughters
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.720]   and said, "Hey, describe your dad."
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.640]   And the first word she used was joyful.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.000]   Like, oh, he's just so joyful.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.680]   And, you know, when I heard the interview,
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.040]   I'm like, wow, who would have ever guessed
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.120]   that would be the adjective for me, you know,
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.580]   like on the upper, because that's what Christ does.
[00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.380]   And I see so many women that you look on their faces
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.940]   and you just kind of go,
[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.940]   I don't think she has a great husband.
[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.000]   You know, I wonder, you know, or when, you know,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.580]   some of you men, if you're listening,
[00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.860]   if your wife, before you met her,
[00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.140]   was this joyful, lively person, and she isn't now,
[00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.540]   you've gotta take some of that on your own shoulders.
[00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.420]   Being married to you has actually caused a burden,
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.660]   because we're supposed to bring life
[00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.280]   and light into their lives.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.460]   And so I think it's a cause for, you know,
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.820]   we should pause, I'm not saying any woman that's depressed,
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.600]   it's your husband's fault, or vice versa.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.220]   You know, and women, obviously, same thing, so.
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.940]   - That is worth reflecting on, humbling and challenging.
[00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.360]   Thank you, Francis.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.780]   And on a related note, Pastor John has addressed
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.100]   dad's role in leading with joy in the home
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.580]   back in episode number 256 of this podcast.
[00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.340]   And then I also asked him what steals his joy
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.800]   in episode number 256 as a follow-up,
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.980]   which became a very personal episode
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.940]   about leadership and joy in the home,
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.540]   and how the home can actually be a joy drain.
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.720]   Those are episodes number 255 and 256 in the archive.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.660]   We will return with Francis tomorrow on Friday.
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.020]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, we'll see you then.
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.260]   (silence)
[00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.420]   (silence)
[00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.580]   (silence)
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:32.580]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
