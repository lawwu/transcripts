[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from the Financial Samurai Podcast and in this episode I have
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.880]   a special guest with me, Charlie Albright, who is a concert pianist.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.700]   He has been hailed as among the most gifted musicians of his generation with a dazzling
[00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.640]   natural keyboard affinity who made quite an impression by the Washington Post.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.880]   American pianist, composer, improviser Charlie Albright has been praised for his "jaw-dropping
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.440]   technique and virtuosity" meshed with a distinctive musicality by the New York Times.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.760]   So welcome to the podcast, Charlie.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.600]   Thanks for having me on, Sam.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.520]   You know, it's been a great, great time talking to you and getting to know you over the years.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.680]   I think you mentioned you first started listening or reading Financial Samurai how many years
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.680]   ago?
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.920]   I was trying to remember.
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.200]   It was near the beginning.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.040]   So I was still living in Boston because I know that I've been reading you while I was
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.040]   even like I think doing, finishing up my college stuff.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.240]   So I'm thinking it was probably somewhere in like 2009 or 10 I started reading you regularly.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.640]   I think that's not too long after you started Financial Samurai, right?
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.640]   Right, July 2009.
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.200]   And I don't even know how I stumbled on the blog or something but I've been, yeah, I've
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.640]   been reading pretty much every article since and so it's great to get to know you over
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.640]   the years.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.640]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.640]   And thanks for your support.
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.040]   So Charlie, you went to Harvard and it says you were, you got a bachelor's degree in economics
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.320]   and you were a pre-med student and then you got a master of music degree in piano performance
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.080]   at NEC and you also went to Juilliard.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.040]   So to me, that's pretty impressive.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.600]   Sounds like a parent's dream come true.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.240]   How did you end up getting into Harvard and what is NEC exactly?
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.560]   And I know about Juilliard because Juilliard is probably the best music school in the country.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.840]   Sure.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.000]   I guess it's probably easiest to start from the beginning I guess because it kind of all
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.920]   connects.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.840]   So I started piano when I was really young.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.600]   I was about three and a half years old and we had a clunky upright garage sale piano.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.440]   It was missing a few keys I think and my parents had just bought it and it was just sitting
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.840]   in the living room in my childhood home.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.280]   I guess I climbed up when I was about three and a half when my mom was in the kitchen
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.280]   or so the story goes.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.960]   I don't remember it.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.600]   I guess I started picking out Twinkle Twinkle Little Star kind of by ear.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.040]   So my mom came in and she asked, "Who taught you that?"
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.440]   And I guess I said something like, "Nobody" or something.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.560]   So she saw that I had a knack for music and so she taught me what little she knows.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.800]   She was born and raised in Korea and she had learned a little tiny bit of piano when she
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.560]   was younger I think.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.440]   So she taught me a little bit of what she knows and then I had several teachers that
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.720]   would teach me entirely by ear.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.200]   So I played and some of these teachers were like my first non-mom teacher was this old
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.040]   lady who played the accordion and like the organ a block away.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.560]   There were several teachers that kind of just taught me by ear including like one who was
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.560]   a – she owned a piano and organ store like this flea market in our town.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.240]   And anyway, so I was starting to perform a little bit and I couldn't read music at
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.680]   all.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.920]   So when I was about seven, I was taking from a jazz teacher and he told my parents, "Charlie
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.640]   really needs a year's worth of like classical music training to develop his technique."
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.200]   And so the plan was – so he recommended this lady, Nancy Adcet, who was like a – she
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.360]   was a private music teacher in Olympia, Washington and about a half an hour from where I grew
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.040]   up in Centralia.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.000]   And the plan was for me to go and take a year from her, develop technique and then go back
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.280]   to what I called the fun songs, right?
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.880]   And so fast forward, she became like family.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.720]   Like her and her husband were like my grandparents.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.640]   We traveled the world together for like competitions and all kinds of stuff with music and we went
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.400]   everywhere from Australia to I think Norway.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.840]   I mean we traveled the world.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.200]   And eventually it came time to be that I needed to figure out what I wanted to do for a living,
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.200]   right?
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.060]   Like growing up and – so my dad retired from the military and my mom is – she works
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.520]   in the local community college in the library.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.280]   She's a student supervisor there.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.600]   And so I didn't grow up in a wealthy family or anything.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.040]   I knew that whatever I did, I had to be able to support myself, right?
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:43.000]   I had to be able to pay the bills and passion is great and all but you also like having
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   electricity.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.960]   That's a nice thing.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.600]   So – and a lot of music is something that's out of your control.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.600]   Like you can practice – the joke is how do you get to Carnegie Hall?
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.600]   Practice, practice, practice.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.600]   No, no, no.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.600]   How do you get to Carnegie Hall?
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.600]   Know the manager.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.600]   How do you get to Carnegie Hall?
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.320]   And there's some truth to that and a lot of it is being in the right place at the right
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.400]   time, having the right person hear you at the right time, God's blessing.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.160]   A lot of things are outside of what's in your control.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.480]   So I thought if I can't – if I couldn't do music, I love music, but if I couldn't
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.960]   do music, what else was I interested in?
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.040]   And for me, like business and medicine were always interests.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:27.480]   So I was attracted to these new joint programs that these various colleges had – were starting
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:33.360]   – back then it was kind of starting up between academic colleges and music schools.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.320]   And they hadn't really existed much before then.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.680]   And basically what it is is so that you can go to an academic school and you're – there's
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.180]   differences between each program, but the general one is you're there full time for
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.180]   four years.
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.280]   You can major in whatever you want.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.080]   But you're simultaneously doing a first – your first year of your master's degree in music
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.080]   at like the conservatory.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.360]   So you're kind of going back and forth those four years, having lessons all four years.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.320]   And then you graduate with your normal degree from whatever the academic school is.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.920]   And then you go one more year, your fifth year, full time at the conservatory.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.640]   And that's really your second year master's.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.080]   So instead of like six years, it only takes five to do both.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.720]   And so those programs really kind of drew me.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.720]   Okay.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.880]   Well, let me talk about your childhood a little bit because I did see a clip, video of you
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.840]   playing piano on TV at three and a half.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.640]   So it clearly seemed like you had way more talents than the average three and a half
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.640]   four-year-old.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.240]   I have a three and a half-year-old and six-year-old.
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.480]   There's no way – I can't see her playing piano right now.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.320]   So how much – it seemed like it was like a God-given talent where you could pick up
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.080]   sound and just do it.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.680]   And then over the years, if you didn't hone your craft or practice, do you think you could
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.680]   still do it now?
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.680]   Like let's say you didn't have that jazz musician teacher, nothing.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.640]   But you still listen to music and you still fiddle around with the piano.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.880]   How good would you think you would be right now versus if you had not – if you went
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.880]   through all the training compared to going through all the training I guess?
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.280]   That's a good question.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.720]   If I didn't ever play the piano, like if I did that picking out Twinkle Little Star
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.720]   and my mom did kind of start me on having – encouraging me to keep playing and take
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:22.820]   me to teachers who taught me by ear, then I don't know if I would have developed much
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:23.820]   at all.
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.420]   You might have had that natural inclination.
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.080]   But like if we didn't even have a piano in the house, we might not have ever known
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:34.060]   that I had an inkling for music until much later on if ever, right?
[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:39.180]   And if we had just only gone to the teachers who taught me by ear, I'd probably still
[00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:44.740]   be able to play by ear and stuff like that because the classical side, the conservatory
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.020]   side, all that doesn't really teach any of that at all.
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:53.420]   So I might not be able to read music or maybe much more poorly.
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.740]   Maybe I would have taught myself as I got older.
[00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:00.660]   But I doubt that my technique would be as good.
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.500]   But I'd still probably be able to do the play by ear part.
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:09.340]   But doing the classical training did develop technique probably far better than if I hadn't
[00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:13.620]   taken at least from like a private classical teacher growing up.
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:14.620]   Yeah.
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:19.700]   So would you – let's say there are two variables, nature or nurture.
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.380]   So nature is just being gifted with it.
[00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:28.300]   What percentage out of 100% do you think your talents, your ability is nature?
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.660]   That's a tough one, Sam.
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.460]   That's the big question, right?
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.300]   That's the whole nature versus nurture debate.
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.300]   That's a tough one.
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:39.820]   I want to figure out how much do we need to – how hard do we need to try to get to where
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.380]   we want to go?
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:47.260]   The percentage is probably – the ratio probably varies depending on the subject, right?
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.580]   Let's talk about piano.
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:54.740]   But for music – Is it over 50% nature you think?
[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:58.500]   That's a tough one.
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.820]   I don't know.
[00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:04.980]   I mean if – there are people who don't – I've met a lot of people and some people
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:11.060]   are – you can kind of tell – sometimes you can kind of tell if someone has what they
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.700]   call the X factor, the it factor.
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:18.500]   And even among people who can play almost any piece written for the piano.
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:23.660]   There's people who you can listen to and they might be extremely good.
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:30.860]   They can play Rachmaninoff and they can play – but maybe they don't have that X factor.
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:34.700]   They're still very good but maybe they don't have that X factor.
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.500]   I don't know if the X factor can be a learned thing.
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.600]   Maybe that's the whole nature part.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.380]   Maybe you can't learn that.
[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:45.580]   But then again, if you only have that and you don't nurture it at all, then you're
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:50.940]   just going to be kind of just raw talent with no honing or focus.
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:54.480]   So it's – I don't know the answer.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:10:00.620]   But there's definitely both that's needed to be really good at – like really spectacular
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.860]   at something I think.
[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:03.860]   So OK.
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.020]   Well, I'm not going to ask you specifically then.
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.180]   But how about Yo-Yo Ma?
[00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:13.300]   You played with him it says five times and everybody has heard of Yo-Yo Ma, the cellist.
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:18.380]   What do you think is his nature versus nurture?
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:23.060]   I mean there's no doubt he has that X factor or whatever you want to call it, that intangible
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.560]   thing.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:33.460]   But he also is extremely disciplined and worked his butt off his whole life, right?
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:38.100]   Oh man, I wish I could give you an answer.
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:43.460]   I don't know.
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:44.700]   Both have to be there.
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:49.300]   Sometimes you can go to a concert or see someone and maybe they're really proficient in what
[00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.340]   they do.
[00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:55.540]   But they don't – maybe you're not moved by the person's playing or their singing
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.180]   or whatever they're doing.
[00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:01.540]   And that might be – but you can't necessarily nail it on the head why, right?
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.700]   Why is that – it was all the notes are right.
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.740]   The dynamics were good, all the stuff.
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:12.580]   But maybe you weren't really moved versus sometimes you go to a place and maybe someone
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.580]   has technical problems.
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:18.740]   They didn't play all the right notes or they didn't – but it's something that's
[00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.860]   like you're incredibly moved and touched.
[00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.260]   Maybe you cry.
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:29.320]   I think that's one of the criticisms also of maybe competitions is that – competitions
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.340]   can – we can discuss this later if you want.
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:35.900]   But what is a competition when it comes to things like art, right?
[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:36.900]   It's not the Olympics.
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.860]   It's not who can play something a tenth of a second faster.
[00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.420]   It's a little subjective.
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.420]   Exactly.
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:46.340]   There's so much subjectivity and one person's incredible might be another person's eh,
[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:47.340]   right?
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:48.340]   Yeah, right.
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:53.980]   I will say that you moved me twice and the first time you moved me was when you did a
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:12:01.380]   rendition of my song Cutie Baby which I came up with in 2017 to sing my son to sleep.
[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:05.220]   And I just thought, "Hey, maybe Charlie can do an improv of Cutie Baby."
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.300]   And you sent it to me the very next day.
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.300]   You recorded it.
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.820]   It was unbelievable.
[00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:15.540]   It brought me to tears because as a creator, you just want to be heard or listened to and
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.060]   for you to make it ten times better.
[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.060]   Wow.
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.380]   I couldn't believe it and I was truly moved.
[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:22.860]   So thank you very much for that.
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:23.860]   Oh, thanks, Sam.
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.420]   It was unbelievable.
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.020]   And I play it in my car a lot and I play it to my kids.
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:32.820]   Let's listen to Charlie's rendition of Cutie Baby so maybe you can go to sleep better.
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:33.920]   So that was amazing.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:34.920]   So thank you.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:35.920]   Oh, thank you.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.180]   The second time you moved me was at a concert that I saw recently at Union City in California
[00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:43.020]   where you do have the showmanship.
[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.260]   You draw the audience in.
[00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:48.260]   It was the most entertaining concert that I've seen because you stood up and interacted
[00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:49.480]   with the conductor.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.980]   You asked questions.
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:52.980]   You had a dialogue.
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:56.700]   And then you did the improv thing where you said, "Anybody in the audience, throw me out
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.980]   several random keys."
[00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:02.740]   And then you listened and you joked back with one of the members and said, "I'll see you
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:06.060]   later because he or she said F key when there was a G key."
[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.060]   I don't know my music.
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.060]   Sure.
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:14.420]   And then you put together this unbelievable improv that sounded just amazing and I was
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:15.420]   blown away.
[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:16.420]   So you do have the it factor.
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:17.860]   I totally see it.
[00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:18.860]   I appreciate that.
[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:19.860]   Thank you.
[00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:26.420]   And I would say, I'm going to answer my own question, I believe that nature has to be,
[00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:35.180]   I think, over 50% of it, 60, 70% because you were born being able to hear music and play.
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:39.580]   You'd survey a thousand people, maybe only 10 people can do the same thing.
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:44.040]   And so you have to have that nature and that God-given ability to do something.
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:50.620]   But then even if it's only 30% nurture in terms of hard work and work ethic, that is
[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:54.300]   still a huge percentage to get to the very top.
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:59.040]   Because we talked about, I asked you, and I'd love for you to share on this podcast,
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:06.620]   what differentiates the number one Juilliard graduate pianist versus the number five Juilliard
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:07.620]   pianist?
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:12.280]   And what differentiates the person who's playing at Carnegie Hall, which you have done, and
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.200]   the person who's not playing at Carnegie Hall?
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.680]   What are your thoughts on that?
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.020]   A lot of it's that what's out of your control thing, I think.
[00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.020]   And it really is.
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:30.120]   There's, I think, Willie Nelson, the country singer, I think he said sometime that he,
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.840]   it was something along the lines of, and I'm going to butcher his quote or whatever, but
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.100]   I'm paraphrasing.
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:39.600]   It was something along the lines of he felt bad for all of the people who are far better
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.100]   than he was, who never got a chance to have the career or anything close to the career
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.100]   that he had.
[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:47.520]   And I think there's so much truth there.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:55.000]   There's a lot of people, just because a particular person is more notorious, more famous than
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.840]   someone else in the music world, and I'm sure this is the case with a lot of, especially
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:04.720]   subjective fields, like acting is, I'm sure, a big one.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.760]   Stand-up comedy might be a big one as well.
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:13.920]   I don't know, but there's a lot of people who are far better than I am, technically,
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:21.240]   musically, all kinds of things like that, that I'm sure don't have nearly the opportunities
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.000]   to perform that I do.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:30.200]   And I feel very blessed by God to be able to do what I do and share music, because it's
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.560]   something that I really enjoy and stuff.
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:41.000]   But yeah, there's definitely a big cutoff, especially in a small world that something
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.400]   like classical music, where there's really not that many opportunities to play, if you
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.600]   really consider it.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:54.920]   And it seems to be shrinking a lot, especially in the United States, but I think it's kind
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:59.360]   of a worldwide trend.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:04.160]   For example, someone like me, I don't work for any company, I'm not associated with an
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:11.360]   orchestra or a presenter or anything, but I'm basically an independent contractor, is
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.360]   what it is.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:19.920]   So orchestras or concert presenters that put on maybe so many shows a year in their city
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:25.000]   or whatever, recitals or whatever, they might say, "Okay, we have X number of concerts per
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.360]   year to present," and they might invite me to give a concert with their orchestra, where
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:34.720]   I'd go, kind of like what I did a couple weeks ago when I saw you.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:39.840]   I would go down there, rehearse with them a couple times, give a concert or two with
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:43.360]   the orchestra where I'm playing and they're accompanying, and then I go on my way.
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:47.120]   And that's kind of the end of that interaction until maybe a few years later when I come
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.120]   back, maybe.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.800]   For a recital, it's very similar.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:54.340]   Maybe there's a presenter that has so many shows in this concert hall every year, and
[00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.800]   maybe they want one piano, and then they're all going to want one violinist and maybe
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.600]   a chamber group or something.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.440]   Same with the orchestras.
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:06.680]   Sometimes if they have, especially smaller orchestras, which most of them are, not your
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:11.640]   LA Philz and your New York Philharmonics and stuff, which give tons of concerts, but they
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:16.160]   might have five, six sets of concerts per year over the course of nine months, every
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:22.080]   month or two, and they'll have maybe one pianist, one cellist, one violinist as their guest
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.280]   artist.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:27.440]   And so there's really not a lot of, if you're thinking in terms of economics, the supply
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:34.120]   of concerts is very low, whereas there's a whole lot of people who would love to perform.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:39.040]   The demand for giving concerts is high.
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:45.000]   And so there's a big drop off, I think, in terms of, I think we were talking, if you're
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.040]   a tennis star or a golfing star or something like that on the PGA Tour or whatever, you
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:56.880]   could be number 90 or 100 and still make a ton of money and have a tremendous career
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.080]   and have sponsorships and whatnot.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:04.000]   But in the classical music world, that's much different.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:12.920]   Maybe the first, the top few people might have, make a decent living.
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:19.600]   Still not going to be in the range of like golf or tennis, but after you get to the number,
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:24.960]   maybe it's five, maybe it's 10, then it's like feast or famine.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.640]   They might not have any concerts.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.640]   In the world?
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.920]   Yeah, in the world.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.920]   It's very, very small.
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:42.560]   And it's not that it's impossible, but it's not as glamorous as it sounds in general,
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:43.960]   the industry.
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:49.200]   I think you make a really good point that, and I know you're being modest, that there
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:55.960]   are a lot of talented people out there who can do what we do, but not everybody has the
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.480]   same opportunity.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:02.680]   And this is really something that we talk about and I think society needs to recognize
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:07.040]   the people who have that head start, who are wealthier, who are better connected, tend
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:12.120]   to stay wealthier and more connected because you just end up helping your friends or your
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.680]   cousins.
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:20.160]   And human nature is we take care of the people we know more than the people we don't.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.560]   So the people who don't have that opportunity, it's going to be very tough.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.200]   And I think that's why we need to fight for people who don't have that opportunity because
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:32.480]   so many people I think can do more, but they just aren't given that chance.
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:36.960]   So that's something, a theme that I do talk about on Financial Samurai.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:41.480]   I love that everything is free on Financial Samurai, the podcast, the content.
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:46.320]   So anybody who wants to learn about personal finance can if they want to.
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.320]   Absolutely.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:53.840]   Let's talk a little bit about the economics of being a musician because you are one of
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.360]   the top five pianists who can make…
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.160]   No, no, no, I don't think so.
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:06.720]   I would say you're in the top 0.1% of pianists and you could, like if you talked about the
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.360]   concerts and everything, tell me more about that.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:16.440]   And also in college you majored in economics and I think you mentioned to me in our lunch
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:23.280]   conversation that you were being drawn to "the dark side of maybe consulting finance."
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:29.440]   But you held strong and you decided to continue doing music.
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:35.880]   So how did you push back against the draw, the allure of immediate financial rewards
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.440]   to focus on being a musician?
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:44.920]   Well, so when I was choosing colleges I ended up going with one of those joint programs
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:45.920]   we talked about.
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.080]   So I did the Harvard NEC one.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.680]   NEC stands for New England Conservatory of Music.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:54.520]   It's one of the big music schools in the US and the world.
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.560]   And they're both in Boston.
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.120]   Harvard's just across the river in Cambridge.
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:05.120]   And so I got there and I thought, "Okay, if I couldn't do music," and I wasn't
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.480]   necessarily dead set on doing music, but music was something I loved.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.920]   And I was performing more and more.
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:16.640]   Kind of starting in high school I was starting to actually travel long distances for concerts
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.260]   and stuff.
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:21.400]   And I was thinking, "Well, if I can't do that, what would I do?"
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:25.360]   And I always thought medicine and business were interesting.
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:31.320]   My dad has a rare neurological disease called reflex sympathetic dystrophy.
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:35.880]   It's one of those kind of freak of nature diseases that no one knows the cause of or
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:39.520]   the cure for, but it causes intense neurological pain.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.920]   So he was bedridden most of my life.
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.480]   He's doing a little better now.
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:47.040]   He's walking around and stuff.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:50.920]   So maybe that's what drew me to medicine a little bit.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.560]   So I thought maybe business or medicine.
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:59.000]   So I interned on Wall Street at NYSE Euro next one summer.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:06.480]   I had a final round interview at Black Rock or something.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.960]   And I remember calling the guy.
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:15.520]   So at the end of the four years I'd been traveling many weekends, I would be on the road giving
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:21.200]   a concert and emailing in homework and stuff, I think, and then coming back for lectures
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.200]   during the week.
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.680]   And at the end I had to make a decision.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:30.680]   Am I going to go down the finance route or something where I'd probably make a tremendously
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.600]   lot more money than I am now?
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.200]   Or am I going to do the music route?
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:40.720]   And I had applied to Juilliard for their AD programs, artist diploma.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.920]   It's kind of, I always joke around artist diploma.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.400]   I joked before I got one too.
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.480]   It's like, why do you need a diploma to be an artist?
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.400]   That's kind of, what's the point of that?
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:55.480]   But it's a terminal degree.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:59.640]   So it's basically, I kind of think of it as like, artist diploma is almost like a JD but
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.640]   for music.
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.680]   It's very practical performance based.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.760]   And then there's other options.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.080]   There's also a DMA, which is a doctor of musical arts.
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:12.640]   That's like if you want to, it's more like musicology.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:16.780]   So if you want to become a professor somewhere, it's kind of straddling between some performance
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:17.780]   and some teaching.
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:22.280]   And then there's like PhD in music, which is all like hypothetical for the most part.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.280]   And some people do multiple.
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:29.160]   But anyway, I thought, I remember giving, I was sitting at Prudential Center in the
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:33.320]   food court, I think, in Boston.
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:38.320]   And I remember calling up the guy who was my, or the guy interviewing me and I told
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:43.480]   him I was just going to cancel because I'm, I think, yeah.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:49.280]   And I don't think he was very pleased, but the bottom line was like, I chose to go down
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.280]   that route.
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:51.280]   And I'm very glad I did.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.960]   I'm glad you did too.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:57.640]   But the economics of it, you ask, a lot of people, it's definitely not as glamorous as
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:58.640]   it seems.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:03.340]   Like I can see from the outside how people would be like, oh, it's so, people probably
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.320]   may think I make a tremendous amount of money to these concerts.
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.820]   They probably thinking in their head, oh, look at these, you know, there's a 2000 people
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:14.280]   here or 1500 people here and we all paid, you know, so much money and Charlie probably
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.280]   gets most of that.
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:19.680]   And that's like just not the way the economics of what I do works.
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:25.040]   Generally how it works is, I mean, you're a sole, you're a, you're self-employed.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.560]   So you're a contractor.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:31.600]   And generally speaking, you, it's not a per ticket thing.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:36.720]   So if nobody comes to the concert, you make the same as if it's sold out.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:40.000]   Usually if it's sold out, it's better because that's probably means that people want to
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.760]   hear you and then, you know, if you can't, no one comes and they might not invite you
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.540]   back a second time.
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:51.320]   But there's no direct, like in the contracts, there's generally no stipulation for like
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:56.160]   percent of ticket sales, which I think might maybe the case in, you know, like pop stars
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:00.340]   and stuff like that, or maybe rock bands.
[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:06.820]   And you go and usually it's a fixed, you know, a fixed fee that they'll pay and it may or
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:12.900]   may not include things like hotel, rental car, airfare, depends on the place.
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:16.620]   And so depending on, you know, where you're playing, you might have to be arranging for
[00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:20.820]   your transportation, hotel, lodging, car, all that stuff.
[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:27.900]   And the other kind of funny part of it is that I've noticed firsthand, and no one explained
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:32.380]   this to me before, maybe they didn't know, I don't know, but like it seems to me that
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:37.460]   there's a correlation, an inverse correlation between like the size and prestige of where
[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.860]   you're playing and the amount of money you get.
[00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:41.260]   At least firsthand, that's kind of where.
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:48.780]   So oftentimes, like if you're playing at the, you know, huge venue, very famous or whatever
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:55.460]   in a big city, you might get paid less than if you played in a smaller town somewhere
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:57.580]   or with a smaller orchestra.
[00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:59.500]   I think there's a correlation there.
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:03.260]   We were talking, I think doctors are very similar, at least here in the United States,
[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:09.580]   where a doctor being any, basically any kind of doctor, they could be doing the same work
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:14.340]   and get paid a fraction in LA that they would be paid if they lived in, you know, maybe
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.300]   rural America somewhere.
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.660]   And it's probably that whole supply and demand thing we keep coming back to where it's, you
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:24.020]   know, it might be harder to get people to come out to rural areas so they have to pay
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:29.260]   more versus, you know, everyone wants to go live in, you know, maybe a big city.
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.580]   But it's similar with music too, I think.
[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:32.580]   Right.
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:36.260]   Well, let me share some perspective from the outside looking in.
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:42.820]   I think you absolutely did the right choice by pursuing music, by pursuing what God-given
[00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:46.580]   talent you've been given and doing the most of it.
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:52.940]   Because you could always go to finance or consulting or whatever if you want.
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:57.860]   But if you went, let's say, the finance route for 10 years, 13 years like I did, I would
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:05.700]   say it would be almost impossible for you to go and give concerts at venues around America.
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:09.340]   I mean, maybe you could do it, but I would say it'd be much more possible.
[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:14.340]   And also it might be impossible because you might be hooked on that, maybe that income
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:16.020]   or that lifestyle that it provides.
[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:20.700]   And it's just like, you know, one more year, one more bonus, one more level to get to MD.
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.660]   And then after that is partner MD and all that stuff.
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:29.020]   So it's an interesting cycle that I broke after 13 years that I don't think a lot of
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:33.020]   people can break because the money tends to be pretty good.
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.660]   It is very rare to break that.
[00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:39.300]   It's very impressive that you were able to because it's that lifestyle.
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:40.780]   Inflation is a big part of it.
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:44.620]   You know, once you have the so high, there's always the next one to go to.
[00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:47.260]   And then you got the place in Greenwich, Connecticut.
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.580]   And then the mortgage is big.
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:49.580]   And then you can't.
[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:52.460]   And there's not many jobs that will be able to support that.
[00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.940]   And yeah, it can – lifestyle creep can happen.
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.540]   You definitely.
[00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:06.980]   So as a hopefully future father, would you recommend your child go the music route if
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:10.820]   you observed her and you notice, "Oh, she's pretty talented.
[00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:11.820]   It could be something."
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:17.980]   What are your thoughts on music as a career or as a passion?
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.540]   That's a good question.
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:27.060]   If she was – if she had musical inclination, I think learning a musical instrument as a
[00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:28.980]   child is very good.
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:32.540]   Like I think there's probably benefits in the brain.
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:38.540]   I think there's probably also the whole teaching of discipline, you know, like you have to
[00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:39.540]   practice.
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:40.540]   You have something you have to do.
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:44.100]   You have a task that you need to accomplish.
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.100]   That's very good.
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:48.900]   My mom was fortunately not a tiger mom like at all.
[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:53.820]   She was kind of the opposite of what the stereotypical tiger mother is.
[00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:56.700]   I was never forced to practice.
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:57.900]   I knew that I was supposed to.
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.260]   When I was a little kid, it was like an hour a day.
[00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:04.180]   And then when I got older, it became like two hours a day, which is actually very low
[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:09.260]   when you compare it to like a lot of people who in maybe middle high school will be practicing
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:13.220]   like the serious classical people who might be practicing four, three, four, five to eight
[00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:15.060]   hours a day, which I would go crazy.
[00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.060]   I would hate it.
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:18.660]   I'd probably quit if I was forced to do that.
[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:23.740]   I think I practiced eight hours a day including a piano lesson once ever, like one time, one
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.980]   day and I was like – it was at a piano festival too.
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.460]   So it probably didn't even count.
[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:34.900]   But no, I think music is good for kids to – I think it's great for brain development.
[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:38.820]   I think it's good for discipline and learning to – you have a task that you need to do.
[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:40.780]   You have a job to do.
[00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:50.980]   In terms of – if my daughter was really like passionate about music and really wanted
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:55.740]   to and that's what she had to do, I hope that I would be supportive.
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:57.660]   I don't have a daughter yet.
[00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:03.060]   We're expecting – I mean we do have a daughter but she's not born yet.
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:04.780]   She's expecting in a few months.
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:05.780]   Thank you.
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:09.860]   But yeah, so we have a daughter now but she's not born quite yet.
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:14.500]   But if she really loved and was passionate about music, I hope that I'd be encouraging
[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:19.260]   but I also consider myself to be one of the – like really pragmatic.
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:20.260]   It's funny.
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:25.300]   My friends always say I'm like super risk-averse as a person but I chose one of the most risky
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:29.580]   careers that you possibly could have chosen.
[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:37.420]   In general, music is not – I mean it doesn't make sense to go into music as a career for
[00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:38.420]   classical music.
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:39.420]   It just doesn't make sense.
[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:40.420]   It doesn't make financial sense.
[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:47.860]   It doesn't make – practically, it doesn't make that much sense.
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:52.820]   But if like my daughter was super passionate and she just felt that she had to do it, I
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.240]   hope that I'd be supportive of that.
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:31:02.780]   But in general, like if you don't – it's almost as if – I can't speak today.
[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:06.380]   It's almost as if if you don't feel like you have to do it and there's nothing else
[00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:09.560]   that you could do aside from that music.
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.900]   If you don't feel like that, then you probably shouldn't go into music.
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:15.660]   Like it's so tough.
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.060]   I mean it's tough financially.
[00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:18.060]   It's tough mentally.
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:23.220]   It's tough just in terms of the BS that you have to put up with a lot that if you
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:27.940]   don't absolutely feel like you have to do it, then it's probably good to not do it
[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:28.940]   and choose something else.
[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:30.460]   There are much easier ways to make money.
[00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:37.220]   There are much easier ways to have a comfortable life than a music career I think.
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:39.500]   I don't want to be a Debbie Downer or anything like that.
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:40.500]   It's very practical.
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:45.820]   But yeah, it's not for the faint of heart I think.
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:48.340]   Well, give us listeners an example.
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:51.820]   Let's say you were able to get into Juilliard.
[00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:57.340]   I don't know what the acceptance rate is there, probably less than 3% or something.
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:01.620]   What does the average Juilliard student do afterwards and what do you think he or she
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:05.820]   makes based on what they're doing?
[00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:10.020]   Piano is a little unique from other instruments because other instruments have basically two
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:14.140]   options in terms of if they want to perform.
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:20.780]   So if you go to a music conservatory, you have maybe two to four options of what you
[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:25.700]   can realistically do if you want to actually use that degree to its fullest.
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:31.820]   You can do what I'm doing and be a solo performer and that's basically the only option for a
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:35.100]   pianist because orchestras don't really have a pianist.
[00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.460]   They usually have a part-time or maybe one.
[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:41.020]   But most orchestra pieces don't involve a piano unless you're doing a solo concerto
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:43.660]   like you do if you're a soloist.
[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:44.860]   So that's one option.
[00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:47.940]   And violinists, other instruments can do that too.
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:50.500]   Violin and cello are probably the most popular of the other.
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:57.060]   There's not many soloists who use some of the other instruments.
[00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:02.000]   Piano, violin, cello are kind of the main soloists, especially piano and violin.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.340]   Another option you can do is if you're an instrumentalist that's not a piano, you can
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:10.460]   try to get a job performing with an orchestra.
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:17.180]   And that's really, that's kind of a, that's like an example of a nine to five of classical
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:18.180]   musicians.
[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:24.060]   So if you get a job as a violinist at the New York Philharmonic, that's like what everyone
[00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:25.980]   dreams of who wants to go down that road.
[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:28.660]   But not anybody, it's very hard to get.
[00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:33.820]   It's extremely hard to get because a lot of these jobs are you have them until you die
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:34.820]   type jobs.
[00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:35.820]   Right.
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:36.820]   Exactly.
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:38.700]   And so like how many people are in an orchestra?
[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:41.220]   80 to 100 maybe for a big one.
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:42.500]   How many violinists are there?
[00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.180]   Those are first and second violin.
[00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:46.180]   Maybe you have a few dozen.
[00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:50.180]   And there's only a spot that opens up if someone retires.
[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:53.940]   And when someone has a job, they aren't going to retire until practically they die.
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:54.940]   Right.
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:34:00.660]   It's very rare for even someone I think to retire even when they get older.
[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:03.820]   Like there's a lot of older people that play in orchestras too because you can, you know,
[00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:06.400]   you can play your instrument your whole life.
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:11.940]   And so only that only when someone, you know, leaves the orchestra, either retires or passes
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:15.420]   away, does that one spot open for the most part.
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:21.220]   And then you have thousands and thousands of people who want to try to get that spot.
[00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:25.020]   And you know, that's super competitive.
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:26.540]   So that's the second one.
[00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:27.540]   Oh, sorry.
[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:28.540]   Yeah.
[00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:32.300]   No, I was going to say I remember I think the San Francisco Philharmonic Orchestra,
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.100]   they won a strike several years ago.
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:37.100]   And so it was revealed how much they got paid.
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:41.940]   And if I recall correctly, I think the pay was something like $160,000 to $200,000.
[00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:44.620]   So that's really, really good money for a musician.
[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:49.940]   I mean, you aren't going to make that being a professor at, I mean, it'd be hard to make
[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:53.540]   that as a professor at even some of the top music schools in the world.
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:55.260]   Like you, yeah.
[00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:59.860]   And a lot of the people working there.
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:01.700]   Yeah.
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:05.620]   So it's very competitive because there's like, as a musician, it's really, really, really
[00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:07.620]   hard to pull those kinds of numbers anywhere.
[00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:08.620]   Right?
[00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:09.620]   Right.
[00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:10.620]   Right.
[00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:12.620]   So the third option would be like being a private teacher.
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:13.620]   Right.
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:19.740]   And then the fourth option would be maybe trying to get a professorship somewhere at
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:22.140]   a college or university.
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:26.180]   And those don't necessarily pay all that great either.
[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:32.780]   So like the most lucrative, if you're thinking just financially, it would probably be the
[00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:37.100]   second option, trying to get a spot at a major orchestra.
[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:38.220]   But of course, there's very few of those.
[00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:43.820]   So there's far more smaller orchestras in the US.
[00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:49.100]   And a lot of those orchestras are pay per concert type things.
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:52.380]   And so a lot of times people, and there's not very many concerts, and they might, a
[00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:56.860]   lot of them give five, six sets of concerts a year, maybe over nine months or so.
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:36:01.620]   And so people in those orchestras will often be a member of multiple orchestras within
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:03.060]   several hours of driving.
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:06.100]   And so they'll just go all over the place performing.
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.380]   Got it.
[00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:11.820]   So definitely sounds difficult.
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:18.300]   It sounds difficult to maybe even make 60 to 70,000 a year regularly.
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.300]   I think so.
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:20.300]   I think so.
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:23.300]   Especially with, yeah, absolutely.
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:24.300]   Yeah.
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:27.900]   So it's definitely something that people need to consider.
[00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:35.660]   And maybe it sounds like what most people do is they get a normal higher paying job,
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:39.060]   and then maybe they can be a musician as their side gig on the side.
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:42.860]   I played with one orchestra in Boston once called the, I think it's called the Longwood
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:44.060]   Symphony.
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:46.140]   And it's made up entirely of doctors.
[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:47.140]   Wow.
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:53.420]   Doctors who practice, I think for the most part, but there's been a lot of talk about
[00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:55.500]   correlation between medicine and music and stuff.
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:59.700]   But a lot of doctors do play instruments, many of which at a very high level.
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:05.180]   And so they have this orchestra that people who are practicing doctors, I think, will
[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:08.380]   come and they'll give a few concerts a year or something, which is really cool.
[00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:13.140]   I mean, that sounds good because I'm assuming if you're a doctor, you're making 300 to
[00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:14.820]   a million dollars a year.
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:18.660]   And then if you are good at music, good enough, that sounds like a win-win.
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:19.660]   Yeah.
[00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:20.660]   Yeah.
[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:21.660]   It could be.
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.780]   It's a good option for a lot of people.
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:28.500]   Of course, whether you should go into medicine now, that might be a changing industry as
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:29.500]   well.
[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:30.500]   That's another discussion.
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:31.500]   Yeah.
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.500]   It's been tough.
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:37.100]   I mean, I had a friend who, one of my good friends from college, became a doctor, cardiologist,
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:38.420]   did a post-fellow and all that.
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:43.460]   And then 10 years after graduating from William & Mary, he's like, "Man, the whole industry
[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:44.460]   changed.
[00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:47.620]   The whole pay structure changed because insurance companies made it much more difficult for
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:49.180]   doctors and litigation and all that."
[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:55.700]   So the compensation as a cardiologist, I think he said, declined by 30 to 40% based on his
[00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:56.700]   expectations.
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:57.700]   Wow.
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:00.220]   And a lot of shifts in the industry are happening now.
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:04.020]   Private equity firms are acquiring more and more private practices.
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:06.260]   I think that's happening across the country quite a bit.
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:12.020]   And then that changes a whole bunch of everything as well because now it's less doctors who
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:17.900]   are working for themselves or for a hospital and shifting more toward doctors working for
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:21.700]   a financial group of some kind.
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:23.060]   Yeah.
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:28.540]   Let me ask, in terms of, again, being a musician, if you don't have your fingers and hands,
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:30.500]   you can't play, right?
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:33.140]   And this is something that I've been thinking about myself because if I don't have my fingers
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:35.580]   and hands, I can't write.
[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:39.640]   And one of the things I like to do is forecast my future.
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:43.500]   And several years ago, I started getting carpal tunnel syndrome in my wrist.
[00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:45.980]   I was like, "Man, I don't want to write because I'm just writing too much."
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:48.620]   So I slowed down my writing.
[00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:52.940]   And also my vision during the pandemic started getting poor.
[00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:56.820]   My visual acuity and then the diopter was getting worse.
[00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:59.140]   My myopia, my nearsightedness.
[00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:03.020]   And I was thinking to myself, "At this rate, I don't know if I can continue writing in
[00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:04.300]   10 years."
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:09.220]   So I thought, "Well, I think as a hedge, let's just do more podcasts because hopefully my
[00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:12.100]   voice will last for a long period of time."
[00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:19.100]   Do you as a musician think, "There might be one day where my fingers and hands don't work
[00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:23.300]   or my fingers don't listen to my brain," because right now I'm assuming a lot of the notes
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:24.540]   you play is just automatic.
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:27.620]   It's just like walking or talking or breathing.
[00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:29.620]   A lot is muscle memory.
[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:30.620]   Yeah, muscle memory.
[00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:34.900]   Do you worry about in the future one day not being able to play?
[00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:39.100]   I hope that it doesn't ever happen that I can't play.
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:40.620]   I don't worry about it.
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:42.420]   I just try not to worry about it, that is.
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:44.060]   Maybe I should.
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:49.820]   But I've been fortunate to have been able to play for so long.
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:56.620]   I'm in my 30s now and I've been playing for decades and decades.
[00:39:56.620 --> 00:40:05.140]   I love music and if there was a time that I physically or mentally couldn't do it, I
[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:08.220]   probably would be very sad.
[00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:12.020]   I hope I wouldn't be depressed or something.
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:16.180]   I'd probably be very sad.
[00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:19.540]   I guess the only thing you can do is hope that it doesn't happen and pray to God that
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:20.540]   it doesn't happen.
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:24.140]   No, I think you can do more though.
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:27.900]   The reason why I bring this up is because I'm 45 now and so I didn't really think about
[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:30.900]   physical ailments as much in my 30s at your age.
[00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:34.620]   But I listened to Izzac Perlman play before he retired.
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:35.620]   An amazing musician.
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:37.660]   My wife loves him.
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:38.660]   Incredible.
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:42.600]   I think for normal people who don't know music, they can't really tell when a musician messes
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:44.460]   up on stage.
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:48.780]   I'm definitely a normal to below normal person in terms of music.
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:50.860]   But I heard him mess up a little bit.
[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:55.420]   He has huge hands and I was like, "Oh man, this could be his swan song."
[00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:56.940]   It was a little bit sad.
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:03.140]   And what I'm saying is that it's tough to face our mortality but man, I think it's like
[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:05.160]   around 40, 45.
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:09.740]   It seems like the things that we thought we could always do tend to fade.
[00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:18.020]   And so for you, I feel like your talent is unbelievable but if you could record more
[00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:24.420]   of your music on CDs or just on YouTube and all that and then it would last forever.
[00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:30.860]   I think that's one of the best hedges I guess or to diversify your identity.
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:36.500]   Because what happens is the more we're invested in our careers or who we think we are, like
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:42.340]   for you as a musician or for me as a banker or whatever, if we lose that, oh man, it's
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:45.580]   very devastating and it could take a while to get out of that hole.
[00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:48.420]   It kind of becomes part of your identity really, right?
[00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:49.420]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:55.020]   People's occupations, they kind of become embedded with kind of who they are for better
[00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:56.700]   or for worse.
[00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:58.100]   I do try to record a lot.
[00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:01.220]   I have a few albums out and I've been doing more and more with YouTube.
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:03.660]   So shameless plug for YouTube.
[00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:04.660]   Absolutely.
[00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:09.180]   But yeah, so I try to record more and more.
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:14.180]   And I do a little bit of teaching on the side and things like that remotely.
[00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:18.860]   But yeah, it would be – so as a musician, there are some things you can also do to try
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:22.900]   to prevent potential problems.
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:26.060]   One of the most important things – I mean it doesn't guarantee it at all.
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:30.720]   But one of the most important things is staying very loose when you're playing.
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:34.700]   One thing that happens and it can kind of happen from a very young age is if you get
[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:38.260]   into the habit of being tense while you're performing or practicing or anything like
[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:44.100]   that, tightening up your hands, fingers, wrists, arms, all that stuff.
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:45.900]   Those habits are hard to break.
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:52.340]   But also they can kind of exacerbate potential problems and lead to problems.
[00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:57.620]   But staying loose, even when you're playing crazy stuff, there's bajillions of microseconds
[00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:01.940]   where you can take a split second to rest and keep loosey-goosey for lack of a better
[00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:03.140]   term.
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:09.860]   That is extremely important I think to help prevent things like carpal tunnel and things
[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:10.860]   like that.
[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:14.380]   I don't want to be a doctor or anything but staying loose I think is very important.
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:15.380]   Yeah.
[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:20.460]   Have you ever had a point in doing a performance where your brain just froze up and you didn't
[00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:21.460]   know what to play?
[00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:22.460]   Oh yeah.
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:23.460]   Memory slips.
[00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:24.460]   Those are horrible.
[00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:30.820]   Luckily, that's when I can – that's when the improvisation portion comes in and I can
[00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:32.220]   just kind of make something up.
[00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:37.740]   A lot of the time, a lot of the time, very few people will know.
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:39.860]   I remember when I was a kid, it happened to me once.
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:43.540]   I was playing – I think I was like 13 or 14 and my teacher was with me.
[00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:49.420]   I was playing with an orchestra in I think Port Angeles, Washington.
[00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:50.660]   You're playing entirely by memory.
[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:54.740]   So like I skipped a part and I'm playing with like an 80-piece orchestra and they are not
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.740]   skipping the part because they've got the music.
[00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:03.940]   I like skipped like a page or something or looped back or something because sometimes
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:07.820]   from going to one section to another, like one or two notes can mean whether you repeat
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:11.140]   a section or go on to the next section.
[00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:15.660]   Somehow though, the conductor and I like connected during the performance and we figured it out
[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:19.860]   and we got through it and it was smooth enough that my teacher didn't even realize.
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:22.300]   He was sitting there watching the performance.
[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:23.780]   So that was good.
[00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:28.660]   But it happens and that's probably one of my bigger fears when it comes to performing
[00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:34.860]   is that sometimes no matter how much you practice, how much you prepare, sometimes it's – your
[00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:36.920]   mind can just go blank and you'd like look at your hands.
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:40.700]   Just like when you think about how to walk, if you think about the physical movements
[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:44.580]   of your toes and feet and ankles and stuff and your legs as you're walking, suddenly
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:45.940]   you forget how to walk, right?
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:49.000]   It becomes awkward.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.860]   But yeah, it can be – that can be kind of scary.
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:56.100]   You told me something that I found fascinating.
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:45:03.860]   You said that before you give a show, you practice for a whole year the piece.
[00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:09.220]   Is that – a whole year and when you say a whole year, how many hours do you practice
[00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:12.440]   a week for that whole year on that piece?
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:17.700]   So yeah, I like to – if it's a new piece, depending on how weird sounding the piece
[00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:22.100]   is, if it's kind of a normal sounding piece, it's a little bit easier because you can
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:25.420]   intuitively know if something is right or wrong because it just sounds right or wrong.
[00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:29.380]   But then there are some pieces that it's not so clear.
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:32.060]   Maybe everything sounds wrong and so you have to – you don't know if it's right or
[00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:33.220]   wrong.
[00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:35.300]   I like to – I'm a horrible sight reader.
[00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:36.300]   I'm very slow.
[00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:40.460]   But I'm pretty good at memorizing.
[00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:44.020]   But I like to have at least a year to like slowly do the piece.
[00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:47.880]   But many pieces that I perform, you know, some of the pieces I perform even today are
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:50.580]   pieces that I've learned, you know, 20 years ago.
[00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:54.520]   That's one of the things also, as you get older as a performer, it's not – because
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:58.820]   it's not just about who can play fastest or who can play, you know, the loudest or
[00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:02.580]   anything like that because it's, you know, it's a lot of – it's art and entertainment.
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:04.660]   It's subjective.
[00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:09.380]   As you get older, maybe, you know, even people who are 70 who are performing, you know, they're
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:13.860]   not in the youth of their life at that stage.
[00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:19.980]   But a lot of times, their performing can be just absolutely incredible in its depth and
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:23.460]   stuff and maybe they're technically not as proficient as they were when they were
[00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:24.460]   25.
[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:25.460]   Yeah.
[00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:31.580]   But, you know, they have that – it's overcompensated by – it can be overcompensated by the level
[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:37.900]   of maturity and insight into what and how they're playing it that can make it just,
[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:39.700]   you know, incredibly moving.
[00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:40.700]   Right.
[00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:44.740]   Well, one of the things – one of the reasons why I thought it was incredible that you practice
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:50.300]   for a whole year before performing the piece is because in my mind, I think, well, you've
[00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:51.940]   had decades of experience.
[00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:53.580]   You know the music.
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:55.420]   You can listen and pick up.
[00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:59.540]   I'm always thinking, ah, you know, I would say, yeah, two weeks of practice and you're
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:02.540]   good to go or a month of practice and you're good to go.
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:07.180]   And the point I'm trying to make to listeners is that getting to the top of whatever your
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:11.220]   craft, it just doesn't come by winging it.
[00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:14.860]   You've got to work at it over and over and over again.
[00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:18.020]   And even if you've mastered it, things can still mess up and that's why you've got
[00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:20.100]   to continue to work at it.
[00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:21.100]   Absolutely.
[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:26.380]   And it's – I think you've probably heard that saying or something or maybe it was a
[00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:32.460]   TikTok trend or something and it's like, oh, you pay someone, an expert craftsman or
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:37.180]   something and they can fix it in five minutes and then they charge a lot of money or something.
[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:40.360]   And then the person might be like, oh, why is it – you only work for five minutes.
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.580]   How come it costs $500 or whatever?
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:44.340]   And it's like, well, you're not paying for that five minutes.
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:48.860]   You're paying for the 50 years of dedication and experience and practice to be able to
[00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:50.860]   do it in five minutes.
[00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:51.860]   Right.
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:52.860]   That's exactly right.
[00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:57.620]   And it's a lot – if I were to calculate like how much I make in terms of like per
[00:47:57.620 --> 00:48:03.500]   hour, it would probably be like single digit cents or less per hour when you factor in
[00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:06.580]   the practicing and the work over the years and stuff.
[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:10.180]   It's definitely not for the money.
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:14.060]   Now, I hear you.
[00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:20.020]   In conclusion, I actually want to learn or hear from you about your thoughts on delusion.
[00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:25.340]   And this is interesting because you say you do teaching and I'm sure teaching pays pretty
[00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:26.340]   well.
[00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:28.820]   I've taught myself high school tennis for three years.
[00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:30.180]   It doesn't pay very well.
[00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:35.700]   But I've also had to manage expectations for the children, the high schoolers and also
[00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:40.200]   the parents who might think that their children are better than they are and deserve to play
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:44.020]   at a higher level on the depth charts, on the rankings.
[00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:50.100]   So as a teacher, I'm presuming that you can kind of identify within the first five
[00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:57.100]   minutes, maybe two minutes, whether the child is talented or maybe just not as talented
[00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:58.980]   as the parents think.
[00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:05.700]   So how do you as a teacher make sure that the child is not crushed in terms of their
[00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:08.100]   hopes and dreams of being like an amazing musician?
[00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:11.820]   And how do you manage the expectations of the parents?
[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:16.140]   Because you will find out eventually when you become a father that your child will be
[00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:21.180]   the most beautiful, amazing child in the world and you might have – fall under their spell
[00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:24.940]   in terms of thinking they're better than they really are in whatever they like to do.
[00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:28.780]   That's a good question.
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:29.820]   I think you're probably right.
[00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:35.860]   You can – like in terms of teaching, you can tell if someone has the X factor or not
[00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:40.620]   within probably seconds of them playing.
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:45.580]   But I might even say a step further and say that most people – maybe not when they're
[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:49.820]   super young but when they're a little older, if you see someone who is in middle school
[00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:55.460]   playing an instrument, you can tell if they have – even a normal person who is not in
[00:49:55.460 --> 00:50:00.540]   music at all can watch that person play, watch the kid play and be like, "That kid has
[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:02.540]   it or doesn't?"
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:07.580]   I think it's – I think that at least for music, it's pretty clear.
[00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:13.100]   You see some kids who are 8 years old who are just like – you're jaw dropping.
[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:14.780]   It's like holy smokes.
[00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:16.940]   What is – like this is incredible.
[00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:21.780]   Then there's most kids who aren't.
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:30.540]   So I'm sure there are parents who are delusional about my kid is going to be the next yo-yo
[00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:38.180]   mom when they're clearly not, no matter how much they practice or work or whatever.
[00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:39.500]   With my students, I try to be clear.
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:43.860]   If the parents ask about it, I can tell them, "Well, they're probably not going to do
[00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:45.260]   this as a career."
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:46.780]   I can tell.
[00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:50.120]   But I think at least I've been fortunate enough that the people I've worked with have
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:53.700]   not been delusional I think in terms of that.
[00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:59.900]   But it's probably important to be – you can say it in a nice way but like at least
[00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:06.020]   to the parents, if they are delusional, it's probably best to at least be up front with
[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:08.620]   them and be like, "I don't think."
[00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:10.420]   I might be wrong but – yeah.
[00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:11.420]   >> Right.
[00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:13.540]   I mean it's a tough conversation.
[00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:19.380]   I truly believe being congruent with your thoughts and your actions and the reality
[00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:25.100]   is so important to manage happiness because the worst is if you think you deserve to go
[00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:30.780]   to Harvard and you don't get into Harvard or you deserve to be a concert pianist and
[00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:33.500]   you can't get any gigs, it's really soul crushing.
[00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:40.820]   But if you can adjust your expectations more closely to reality, that will bring a greater
[00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:43.220]   level of happiness.
[00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:47.500]   >> There was this thing on the internet that I read a long time ago and they had like a
[00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:50.740]   bunch of diagrams and stuff and they were like, "Happiness is the difference between
[00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:52.860]   expectation and reality.
[00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:57.860]   And if expectations exceed reality, then that's like – it makes you sad.
[00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:01.340]   But if reality exceeds your expectations, then that's like happy."
[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:04.380]   There's probably some truth there.
[00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:06.100]   >> No, for sure.
[00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:09.060]   I've had pretty low expectations all my life.
[00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:14.180]   I mean since like trying to take the SATs, I was like, "How do you guys get high SATs?"
[00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:18.180]   I had to – I remember going to Barnes & Noble and just flipping through the SAT prep book.
[00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:21.860]   I was thinking, "Oh, well if I flip through it, I must be learning."
[00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:26.340]   But clearly I was fooling myself because my SAT scores were quite poor and we couldn't
[00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:30.380]   afford like $2,500 Princeton review stuff.
[00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:34.660]   But by going to a public school, I was thinking, "Oh, if I get a $30,000 a year job, I'll
[00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:35.940]   be happy."
[00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:39.980]   And so yeah, please manage expectations, folks.
[00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:45.320]   I know I talk to really successful people in their arts like yourself and others.
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:50.620]   But I'm just curious as to how people get to where they are right now.
[00:52:50.620 --> 00:52:54.780]   It's always amazing to hear from people like you directly.
[00:52:54.780 --> 00:53:03.660]   >> I think comparison also is something that can be – can cause you to be less happy.
[00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:08.540]   If you compare occasionally with other people in your field or whatever, it can – and
[00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:10.300]   you can use that as motivation.
[00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:14.180]   Oh, like I can – that person did this.
[00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:15.180]   That's great.
[00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:16.180]   Great for them.
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:18.700]   I'm going to try to do something amazing too.
[00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:22.260]   If you can use it as motivation on occasion, that can be good.
[00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:26.300]   But if you're always going through social media and it's like, "Oh, so-and-so is
[00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:28.900]   doing this and I'm not.
[00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:33.700]   How come I'm not as advanced in my career or in my whatever?"
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:38.560]   There's very little that can – good that can come from that kind of thing as well.
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:43.020]   Especially in careers where a lot of it is subjective and a lot of it isn't necessarily
[00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:51.140]   how many hours you put in, that can be especially kind of a difficult thing.
[00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:54.420]   So not comparing yourself too much is a good thing I think.
[00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:59.500]   >> Yeah, it's tough because on Financial Samurai, I just write about my experiences
[00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:01.300]   and I'm in an expensive city.
[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:02.300]   I live in New York City.
[00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:03.700]   Now I'm in San Francisco.
[00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:07.500]   So when I write these figures, sometimes people are like, "Are you kidding me?
[00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:10.620]   Those are ridiculous figures, ridiculous income levels."
[00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:14.940]   And I'm saying, "Well, that's just the reality of the income in these areas and
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:18.580]   the cost of living is higher than obviously in the Midwest."
[00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:22.300]   So it's hard sometimes when I'm writing or talking.
[00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:26.260]   I don't want to be everything to all people, but I also want to be cognizant that people
[00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:27.740]   have different realities.
[00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:31.140]   So hopefully listeners can realize that.
[00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:36.980]   We all are in our little bubbles, but it's really fun to learn about people doing different
[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:37.980]   things.
[00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:38.980]   >> Absolutely.
[00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:39.980]   Yeah.
[00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:45.340]   So Charlie, if people want to subscribe to your YouTube channel and listen to your stuff,
[00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:47.900]   where can they find you?
[00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:50.080]   >> You can find me on most online stuff.
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:56.460]   So my YouTube and Instagram and Facebook are all charliealbrightpianist.
[00:54:56.460 --> 00:55:00.480]   My albums and stuff are I think somewhere on there and then there's also Apple Music
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:02.260]   and Spotify, all that good stuff.
[00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:05.180]   And then my website's just my name, charliealbright.com.
[00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:11.300]   And then that's where all the upcoming concert touring info is and stuff.
[00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:16.100]   So yeah, so you can check me out online or if I'm in their area, they can come see a
[00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:20.260]   show and say, "Hey, I heard you're on with Sam Dogan on Financial Samurai.
[00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:21.260]   That'd be awesome."
[00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:23.980]   Meeting you was so tremendous too.
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:28.700]   I've been a fan of yours for what, over a decade or something?
[00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:32.940]   And finally getting to know you and meeting you and all that stuff has been just awesome.
[00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:35.020]   >> No, it's really great.
[00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:40.340]   And your concert, your performance was the most entertaining concert I've ever seen really
[00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:45.900]   because of you just stopping and showing to the audience that you're a real person with
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:50.100]   a personality and you're telling a story and interacting.
[00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:52.700]   I've never seen a concert like that before.
[00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:58.120]   Maybe it's because I'm not an experienced concert goer, but I've seen enough to say
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:00.140]   that it was truly entertaining.
[00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:02.020]   I hope you do more of that.
[00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:03.020]   >> I try.
[00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:04.020]   I try.
[00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:07.860]   There's a thing called classical music is dying and that's the best thing for classical
[00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:08.860]   music.
[00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:10.540]   It was a long time ago.
[00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:14.540]   It was on CNN and the first classical was in quotes.
[00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:18.940]   My point was the classical rules of classical music are dying.
[00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:20.980]   No talking at all.
[00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:25.820]   If someone coughs, you send them a laser eyes and shut the concert down.
[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:33.940]   This kind of full of themselves, uppity kind of idea of classical music is dumb, I think.
[00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:37.180]   Talking and interacting and just making it low key.
[00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:39.620]   It's not me playing and people listening.
[00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:41.380]   We're all sharing an experience together.
[00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:42.380]   We're all having fun.
[00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:43.380]   >> Interactive.
[00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:44.380]   >> I think that's important.
[00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:45.900]   >> Oh, it's so important.
[00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:51.540]   Just to learn about the piece and then hear it is huge.
[00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:53.060]   So keep it up.
[00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:58.340]   I hope other musicians who are listening keep that interaction up as well because it's been
[00:56:58.340 --> 00:56:59.340]   wonderful.
[00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:01.900]   I'm going to link to all the stuff you said in the show notes.
[00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:03.700]   And Charlie, thanks again for your time.
[00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:04.700]   It's been great talking to you.
[00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:05.700]   >> All right.
[00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:06.700]   Thanks again, Sam.
[00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:07.700]   >> All right.
[00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:08.700]   Bye-bye.
[00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:08.700]   >> Bye.
[00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:18.400]   [ Silence ]
