[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.920]   Today's question is anonymous.
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.440]   Whether it's from a man or from a woman, I don't know.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.280]   Here it is.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.960]   Pastor John, why did God make some people ugly
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.280]   and unattractive?
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.880]   How can I accept the fact that God,
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.320]   though capable of making me beautiful,
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.120]   or at least average looking,
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.040]   chose to create me in an unattractive manner?
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.600]   As an unattractive person myself,
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.360]   I can say life is tough for us.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.320]   Our opinions and ideas are most often sidelined.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.420]   We have it tough in offices and schools and colleges.
[00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.680]   I can't express in words how difficult it is
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.160]   to be confident.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.900]   This is straining my relationship with God.
[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.640]   Clearly in the Bible, there are some features
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.460]   described as examples of beauty.
[00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.360]   I count dozens of verses in the Bible
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.600]   that speak of physical beauty.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.960]   Moses was a fair and beautiful child.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.120]   We see that in Exodus 2-2 and Hebrews 11-23.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.000]   David was ruddy and handsome in appearance,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.960]   1 Samuel 17-42.
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.760]   Esther had a beautiful figure and was lovely to look at,
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.160]   Esther 2-7.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.560]   Absalom had thick hair and from the sole of his foot
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.540]   to the crown of his head, there was no blemish in him,
[00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.860]   2 Samuel 14-25.
[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.800]   Now, I know God is concerned about what we do
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.560]   with our bodies and he cares about our bodies.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.800]   So why does he make some of us so unattractive?
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.080]   When I hear a question like this, it makes me groan.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.720]   Partly because I can count on three fingers,
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.720]   maybe less, the people who have ever called me ugly
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.860]   or handsome.
[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.740]   In other words, I groan because I know I'm being asked
[00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.160]   to speak to a sorrow that I've never tasted.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.300]   It would be so much easier for me to just ignore
[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.360]   this question because I know that when I'm done,
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.680]   many people would have the right to say,
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.600]   but you've never experienced this.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.540]   And that's true.
[00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.700]   Another reason it makes me groan to hear a question
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.700]   like this is that I know that what this person calls ugly
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.440]   is the tip of the iceberg of human suffering
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.440]   when it comes, for example, to horrific deformities.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.800]   The kinds of dreadful disfigurements that in another age
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.340]   would be exploited in what were often advertised
[00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.860]   as freak, human freak shows.
[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.260]   And then there are the kinds of diseases
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.260]   that produce hideous malformations and growths
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.900]   and cankerous, open, unhealable flesh.
[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.280]   And then there are ghastly wounds that leave a person
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.240]   in pain the rest of their lives, disabled, unsightly.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.220]   So as I try to say something biblical,
[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.240]   which is all I have any claim to say
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.480]   as far as helpfulness or authority goes,
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.160]   I have all of that in mind.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.160]   I see this question about ugliness as a species
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.320]   of a larger question about disfigurement and disease
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.060]   and deformity and injury.
[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.920]   And if anyone thinks this is not relevant for them,
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.320]   keep in mind that you may not start life ugly,
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.140]   but you may well spend the last year curled up
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.600]   like in a fetal position,
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.800]   weighing 80 pounds and wearing a diaper.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.960]   Very few people escape the relevance of this question
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.440]   at some point.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.080]   I think the deepest answer to the question
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.400]   why there is so much ugliness and deformity
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.400]   and injury and disability and misery in the world
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.480]   is found in Romans 8, 18 to 23.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.520]   I don't think it gets any more helpful or important,
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.280]   profound than these verses.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.800]   So I want to read the whole thing,
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.380]   making comments as I go,
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.040]   because I think this paragraph is worth meditating
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.400]   on the rest of your life.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.240]   Here's what he says.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.440]   This is Paul in Romans 8, 18.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.440]   "I consider that the sufferings of this present time,"
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.320]   now I'm going to include in that
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.480]   every form of ugliness or disfigurement,
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.020]   and you'll see why I include it
[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.280]   in this word sufferings as we go on.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.160]   "I consider that the sufferings of this present time
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.440]   are not worth comparing with the glory
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.660]   that is to be revealed to us."
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.560]   So the fundamental hope of Christianity
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.560]   is suffering now, glory later.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.140]   Suffering now, glory later.
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.560]   Now, what kind of suffering?
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.560]   Verse 19, "For the creation waits with eager longing
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.060]   for the revealing of the sons of God."
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.040]   Now, take note,
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.360]   this is not persecution suffering primarily here.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.880]   This is creation-based suffering.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.320]   "The creation waits with eager longing
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.000]   for the revealing of the sons of God,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.720]   for the creation was subjected to futility,
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.120]   not willingly, but because of him who subjected it in hope."
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.200]   Now, who's that?
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.680]   That's God, because only God subjects the creation in hope.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.560]   The devil doesn't do that, sinful man doesn't do that.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.560]   Only God subjects the creation to futility in hope.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.920]   So this is a reference to the fall, Genesis 3,
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.680]   the fall into sin and the consequent miseries
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.760]   that were brought into the world.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.340]   All the horrific consequences of sin,
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.280]   including every disfigurement, every injury,
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.240]   every disability, every catastrophe.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.240]   And so he says, "God subjected the creation to that in hope."
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.880]   What hope?
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.600]   Verse 21, "The hope that the creation itself
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.600]   will be set free from its bondage to corruption."
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.240]   Now, that's just another phrase for subjection to futility.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.940]   So you get subjection to futility and bondage to corruption.
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.940]   Corruption, the word, decay, ruination, futility, horrors.
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.180]   And obtain, continuing now with the description of the hope,
[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.420]   and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God.
[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.420]   So the physical world, the creation, including our bodies,
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:54.340]   will share in the glory God has destined for his children.
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.400]   Verse 22, "For we know that the whole creation
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.860]   has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth
[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.460]   until now."
[00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.100]   What an image.
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.220]   This is another way of saying subjected in hope.
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.980]   It's as if the creation is pregnant,
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.700]   and all the pain and misery and disfigurement
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.320]   are like cosmic birth pangs.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.320]   A mother crying out in pain, a world in labor.
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.460]   Verse 23, "And not only the creation, but we ourselves."
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.060]   Now, here's where it gets really personal.
[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.660]   "Not only the creation, but we ourselves,
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.740]   who have the first fruits of the Spirit."
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.540]   And you can hear Paul responding to people here who say,
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.660]   "Look, I'm saved, I'm redeemed, I'm forgiven.
[00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.000]   I'm a child of God, I have the Spirit of God in me.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.540]   How can it be going so bad for me?"
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.140]   And he's drawing attention to that.
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.260]   Yes, you too, you too groan inwardly
[00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:57.940]   as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons.
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.620]   And here's the phrase, "The redemption of our bodies."
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:06.140]   That covers the whole waterfront of aging miseries,
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:11.140]   disease miseries, disability miseries, ugliness miseries.
[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:15.420]   In other words, he makes explicit that the horrors
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.020]   of groaning and corruption and futility
[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:22.300]   include Spirit-filled Christians.
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:26.300]   Our bodies, our bodies, John Piper's body,
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:31.020]   Tony Ranke's body, everybody's body desperately needs now
[00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.980]   or will need soon redemption.
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.340]   We feel it in disease, we feel it in aging,
[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:42.980]   and we see it in the mirror, some early, some late.
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.260]   And that redemption is coming.
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.180]   I think that's the most important passage in the Bible
[00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.300]   for our friend to think about.
[00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:55.260]   Ugliness and disfigurement have their roots
[00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.340]   in the origin of human sin.
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.500]   Now, listen carefully,
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:03.180]   'cause this could be so easily misunderstood.
[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.960]   Not in a person's particular personal sin,
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.560]   but the origin of human sin in Adam and Eve,
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.040]   which infected the whole human race.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.020]   In his wisdom, God decreed
[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.540]   that there would be physical manifestations
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:23.700]   of the horrors and outrage of sin against God.
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:28.080]   This does not mean that everyone's disability
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.660]   or everyone's disease or everyone's disfigurement
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.720]   is because of their own sin.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.240]   John 9:3 makes clear that's not the case.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.740]   They asked Jesus, "Who sinned, this man or his parents,
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.140]   "that he was born blind?"
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.440]   And Jesus answered, "It was not that this man sinned
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.100]   "or his parents, but that the works of God
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.060]   "might be displayed in him."
[00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:58.060]   So the point is, Romans 8 gives a global explanation
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:04.180]   for why there is such a thing in the world as ugliness
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:07.140]   and every form of physical misery.
[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:12.000]   God brought the physical world, the bodily world,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   into sync, into correspondence with the moral world.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.980]   He made physical ugliness and misery correspond
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.460]   to moral ugliness and misery,
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:30.600]   even in some of the most godly people on the planet.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:35.260]   Every bodily or material burden in the world
[00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:39.500]   should point us to the burden of sin.
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.240]   Every ugliness should point to the ugliness
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.040]   of sin and Satan.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.820]   Satan is a real secondary cause under God.
[00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:54.820]   He is immediately responsible for many physical horrors.
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:59.460]   Jesus said that in Luke 13, 16.
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.080]   There was a woman bent over for 18 years,
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.840]   so picture her, she's probably walking at a 90-degree angle
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.600]   with a horrible scoliosis.
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.480]   And he says, "Ought not this woman, a daughter of Abraham,
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.820]   "whom Satan bound for 18 years, be loosed?"
[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:20.560]   So all physical ugliness and deformity and misery
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:25.560]   points to the moral ugliness and deformity of sin and Satan.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:30.480]   And then, within that global sorrow
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.820]   and corruption and futility,
[00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:37.820]   God saves sinners and promises new bodies
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.680]   at the cost of his son's life.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:46.680]   He sends Christ into the world, described like this.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.860]   "He had no form or majesty that we should look at him
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:55.860]   "and no beauty that we should desire him," Isaiah 53, 2.
[00:11:55.860 --> 00:12:00.760]   He took it all on himself, all the ugliness, all the misery,
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:06.660]   and died to put an end to all ugliness and all misery
[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:11.320]   for everyone who trusts him and treasures him
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.120]   more than we treasure human beauty.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:19.360]   And then he makes all physical ugliness
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.980]   in his precious blood-bought people,
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:27.980]   he makes all physical ugliness serve to show his own worth
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:35.260]   because he satisfies the soul so completely
[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.860]   and promises a future so glorious
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:45.480]   that he makes his homely family happy.
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:52.400]   And that happiness, in spite of all earthly rejection,
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:57.680]   bears witness to the all-satisfying moral beauty of Christ
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.940]   and the confidence we will share in it.
[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:04.660]   Christ is most glorified in us
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:07.340]   when we are most satisfied in him,
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:12.340]   especially in our temporary ugliness.
[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:13.940]   - Yeah, thank you, Pastor John, that's a good word,
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.060]   pointing us back to the satisfaction that we have in Christ
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.040]   and in the beauty of his cross,
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.060]   the beauty in the ugliness of the cross
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.720]   and in his crucifixion.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.220]   Thank you for joining us today.
[00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:26.860]   You can ask a question of your own,
[00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.140]   you can search our Growing Archive
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.300]   or subscribe to the podcast,
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:34.300]   you can do all of that at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.700]   Well, speaking of delighting in God,
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.180]   that's the topic next time.
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.980]   How do we experience more joy in God,
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.260]   especially when we feel stuck?
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.500]   It's a part of Christian hedonism
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.340]   that really often goes unnoticed,
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.300]   and we're gonna talk about it next time.
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.140]   I'm your host Tony Rehnke,
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.360]   we'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:06.520]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
