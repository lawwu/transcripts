[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.020]   This session, a moderator to my left,
[00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:14.020]   the esteemed John Luskin, host of Twitter Live,
[00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:19.660]   also runs our Bogleheads Facebook page
[00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.200]   and Bogleheads Twitter.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.860]   He is a fee-only, advice-only certified financial planner
[00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.820]   from sunny San Diego, California.
[00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.580]   He helps a lot of do-it-yourself investors.
[00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.060]   He is a prolific writer with articles published
[00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.560]   in peer-reviewed journals and magazines.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.700]   He's been published in the Journal of Financial Planning
[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.140]   and others.
[00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.140]   He did his master's thesis on university endowment funds
[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.220]   where he showed that university endowment funds
[00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.700]   would do a much better job managing their endowments
[00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.980]   if all they used was a portfolio of passive index funds.
[00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.060]   Which those very smart people don't really wanna hear.
[00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.200]   But anyway.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.640]   So he is recognized as one of the leading financial planners
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.280]   in the industry by Investment News Magazine.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.780]   He's been featured in the New York Times,
[00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.480]   Wall Street Journals, and other publications.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.240]   So I give you your moderator, John Luskin.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.400]   (audience applauding)
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.400]   (audience cheering)
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.080]   - Folks, welcome to Vanguard Deep Dive.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.360]   As you know, I'm your host, John Luskin.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.380]   And I'm joined by Alec Lucas and Ben Johnson, CFA.
[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.320]   Alex is a strategist within manager research
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.560]   for Morningstar Research Services.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.520]   Ben is head of client solutions
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.040]   at Morningstar Asset Management.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.320]   Today, we're talking about Vanguard.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.040]   I'll start by reviewing Vanguard's past, present,
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.000]   and future before opening up to audience questions.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.640]   Let's start with the past.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.720]   Alex, can you start us off by giving the audience
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.640]   a little bit of a refresher on the history of Vanguard,
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.740]   how it came to be, and the motivation behind it?
[00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.600]   - Well, thank you for having me.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.360]   I guess we'll use the mic.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.200]   It's probably a little easier to hear.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.040]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.920]   Very excited to be at a Bogleheads conference.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.100]   I expected to see Bobblehead dolls on the tables, but.
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.840]   - They're very expensive.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.160]   - Yeah, they're very expensive.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.160]   Inflation, inflation, there you go.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.140]   There we go.
[00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.660]   In terms of Vanguard, I think that one of the themes
[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.220]   I've noticed, so I started covering Vanguard in the,
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.560]   I started investing in Vanguard in the late '90s,
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.680]   but joined Morningstar in 2013,
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.800]   and then have been what's called the Vanguard parent lead
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.440]   since the first half of 2018.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.680]   And I think one challenge that Vanguard sometimes faces
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.220]   is that there's a tendency to compare the new Vanguard
[00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.340]   with the old Vanguard, and I actually wrote a piece on this.
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.840]   And I think sometimes there is a tendency to gloss over
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.400]   some of the details about what happened early on
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.200]   in Vanguard's history.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.680]   So as is probably well-known among this group,
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.380]   but perhaps not as well-known as it should be,
[00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.800]   is that there's a very close relationship
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.540]   between Vanguard and Wellington that persists to this day.
[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.480]   But what became the Vanguard effect of lowering fees
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.480]   and promoting indexing, it arose in the midst
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.760]   of a very fierce battle that Jack Bogle had
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.440]   with four Boston-based rivals.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.840]   And remember that Vanguard is based in Philadelphia,
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.000]   so there's probably some regional differences there.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.740]   And initially when Vanguard,
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.460]   Vanguard was founded in September of 1974,
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.020]   its first day of operating was May 1st, 1975.
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.060]   And after seven months of negotiation
[00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.980]   with his Boston-based rivals,
[00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.220]   Bogle said that he got 1/3 of what he called the fund loaf.
[00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.460]   Now, what did he mean by that?
[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.280]   If you think about what a mutual fund does,
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.260]   it does fund administration, it does investment management,
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.500]   and it does distribution.
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.820]   So Vanguard, at its inception,
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.820]   only had a right to fund administration.
[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.220]   But Bogle being in some respects the perfect example
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.940]   of Adam Smith's invisible hand,
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.020]   his competitive zeal leading to the good
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.880]   for a lot of people,
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.860]   because what he essentially did is back then,
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.420]   you had a commission-based distribution system,
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.780]   so he went no load.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.120]   And then because Wellington
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.300]   retained investment management rights,
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.380]   he launched the first retail index fund
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.260]   because he argued it was unmanaged,
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.340]   because it merely tracked an index.
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.340]   And so initially, this incredible innovation,
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.900]   the democratization of what we call now beta
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.300]   for your average retail investor,
[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.540]   it was his only play to launch a new fund.
[00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.900]   And so there's this wonderful thread,
[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.040]   if you kind of go throughout Vanguard's history,
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.560]   that a lot of these innovations were born
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.780]   in the midst of this career-defining conflict
[00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.920]   that led to Vanguard's founding.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.100]   And there's other things we can go to,
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.320]   but I think that it's important
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.800]   to really understand the history
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.220]   that what became Vanguard
[00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.240]   in this playbook of low fees and indexing
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.780]   really emerged in the midst of that conflict.
[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.540]   - Fantastic.
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.940]   All right, let's bring it to Vanguard today.
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.540]   Now, Vanguard is moving into new spaces
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.080]   where it wasn't involved before.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.660]   Advice with Vanguard's personal advisor services,
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.540]   including private equity and direct indexing.
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.060]   Ben, what should Vogleheads make
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.980]   of Vanguard moving into these new areas?
[00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.860]   - Well, I think to pick up where Alec left off,
[00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.860]   like the Vanguard effect is pervasive now, right?
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.940]   We see it everywhere.
[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.580]   You know, we see it emblematic,
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.220]   like in the fact that like market exposure,
[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.420]   beta is free just about anywhere you can go.
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.580]   The entry point in many cases is as low as a single dollar.
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.700]   If you show up at Vanguard, if you show up at Schwab,
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.600]   if you show up at Fidelity with a dollar,
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.020]   you can get a zero fee total stock market index fund today.
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.700]   So I think that is absolutely to be allotted,
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.000]   but what that creates is basically
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.300]   like a flat competitive space.
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.780]   So I always use the analogy of like competition
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.580]   between two corner gas stations, right?
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.920]   So what are they selling?
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.520]   They're selling something that's gonna make you go
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.360]   at the end of the day.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.980]   Market beta is gonna make your portfolio go full stop.
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.060]   So you need that beta to lift your assets over time,
[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.020]   ideally at a rate that outstrips inflation.
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.860]   Well, when that becomes a commodity,
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.460]   I paid nothing or effectively nothing
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.000]   for total stock market exposure,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.780]   total bond market exposure.
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.780]   My three front portfolio can be had for literally nothing.
[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.780]   How do I differentiate?
[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.540]   Well, we arrived here because one corner gas station
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.500]   was taking a penny off of the gallon of gas.
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.380]   The other one was, the other one was.
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.420]   It's free now.
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.260]   So what do we do?
[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.580]   Oh, we've got these fancy new detergents in our gas
[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.300]   that will extend your engine life.
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.820]   We call it smart beta.
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.660]   Cool.
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:29.860]   Is that really gonna work?
[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.460]   Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.
[00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.300]   But for the time being,
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.900]   it's a way for us to differentiate our gasoline
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.820]   from the person kiddie corner from us.
[00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.300]   Well, that's not really working.
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.300]   So what do we do now?
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.940]   Well, if you fill up here,
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.860]   I'll give you a car wash for 399.
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.740]   Okay, that's a differentiator.
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:48.580]   Well, if you fill up here,
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.420]   I'll give you a car wash and a pizza.
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.240]   So what you see, not just at Vanguard,
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.060]   but really across like the like tier one
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.860]   asset management industry is an expansion
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.460]   of the breadth of their offering,
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.300]   because they have to,
[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.180]   because their core offering at the end of the day
[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.820]   has become what's effectively a public utility.
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.620]   It's just market exposure, like awesome.
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.260]   Like I can't underscore how awesome that is,
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.100]   that that is free,
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.340]   that that is investable to anyone
[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:21.940]   at like a minimum investment of a few bucks.
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.980]   Fantastic, let's celebrate that.
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.260]   But now we've got to move on and say,
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.460]   okay, well, how are we gonna differentiate?
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.980]   We're gonna differentiate along the axis
[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:34.100]   of how do we package different investment strategies?
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.220]   And what are the different types
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.620]   of investment strategies that we offer?
[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.040]   So in the packaging, what we've seen is,
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.420]   ETFs have become the choice of a new generation.
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:47.940]   The investment vehicle that literally the founder refused
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.900]   has really become the cornerstone now of this organization.
[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:55.900]   You see differentiation along the lines of strategies.
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:00.300]   So you've got at the core, low cost beta humming along,
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:04.280]   you've seen an effort that's had not so much success
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:08.180]   in factors, you see concentrated discretionary
[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.700]   active portfolios coming to play.
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.000]   And that is all to compete,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.980]   that is all to ultimately serve different needs
[00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.900]   across a massive client base, right?
[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.860]   There are some 30 million different investors
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.740]   that Vanguard's serving around the world today
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.320]   that don't necessarily just want a tank of gas,
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.820]   but might want to carwash a pizza,
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.620]   a different detergent in their gas
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.980]   that's gonna extend their engine life.
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.700]   And that's, I think, just part of a natural evolution.
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.180]   And to the extent that they've done it
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.220]   in a way that resonates with their past,
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.700]   focus on the investor,
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.460]   focus on bringing down costs in these space.
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.380]   And you see that in the advice offering.
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.700]   I think that resonates, right?
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.820]   That's true to their legacy.
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.420]   But that's not to say that there might not be missteps
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.160]   at some point along the way.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.520]   And for those who aren't investment nerds,
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.260]   beta just means we're investing in the Vanguard total
[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.560]   or other low cost total stock market index fund.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.460]   - Yeah, I would add to the differentiator point
[00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.580]   that I think Ben is exactly right on.
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.820]   There is also, I think, an altruistic element to it.
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.620]   Vanguard does see itself
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.540]   as trying to democratize asset classes.
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.820]   And so I think that the private equity efforts
[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.740]   can be seen in that light as well,
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.500]   even as it is to also serve institutional clients.
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.700]   And I think it's something that's perhaps unrecognized,
[00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.340]   but if you think about indexing
[00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:38.120]   when Vanguard launched the first index fund,
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.120]   at the time it was an institutional strategy.
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.660]   It actually wasn't working too well.
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:46.380]   So it's quite fascinating that Bogle launched
[00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:49.860]   what became the Vanguard 500 as early as he did.
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.860]   The first effort at indexing,
[00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.900]   if you've read Robin Wigglesworth's book,
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.560]   and it's also covered in Peter Bernstein's "Capital Ideas,"
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.340]   the first effort at indexing
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.260]   occurred with the Samsonite Pension Fund,
[00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.440]   I believe it was 1971.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.060]   And they tried to equal weight the New York Stock Exchange.
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.700]   It was a disaster.
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:13.740]   1973, there was a sampling approach to the S&P 500.
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:18.380]   Those were institutional portfolios.
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:22.740]   Bogle in '76 launches the first retail index fund.
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:26.300]   Think about computing power back at that point.
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.820]   It's much less robust.
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.300]   So if you have an institutional accounts,
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:34.420]   the money flows are much more predictable
[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:35.460]   and they're bigger.
[00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:39.740]   And so that's why sort of understanding
[00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.940]   the origin of Vanguard and what it did,
[00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.740]   it's this tremendous revolution
[00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.900]   that at the time had no guarantee of success
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.380]   and was slow going in the early days.
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.640]   And so I think there's a lot of insight to be gleaned
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.320]   from understanding Vanguard's present in light of its past.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:59.940]   - Ben, I know you have a lot of expertise
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.300]   in index fund investing and ETFs.
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:03.900]   Tell us your thoughts on Vanguard
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.340]   moving into direct indexing.
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:09.060]   - Yeah, direct indexing I think fits within
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:14.060]   this idea of expanding choice for the end client
[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.940]   along the dimension of sort of delivery.
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:20.660]   So direct indexing, I don't know if anybody remembers
[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.900]   the old Mike Myers skit where he played Linda Richmond
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.860]   in Coffee Talk on Saturday Night Live.
[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.420]   Direct indexing is neither direct nor indexing,
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:31.540]   so let's discuss that.
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:36.540]   So what direct indexing is really is a way to optimize
[00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:41.660]   first and foremost for tax considerations.
[00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.340]   So people who are in high tax brackets
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.660]   who have a lot of money, oftentimes who are bringing
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.540]   like a concentrated stock position to bear,
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:52.180]   look at direct indexing as a way to build a portfolio
[00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:55.340]   around that concentrated stock position
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:59.260]   that brings in diversification that keeps the tax man at bay
[00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.660]   as long as humanly possible.
[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:05.220]   Pretty cut and dry to make sense in those use cases,
[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.900]   but that's not everyone, that's not me.
[00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.180]   I don't have that problem, and I would argue
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.780]   most investors don't have that problem.
[00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:14.140]   But for those investors that are looking to achieve
[00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:17.820]   something very specific, it is a very good tool
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.460]   to do exactly that.
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.340]   And it's also something where Vanguard's got an offering,
[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.260]   BlackRock's got an offering, JP Morgan's got an offering.
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:30.260]   So it's emblematic of the level of competition right now
[00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:34.460]   among the large asset managers for your money.
[00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:37.700]   They want your money because that's how they make money,
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:41.140]   and if they don't have the shiny new toy
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.820]   that their friend across the street has,
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.140]   they're at risk of either losing your money
[00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:49.020]   or getting tough questions from you like,
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:53.660]   hey, BlackRock has appareo, what do you have to offer me?
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:56.420]   So it's, I think, important to understand a lot of this
[00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:00.220]   in the context of competition
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:02.480]   among these large asset management firms,
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:07.480]   and Vanguard is one of the three now 900-pound gorillas
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:12.420]   in this space operating not just here in the U.S.,
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:16.320]   but globally against chiefly BlackRock and State Street.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:21.060]   - Earlier beforehand, we were rehearsing for our talk today,
[00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:25.620]   and I mentioned Vanguard has higher fee active funds
[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.580]   in their personal advisor service offering,
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:32.300]   and then, Alec, you mentioned relatively, yes,
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.140]   but compared to some of the other funds that are out there,
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.580]   compared to other funds, it's still relatively low cost.
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:38.940]   Can you tell us more about your thoughts
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.300]   on Vanguard making this move?
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:45.060]   - Yeah, so as a number of you probably know,
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.300]   Vanguard launched some advice select funds
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:51.820]   in 2019, late 2019, and so they're only
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:54.940]   for personal advisor services clients,
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:58.580]   and this was a subject of considerable discussion
[00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.620]   at Morningstar, especially between John Rankinthaler
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:05.620]   and myself, it reminded, it certainly reminds some people
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.780]   of kind of the old wire house approach
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.660]   where you sort of have this proprietary product
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.220]   and you're trying to get it to investors,
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.760]   but if you think about the simple fact
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.620]   of sort of democratizing investing
[00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:22.500]   and the playbook that Vanguard has followed very well
[00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:27.420]   is in indexing, if you had a very simple model of indexing,
[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:32.340]   you invest in the index fund, you get the market average,
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.740]   and then you beat most people
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:36.380]   because you have lower fees, right?
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.420]   Well, there's always going to be a right side
[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.720]   to the distribution where you have
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:45.580]   some superior active management that is going to occur,
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.380]   but it's hard, and so what Vanguard did
[00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:51.180]   is it launched these high conviction active strategies
[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.420]   and it's priced them pretty competitively
[00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.380]   for actively managed funds, but even if you include
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:00.060]   the 30 basis point charge for personal advisor services,
[00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:03.100]   it still falls below the active median,
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.240]   and there are clones of those strategies.
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.900]   Don Kilbride has run one.
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.380]   He manages Vanguard Dividend Growth,
[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.980]   which is a fund that's done very well.
[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:15.100]   The more concentrated version of the fund,
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.940]   he's run as a separate account since 2008,
[00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.900]   and it has actually beaten, even if you add in the fees,
[00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:25.820]   it's outperformed the slightly more diversified
[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.740]   Vanguard Dividend Growth fund,
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:30.340]   but I think it's important that they're offering things
[00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:34.580]   at a price point that is competitive and it is selective,
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:37.340]   but not everyone can outperform.
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:42.060]   Is it Lake Wobegon where everybody's above average?
[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:45.020]   Yeah, that's not gonna happen, right?
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.260]   But everyone can be average through indexing.
[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:51.860]   - Let's bring it to a topic that's come up
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:55.820]   quite a few times already just today, ESG investing.
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:59.980]   So earlier on the panel, I got quotes from the panel
[00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:02.300]   on that subject, and these are shortened
[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.440]   'cause I put on Twitter, and as you guys may know,
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.820]   there's some pretty limited character counts there.
[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:09.900]   So here's from Dr. Jim Dolly on ESG investing.
[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.140]   There are better ways to make a difference.
[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:15.300]   Jason Zweig, you should be skeptical.
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:18.300]   Dr. Bill Bernstein, and again, this is cut
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:21.960]   from a much longer quote, ESG is a scam.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.420]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:26.820]   And then lastly, if you want to make a difference,
[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:29.580]   you want to own the stock, and that's from Rick Ferry.
[00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:33.420]   So naturally, Vanguard's moved into ESG investing as well.
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.660]   Ben, I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on that.
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:40.060]   - Yeah, so I planted a tree in my backyard a few weeks ago,
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.060]   and that tree, over the past two weeks,
[00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:45.900]   has already sequestered more carbon
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.480]   than every ESG fund under the sun ever will.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.860]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:54.860]   So it's, you have to understand like,
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.340]   what is the transmission mechanism
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:59.620]   between your investment capital
[00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:03.100]   and the cause that you believe in?
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.620]   And in the case of public markets,
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:08.060]   like as a public equity investor,
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.680]   unless you're like participating in new share issuance,
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.060]   like there's no direct connectivity.
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.580]   You're passing shares back and forth to one another,
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:19.860]   and if anything, by virtue of not owning the shares,
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.260]   and I think this probably came up too earlier.
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.620]   I saw your tweet.
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.180]   You forfeit the only connectivity you have,
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:31.200]   which is either directly or indirectly to like vote proxy
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.540]   to try to effect change at the level of that corporation.
[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:39.540]   So the link there is tenuous at best.
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.580]   That said, it's a real choice.
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.580]   It's a real preference, and I don't think
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.400]   you can discount that.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.540]   I think you've seen, again, Vanguard
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.520]   and all of its competitors position themselves
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:55.240]   to expand, again, along this axis of choice
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.260]   that is the investment strategy.
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:01.020]   Does it incorporate ESG criteria or does it not?
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.900]   More choice for people who want that choice, that's great,
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:07.380]   but to do that at scale is exceedingly difficult
[00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:11.240]   because ESG considerations are inherently personal.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.980]   We heard Burt Malkiel talk about the disagreement
[00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.800]   even among ESG ratings providers,
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.900]   and it's going to differ if we go around the room here.
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:25.060]   My ESG omits the stock of the guy who,
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:27.940]   the company who has a CEO that stuffed me
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.260]   in a garbage can in high school.
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.540]   That's my ESG criteria.
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.340]   That's gonna be different if I ask somebody else
[00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:35.460]   in the audience.
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:36.500]   - That would be G for governance.
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.460]   - It's difficult to do for scale.
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.960]   It is, in theory, a potential use case
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.800]   for something like direct indexing,
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.000]   which we were talking about before,
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.880]   that allows people to go up and down,
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.160]   starting from an index portfolio,
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.080]   and apply those sliders that say,
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.300]   I want to not own companies
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:58.280]   that don't take into consideration animal welfare,
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.960]   like whatever the case might be.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:06.000]   But it's, at the end of the day, exceedingly difficult,
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.360]   and what we've seen is more and more asset managers
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.140]   have tried to compete on this vector
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:14.700]   and get into this old school,
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:19.180]   like Mr. Olympia, ESG, green muscles flex-off,
[00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.060]   kind of hulking out on ESG,
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.800]   is that there's been blowback,
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.420]   and there's been blowback for all the reasons
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:26.420]   that I've just described,
[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.900]   because there's fundamental disagreement
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.580]   on what is ESG good, what is ESG bad,
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:34.180]   and we could both take very different sides
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:35.780]   of the exact same coin.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.600]   So I think it's going to continue to be out there.
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:45.600]   I think investors continue to need true direction
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:50.120]   in terms of who is actually walking the talk,
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:54.440]   but it's, again, a dimension of preference.
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.800]   It's a strategy type.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.720]   People are gonna be into ESG
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.920]   the same way that there's diehard quants out there
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:05.040]   that are still hodling small cap value stocks
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.680]   through multi-decade drought.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:12.000]   There's a saying in Spanish.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.220]   This is my first ever panel response
[00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:17.720]   where I will try my hand at speaking in Spanish,
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:21.860]   but Senor Marth, my sophomore high school Spanish teacher,
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:25.880]   was always fond of saying (speaking in foreign language)
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.680]   So everyone has their own different colors,
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.800]   their different flavors.
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.420]   ESG is one of those flavors.
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:34.380]   - Wonderful.
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:39.700]   All right, let's bring it to growing pains.
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.860]   Alec, looking at Vanguard, they're not in Melbourne anymore.
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.300]   What does Vanguard's geographic expansion mean
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.940]   for their investor elements?
[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:53.020]   - Well, I think Vanguard opened up its first global office
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:57.780]   and it was in Melbourne in 1996,
[00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.020]   so they have a history of being overseas,
[00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:02.160]   but growth has been slow.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.900]   I just talked to a Melbourne-based reporter.
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.660]   They're trying to revivify an attempt
[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:13.660]   at launching a platform for Australia's superannuation,
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:16.620]   retirement funds, basically.
[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.580]   Apparently, they had done that in years past
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:19.420]   and it had not worked,
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.460]   so it's been pretty slow going, I think.
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:26.460]   They've been in Canada, for example, since December 2011,
[00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:30.780]   and only in May of 2018 launched their first active funds.
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:35.260]   So what is Vanguard's playbook overseas?
[00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:37.340]   What you find when you talk to Vanguard,
[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:38.720]   and I'm not an entire expert
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.260]   on Vanguard's entire non-US operations,
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:45.620]   but my understanding is that in a lot of these countries,
[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.320]   it's an oligopoly in terms of distribution
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.200]   and it's been hard to break in.
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.740]   So 95% of Vanguard's overseas assets
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.460]   are in passive strategies
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.900]   and they've been trying to basically grow their business
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.620]   through exchange-traded funds
[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:02.460]   and more recently through advice.
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:03.460]   And in its early days,
[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.580]   I think they did use US investor assets
[00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:08.900]   to subsidize their expansion efforts overseas.
[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:11.800]   They would argue that that's also helped their investing
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:16.540]   to have more of a global firm, but it's been slow going.
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:20.840]   The last number I heard, this was in 2020,
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:21.680]   so it's quite dated,
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.480]   but I think they had 550 billion overseas.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:28.620]   By contrast, until the market downturn,
[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:31.660]   I think they had about 8 trillion in assets globally.
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.660]   So at that point,
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.000]   probably under a trillion of that is overseas.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.260]   But taking a measured approach
[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.620]   and I think trying to grow overseas,
[00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.700]   and I think Vanguard does hearken back
[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.680]   to how long it took, for example, indexing to take off.
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.780]   If you look at Vanguard's assets
[00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:52.120]   and you look at the division of active and passive,
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.740]   it is not until in the aftermath
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.380]   of the global financial crisis
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:00.780]   that AUM indexed assets take off
[00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:03.260]   relative to active and Vanguard.
[00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:04.300]   So if you think about Vanguard,
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.900]   what built Vanguard is actually the Wellington Fund,
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:11.080]   is what subsidized a lot of its early efforts at indexing.
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:16.340]   - Yeah, indexing is like the overnight success
[00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:18.660]   that's been decades in the making, right?
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:22.540]   And internationally what you see,
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:24.140]   I think which is most interesting
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:27.080]   is we talked about like the Vanguard effect before.
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.980]   The Vanguard effect almost on fast forward
[00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:31.960]   in certain markets and notably,
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:37.980]   when they first listed their FTSE 100 ETF in the UK,
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.740]   this was years ago.
[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:41.460]   BlackRock was already present there,
[00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:44.140]   had a multibillion dollar competitive offering,
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:47.560]   tracking the exact same underlying index and said,
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.060]   you know, we're holding the line on fees
[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:52.620]   even though the Vanguard ETF was charging a tiny fraction
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.260]   of what the iShares ETF was charging.
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:56.620]   We have superior liquidity,
[00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:00.660]   our clients worry about ETF liquidity, not fees.
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:04.760]   They held out for I think it was all of like 18 to 24 months
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.020]   before finally they cried uncle
[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:09.120]   and had to cut their fee to,
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.140]   I don't remember if they matched or undercut
[00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.900]   the Vanguard ETF because they were losing share
[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:17.160]   because people saw Vanguard coming
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.980]   and knew exactly what the Vanguard playbook was
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:23.820]   and quickly their competition had to respond.
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.820]   You've seen that happen in Canada too
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:28.460]   where they've launched single ticket
[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.340]   like ETF allocation portfolios.
[00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:34.400]   And it's a market that's very difficult
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.180]   for outsiders to penetrate
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.860]   because so much of asset management product
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.240]   is distributed through bank branches in Canada.
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.700]   So I show up to a BMO branch in Canada.
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:47.300]   When I'm 16, I opened my checking account.
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.220]   You know, I do all my business with them
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:51.340]   until the day I die, my heirs come
[00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:54.740]   and walk away with my assets after I've expired.
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.560]   Well, Vanguard has forced competitors in there
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:00.180]   to launch nearly identical product
[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:02.480]   at nearly identical or lower fees
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.080]   just by virtue of their presence in some cases.
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:09.860]   So, you know, the Vanguard effect is the real deal
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.540]   and it's replicating itself in all these new markets
[00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:15.940]   where they show up and build a presence.
[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:19.020]   And even at 550 billion or so overseas,
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:23.420]   like that's like a top 25 asset manager in the U.S.
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.220]   So it's a significant footprint.
[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.660]   You know, as much as we talk about like Vanguard
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.620]   as being this indexing behemoth,
[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:33.340]   they're also one of the largest active managers in the world.
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:38.340]   And even what is a relatively small in Vanguard terms,
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.940]   you know, foot side the U.S.
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:45.160]   is, you know, would be a pretty big U.S. based asset manager.
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:49.440]   - So beforehand, we asked for questions
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.840]   on the various BogleHeads communities,
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.320]   including the BogleHeads forums.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.060]   And one topic came up multiple times
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:56.440]   and I'm sure a lot of folks
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.960]   are gonna be able to guess what this is.
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.760]   And that is going to be growing pains and customer service.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:05.220]   So here is one question from Meg File
[00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.160]   from the BogleHeads forums who writes,
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.440]   it'll be interesting to hear from the Morningstar analysts,
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.860]   whether they think Vanguard's current cost structure
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:15.200]   and ultra low expense ratios would even allow
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.820]   for Vanguard to return to a higher level of service.
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:22.120]   - Okay, I'm prepared for this question.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:22.960]   I have a prop.
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:29.320]   I feel like as a rite of passage,
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:30.520]   if you're gonna be in BogleHeads,
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:33.640]   you need to read "Character Counts" by John Bogle
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.960]   or his thesis.
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:36.920]   I've read both.
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.880]   I've read both.
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.260]   I think I would not say the thesis is a page turner.
[00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:49.700]   So this is a compilation of his speeches.
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:51.140]   It is not indexed.
[00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:52.540]   I came from academia.
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.300]   I am used to indexes.
[00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:55.800]   I made my own.
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:01.680]   The right-hand column,
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:06.080]   because early on in my Vanguard lead days at Morningstar,
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.180]   guess what topic kept coming up?
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:10.820]   Customer service.
[00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:14.700]   So I have a personal index of every reference
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:18.740]   to customer service problems throughout his speeches.
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:21.740]   Let me give you a small selection.
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:25.740]   Service quality not uniformly high, that's page 69.
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:29.980]   Processing traumas, page 73.
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:32.240]   Service problems, 107.
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:37.900]   Learning from service setbacks, processing overload,
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.560]   shareholder complaint letters,
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:42.580]   and perfection as a goal, and so forth.
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:45.680]   So I think that the way to think about Vanguard
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.200]   is it has a frugal culture
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:52.420]   and high-touch customer service
[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:56.800]   is probably never going to be its strength.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:00.000]   Anecdotally, we have heard that investors
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.120]   who pay the 30 basis point charge
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:06.400]   for personal advisor services are, for the most part,
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.200]   fairly satisfied with the services.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:12.480]   But I, myself, have experienced long hold-wait times
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.040]   and some of my own disasters
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.780]   from a customer service standpoint,
[00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:20.880]   including when we changed over our money market account.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.360]   I rarely wrote checks for my money market account,
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.280]   so I wrote earnest money for our housing down payment.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:30.480]   It was a short sale 'cause I lost a bunch of money
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.680]   on a condo that I bought in 2005,
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.460]   so I was like, we're gonna make it up
[00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:35.880]   by buying a short sale.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.320]   So you can imagine, you want the earnest money check
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:43.720]   to cash, right, on a basic level.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:46.840]   I happened to also, out of the same money market account,
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:49.200]   write a check to the home inspector.
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:53.340]   It bounced, and the home inspector got back to me,
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:57.120]   luckily, in time to wire money
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.880]   and replace what then subsequently bounced
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:00.920]   as the money market account.
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:04.440]   Well, what happened, they changed the brokerage platform
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:08.200]   circa 2016 and didn't let me know,
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.660]   or at least didn't make it clear enough
[00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:14.600]   that you needed to re-register for check-writing privileges
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:18.400]   and all your old checks wouldn't work.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:22.820]   And I got Vanguard to pay me back the money
[00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:26.480]   I got charged for bouncing that check, and they did.
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:30.020]   But I think that a theme throughout Vanguard's history
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:33.220]   is if you sort of think of the field of dreams,
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:36.700]   quote, if we build it, they will come.
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.540]   Well, indexing really did take off,
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:42.460]   especially in the aftermath of the financial crisis,
[00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:44.540]   and Vanguard's growth has been phenomenal,
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:46.060]   and there are challenges.
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:49.620]   I will say anecdotally, we get lots of complaints
[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:52.260]   from customers, and I have duly passed those on
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:54.500]   to Vanguard myself and said, I'd like to talk
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.840]   to Tim Buckley about how they're handling this,
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.600]   because my impression is you have a lot of the people
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.220]   that helped make Vanguard what it is today
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.980]   whose financial needs have gotten more complicated
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:08.060]   and are subjected to very long wait times on the telephone.
[00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:09.100]   And I think it's unfortunate,
[00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:11.940]   and I think they could do a better job with it,
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.420]   to be quite blunt about it.
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:17.940]   So those are my initial thoughts on customer service,
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:20.860]   but a point Ben has often made is if you think
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:22.980]   about having 30 million investors,
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:26.600]   you could satisfy the lion's share of them,
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.540]   but still, just on an absolute basis,
[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:30.220]   have quite a few missteps.
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:32.540]   And anecdotally, there is a Morningstar analyst
[00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:34.700]   who had a family member pass away
[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:37.060]   and had to deal with all these accounts,
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.420]   and said the people that ended up
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:41.260]   being the most helpful were Vanguard.
[00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:44.820]   We don't get written to about that, right?
[00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:47.860]   So I do think you have to keep in mind
[00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:49.740]   how many customers it is they serve,
[00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:51.980]   as well as the challenge of keeping up
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:53.780]   with the growth they've experienced.
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:59.840]   - I would just add that despite that, it's interesting,
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.160]   like if everybody gets real quiet,
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:06.480]   you can actually hear money headed to Malvern right now.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.720]   So through the end of September,
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.520]   I just did the map based on our flows data,
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.640]   something like $300 million a day
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:19.840]   flowing into Vanguard funds.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:23.800]   So at the end of the day, everyone here,
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:26.900]   Vanguard investors are gonna vote with their wallets,
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:29.740]   and they're continuing to vote for Vanguard.
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:33.860]   And as Vanguard clients, or otherwise consuming
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:36.740]   Vanguard product through other platforms, right?
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:38.740]   You can be a Schwab client
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:41.300]   and buy Vanguard asset management products.
[00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:43.740]   I am a Schwab client that buys
[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:45.860]   Vanguard asset management products.
[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:47.500]   The other thing you have to look at too,
[00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.240]   and you mentioned Thrift, Alec,
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.300]   I just looked back at the envelope.
[00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:56.700]   The number of employees per investor served,
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:59.340]   this is just based on the public data out there,
[00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:01.940]   Fidelity has nearly three times
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:06.700]   as many employees per investor as Vanguard does.
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:10.900]   And they have three times as many employees
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:12.940]   per investor as Vanguard does
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:14.660]   because they're monetizing their investors
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.300]   in different ways that Vanguard hasn't historically
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:19.380]   tried to monetize their investors,
[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:21.780]   be it through earning interest spreads
[00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:24.740]   on cash sweep accounts, any number of different ways.
[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:29.740]   So foundationally, I think I can credit David Booth
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:33.340]   with saying this, that the product of the asset management
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.620]   in wealth industries, at the end of the day,
[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.460]   boils down to trust.
[00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:40.480]   And I don't think there's any more trusted brand
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.680]   in this industry, probably, than Vanguard
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:45.500]   that shows up in survey work that's been done.
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:50.300]   But as a result, they're under the microscope.
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:53.620]   And this is, I think, something that's not going away,
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:56.940]   barring probably more significant investment
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:01.040]   in something we've talked about with them for years,
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:04.500]   and obviously something that shows up
[00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:07.060]   in the Bogleheads Forum.
[00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:11.300]   In addition to which composite fiberboard
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:13.200]   you can build your deck out of
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.740]   that is least likely to burn your feet in the summer.
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:19.940]   So credit to the Bogleheads Forum, I love this place,
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:23.180]   that I could look up anything from tax location
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:25.360]   to what should I build my deck out of
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.460]   so it won't hurt my feet.
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:28.300]   That's amazing.
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.860]   It's like the ultimate hitchhiker's guide to the universe.
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.860]   (audience laughing)
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:35.820]   - Before bringing it to the audience,
[00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:37.820]   let's talk about the future.
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:40.260]   Eric Bolchunis, keynote speaker for this year's conference,
[00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:42.580]   takes a stab at dispelling many of the myths
[00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:46.500]   of index fund investing and how it could distort markets
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.440]   in his book, "The Bogle Effect."
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:50.540]   Yet with massive fund flows,
[00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:53.040]   Vanguard receives daily 300 million.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:56.420]   How big is too big for Vanguard?
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:03.740]   - When I came here and registered,
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:05.980]   I saw that they were offering,
[00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.120]   I don't know if it was, I have it and have read it,
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:13.120]   the last book that Bogle wrote, 2019, "Stay the Course."
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:16.100]   Towards the end of that book,
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:19.560]   he does mention this question of size.
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:22.400]   And if you think about especially Vanguard
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:26.240]   in relation to BlackRock and then State Street
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.920]   and the growth of passive assets,
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.840]   there's real questions about size
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:31.800]   that they take very seriously.
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.840]   I actually was visiting with BlackRock
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.200]   in New York the other week.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:39.000]   And to bring it back to the topic of ESG,
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.880]   they were talking about how they're trying to,
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.000]   and Vanguard's doing the same thing,
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.640]   they're trying to take a very serious approach
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.300]   to voting proxies.
[00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:50.060]   And so sometimes you will get very silly proposals
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:55.120]   from, say, an overly zealous environmental group
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:58.120]   that will, say, try and put a proposal
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:02.440]   for a natural, for an oil company or a gas company.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:05.340]   I'll stop drilling.
[00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:08.360]   This is an exaggeration, but it's not far off.
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:12.180]   We'll stop drilling entirely and plant trees.
[00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:15.160]   And they will not support the proposal.
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:17.080]   And then they will, the next year,
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:20.440]   reward the proposal to say something like,
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:22.040]   we would like you to stop drilling
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.900]   and consider planting trees.
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:26.520]   And so they were just complaining about all these proposals
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:27.360]   that aren't that helpful.
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:30.560]   And I said, well, have you ever talked to Vanguard
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:34.560]   to try and band together and get it
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.480]   so that there aren't so many silly proposals
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:39.180]   that you're essentially having to vet and vote against?
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:44.180]   And the answer, essentially, was there would be real concern
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:47.120]   about the perception of collaborating
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:51.880]   given the amount of stock owned in public companies
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:54.140]   between just those two firms.
[00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:56.640]   So I don't, the basic answer to the question
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.240]   is I don't know how big is too big,
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.280]   but it is a real issue going forward
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:04.440]   and one that I think Bovo was rightly concerned about.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.420]   - And that issue has a few different facets.
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:15.980]   So one of those is the growth of indexing
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:18.500]   and what does that mean for market efficiency,
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.660]   like price discovery, you name it.
[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:25.660]   If there's just 380 billion plus,
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:27.220]   you know, 380 million, sorry,
[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:31.300]   going towards Malvern, going into index funds incessantly,
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:35.380]   like what does that mean for finding two sides
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:38.880]   to agree on what the price of Apple stock is?
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:43.200]   At the end of the day, these concerns are as old as time.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:46.440]   I don't know if anybody ever read, what is it?
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.220]   I'm gonna get his name wrong.
[00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:51.140]   John Brooks' Business Adventures is the book anyway.
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:55.180]   So if you go back to the go-go years of the '60s,
[00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:56.900]   people were worried about the quote-unquote
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:58.820]   mutual fund situation.
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:01.620]   So retail mutual funds were just becoming
[00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:04.300]   truly a thing being made widely available.
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:07.500]   Incumbents were worried that once the you-know-what
[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:10.460]   hit the fan, that all these new mutual fund investors
[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:13.080]   would go flocking towards the exits at the same time
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.220]   and markets would be upended,
[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:17.540]   cats and dogs would live together, whatever.
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:18.960]   Like that didn't pan out.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.640]   So like these are just like,
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.540]   it just feels like the same fears keep getting recycled
[00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:25.880]   in like new clothing.
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:28.940]   I would apply that to the growth of indexing.
[00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:31.060]   You know, where it becomes potentially more concerning
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:33.220]   I think is around common ownership.
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:37.260]   So Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street owed an ever larger
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:39.500]   amount of an ever larger number of companies,
[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:41.620]   not just in the US, but globally.
[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:43.980]   Like what are the implications for corporate governance?
[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:46.020]   And it's something that Bogle wrote about
[00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:49.440]   in his last op-ed in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.380]   You're already seeing the industry
[00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:53.740]   like try to move to cut that off at the pass.
[00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:56.020]   BlackRock announced earlier this year
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:59.320]   that it is handing over the ability to vote proxies
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.700]   like based on certain policies
[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:03.960]   to some of its institutional investors.
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.860]   Just this morning, Charles Schwab announced
[00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:09.060]   that it's going to pilot for three of its index portfolios,
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:12.580]   two ETFs and an index mutual fund,
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:15.740]   a survey of investors in those funds
[00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.360]   based on like their preferences
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.780]   as to how they might vote the proxies
[00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:23.500]   for the firms that are owned in those portfolios.
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.820]   At the end of the day, it's the investor's asset, right?
[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:27.060]   That vote.
[00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:29.500]   So it's incumbent upon the asset manager
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:32.820]   as a fiduciary obligation to vote those proxies
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:34.340]   in a way that's sensible.
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:37.900]   I think that proxy voting is going to come ever closer
[00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:40.060]   to the end investor now.
[00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:42.400]   Are most investors gonna know what to do with it
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.700]   or care to do anything with it?
[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:47.260]   Probably not.
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:50.680]   I mean, raise your hand if you're like a regular proxy voter
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:55.340]   I know we've got super, super duper sample bias here too
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:57.760]   because these are like some of the keenest investors
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:58.600]   in the planet.
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.040]   (indistinct)
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.520]   Yeah, but absolutely.
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:02.960]   And Jim's point up front is
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:05.000]   if there were an easier way to engage,
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.320]   there'd probably be more uptake.
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.440]   I don't disagree with that.
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:11.720]   And engage in a way that says like broad spectrum,
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:15.440]   these are the things I believe in or believe against,
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.400]   you know, apply that across a thousand stocks
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:21.120]   and the Schwab 1000 ETF go.
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:22.920]   But I think that's where it becomes
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.440]   potentially more concerning.
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:25.980]   And you start to bump up against
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:28.300]   even just ownership constraints
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:29.960]   that are real and regulatory.
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:32.980]   You know, and anytime you put that question across
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:34.640]   to the asset managers,
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.740]   mom's the word because you know,
[00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:39.060]   this represents at some level of growth,
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:41.980]   like real enterprise risk and the potential of
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:46.060]   like even bringing up like antitrust conversations.
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:48.260]   - Just to add one other thing.
[00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:51.860]   I think it was in 2018 that Vanguard changed it
[00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:55.900]   so that the sub advisors, the external sub advisors
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:00.900]   hires to manage this equity assets can vote proxies.
[00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:03.580]   So previously Vanguard voted those proxies.
[00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:08.020]   They did that more to help the managers in that case,
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:10.740]   you know, influence the companies they were investing in,
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:14.940]   but it also has the effect of decentralizing the voting.
[00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:16.660]   And I think Ben's right on it.
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:20.420]   It is the proxy voting and the ability to vote proxies
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:23.220]   that I think is the biggest concern about size.
[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:28.780]   - Folks, if you want to ask your question to the panelists,
[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:31.060]   go ahead and step up front or raise a hand.
[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:31.900]   And okay, great.
[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:32.780]   I'm gonna hand you the mic.
[00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:34.100]   Wonderful.
[00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:34.940]   - Hi there.
[00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:38.020]   A question on your Vanguard inflows,
[00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:40.020]   data you're in support of the customer service.
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.740]   Does your data, I just don't understand
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:44.420]   a little bit of clarification.
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:46.500]   When you do your fund inflow data,
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:50.380]   are you measuring fund flows into the funds themselves,
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:52.980]   regardless of where the trade was executed?
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:57.420]   'Cause I think that's what the issue is,
[00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:00.780]   is Vanguard the company as my trading platform
[00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:03.060]   and customer service versus Fidelity or Schwab
[00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:04.300]   is my trading platform.
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:08.140]   So 'cause I own Vanguard funds at Fidelity.
[00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:11.460]   So that's what I'm trying to clarify
[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:14.940]   'cause the customer support is a company
[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:17.180]   versus the Vanguard branded fund,
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:18.620]   which can be traded anywhere.
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:22.140]   - Yeah, so that is a measure like irrespective
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:24.140]   of the origin of that money.
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:27.340]   So irrespective of whether it came from a Fidelity client
[00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:30.620]   or a Schwab client or an advisor, an individual,
[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:34.820]   that's just, we know that that money has wound up in Malvern.
[00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:36.540]   We don't know how it got there.
[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:38.340]   We just know it's being managed there today.
[00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:40.740]   So that's a good question.
[00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:42.820]   You know, I think part of it too is like,
[00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:46.220]   I'm very fond of like the Bogle-ism,
[00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:48.900]   like you get what you don't pay for.
[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:52.060]   Yes, in investing, but I think even Jack,
[00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:55.460]   maybe this was when he had heart surgery
[00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:57.740]   and like, you know, relented and said,
[00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:59.700]   well, sometimes you do get what you pay for.
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:01.740]   And when it comes to like, you know,
[00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:04.300]   someone operating on you, like that's the case.
[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:08.380]   I would say when it comes to service offerings in general,
[00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:09.820]   like that's also the case.
[00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:12.420]   So, you know, you can't show up to McDonald's
[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:16.420]   and expect like white tablecloths and a major D.
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.740]   So, you know, I think you've got to take the good
[00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:20.700]   with the bad at the end of the day.
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:25.340]   - So probably similar to this,
[00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:28.780]   could you explain Vanguard now moving accounts
[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:33.020]   from mutual fund accounts to brokerage accounts?
[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:35.900]   And why is that such a complicated thing
[00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:37.900]   and why do they have to do it?
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:42.700]   - I'm not sure I can answer that in every respect,
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:45.820]   but I know they started that initiative in 2016.
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:47.060]   And as I explained earlier,
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:49.300]   I experienced my own hiccup with that.
[00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:53.020]   I think that it was much more about expanding
[00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:56.420]   the brokerage platform and just the technology of it
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:57.820]   is my basic understanding.
[00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:01.340]   And I know that I believe it was this year,
[00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:05.500]   they sent a notice to legacy investors
[00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:08.540]   on their old platform that it was time to move.
[00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:12.380]   So I think it's just about updating technology.
[00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:13.860]   And if you think about it,
[00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:17.340]   if you just think about where the asset management industry
[00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:19.940]   is today, I have a two and a half year old,
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:24.340]   her grandparents and great grandparents
[00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:27.660]   give her more money than she needs
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:29.060]   as a two and a half year old.
[00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:32.980]   So I take that money and she now has
[00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:35.820]   a globally diversified portfolio.
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:40.220]   And also because I will say that
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:41.660]   my children love McDonald's,
[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:43.180]   I do not love McDonald's myself,
[00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:45.580]   but they each own one share of McDonald's.
[00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:48.860]   And so the point being that,
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:50.980]   if you think about where investors are,
[00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:52.500]   you can open a brokerage account
[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:55.460]   and get a diversified global portfolio in 20 minutes.
[00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:57.580]   Well, that takes a certain amount of technology.
[00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:01.620]   And so I think it was about transferring their investors
[00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:04.140]   to more technology enabled platform.
[00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:07.620]   And that did take years for them to do that.
[00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:10.580]   - I would just add in a related vein,
[00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:12.620]   you've seen a similar shift.
[00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:13.900]   Sometimes there's a carrot,
[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:15.060]   sometimes there's a stick away
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:17.460]   from legacy mutual fund share classes
[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:18.860]   into the ETF share class,
[00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:21.700]   where the ETF share classes has been appended
[00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:22.980]   to the mutual fund.
[00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:25.980]   And part of that is just trying to address the issue
[00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:29.220]   of like individual shareholder record keeping,
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:31.940]   which exists and can be costly in the case of,
[00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:33.540]   say the Admiral share,
[00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:36.900]   but exists, does not exist in the case of the ETF
[00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:39.220]   where shareholder record keeping takes place
[00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:40.740]   at like an omnibus account level.
[00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:42.820]   So you've seen that even just in the way
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:47.180]   that the ETF share class in many instances was repriced
[00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:50.060]   to be a basis point lower than the Admiral share.
[00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:52.100]   And yeah, that repricing is reflective
[00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:55.580]   of the cost savings on Vanguard's end.
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:57.380]   You have servicing a client that's an investor
[00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:59.860]   in the Admiral share versus the ETF share.
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:02.780]   So I think it's similar.
[00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:08.260]   - I'd like to hear your thoughts on the debacle
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:10.020]   with the target retirement funds,
[00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:11.980]   capital gains distribution.
[00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:14.420]   Does anybody at Vanguard care?
[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:16.780]   What do they think about these lawsuits
[00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:19.260]   that are now being launched because of this issue?
[00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:22.780]   Is this sort of thing gonna happen again?
[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:24.940]   What are your thoughts on that debacle?
[00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:29.780]   - Yeah, so that was a subject of considerable discussion.
[00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:32.380]   For those of you that don't know,
[00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:35.100]   Vanguard opened up a cheaper version
[00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:38.180]   of a target date fund and investors,
[00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:42.580]   instead of lowering the cost of the current fund
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:46.700]   and institutional money sort of flocked to the new fund
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:49.460]   and caused a huge capital gains distribution.
[00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:54.460]   Now, if you're investing in say 401k or Roth IRA,
[00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:57.980]   if your money's through that route,
[00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:01.100]   the capital gains distribution does not matter for you.
[00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:03.740]   But if you took, and in some cases
[00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:05.740]   there was some criticism Morningstar as well
[00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:08.100]   for not making it clear that, you know,
[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:10.380]   investing in a target date fund in the glide path
[00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:14.740]   can be an inefficient thing to do if it's taxable money.
[00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:19.740]   So I think that that was a reminder to Vanguard
[00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:22.060]   that, you know, sometimes I think
[00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:24.100]   this is the disadvantage of their size.
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:27.180]   You know, the vast, vast, vast majority
[00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:30.540]   of their target date assets are in retirement accounts.
[00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:31.980]   So it didn't matter.
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:36.500]   However, you know, when you're talking
[00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:39.780]   the huge asset bases that are in some of those funds,
[00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:42.820]   even if it's a few basis points,
[00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:44.060]   it's still a lot of money
[00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:46.100]   and it's a big deal to a lot of people.
[00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:47.540]   I actually had an hour long call
[00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:50.980]   with somebody based in Pittsburgh to talk about that
[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:53.300]   because he was so frustrated,
[00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:55.380]   both at Vanguard and at Morningstar
[00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:58.500]   because he felt like we could have done a better job
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:01.320]   of warning investors about that potential.
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:04.180]   And I think he was right.
[00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:06.300]   You know, it's something to be aware of
[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:08.420]   and it's something that we need to be as thoughtful
[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:11.860]   as we can be about the, you know, the positives
[00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:14.780]   as well as the potential negatives for investing money,
[00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:16.260]   especially when you segment it
[00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:19.680]   into tax advantaged and taxable accounts.
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:21.780]   So I do think that Vanguard got the point,
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:27.460]   but it is an illustration of some of the collateral.
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:29.460]   The way that I phrased it when I wrote about it
[00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:32.420]   is this is a collateral effect of the fee war.
[00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:34.100]   You know, Vanguard basically
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:36.340]   is the reason we have fee compression
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:38.360]   in the asset management industry
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:40.060]   and some of their biggest rivals.
[00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:42.200]   And so there's been, you know,
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:44.340]   I think it's especially between Vanguard and Fidelity
[00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:46.580]   in lowering their target date fees.
[00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:48.260]   One will lower and then the other will lower
[00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:50.260]   and then the other will lower.
[00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:53.380]   So I think their competitive zeal got the best of them.
[00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:59.660]   - We've talked about ESG investing
[00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:03.620]   and Ben, you mentioned how with the traditional approach
[00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:06.180]   to ESG investing, you are giving up
[00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:09.160]   one means of influencing those companies.
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:11.180]   And then we've also kind of tangentially talked
[00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:12.680]   about proxy voting.
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:15.220]   What do you think about the other newer approach
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:18.220]   to ESG investing, like engine number one's vote ETF?
[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:21.500]   - Yeah, so there's engine number one
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:24.820]   and now there's even like anti-engine number one.
[00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:27.300]   So there's another firm out there
[00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:30.140]   that is like trying to vote contra
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:33.080]   the way engine number one might vote.
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:36.500]   You know, I think it's interesting,
[00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:38.180]   but again, it's difficult to scale
[00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:39.940]   because it assumes alignment
[00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:41.340]   at the level of the end investor.
[00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:43.340]   Like certainly there's a market for that.
[00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:46.760]   We see that there's hundreds of millions of dollars
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:51.580]   in VOTs, the ticker of the engine number one fund,
[00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:52.940]   but there's also, you know,
[00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:56.380]   tens of millions of dollars in the contra fund.
[00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:58.100]   I think at the end of the day,
[00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:01.220]   like the scalable solve is, as I mentioned before,
[00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:02.980]   to like get more of the vote
[00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:05.300]   as close to the end investor as possible
[00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:08.600]   in a way that isn't overly burdensome,
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:10.420]   you know, and doesn't make things
[00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:12.260]   incrementally more complicated.
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:18.720]   That's ultimately my take as it pertains to proxy voting.
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:20.500]   The other element that we didn't touch on
[00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:22.780]   is like, you know, more impact oriented,
[00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:25.580]   like thematic, you know, portfolios
[00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:27.700]   that look to invest in companies
[00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:30.340]   that are gonna capitalize on like the energy transition
[00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:33.380]   or even, you know, certain fixed income managers,
[00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:36.660]   for example, PIMCO does like direct placement.
[00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:39.340]   So like they will have like a firm
[00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:41.260]   that is doing a green project,
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:42.260]   issue them a bond,
[00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:44.660]   they will own that bond in their portfolios.
[00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:47.820]   Like that linkage, as I described it before,
[00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:50.260]   between capital and cause is immediate.
[00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:52.500]   It's direct there, you know,
[00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:55.940]   whether that green project winds up being not green,
[00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:58.500]   like ex post, like at some point in time,
[00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:00.260]   somebody thought asbestos
[00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:02.420]   was a great green building material, right?
[00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:04.260]   Like, wow, was that wrong?
[00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:07.900]   So, you know, there's still gonna be a bit of uncertainty.
[00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:10.260]   Did that get to your question?
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:11.660]   Hopefully, okay, thank you.
[00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:14.740]   - And I would just add on the impact front,
[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:17.460]   Vanguard co-opted essentially
[00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:20.320]   a Bailey Gifford positive impact fund.
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:24.340]   I think it was last year, I don't think it was this year.
[00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:26.140]   I think maybe it actually changed,
[00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:28.820]   it got rebranded as a Vanguard fund this year.
[00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:31.460]   So they have that as part of their offering.
[00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:33.820]   And I would say one thing to think about Vanguard
[00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:38.820]   with respect to ESG is an important development
[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:40.620]   is a guy named Dan Newhall,
[00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:42.940]   who for many years oversaw Vanguard's
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:44.660]   manager search and oversight committee,
[00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:48.240]   which evaluates all the sub advisors they hire,
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:49.980]   both internal and external.
[00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:53.460]   So if you put your money in actively managed assets,
[00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:57.420]   that group is the one that picks those sub advisors.
[00:51:57.420 --> 00:52:00.460]   And it will also be, it will also, you know,
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:04.100]   Vanguard's own in-house investment capabilities
[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:06.380]   have to compete with those external managers.
[00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:10.100]   And so a big question we've had is what is the role of ESG
[00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:11.660]   when they evaluate those managers?
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:14.220]   Well, a guy named Matt Pirro took over
[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:15.540]   as head of that group.
[00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:17.600]   And he had recently been appointed head
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:20.520]   of their global ESG product lineup.
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:22.800]   So I think that there's going to be a bit more
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:25.420]   of a consistent vetting of managers
[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:28.660]   from the standpoint of ESG on a go forward basis.
[00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:31.080]   But I think Vanguard will always make room
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:33.060]   for a firm like PrimeCap.
[00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:35.980]   PrimeCap is one of their longest sub advisors,
[00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:37.380]   as you may know.
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:40.580]   And they came out with a statement a couple years ago
[00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:42.380]   on their approach to ESG.
[00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:45.500]   And it's, they said it took them forever to come up with it.
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:48.400]   And it's maybe four or five sentences.
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:51.180]   And the key line is they struggle with the idea
[00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:54.580]   that definitive objective rationales exist
[00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:56.700]   by which you can vet these companies.
[00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:59.780]   That said, PrimeCap's next analyst they hired
[00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:02.060]   is somebody with tremendous ESG experience.
[00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:05.740]   So there is something to be said for active managers
[00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:09.980]   paying attention to risks from the lens of ESG.
[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:13.060]   But I think Vanguard will always leave room for managers
[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:16.260]   that are not necessarily leading with ESG,
[00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:19.800]   but see it as one Wellington manager,
[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:22.300]   one Wellington management manager put it,
[00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:23.480]   part of the mosaic.
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:29.980]   - My question is more about Morningstar than about Vanguard.
[00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:32.420]   I'm wondering what's going on with your accounts.
[00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:34.900]   I've always, for a while I was a paying customer
[00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:37.220]   and then I learned that I could use what I really want
[00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:40.180]   and use a lot as the watch list.
[00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:43.380]   And now I've discovered all of a sudden
[00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:47.460]   I've been lured into being a subscriber again
[00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:48.540]   to Morningstar.
[00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:50.840]   It arose out of a frustration that I've had
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:52.460]   with Vanguard's reporting.
[00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:56.540]   If I try to list all my funds on one page,
[00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:58.380]   okay, so it's more than four.
[00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:01.780]   The easiest way I found to do that
[00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:04.820]   was using a watch list that I would keep
[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:07.620]   from month to month and update.
[00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:11.260]   - I think that's a great question for Ben to answer.
[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:13.380]   (audience laughing)
[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:15.980]   - I was actually looking down at Christine.
[00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:19.300]   (audience laughing)
[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:20.460]   - Oh, sorry, we got two minutes.
[00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:23.340]   So is your question as it pertains to that
[00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:26.460]   like watch list function, where it exists?
[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:28.740]   'Cause I know we've had some changes to our--
[00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:33.340]   - And it seems to be changing with relation
[00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:36.540]   to the free accounts versus the paid subscription
[00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:38.500]   of about $200 a year.
[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:40.780]   - We're gonna meet once I get off stage
[00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:43.460]   and we will figure this out for you.
[00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:44.620]   - Great, thank you.
[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:46.260]   - I can't on the fly, I'm sorry.
[00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:52.380]   - I have a simple question, won't take very long.
[00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:56.740]   Every time that I call Vanguard and I get a rep
[00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:59.460]   who doesn't really seem to understand the simplest question
[00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:02.100]   or every time they bounce one of my checks,
[00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:05.660]   I wonder about the opacity of the compensation structure
[00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:08.100]   of the executives at Vanguard.
[00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:11.660]   And I'm wondering if anyone in your shop
[00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:13.460]   has discussed that.
[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:15.820]   - Yeah, I've asked Tim Buckley that directly.
[00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:19.980]   As you may know, some of you may be familiar
[00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:24.060]   with Dan Wiener who runs the Vanguard Independent
[00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:26.260]   and as I'm blanking on the exact terminology,
[00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:29.460]   but he famously reconstructed Bogle's salary
[00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:33.020]   and published it, which made Bogle quite angry.
[00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:35.780]   I think though that Vanguard,
[00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:37.740]   there's certain things Vanguard could improve in
[00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:42.100]   and I think transparency is one of them in certain respects.
[00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:45.900]   And one of them would be compensation for executives.
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:48.980]   They have said to me, basically,
[00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:50.140]   they don't wanna disclose it
[00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:52.220]   because of competitive pressures.
[00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:54.300]   But if you think about your average,
[00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:56.380]   well, every publicly traded company,
[00:55:56.380 --> 00:56:00.260]   you wanna find out what the CEO makes, you can.
[00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:04.860]   Bogle has made much out of you can't serve two masters
[00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:07.940]   and being very critical of publicly traded asset managers,
[00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:10.900]   but that's one respect in which publicly traded
[00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:15.500]   asset managers have a leg up and it's been raised
[00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:18.540]   is what I can say and I'd like to see him do it.
[00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:25.780]   - Folks, that is gonna be it for our time today.
[00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:27.660]   Thank you for Ben Johnson and Alec Lucas
[00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:28.700]   for joining us today.
[00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:31.860]   (audience applauding)
[00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:39.300]   We will see everyone at 6.30 down in the banquet hall
[00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:41.740]   downstairs, same spot as last night.
[00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:43.140]   Until then, enjoy your break.
[00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:45.820]   (dog barking)
[00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:55.820]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
