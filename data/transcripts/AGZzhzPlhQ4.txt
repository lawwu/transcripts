[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200]   Hi, my name is Brad.
[00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:07.240]   I'm a husband, father of three awesome kids, and a minister in Houston, Texas.
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.400]   I've been a Desiring God ministry partner for five years now.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:19.560]   You're listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with John Piper.
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.600]   Brad has a story I want to share with you in a moment, but speaking of ministers and
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.920]   the ministry, if you want to understand John Piper and why he does ministry the way he
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.280]   does, I think you must understand David's bold claim in Psalm 119, verse 99.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:42.880]   I have more understanding than all my teachers, for your testimonies are my meditation.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.760]   Understanding God's word rests on personal meditation, not simply in surrounding yourself
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.280]   with the sharpest academic minds.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.760]   This text proved vital to Pastor John's early formation in ministry.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.720]   The broader context of Psalm 119, verses 97 to 100 is important, too.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.600]   On the podcast, we talked briefly about this text one time back in APJ 1533.
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.200]   There, Pastor John, you talked about why, when we have so much good Bible scholarship,
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.040]   we still need to be trained to study the Bible for ourselves.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.160]   And on Twitter, you've cited verse 99 a few times.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.840]   Here are two of those tweets, both very provocative.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.600]   In my 20s, I knew I could not outread my liberal professors, but I took heart from this verse
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.480]   that I could out-meditate them.
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.480]   So can you?
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.560]   In a couple of years earlier, you tweeted this on the same text and said, "One true
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.600]   citation from God's word may silence a whole semester of human speculation."
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.760]   I was wondering, Pastor John, can you don your biographical hat, take a Bible truth
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.280]   and apply it to one life—in this case, apply Psalm 119, verses 97 to 100—to your own
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.280]   formation?
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.440]   Well, I will try.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.500]   Let's read the Psalm.
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.440]   Not everybody knows these verses, so they are very, very precious, and I hope they are
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.280]   to the folks who are listening or will become so.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:13.520]   So Psalm 119, 97 to 100, "O how I love your law."
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.960]   And by the way, just a little comment here, this is not even in my notes.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.480]   Torah, the word for law, means basically instruction.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.240]   So if people have in their mind law means just rules, that's all it is, just rules,
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.040]   rules, rules, you need to get that out of your brain.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.200]   "O how I love your instruction.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.360]   O how I love everything you say."
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.120]   Okay, close that parenthesis.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.020]   "O how I love your law, your instruction.
[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.360]   It is my meditation all the day.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.960]   Your commandment makes me wiser than my enemies, for it is ever with me.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:56.400]   I have more understanding than all my teachers, for your testimonies are my meditation.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.680]   I understand more than the aged, for I keep your precepts."
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.360]   Now I think the first thing to say here is this.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:13.020]   When I was undergoing an awakening to the life of the mind at Wheaton College between
[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:22.500]   1964 and 1968, under the influence of Clyde Kilby and C.S. Lewis, Stuart Hackett, the
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:29.640]   philosophy teacher, Francis Schaeffer indirectly, whole English department where I was a major,
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.640]   two things were growing in me which relate to this text.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:45.820]   One was the deepening and intensifying of my affections, my emotions, my heart response
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:55.160]   to the good, the true, and the beautiful, and ultimately of course the highest good
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.520]   and the highest affections for God himself and his word.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.700]   That's one thing.
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:09.880]   The other was a similar intensifying of my analytical bent toward probing and questioning
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.080]   and scrutinizing and defining and dissecting, all the while as a lit major knowing that
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.040]   Wordsworth had warned, "We murder to dissect."
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.000]   I said, "I get that.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   I'm sorry, William.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   I'm not killing anything.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I'm trying not to, but it is a danger.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   It is.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.080]   You dissect something, you kill it first."
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:36.480]   So I have always felt like I am two kinds of person in one, a highly analytical question
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:46.960]   asker and a romantic pursuer of deep and authentic, satisfying emotional responses to what I see
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.280]   and experience.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:58.560]   So when I read verse 97 of Psalm 119, "Oh, how I love your law.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:06.240]   It is my meditation all the day," the two persons inside of me latch on to those two
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.600]   words, right?
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.000]   One of me took hold of the word "love."
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.280]   "I love your instruction, Lord.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.280]   I value it.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.280]   I embrace it.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.280]   I cherish it.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.280]   I enjoy it.
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.280]   I long for it.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.280]   I admire it.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.280]   I eat it.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.280]   I drink it.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.280]   It makes me happy.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.920]   It awakens life and joy and hope in me."
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.560]   And the other me took hold of the word "meditation."
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.600]   "I will think about your law.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.120]   I will probe into your law.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.760]   I will ask questions of your law.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:46.280]   I will analyze your law and press for definitions in your law until I squeeze from your law
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:52.080]   every drop of reality juice that I possibly can."
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:06:01.680]   So that double response to Psalm 119, 97, one, loving God's Word, two, meditating on
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.480]   God's Word set—I think this is what you're asking me to talk about.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.120]   I might misunderstand.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.960]   It set the course of my life.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.360]   It really did.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:19.840]   I think everything I have done, written or spoken, has been shaped by the double grasp
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.880]   of God's Word in these two ways.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:30.800]   Now, what you pointed out in those tweets was that over the next six years of my seminary
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:39.400]   education three years and doctoral studies for three years, I found that my bent toward
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:46.960]   loving the reality that biblical texts were seeking to communicate and spending long hours
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:56.080]   staring at the text, wrestling, digging, querying, praying, paid more dividends for me than if
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.560]   I had spent all of that time reading secondary sources.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.560]   That's what I discovered.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.740]   Now, I wish I've dealt with the Lord a lot of times on this and have had to have him
[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:14.360]   rebuke me because of my discontent, but I could wish that I read faster and comprehended
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:21.800]   more quickly and remembered things long enough that I could be a person who is both widely
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:28.420]   read and intensely focused on particular biblical texts.
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.960]   But I'm not that person.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.120]   I'm not.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:41.160]   And so I have opted to be a very focused text analyzer and reality lover rather than being
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.900]   a widely read scholar.
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:53.080]   So I tweeted, "I knew I could not outread my liberal professors, but I could outmeditate
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:59.900]   them," or I wrote, "One true citation from God's Word may silence a whole semester
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.820]   of human speculation."
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:10.900]   In a sense, that's my biographical living out of Psalm 119.98-100.
[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:11.900]   It goes like this.
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.180]   This is the other part of the text you cited.
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:21.700]   "Your commandment makes me wiser than my enemies, for it's ever with me.
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:28.060]   I have more understanding than all my graduate school teachers, for your testimonies are
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.780]   my meditation.
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.260]   I understand more than the aged."
[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.060]   I was in my 20s then.
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:38.060]   So what does it mean now?
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:41.860]   You'll have to work that out for another session.
[00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.780]   "So I keep your precepts."
[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.780]   So there's a double progression here.
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:51.880]   It moves from enemies to teachers to elders.
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.460]   And I can out-understand them all, it says.
[00:08:55.460 --> 00:09:00.140]   And it moves from, "Your Word is with me," to, "Your Word is my meditation," to, "I
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.140]   obey your Word."
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.700]   There's a progression in both the people and in the action.
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:11.940]   So the overall point, it seems to me, is the more seriously and diligently and lovingly
[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:18.700]   you dig into God's Word and let it dig into you, the more likely it is that you will be
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:25.900]   wiser and more insightful than those who get their learning another way, no matter how
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.860]   much older than you they are.
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:35.420]   So I know it would be utterly presumptuous now to draw the inference, "So I have been
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:41.140]   wiser than all my teachers and all my enemies and all my elders for these yea many fifty
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:42.140]   years."
[00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:46.980]   And the reason that would be absolute folly to talk like that is—I mean, there are several
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:54.180]   reasons—but one is, there are others besides me who meditate on God's Word, of course.
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:58.940]   But here's what I will say with a couple of anecdotes.
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:06.780]   When I was in seminary, I took every possible course with the teacher who valued this kind
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.740]   of rigorous attention to the text.
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:11.900]   This is Daniel Fuller.
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:16.820]   One time, a visiting scholar came to the seminary—well-known.
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.180]   You would know his name, Tony.
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.340]   Lots of our listeners would know his name.
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.580]   He's not living anymore.
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:27.740]   But he came to just teach one course, and world-class New Testament scholar.
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.620]   I said, "Man, I'm signing up for that class."
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:35.960]   And so eager to learn from this giant about two or three classes in.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.300]   My hand's just up, sticking up.
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:44.100]   I'm raising my hand regularly in the class and asking particular questions about the
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.140]   text and about the way he's using them.
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:51.140]   This man was not used to that.
[00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:58.340]   His face would turn red, and he was manifestly unhappy with such questions.
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.140]   So you know what I did?
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.700]   I dropped the class.
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:09.140]   I said, "Look, for me, education meant not being lectured to with what I could read in
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:17.020]   his books, but having my capacities of seeing and savoring deepened and ripened and intensified
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:24.740]   by rigorous observation and analysis and celebration with someone who's better at it than I am.
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:25.740]   Help me do this."
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:29.140]   So I just went and signed up for another class with Daniel Fuller.
[00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:33.900]   Man, was I growing in leaps and bounds in my capacities.
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.700]   Now when I got to Germany—one more anecdote.
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:41.660]   When I got to Germany for graduate school, I had formed habits.
[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.020]   So now for three years I've been forming these habits.
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:51.800]   I had formed habits of observation and analysis and text querying that were very fixed in
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.800]   my methodology.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.620]   I knew how I profited from Scripture.
[00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.020]   They were so fruitful.
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:04.880]   My methods were so fruitful in what they yielded from meditation, nothing could dislodge them.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.180]   And I didn't see anything.
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:11.140]   In fact, I came to tears sometimes sitting in classes grieving over what these students
[00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.940]   in my classes were having to deal with because they were so inadequate.
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:22.140]   I didn't see anything in the German methodology of those days in that school that came close
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:27.580]   to the fruitfulness of the methods of observation and analysis that I had learned.
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:34.340]   And my love for the reality that the authors of Scripture were trying to communicate had
[00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:42.300]   created a habit of mind that was impatient with mere textual gamesmanship that stayed
[00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:47.540]   at the grammatical, logical, historical level while never pushing through the words to the
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:52.580]   reality that was driving and animating everything in the Bible.
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:59.580]   So these two habits—rigorous analysis of text plus earnest love for the reality behind
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:10.060]   them—Psalm 119.97—proved to be very unusual among my fellow graduate students in Munich,
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.860]   Germany in the early '70s.
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.820]   And I say this as a tragedy.
[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:21.420]   There was such a fascination with almost everything but the actual nitty-gritty of the wording
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:27.620]   of the text and the glorious reality that the text was trying to communicate time and
[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:34.500]   again—and this is embarrassing even—time and again in discussions.
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:41.380]   I would listen for a while, and then I would kind of hesitantly ask a question to my three
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:46.060]   or four folks, fellow students, who were talking.
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:52.440]   I would ask a question about some grammatical particularity in the biblical text that seemed
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:58.220]   to have an implication for reality that they were not latching onto, and there would be
[00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:59.220]   silence.
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:04.500]   You hit your ball over the tennis net and it never comes back.
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:14.500]   So to this day, Tony, my personal testimony is that my limited scholarly focus has not
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:23.580]   suited me to be a world-class scholar, but that very limited focus on loving the instruction
[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:32.140]   of God and the reality behind it and meditating assiduously on God's expression of that reality
[00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:42.780]   in his Word has taken away from me any sense of being intimidated when it comes to a confident
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:48.300]   rendering of what God is communicating in his Word.
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:55.180]   I think that is tremendously encouraging for young aspiring pastors to hear, that if they
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:15:04.020]   will love God and love his Word, and if they will give themselves untiringly to careful
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:13.220]   handling meditation on God's text, they will never have to be cowed by their enemies, their
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:17.660]   teachers, or the aged—even the aged John Piper.
[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:22.140]   They will be able on their own to get what they need and preach the Word.
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.980]   That's a great encouragement for any pastor.
[00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:26.460]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:30.540]   And speaking of pastors, you met Brad, a pastor in Houston, at the top of this episode.
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.020]   I have him on the phone now.
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.220]   Brad, thank you for joining us on the podcast today.
[00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:39.460]   Tell us a little bit about yourself and how Pastor John's ministry intersected with your
[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.460]   own ministry.
[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:46.500]   When I was in college, my brother had gotten started in youth ministry and had found Desiring
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.740]   God and some of the books that John Piper had written.
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:54.820]   And so we started—I first read Desiring God and then found the website and started
[00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:59.260]   listening over and over again to a lot of the different biographies that were on there.
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:04.940]   And then that moved into sermons and then just being so encouraged and really shaping
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:13.180]   so much of my theology of what does it mean to be a Christian and money and marriage and
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:20.620]   just Christian life and all those things just made such a big impact on me as I was growing
[00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.620]   spiritually.
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:27.580]   Ten years ago, my brother and I had an opportunity to go to the pastors conference and meet Pastor
[00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:33.340]   John and it really just made a huge impact in our lives to have someone that we looked
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:38.540]   up to so much, that we had listened to so many things, and it really helped shape so
[00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:39.540]   much of our faith.
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:44.580]   And then just to have a chance to meet him, to see other people there, and just the encouragement
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:49.220]   that was brought to so many pastors by Desiring God in the ministry that they do.
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:50.580]   That's great to hear.
[00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:56.260]   So as a pastor today, how do Desiring God resources continue to equip you and how do
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:00.620]   you make use of the resources as a pastor, particularly this podcast?
[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.020]   Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:08.820]   And I recommend Desiring God and a lot of the resources that are there in so many questions
[00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:12.900]   that Pastor John answers to our people all the time when they have questions about their
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:18.460]   marriage, about parenting, usually when they're struggling through what is the right thing
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.860]   to do, what's the godly thing to do.
[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:25.860]   So I recommend Desiring God to our people all the time when they have questions about
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:30.780]   the Bible or particular passages, and it's so easy to find the answers that they're looking
[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:31.780]   for.
[00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:36.660]   And then also, I think just for me personally, if I'm teaching a lesson or going through
[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:41.740]   verses that I'll always go back and check what resources are out there to help make
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:47.220]   sure that I'm on the right track and ways of teaching and presenting these things.
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:50.540]   It is an everyday thing that I use Desiring God.
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:56.620]   And that's hard to get across, I think, in trying to be brief, just the level of impact
[00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:57.620]   that it's made.
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.420]   Well, even briefly put, that's moving to me, Brad.
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.420]   Thank you.
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:06.260]   You are right now talking to a bunch of listeners to the podcast, many of whom have received
[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.140]   a lot from the ministry but have never given back.
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:10.900]   What would you say to them?
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:17.380]   Yeah, so I've been listening and really using Desiring God resources for over 15 years,
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:22.020]   but it wasn't until five years ago that my wife and I decided that we needed to start
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:27.300]   giving and part of that came in reading 1 Corinthians 9, 11.
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:33.140]   It says, "If we have sown spiritual things among you, is it too much if we reap material
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.220]   things from you?"
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:42.260]   And we just talked about how much we had received spiritually from Desiring God and from the
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:46.260]   sermons, from the Ask Pastor Johnson, all the different resources that are there.
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:51.540]   So we've received so much spiritually and just thinking that we want other people to
[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.180]   have access to that, too.
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:58.060]   And as we've gotten older, realizing that even though everything on Desiring God is
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:03.780]   free for people to access, that there's still a cost to it, that someone's paying to keep
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.660]   all those things running and moving.
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:11.420]   And since it made such a big impact in our lives, we want to continue to see that happen.
[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.820]   They can make an impact in the lives of others as well.
[00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:17.980]   And so it wasn't something that we felt like we had to do, but that we were excited to
[00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:18.980]   get to do.
[00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:23.420]   And we feel like every dollar that we invest in Desiring God is a great investment into
[00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:24.420]   the kingdom.
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:28.780]   Yes, an investment that makes it possible for our resources to be made and to be spread
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:31.620]   around the world free of charge.
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:35.380]   Five years supporting Desiring God as a ministry partner and many more years of purposefully
[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:40.300]   sharing our resources and seeing the strategic value of our resources to serve you as a pastor
[00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:41.980]   and serve your congregation.
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:47.500]   That's exactly the kind of intentional vision for our resources that encourages our work,
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:48.500]   Brad.
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.500]   So thank you so much.
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.500]   In so many ways, you're a gift to us.
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:51.500]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.500]   We are really grateful.
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.700]   Man, it's so encouraging.
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:58.380]   As we enter the final weeks and days of the year, if you believe this, if you believe
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:03.180]   that Desiring God is making pastors and churches better and more faithful, consider joining
