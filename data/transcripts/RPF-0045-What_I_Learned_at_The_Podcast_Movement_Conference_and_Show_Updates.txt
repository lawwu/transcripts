[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.640]   Radical Personal Finance, episode 45.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:56.640]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast, episode 45 for today, Thursday, August 21, 2014.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.640]   I am thrilled to be back with you today.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.640]   I'm going to be sharing with you some lessons from the Podcast Movement Conference, which I attended this last weekend,
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.640]   which will be beyond podcasting.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.640]   I'm going to give you some information that I think you'll enjoy applying to your own life and the conferences that you attend,
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.640]   and also some updates on the show.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.640]   I hope you enjoy.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:24.640]   Thrilled to be back with you today on Thursday.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.640]   I was away from the mic for two days, and that's the first two days that I haven't recorded shows.
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.640]   I was on the road those two days, both days, and I thought about recording a show,
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.640]   but I decided just to go ahead and wait until I got back, just to give myself a little bit of a break.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.640]   Then I was interested to see if I would get any feedback from the audience about missing shows.
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.640]   I'll share that more with you at the end of today's show.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:56.640]   Today, I'm going to share with you some information that I learned from the Podcast Movement Conference this last weekend that I attended in Austin, Texas.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.640]   Again, as I said just a moment ago, this is going to be beyond just what I learned,
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.640]   but also some thoughts that I think will be helpful to you when you attend conferences, I hope.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.640]   I first heard about the Podcast Movement Conference only about a month or so ago.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.640]   Maybe it was a month and a half, I'm not sure.
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.640]   This was the first year that the conference was ever put on.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.640]   What I learned about the story of the conference was really interesting.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.640]   Basically, some people wanted to put together a podcasting-only conference.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.640]   My understanding is that there had been some things like this in the past,
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.640]   but usually they're part of a new media expo or podcasting tracks, things like that.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.640]   It's not its own conference.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.640]   Some people got the idea to put together a conference.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.640]   They did a Kickstarter to raise funds.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.640]   There was a lot of support, and it wound up being a really great conference.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.640]   It looks like they're trying to do it again next year, and I'm glad I went.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.640]   I went last minute because I just figured I would learn something, I would meet some people,
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.640]   and the ticket prices were not all that expensive, so I figured I would go ahead and go.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.640]   It was a really neat experience.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.640]   I left shows all last week, so I actually drove out to Texas.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.640]   I left West Palm Beach early on Thursday morning and then arrived there Friday midday and then drove back.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.640]   I spent one extra day in Texas visiting with a friend on my way back.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.640]   I left shows last week for Thursday and Friday, but they were actually prerecorded.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.640]   I had wanted to do that because I wanted to make sure the show went out every day.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.640]   I'm glad I did, but it was challenging to record the extra shows.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.640]   But I'm glad it wound up.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.640]   Friday's show was the Walmart show, was how I would become a millionaire at Walmart.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.640]   Based upon the download, it's actually really interesting.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.640]   It's written well received, but I haven't even gotten the show notes up.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.640]   I was wrapping up, and I didn't have time to write the show notes,
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.640]   so I went ahead and published it, and I still need to go back and finish the show notes.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.640]   I had planned to do some shows from the road on the way back, but I chose not to do it.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.640]   I just decided to take a little break.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.640]   I didn't want to just create a show for no reason, and I was actually curious to see if I would get any feedback from not doing it.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.640]   I wound up getting one piece of feedback, so I was thrilled about that, and I'm going to cover that at the end of the show.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.640]   Where I'm going to go is I'm just going to walk through why our conference is valuable,
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.640]   what are some of the lessons that I learned from this one I went to,
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.640]   lessons I didn't learn, how to do a conference on the cheap,
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.640]   and then at the end I'm going to give you some updates on the show and where I see this going as far as over the long term.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.640]   So why go to conferences in the first place?
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:30.640]   Well, I think that all of us should be, especially as we're establishing our careers, all of us should be going to conferences.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.640]   If you remember back to the 1,000% formula on the episode that I did,
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.640]   which was you're 100% responsible for your income,
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:45.640]   which if you're interested in that one, it was episode 10.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:51.640]   So radicalpersonalfinance.com/10, which is entitled "You are 100% responsible for your income."
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:05:00.640]   I went over Brian Tracy's 1,000% formula, his specific formula for how to increase your income by 1,000% in the next 10 years.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.640]   And it was his idea, and I've seen other people do it as well, that you can multiply your income.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.640]   Whatever you're making today, every 10 years you can multiply your income by about 10 if you want to.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.640]   And he gives a specific formula for how to do that.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.640]   One part of the formula is to go to four conferences in your field each year.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.640]   And so I've always kept that in mind, and I've tried to do that as much as possible.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.640]   I haven't always gone to four, because the challenge is just with integrating life and business
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.640]   and then feeling like you have a really good one to go to.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.640]   But I've never always found one that I wanted to go to.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.640]   But I've always gone to at least a couple per year.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.640]   And I think it's so valuable, and especially now as I embark in a new field and a new career
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.640]   where I really don't know much about it, I want to make sure that I'm going to various conferences in my field each year.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.640]   The primary value of a conference, in my opinion, is not really what you hear at the conference.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:55.640]   I think the primary value of a conference is that you get a chance to meet the leaders of your field.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.640]   Or if they're not the leaders, at least those who are serious about learning.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.640]   I don't know, other than an industry conference, I don't know of a better way to get an opportunity
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:10.640]   to meet people that are in your specific industry, that are in your specific field, other than at a conference.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.640]   I mean, think about it. I'm not sure how many people were at this Podcast Movement conference,
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.640]   but there was at least several hundred.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.640]   And these are the several hundred people who are the leaders in the podcasting world and very serious.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.640]   They're not necessarily all the top podcasters, but there are a lot of them.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.640]   And it was a really neat opportunity just to have them all in one place and get a chance to talk
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.640]   and to speak with them and meet them individually.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:41.640]   I think that kind of exposure is invaluable, especially if instead of trying to necessarily pitch something,
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.640]   you're just focused on building friendships and building relationships.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:50.640]   I think conferences are also really valuable to meet with a lot of vendors in one place.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.640]   And at this Podcast Movement conference, that was the case.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.640]   There were a good number of vendors showcasing some new products, some exciting products.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.640]   And then I was able to get some of my questions answered,
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.640]   especially some technical questions with some of the vendors who were there.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:08.640]   I'm not a technological guy. Frankly, it drives me a little bit nuts.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.640]   But I was able to get some clear answers on some questions I had.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.640]   So meeting with a lot of vendors in one place is really valuable.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.640]   Also super valuable just to get a kind of a general sense of the state of the industry
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.640]   and the current trends going on in the industry.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:28.640]   I don't know, other than a conference, how you can get such a wide exposure to many people,
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.640]   many topics in a very short amount of time.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:37.640]   And the other nice thing about a conference is it pools people together that, frankly, you wouldn't ordinarily meet.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:42.640]   One of the most memorable sessions that I went to at the Podcast Movement conference
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.640]   was they had a session with somebody who is a media buyer.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:52.640]   And this person has an advertising company, and they consult with large companies to place advertising.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.640]   And they're doing a lot of work with podcasters now, placing advertising with podcasters,
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.640]   just like advertising has been placed with radio personalities.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.640]   And I learned a lot from that session.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:09.640]   It was just really valuable exposure to meet the media buyer and hear about some of the growth and some of the trends.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:16.640]   I think sessions--and this is at least what I've tried to do at the conference--I think sessions are valuable.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.640]   But a lot of times I actually prefer just to listen to a recording of a session later.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:26.640]   My number one goal in going to this conference was just simply to meet some other people in my industry
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.640]   and make some friends.
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:33.640]   And I didn't really have anything specific that I was looking to sell or anything specific looking to buy.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.640]   My primary goal was just to make some new friends, and I really feel like I accomplished that.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:43.640]   I met some really awesome people in the niche, in the podcasting world.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.640]   I met some really awesome people and really enjoyed--had a really nice time.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.640]   So I think that was the biggest thing.
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:57.640]   I actually prefer not necessarily to watch people speak in person unless it's like a motivational speech maybe.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:02.640]   So if somebody has a specific timely message that they're trying to get across.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:08.640]   So I watched some of the keynotes, but I prefer to listen to the speech later when I can listen at 2x speed.
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:13.640]   I usually--when I go to a conference, I usually buy all the audio and then listen to all the audio from all the speeches.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:18.640]   And that way I can get a better idea and I can listen to it at 2x or 3x speed.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.640]   I'm not quite to 3x.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.640]   Incidentally, I'll insert a suggestion for you.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.640]   For shows like mine, one thing I love about podcasting, listen to them at double the speed.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.640]   My highest rate that I can consume info at is about 2.7x.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:38.640]   So depending on the app that you're listening on, if it allows you--most of the apps will allow you to go at 2x, 1.5x, or 1x.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.640]   But some of them you can get a little bit faster, and I've gotten up to about 2.7x to be able to absorb it in English.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.640]   Not foreign language podcasts, but in English.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:53.640]   And that allows me to consume a lot more content and just look for the nuggets than listening at 1x.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.640]   So a little tip for you from what Joshua does if you're interested.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:02.640]   So, I mean, the sessions are valuable, but a lot of times I just like to listen to the recordings of the sessions, and that's what I did this time.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.640]   I really just spent most of my time talking with people and trying to build friendships, and I really enjoyed that.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.640]   I learned a lot.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:14.640]   You know, one of the things about the sessions that I did go to, it's very interesting.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:23.640]   I'm convinced sometimes you have to really look beyond what the conference speaker says they do or says works,
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.640]   and look at what the conference speaker is actually doing.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:35.640]   And I was struck by this at the podcast conference, that so many people have an idea of, "Here's what I'm doing, and here's why it works."
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:44.640]   And I listened to them carefully, and I think they might be right, but they might not know why what they're doing works.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.640]   I really feel like a lot of times it's hard for us to figure out why what we're doing works.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.640]   There was a lot of comment and a lot of suggestions given about the format of a show,
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:11:00.640]   and how it should be formatted in this way or not formatted in this way, or how long it should be, or how frequently it should be.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.640]   And I just look at it, and maybe they're right, maybe I'm wrong.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:11.640]   But a lot of times I just think the key thing is that in general, the people that have well-received shows are interesting people,
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:18.640]   talking about a topic that's of interest to their audience, and they're producing really targeted, well-produced content.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:23.640]   And frankly, if you have that, I don't think it really matters as much how great your website looks,
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.640]   or how awesome your audio is, or how wonderful your production quality is.
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:31.640]   Now, those things I think should be tweaked to improve excellence.
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:36.640]   And all of us should be working hard to improve excellence in every way, not to turn people off.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:43.640]   But it's about just having a message and having a really great message.
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:51.640]   Last reason as far as why to go to a conference in the first place, conferences can be just a great way to integrate personal life and fun and business.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:56.640]   And at the end of the show, or in the fourth topic I have I want to go over in today's show,
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:02.640]   is just talk about how much I spent going to the conference, and then how to integrate business and personal expenses.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:09.640]   And going to conferences can just be a great way to mix your personal life with some fun travel and some personal enjoyment.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.640]   Maybe take your family, and then also the fun and business fun.
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.640]   So what did I learn?
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:21.640]   Well, the first thing I learned is I had to reinforce that conferences, I just had such a great time meeting some like-minded people.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.640]   I met so many cool, inspiring podcasters.
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:29.640]   And I really felt like every conversation with another podcaster was just easy to start.
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.640]   We were all there for the same reason.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:37.640]   And it was just, it was almost like a family reunion or an old reunion with friends that you've gotten along well with,
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:44.640]   even though I didn't know, let me think to make sure I'm speaking the truth, yeah, I didn't know a single person that was going to be at the conference.
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:49.640]   And I'm actually an introvert, believe it or not, most people don't believe me.
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.640]   I'm an introvert, I prefer a lot of times to be by myself.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.640]   And I often get nervous about meeting people.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.640]   I get nervous when there's a big crowd in a big room, and it's very difficult for me.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.640]   I kind of have to force myself to be social.
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:05.640]   But it was so easy at a conference like this where everyone was there for the same reason.
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.640]   And I just enjoyed that.
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.640]   It was just so easy to feel like it could click.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:15.640]   And because everyone there was there for a specific topic, podcasting,
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:23.640]   the conversations were easy because we were all talking about ideas that were important to us.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:29.640]   And for me, when I talk about, if I have to talk about myself or about some subjects,
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.640]   to me it's not, I don't, I guess I don't mind talking about myself,
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.640]   but a lot of times if I don't have a lot in common with someone it's difficult.
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.640]   But when I can talk about big ideas, I love to talk about big ideas.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:43.640]   That's why I host a podcast, and why I can come up with something to say for an hour a day.
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.640]   Because I love to talk about ideas. Ideas turn me on.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.640]   Whether or not I agree with them or not, that doesn't matter.
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:54.640]   I just like to talk about ideas and wrestle with them and have an internal conversation and struggle.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:01.640]   I was also just reconvinced that I love being with entrepreneurs. I really do.
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.640]   Entrepreneurs are the most interesting people in the world to me.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:10.640]   And because entrepreneurs see what's possible instead of seeing what's not possible.
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:16.640]   And whether they're successful entrepreneurs, with here defining success as having "made it,"
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.640]   having made a lot of money, or whether they're brand new entrepreneurs
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.640]   that are just getting started and haven't made a dime yet,
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:26.640]   there's just something about the entrepreneurial mentality.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:31.640]   And because it's so important to choose who we associate with,
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:36.640]   I want to associate with people who are entrepreneurs and who have that entrepreneurial spirit.
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:40.640]   I was struck that, frankly, we're all the same.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:47.640]   All of us are working hard to overcome our personal conditioning and the fear that's built into us.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.640]   All of us are working hard to overcome the conditioning,
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.640]   the way we've been conditioned with school, the way we've been conditioned by what's not possible,
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:59.640]   the way that we've been conditioned by having just ideas beat down and beaten out of us.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:02.640]   And everybody is overcoming fear.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:09.640]   I was struck that the exact same fears that I have are the same fears that everyone else who's at this conference with has.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.640]   And all of us are in that same journey of overcoming our personal fears.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.640]   And so what an awesome group of people to be around.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:20.640]   And it was just a really neat experience to be at a conference with that many people.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.640]   I had planned to do a bunch of interviews at the show.
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:28.640]   And I thought that I would take a mic and I would do some interviews there.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.640]   And I didn't do that.
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.640]   I try not to just interview other podcasters.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:40.640]   It's so easy to get this kind of almost incestuous circle of podcasters where everyone is on everyone else's show.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.640]   And it's like, "Why don't you branch out a little bit?"
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.640]   If someone wants to hear you, go listen to their show.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:52.640]   If you want to hear Joe Blow, go listen to Joe Blow's show if he's a podcaster.
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.640]   You don't need to hear him interview to my show.
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:59.640]   So I try not to bring a ton of other podcasters on.
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:03.640]   But the reality is that it was such a cool group of people.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:09.640]   I met a bunch of people that I'm going to be bringing on this show to interview because you're just really genuinely cool people,
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:13.640]   genuinely interesting people who have interesting stories.
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:20.640]   And I especially tried at this conference--Philip Taylor, who runs the blog PT Money, was there.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:26.640]   And he's the organizer of the FinCon Conference, which is the Financial Bloggers Conference, or formerly the Financial Bloggers Conference.
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.640]   He changed the name to be more inclusive than Financial Bloggers.
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.640]   And I'll be going to that conference in New Orleans next month.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:39.640]   And he had a table there, and that was kind of a neat congregating point to meet with some other personal finance people.
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:44.640]   And I really wanted to hang out with some other personal finance people because I didn't know--prior to this conference,
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:50.640]   I didn't know any other personal finance people that wrote personal finance blogs except the ones that I brought on this show.
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:54.640]   And it was neat just to meet some other personal finance people.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.640]   And again, I was just convinced that the personal finance community, the online personal finance community,
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:07.640]   what an exciting group of people, normal, everyday people that are just working hard to learn and to grow and to pay attention to their money.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:12.640]   And I was a little embarrassed that I don't listen to other personal finance podcasts.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.640]   I think I need to change that.
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:20.640]   I generally try not to listen to other personal finance podcasts because I don't want to steal people's stuff.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:30.640]   And I don't want to hear someone else do an idea that I have and then feel like if I do my idea that I don't--if I do my show,
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.640]   then it's the same show they've done that I'm plagiarizing off of them.
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:36.640]   So I've tried to just avoid listening to many other personal finance shows.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.640]   But I think I'm actually going to change that because there are so many other great personal finance people.
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.640]   And I learned about a bunch of new personal finance shows.
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.640]   And I think I'm going to go change that.
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:56.640]   I think at this point I have enough of a clear idea of what I'm trying to do with my show that I don't--it won't become just like someone else's show.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:03.640]   So I'm going to probably expand my listening horizons and try to listen to some other personal finance content.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:10.640]   I was struck by podcasting as what an awesome medium, what an awesome medium to build a community and meet cool friends.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:15.640]   I had an opportunity to meet--there's a podcast I really enjoy listening to.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.640]   It's called The Family Adventure Podcast.
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.640]   And I would encourage you to check it out.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.640]   It's awesome.
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:25.640]   The host, his name is Eric Hemingway, and he does this show.
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:29.640]   It's an interview show where he interviews families who are traveling.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:34.640]   And usually these are families who are traveling for a long period of time, but they're traveling with their kids.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.640]   And I love to travel and I like kids.
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.640]   So I enjoy his show and they're really great.
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:44.640]   Well, I was at this one event at the conference, and I hear his voice in front of me.
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.640]   He turns around and says hi to me.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:52.640]   And I had that weird moment where I felt like I know who you are because he has this very distinctive voice, great deep voice for radio.
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.640]   It's very good.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.640]   And I was like, "Who are you?
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.640]   Who are you?"
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.640]   And then I made the connection, shook his hand, and he's like, "I'm Eric Hemingway."
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.640]   And I said, "Ah, Family Adventure Podcast."
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.640]   And it was awesome.
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.640]   We had a good chance to hang out together.
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.640]   And it was like meeting an old friend.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:15.640]   And I thought, "What an awesome connection to make, like meeting an old friend," because I felt like I knew him and I knew his story.
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.640]   And we had so many things in common.
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.640]   We really had a great time talking.
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:24.640]   I'm going to have him on the show to tell you his story because he and his wife have an awesome story.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:31.640]   One of the things I learned, and I think this goes against what was actually presented by some of the speakers,
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:38.640]   I learned that the format of a show is not the key indicator of what success is.
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:46.640]   And I was struck by this because I think in many ways podcasting currently is almost a little bit formulaic.
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:56.640]   It seems like a lot of broadcasters or podcasters, they look to see what are the shows that are doing well and then try to copy that.
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:03.640]   And that may be a good place to start, but I was just struck in how I really believe that's the wrong message.
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:07.640]   Rather, I think the format should fit the content.
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:13.640]   And that's why I love podcasting is that if I've got a topic--now, this has gotten out of hand for me in a couple of the shows that I've done--
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:19.640]   but if I've got a topic where I need four hours to cover the point, I should take four hours and cover the point.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:23.640]   And if I have a topic that in 15 minutes, that's it, then I'm going to make a 15-minute show.
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:27.640]   I'm not going to waste your time with a one-hour show just because that's the format.
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:32.640]   And the opening keynote, Chris Brogan, I think was the opening keynote, he made that comment.
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:42.640]   I've never listened to his show, but he made that comment very much and said that don't stick to your formats, stick to your content.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:47.640]   And then probably one of the favorite sessions I attended was a session with a man named Justin.
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:53.640]   I don't remember his last name, but Justin runs something called the Brewing Network.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:59.640]   And he's got a show that his entire show is about--it's for home brewers and craft brewers.
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:05.640]   It's all about beer. His topic was how I get paid--or his title of his talk was "How I Get Paid to Drink Beer for a Living."
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:10.640]   And he presented this show, and it was such an awesome, an awesome presentation.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:15.640]   But I was struck--his podcast is four hours long, and he does a weekly show.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:20.640]   It's four hours long. He always does it live. He always does that.
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:27.640]   And the reason he chose a four-hour format was he says, "Well, broadcast radio, they do a four-hour format, so it must work for a reason.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.640]   Every morning show that you listen to is a four-hour format." So that's what he does.
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:38.640]   And his show has been very successful for him. It makes a full-time living for him and a number of other people and a very niche topic.
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:42.640]   But he made a good point that everybody knows what good radio sounds like.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:50.640]   And I've been working hard--which I'm going to come to in just a moment with more on this--but I've been working hard to try to amp up my game a little bit and be a better broadcaster.
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:56.640]   But I haven't known where to go to learn, other than just to listen to myself and say, "Well, do I like that or not?"
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.640]   And I haven't known where to go to learn.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:11.640]   And I thought his point about just listening to good broadcasters--and everyone knows what good radio sounds like, and that's the primary way to learn--would be that listening to radio--
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:16.640]   listening to what works there--is probably a better idea than I had ever given credit to.
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:21.640]   In his show, his four-hour show, he does it exactly like commercial radio does it.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:29.640]   He does pauses for advertising breaks, does a four-minute break block of advertising and commercials right in the middle of the show.
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.640]   So I was just struck that everyone's trying to say, "This is what works."
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:37.640]   And the reality is that there are so many different things that can work.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:45.640]   The format should just fit the content, so I'm really going to pay attention to that, trying to tighten up my content and keep my format exactly to what's appropriate.
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:51.640]   I learned--and I hadn't realized--but iOS, the Apple devices, are not king in podcasting.
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:23:04.640]   And one of the talks--I think it was Jamie Tardy from The Eventual Millionaire--her podcast, she was talking, and she put up a chart on the screen that showed the growth of Android versus iOS.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:10.640]   And I had never realized how dramatically iOS was losing market share compared to Android.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.640]   I knew it big picture, but I'd never looked at a chart.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:22.640]   And so I've made so much of a to-do about getting good iTunes reviews and getting you all to leave me iTunes reviews, and thank you.
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.640]   Those are super helpful.
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:29.640]   We're listed in New and Noteworthy still, and I actually found out last night we're New and Noteworthy #6 for health right now.
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.640]   Because that was one of the categories I submitted my show under.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:39.640]   I submitted it under business, investing, general business, and then health, because I think financial health is a big influence on personal health.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:44.640]   But I recognize that in some ways I'm kind of spending all this time on iTunes, and there's so many other platforms.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:50.640]   So I went and I looked, and I just want to say personally thank you to those of you who left me reviews on Stitcher.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:55.640]   I found three reviews on Stitcher that I hadn't seen previously.
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:24:02.640]   And I want to thank you just because I didn't have a way to kind of see those, and I hadn't looked for them.
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.640]   And I found three awesome reviews sitting there on Stitcher.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:10.640]   And so I want to thank you for those of you who are listening on Stitcher and who left me reviews on Stitcher.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:16.640]   And I would ask you if you do listen on Stitcher, please take a moment and do that.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.640]   I've got three five-star reviews there, and that means the world to me.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:24.640]   So if you listen on Stitcher, I'd appreciate your leaving me a Stitcher review as well.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:28.640]   I just don't know why. I just was discounting people who weren't listening to iOS.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:34.640]   I learned that interviews are probably tough to do at an event.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:39.640]   I had planned to take my mic with me and do a bunch of interviews, and it just didn't feel right to me.
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.640]   I didn't do any interviews there.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:52.640]   I may do some at FinCon, but I feel like better, though, just the people that I met and that I'll be able to bring on the show now is going to be better.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:57.640]   It felt like there were many people doing interviews there, and I thought, "It all just seems a little bit forced to me."
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:02.640]   So I felt it was better to meet people and then do a Skype interview later.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:13.640]   I was reminded that as adults, we care about who people are at the core, not what their external appearance is or whether they're cool or not.
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:20.640]   And maybe it's because I'm young and I'm still slightly recovering from all of the conditioning that was done to me in the school system.
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:27.640]   But some of the most unlikely-looking people at the show were the most interesting for me to talk to.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:32.640]   I'm not much of a techno nerd. I come from the business world.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:39.640]   I remember the first day I met--I'll skip the names. This isn't insulting.
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:44.640]   There was a podcaster who was there who I found out has a fairly successful show.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:51.640]   He's wearing shorts, jean shorts and a t-shirt and tennis shoes.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.640]   Now I'm from South Florida where fashion matters.
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:26:04.640]   I've never in my life--well, maybe since I was nine years old, I've never gone out of the house in jean shorts, tennis shoes and a t-shirt.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:07.640]   We wouldn't dream of doing that in South Florida.
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.640]   I don't even live in Miami where it's worse than where I live.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:14.640]   But here he was and he's talking to me and he's super helpful and just an awesome guy.
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.640]   I was struck just by how casual some of the people were at this event.
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:22.640]   Some of the people that make a lot of money on their shows and who are much loved by other podcasters.
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:30.640]   And here they are. There was one guy who's wearing khakis and tennis shoes and that's a complete no-no in my world.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:34.640]   I would never in my life dream of leaving the house dressed like that.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.640]   But here was a group of people who didn't really seem to care.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.640]   A lot of techno geeks and whatever, I'll wear what I want to wear.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:47.640]   Looking at what people wore on stage and again, the jeans and tennis shoes thing is hard for me to take.
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.640]   It's just such a big no-no where I'm from.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:57.640]   But it was refreshing to be at a place where adults care about who people are on the core.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.640]   Not what they look like, not these external things.
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.640]   Now I was just reminded though that appearance does matter.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.640]   It's not to say that appearance doesn't matter.
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:09.640]   And I often think this, even just on the way there, I was thinking about my own appearance.
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.640]   I was just thinking appearance does matter.
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:15.640]   It would be nice if nobody judged us by how we look.
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.640]   But the fact of the matter is, they do. People do.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:24.640]   So there's probably a balancing act there between those two things that I haven't figured out.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:31.640]   I haven't figured out exactly how it's supposed to work.
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.640]   But it was neat to me to see.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:38.640]   It's just amazing to see someone come up for a keynote wearing tennis shoes on stage.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:44.640]   Again, maybe it's just a Florida thing, but that is a little startling to me.
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:49.640]   Really bothered by some of the advice that I heard people give and some of the business models.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:53.640]   For example, one of the themes I heard from some people, not necessarily from the stage,
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.640]   was position yourself as an expert even if you're not.
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.640]   I just thought, what a load of crap.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.640]   Say you're not an expert, but don't position yourself as an expert.
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.640]   Don't just try to do this thing of, "I'm an expert at a podcast."
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.640]   There are many things I'm an expert at and there are many things that I'm not.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:11.640]   But I feel like podcasting is a medium where you get to know the person intimately.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:16.640]   And you're going to be able to smell a rat in an instant if somebody's not an expert.
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.640]   Now, become an expert and then share your journey.
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.640]   But focus on that.
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.640]   I was bothered by some of the focus on money.
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.640]   I think money is very important that podcasters learn how to make a profit at.
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.640]   But I was just bothered.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.640]   I heard one guy talk about how he does it on his show.
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.640]   He doesn't have any formal advertisers.
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:39.640]   What he does is he recommends--he sells advertising, but he doesn't do it with the point of,
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.640]   "Okay, here, our sponsor of the day is blah, blah, blah."
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:45.640]   He uses it as product placement.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.640]   I thought, "Well, man, but are you disclosing that?"
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:53.640]   I just think let's raise our game as far as making sure that we have a clear business model
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:29:00.640]   that's going to work and that is fully ethical and has a high degree of integrity.
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.640]   I learned a lot, and I just was struck that I love learning.
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:06.640]   Really, to me, what's fun is learning.
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.640]   And so much--not fun.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:12.640]   What is fun is learning, not just doing things that are fun things to do.
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:17.640]   And it seems like in our lives we're just constantly distracted by fun.
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:21.640]   Learning is so cheap, and learning is fun in and of itself, so I really enjoyed that.
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:29.640]   Probably the biggest takeaway that I really appreciated was the closing keynote by Cliff Ravenscraft.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.640]   He runs a show called "The Podcast Answer Man."
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:34.640]   It's really an excellent podcast.
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.640]   He does a good job with it.
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:39.640]   He talked a little bit about something called "impostor syndrome."
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:48.640]   And the idea was basically that everyone is really--that there's this idea of imposter syndrome,
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:52.640]   which is I'm telling people something, but I feel like an imposter because I'm still scared
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.640]   and I don't really know what to do about it.
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:30:02.640]   And his takeaway was that just simply share where you are in the journey.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:08.640]   And it was a good reminder for me because my tendency, my personal tendency, is to want to be the expert,
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.640]   to want to sound like I know what I'm talking about.
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:14.640]   I remember when I first started as a financial advisor, this was a big problem for me,
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.640]   that I didn't want to sound stupid.
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:20.640]   And I always had this chip on my shoulder about my age when I started because I was 23 years old,
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:26.640]   and here I am in a meeting with somebody who was twice my age and had 80 times more money than I was.
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:30.640]   And I just--I think I would try to be more expert than I was.
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:37.640]   And just the freedom to simply be who you are, which is what I think podcasting can be and should be,
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:42.640]   is really--it's totally freeing.
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:46.640]   And I was reminded of just about how much of our life we spend trying to impress other people
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:50.640]   when in the reality is the way to impress other people is not to sound impressive,
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.640]   but to be impressed by them.
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:58.640]   And the way to get other people to like you is not to necessarily focus too much about how to be likable,
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.640]   but more to simply like other people.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:05.640]   And I thought, "What a great reminder to me just to be genuine."
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:10.640]   And I really work hard on this show to be genuine,
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:15.640]   and yet I recognize that it's so easy for me to get out of whack and try to be more expert than I am,
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.640]   try to come from a higher place of, "I'm the teacher.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:22.640]   I'm here to tell you how to do things," that I really don't mean to be.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:27.640]   There are some things that I'm an expert about, and it does nobody any good if I--
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.640]   I feel this--believe this strongly.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:34.640]   If you are very good at something, false modesty, the idea of, "Well, I'm not very good at it,"
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.640]   false modesty doesn't help anybody.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:41.640]   If you are an expert at something, you should share that you're an expert at something,
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.640]   and you should help people benefit by your expertise.
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:47.640]   But you can still do that in a humble way, and do it in a humble way
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:51.640]   without trying to necessarily sound too impressive.
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.640]   So I really appreciated that.
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:58.640]   I really appreciated that takeaway from the conference.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:01.640]   Things I didn't learn from the conference--I didn't learn how to create better content.
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:05.640]   These things are not insults. It's just I didn't learn it.
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:10.640]   I asked other people, but I'm very conscious and aware of the type of content I'm creating,
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:14.640]   and I feel like it's good, but I feel like it could be great,
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:18.640]   and I want to make it great, and I need to learn the skills to make it great.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.640]   I didn't learn how to create better content.
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:25.640]   I think there were a couple of talks on this topic, but I didn't go to them,
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:30.640]   so maybe when I listen to the audio from those sessions, I'll learn something from them.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:36.640]   But I was struck by how the technical side of podcasting--
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:42.640]   excuse me--or frankly, most industries is probably pretty simple and straightforward.
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:49.640]   And it may take you some time to master, but it doesn't take that long to get the basics.
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:54.640]   But the talent side of things, the ability to create really great content
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:59.640]   and to make it smooth and to make it flow and to make it coherent, that's challenging.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.640]   I didn't learn how to be a better interviewer.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.640]   I've been thinking about and just listening to some of my shows,
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:10.640]   and I've recognized that I have a lot to learn when it comes to interviewing.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.640]   I don't think I'm a very skilled interviewer,
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:15.640]   and I don't know how necessarily to become a better interviewer.
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:20.640]   I asked several people that had interviewed shows that seemed to be fairly well received
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.640]   just how to become a better interviewer,
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:28.640]   and I didn't get much help other than listen to great interviewers.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:31.640]   And that's good advice. I've taken it to heart.
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:34.640]   But I was struck how is it so difficult to teach something,
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:39.640]   and it's one of those things--maybe that's a niche that somebody who's really great could do,
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:45.640]   or if you know of any resources for how to be a better interviewer, I would love to know.
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:50.640]   And it's one of those things where I'm kind of just having to listen to myself
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.640]   and learn to trust myself.
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:56.640]   For example, I really--I was listening to--which TV show?
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:59.640]   I listened to some of the 60 Minutes things, for example,
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:02.640]   and the people who are interviewers on 60 Minutes,
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:07.640]   or I was listening to--who was it?--a Fresh Air--Terry Gross on Fresh Air, the NPR show.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.640]   She's renowned as being this great interviewer.
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:14.640]   And I was thinking, "How does she do it? How does she draw people out of their--
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:16.640]   how does she draw people out?"
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:21.640]   Now, and their approach is very much to draw the person that they're interviewing out
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:26.640]   and not say much themselves, not to express much of their own opinions.
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:28.640]   But when I listen to podcasts, I don't listen to those shows.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.640]   I don't listen to 60 Minutes. I don't listen to Terry Gross.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:32.640]   I find it really boring to me.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:40.640]   So I listen to podcasts, and one of the things--if I find a podcast that I really like
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:43.640]   and I find a host that I like, I'm interested in that host's opinions.
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:46.640]   So I don't care just to hear the guest.
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:50.640]   I'd like to hear a conversation between the guest and the host.
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:53.640]   Now, it seems that I'm wrong in that.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:59.640]   All the research I've done, all of the people who give advice about how to be a better interviewer
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:05.640]   simply say, "Insert less of yourself, put less of yourself into the show, and let your guest shine."
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:08.640]   But that's not my experience.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:13.640]   So it's one of those things where it's kind of unknown, so I'm testing it out.
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:18.640]   I feel like--I was listening to some of my interviews--I feel like sometimes I put too much of myself in
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:23.640]   and I should have pulled back, but then sometimes I feel like it really adds to the show.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.640]   So I'm learning.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:28.640]   I was also struck--I was trying to listen to--on the trip, even, while I was in the car,
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:36.640]   I was listening to some commercial broadcasters, and I learned something.
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:41.640]   I never--before I started this show, I didn't recognize how challenging it would be
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:47.640]   to put forth really compelling content every day.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:52.640]   And I knew it would be challenging, but I feel like it comes more easily to me than writing does.
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:56.640]   But I knew it would be challenging, but I didn't quite appreciate how challenging it was.
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:59.640]   So I started listening to some of the big shows.
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:06.640]   I was listening to--I found that Glenn Beck, the talk show host, puts his show on SoundCloud,
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:12.640]   and that enables me to listen to it on the phone without having to listen to any of his commercials.
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:18.640]   And that was interesting because what I learned is that it helped me feel a little bit better as a broadcaster
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:23.640]   that he does--his show is three hours long.
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:27.640]   He has two co-hosts, two producers--I don't know what their names are--that help him with the show,
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:30.640]   and he's got a massive team of people doing research.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.640]   And he's also doing a TV show, so I'll give him credit for that.
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:36.640]   But out of his three hours, when you take the commercials out,
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:44.640]   it's about an hour and 44 minutes of actual content that's actually him producing content.
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:48.640]   And then it's in the segments, and what's interesting is when you listen to the talk show
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:52.640]   and you take out the advertising segments,
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:56.640]   then what you find is that they're repeating themselves multiple times.
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.640]   And that makes a lot of sense to me.
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.640]   I never noticed it with talk radio.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:03.640]   I never noticed that they would repeat themselves throughout the segments.
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:06.640]   But now it makes sense because people tune in, they tune out, they tune in, they tune out,
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:09.640]   and when you have a four-, five-, or six-minute commercial break,
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.640]   you don't notice the person coming back and covering the same subject.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:18.640]   But when you listen to it without the commercial break, it's really obvious,
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:20.640]   and you think, "Wow, I never knew that before."
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:25.640]   So I was feeling a little bit--not exonerated--I was feeling a little bit justified
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:29.640]   at how challenging I found it to create really compelling content every day.
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:33.640]   And I'm going to keep going with it, but I felt a little bit better that,
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.640]   "Hey, if these guys can learn it, I can learn it."
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:39.640]   And I hope in the future to have more resources, to have help,
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.640]   to have to do fewer of the technical things
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:47.640]   so I can just focus purely on creating really great content.
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.640]   So those are some things I didn't learn that I look for.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:53.640]   Incidentally, I've been doing some reading, trying to do some reading
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:55.640]   on how to communicate better.
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:58.640]   If there are any people that you really enjoy listening to them,
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:02.640]   their interviewing style, or anybody that you really like,
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:06.640]   please send me an email--Joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com--
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.640]   or comment on today's show.
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:13.640]   And today is Episode 45, so it's radicalpersonalfinance.com/45.
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:16.640]   And I would love to know who some great interviewers are,
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:20.640]   because I'm trying to improve my own skills in that area,
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:24.640]   and I need some good examples of people that you like listening to.
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.640]   I would love that if you would help me with that information.
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:30.640]   Two last quick topics, and I'm done.
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.640]   So first of all, how to do a conference on the cheap,
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.640]   and then I'm going to give you some updates on the show
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.640]   as far as my personal plans.
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.640]   So how to do a conference on the cheap.
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.640]   This was kind of a fun experiment for me.
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:43.640]   I wanted to go to this conference, but I didn't really want to spend much money,
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:46.640]   so I thought, "Let me listen, let me practice what I preach
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:48.640]   and see how cheaply I can do this."
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:53.640]   So first, some integration of finance tips.
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:39:00.640]   It's really nice to be able to have fun and let it be a deductible expense.
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.640]   So this was purely a business conference for me,
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:05.640]   and the entire thing was a deductible expense for me.
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:09.640]   And I had a really great time, because my business is in an industry
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.640]   that I'm interested in, and I met some really fun people
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:16.640]   and had a really awesome time working on all business-related issues.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:20.640]   And so learn this lesson, because I feel this is a major lesson
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:25.640]   that we can learn that really will help to understand
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:28.640]   how to do a more holistic view of financial planning.
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:32.640]   A business is a way better tax deduction than is an IRA,
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.640]   each and every time.
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.640]   Now, they're different, of course, but the business is better,
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.640]   because you can have personal fun now and do it without any tax.
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:43.640]   Now, I went alone, so I didn't have to worry about the integration
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:47.640]   of my spouse or my son into my expenses.
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:51.640]   My expenses were fully deductible, and deductible under the rules.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:54.640]   I've kept good records, keeping good records of the show.
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.640]   I did some interesting things.
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:01.640]   I've done all these shows on--or I did, I think, two shows on living in your car,
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:03.640]   and I read a couple books on it recently.
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.640]   So I thought, "Let me try this out and see what it was."
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.640]   So I actually borrowed a Prius from a family member to drive out there.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:12.640]   Instead of driving my minivan, I borrowed a Prius to get better gas mileage.
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:16.640]   And I had read online about this lady who camps in her Prius,
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:17.640]   and I found this very interesting.
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:21.640]   I think it was on the Cheap RV Living website, I think, where I originally found it.
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:24.640]   And this is a middle-aged lady, and she didn't have much money, but she had a Prius.
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:29.640]   And so she set her Prius up where she goes on extended, several-month camping trips
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:32.640]   and spends the entire time in her Prius.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:34.640]   And the cool thing about the Prius is a couple of things.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:38.640]   You can put the back seat down, and the back seat is flat between the cargo area
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:40.640]   behind the back seat and the back seat.
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:44.640]   And then you can lean the front seat, the passenger seat--you could do both seats,
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:49.640]   but I just did the passenger seat--you can lean that completely flat as well.
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:54.640]   So you can have a completely flat bed, basically, which is maybe 8 to 10 feet long--
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:59.640]   probably 8 feet long--and that gives you a really nice place to sleep.
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:03.640]   And the cool thing about it is that you can put a mattress down,
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:07.640]   and you can have a nice, pretty, flat place--a very flat place to sleep.
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:09.640]   Full length, stretch out full length.
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:12.640]   And the nice thing about the Prius is, based upon the way the Prius works,
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:15.640]   you can leave the air conditioning on all night, and it will run on the battery.
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:18.640]   It will run the battery down, and then whenever the battery is run down,
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.640]   it will start the car automatically.
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:23.640]   It will charge the battery up, and then once the battery is charged,
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:27.640]   it will stop the car, and the car will cycle on and off all night long.
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:30.640]   And this is really great because it allows you to have an air-conditioned
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:37.640]   or a heated car without having to run the engine full time,
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.640]   and so it doesn't use much gas.
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:42.640]   So obviously you need to be careful with carbon monoxide.
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.640]   It would probably be a good idea if you're going to do this on an ongoing basis
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.640]   to have a carbon monoxide detector.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:49.640]   But it was just a cool thing, so I decided to try it out.
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:52.640]   And so I slept in the car on the way there and on the way back,
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:54.640]   and it worked awesome.
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.640]   It was really, really cool.
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:58.640]   It worked for a single person or maybe even for a couple.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:03.640]   That is the way to go--go in the Prius, and you can just camp out in the Prius.
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:06.640]   And I stayed at a truck stop one night and then a rest stop the next night,
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:08.640]   and it worked awesome.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:10.640]   It was cool just to be able to stay there.
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.640]   And, you know, I hate those roadside hotels.
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:15.640]   I've stayed at plenty of them where you stop and you spend $40 for a night,
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:20.640]   and the room is disgusting, and you don't really want to spend much time in the room,
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.640]   and you're basically just paying for a bed.
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.640]   Hey, if you've got a Prius, that's the way to go.
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.640]   And the AC thing worked so well.
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:30.640]   I was in Florida and Texas and Louisiana where it was still pretty warm,
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:34.640]   and that worked really well to have a tiny amount of gas used.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:36.640]   I mean, it may have been, what, half a gallon?
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:42.640]   It was just this tiny amount of gas to be able to have a nice, comfortable place to sleep
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.640]   and just pull in off the road.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:45.640]   So I went alone.
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.640]   It would be different, I guess, if you had multiple people.
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:52.640]   I think a couple would be fine, but it wouldn't be--if you had kids to integrate into that,
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:57.640]   I don't know, put them on the roof or something because it would probably get tight in there.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:59.640]   But I commend that to you.
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:00.640]   It was an awesome thing.
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:01.640]   I really enjoyed that.
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:04.640]   I tried to--how I did it on the cheap, I didn't spend much money.
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:10.640]   I mean, I spent--the show ticket cost about $200, I think, or the conference ticket.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:14.640]   And I drove, and I spent something like $250 on gas, getting there and back.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:16.640]   It was about 3,000 miles.
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:19.640]   And I spent maybe $100 on other expenses.
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:20.640]   I brought my own food.
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:22.640]   That was nice.
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.640]   I brought my own food for the way there.
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:25.640]   I ate out a little bit on the way back.
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:26.640]   I didn't have to do anything.
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:28.640]   I ate out a little on the way back.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:31.640]   And it just made me--man, I am sympathetic to truck drivers.
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:36.640]   I think I--it's tough to eat healthy when you're trying to stay on the road.
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:40.640]   And it's also tough to eat cheap if you don't have the food with you.
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:46.640]   And if I were a truck driver, I would need to do a lot of planning
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:49.640]   and make sure that I had a refrigerator and make sure that I had good options.
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:53.640]   Because what happens is I think, especially if you're driving alone like I was,
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:57.640]   you get in off the road and you just want--you crave some company.
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.640]   And you crave just being off the road.
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:03.640]   So even though I had healthy food with me and I didn't necessarily need to stop and eat,
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:06.640]   I still found that I wanted to stop and eat.
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.640]   So my hat goes off to truck drivers.
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.640]   And I would just encourage you, if you're a truck driver--hopefully you're listening to this--
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:17.640]   cut those expenses but plan ahead because it's tough to eat anything healthy at truck stops.
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:19.640]   And it's tough to eat anything inexpensive.
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:23.640]   Convenience food on the side of the road costs money and is not good for your waistline.
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:24.640]   I did stay with friends.
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:30.640]   And so I was struck by how a theme that we explored on a recent show--that there are many kinds of capital.
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:35.640]   And so I was able to stay with a friend that lives in Arlington, which is right out--
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:39.640]   a suburb of Dallas, I guess, but basically very connected, very close to the conference site.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:45.640]   And I was struck by how if you have social capital--friendships and the willingness of friends
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:50.640]   to let you crash on their couch--if you have social capital, then you don't need financial capital.
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:54.640]   I didn't need to spend the $180 a night at the fancy hotel.
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:55.640]   I just stayed with friends.
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.640]   And I think in so many areas of life we could do that.
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:00.640]   So I substituted on this trip--I didn't stay at any hotels.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:07.640]   I substituted social capital--staying with friends--and skills, I guess.
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:11.640]   I don't know what this would fall under--skills and the personal willingness to stay in a car--
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:16.640]   and saved, what, $600 I would have spent on hotels? Maybe more.
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:26.640]   So there are always ways to get around the need for money if you're willing to think of other more creative ways.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:30.640]   And I was so thrilled to spend the time driving.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:33.640]   I like driving. I like driving, especially if alone.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:35.640]   I would prefer to drive with somebody else.
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:41.640]   But the nice thing about driving alone is I find it just a really good time for me to learn.
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:43.640]   I learn so much on the car.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.640]   Time for me in the car is so valuable.
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:50.640]   I work from home now, and I don't get to spend much time in the car, which is good.
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.640]   I wouldn't trade that to go for a commute just for that.
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:57.640]   But it means there's a lot of things I want to listen to--a lot of podcasts, a lot of seminars, a lot of CDs, a lot of books--
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:01.640]   that I want to listen to that I don't often get a chance to listen to.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:03.640]   So on this trip I had an opportunity on the way there.
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:06.640]   I listened to a couple of seminars that I've been wanting to listen to.
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:09.640]   I listened to a couple of books that I've been wanting to read.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:16.640]   And on the way back I listened to a series of podcasts on the history of education--basically the history of the world.
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:18.640]   I'll point you to it if you're interested.
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:21.640]   There's an awesome thing that's called "The Ultimate History Lesson,"
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:26.640]   which is an interview with John Taylor Gatto about basically the history of the world.
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:28.640]   I think it's at theultimatehistorylesson.com.
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:32.640]   And I listened to that plus commentary on the Peace Revolution.
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.640]   Peace Revolution is an excellent podcast.
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:39.640]   If you want to be challenged with everything you've ever believed about life, go listen to the Peace Revolution.
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:45.640]   So I listened to episodes 41 through 45 on the way back, and each of those episodes is about four hours long.
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:49.640]   So it wound up being about 20 hours of audio that I wanted to listen to, and it was perfect.
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:54.640]   It fit perfectly, and the time driving from Texas to Florida, it was really great.
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:56.640]   So I learned so much.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:01.640]   And I was just struck by how in the adult world it seems like we never have time to learn.
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:07.640]   It's unusual sometimes to be able to unplug a little bit and spend time learning.
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:15.640]   Our society seems to think that the only time you should learn is when you're in high school or college,
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:17.640]   and then your learning is done.
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:20.640]   And we don't often schedule a day at home--I don't often--
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:24.640]   where I'm not going to do any of the things that need to be done because there's an endless list.
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:29.640]   So one thing I like about going away on a trip to a conference or something like that
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:33.640]   is it gives me time where I'm away from the house, so I can't do the normal things that are on my list,
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.640]   and I can learn.
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:38.640]   It was a really great experience.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.640]   I really enjoyed it.
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:44.640]   So let's wrap up with a couple of updates on the show, and then I'm done for the day.
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:54.640]   And I just wanted to share with you what I was learning, and tomorrow we'll get back to the primary financial topics.
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:58.640]   I was struck by how, at this conference, I was struck by how, in many ways,
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:00.640]   I'm kind of traveling down a lonely path with this show.
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:05.640]   I don't know anyone else doing really what I'm doing, and I think I'm okay with that.
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:12.640]   But it's kind of challenging because I've got a vision of what I think would be helpful,
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:17.640]   but it's a unique vision, and we'll see if it works.
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:22.640]   I think there's a desire for it, and like I've said many times,
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:25.640]   I'm basically just trying to create the kind of show that I would want to listen to.
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:34.640]   And so that's really my only guiding point, and I figure there's probably at least a few other people out there that are doing that.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:39.640]   And on the one hand, I was struck by being at this conference, how the majority of the feedback that I received was,
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:43.640]   "Well, it's not going to work. What I'm doing is not going to work,"
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:46.640]   or, "Ben, you're crazy, Joshua, for doing it," which is fine.
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:48.640]   I may be, and I may have to change something.
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:52.640]   But I also just am careful about who I was listening to the feedback from
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:56.640]   because the reality is that the medium of podcasting is very, very young.
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:03.640]   And so I thought about--I intentionally didn't record shows on Tuesday and Wednesday,
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:06.640]   and I was curious if anyone would miss the show.
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:09.640]   Now, the number one piece of feedback that I hear on this show,
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:12.640]   when I kind of look at the things that are written about the show,
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:18.640]   or the number one piece of feedback that I hear is that it's too much and it's too often.
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:22.640]   So my shows are too long and that they come out too frequently.
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:26.640]   I read a comment recently in a forum thread, and the comment was,
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:29.640]   "Who told this guy that he should do a daily show?"
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:31.640]   And I kind of chuckled because, well, no one told me,
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:34.640]   but that's the number one feedback that I hear on the show.
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:37.640]   And I always question, "Well, why is that?"
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:42.640]   And I want to be very transparent with you all and just kind of tell you what I'm thinking
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:44.640]   and what I'm hoping to do with the show.
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:48.640]   But I want to respond to that and just tell you that I hear the feedback,
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:53.640]   and I'm listening to it, I'm aware of it, but yet I'm also trying to accomplish something.
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:57.640]   So as far as the show being too long, I admit it is too long.
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:59.640]   And some of the shows have gotten out of hand.
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:01.640]   I was speaking with someone at the Podcast Movement Conference,
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:04.640]   and they referenced one episode I did, which was a very long episode.
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:06.640]   And they said, "Man, how did you do such a long episode?"
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:10.640]   And I said, "Well, I didn't know how to tighten it up."
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:15.640]   And I intentionally released some of the episodes that I'm not too proud of
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.640]   because I think, A, I do have a message.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:21.640]   If I'm going to record a show, it's because I do have a message for that show that I want to get out.
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:25.640]   And I may not yet be expert at getting that message across, but I still want to do it,
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:30.640]   if for nothing else than to encourage people that--
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:36.640]   and hopefully--I foresee this show being extremely successful and extremely popular in the long run,
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:43.640]   and I want to have my mistakes here at the beginning so that somebody can come back and be encouraged.
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:47.640]   I like to go--anytime I find a show or anytime I find a blog that I really like,
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:53.640]   I like to go back to the beginning and hear all of the beginning episodes.
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:58.640]   And it always encourages me when I hear somebody release something that is smooth
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:01.640]   and is polished and is beautiful, and I go back and listen to their first episodes
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:05.640]   and they stuttered and they said "um" and it was too short and it was too long
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:06.640]   and they screwed everything up.
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.640]   I get encouraged by that.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:11.640]   Maybe it's just me. I don't think it's just me, but maybe it's just me.
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:16.640]   But that encourages me because I say, "Well, if that person can learn that, then I can learn this."
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:19.640]   And I think in our world--so I'm doing it intentionally.
[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:25.640]   I'm releasing content that--frankly, some of it I wish it were better,
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:28.640]   I'm learning to make it better, but I'm releasing it intentionally
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:33.640]   because I want to encourage you and other listeners that anything worth doing
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:35.640]   is worth doing poorly at first.
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:39.640]   I can't remember who I attribute that quote to.
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:42.640]   I don't know who to attribute that quote to. I've heard a few people say it.
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:47.640]   So I apologize if I'm stealing your quote. I just can't remember who to attribute it to.
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:51.640]   But anything worth doing is worth doing poorly at first.
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:56.640]   And what happens is that in our world we have this idea that if I do something, I have to do it well.
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:00.640]   Now, I want to do things well, so don't mishear me.
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:02.640]   I want to do an excellent job.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:06.640]   But if something is worth doing, it's worth doing poorly at first.
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:08.640]   Think about whether it's learning to walk.
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:11.640]   How long would you expect--how long if you were a mother or father,
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:14.640]   and hopefully if you are or if you were,
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:20.640]   how long would you spend--how long would you be willing to give your one-year-old child
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:23.640]   to learn how to walk?
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:26.640]   You'd give them as much time as it takes, right?
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:29.640]   You wouldn't sit back and say, "Well, Johnny's only going to get two months,
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:32.640]   and if Johnny can't get perfect in two months, he's done for."
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:34.640]   No, you'd give it as long as it takes.
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:38.640]   And anything that people are good at, they started--they weren't good at it.
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:43.640]   And we've got this idea, I think, in our culture that somehow there's this natural talent and skill
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:46.640]   that explains all of somebody's success.
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:49.640]   Now, natural talent and skill, they do exist.
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:55.640]   And those things, as far as I can tell, it's not that natural talent and skill are not unimportant.
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:53:02.640]   However, persistency and tenacity and continuing is also very important.
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:08.640]   And we oftentimes, if we could go back and we could see the famous comic,
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:12.640]   if we could see--I guess Robin Williams--if we could go back and we could see his first times
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:15.640]   he tried to do stand-up comedy or tried to be funny,
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:18.640]   I guarantee you it was nowhere near as good as it was at the end of his life.
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:24.640]   Or Jerry Seinfeld. I guarantee you Jerry Seinfeld was booed off the stage at a comedy club at some point.
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:27.640]   But he learned. Every actor. You go back and you look at every great actor,
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:30.640]   you look at their earlier works and you find they probably weren't very good.
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.640]   They took acting classes at some time.
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:34.640]   Every great musician had to learn.
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:39.640]   And so I intentionally released some content that I wish were better.
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:45.640]   If for nothing else, then just to have it here as an encouragement to those who come along behind me
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:49.640]   that can say, "Look, here, Joshua learned."
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:52.640]   And I do that intentionally.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:58.640]   So I'm working on the link. I don't want anything to be longer than it needs to be.
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:04.640]   And last week I read several of my reviews and a couple of the reviews on iTunes say "rambling."
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:07.640]   And that was true. Those are accurate reviews.
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:11.640]   And so today, one of the things I'm really working on is trying to have a much tighter outline
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:15.640]   and go straight down my outline and not get distracted by rambling.
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:21.640]   Hopefully today was better and I intend to continue that because I really want to tighten up the show.
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:26.640]   So too long. But here's the flip side.
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:30.640]   One of the problems with our society, with certain topics,
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:36.640]   one of the problems with how we communicate is we try to communicate sometimes in too short of a format.
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.640]   And I'm tired of it.
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:43.640]   You cannot communicate an in-depth, important financial topic,
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:46.640]   or frankly on many things, in a four-minute sound bite.
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:51.640]   Now, a great master may be able to communicate a simple truth.
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:57.640]   And I think in many ways the mark of mastery is to be able to make the complex simple and short.
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:54:59.640]   So maybe I just need to learn to be a better teacher.
[00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:05.640]   But this is one of the things that just pisses me off about a lot of the radio content
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:15.640]   is that you cannot solve complicated financial topics in four minutes.
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:19.640]   Call-in radio is not the right format for financial advice.
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:22.640]   And what happens is a lot of times you think a subject is simple.
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:24.640]   And the only reason you think it's simple,
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:27.640]   and the only reason you think the short answer is appropriate,
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:30.640]   is because you don't know what the actual facts could be.
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:34.640]   And that's why I can't really listen to call-in financial shows anymore
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:36.640]   because I used to think, "Wow, this is right.
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:39.640]   Look, I can just put the whole answer in this three-minute thing
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:42.640]   and finish it up by the commercial break."
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:44.640]   But I'm telling you, you can't do it.
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:47.640]   It's not possible because what happens is it's sloppy.
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:48.640]   It's incredibly sloppy.
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:51.640]   And sometimes the answer is short and simple,
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:54.640]   and sometimes you need a couple hours to really dig into the details.
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:59.640]   And if we want to change this, we've got to enhance our attention spans.
[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:03.640]   If we want to improve our society, we've got to enhance our attention spans.
[00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:05.640]   And we've got to be willing to go deeper.
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:09.640]   One thing I so appreciate about the Peace Revolution podcast I've been listening to
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:13.640]   is that they don't pay any attention to length restrictions.
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:18.640]   They go as long as the show needs to be in order to get the point across.
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:21.640]   The longest show I've listened to them was one show was 19 hours,
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:24.640]   and that was how long the show needed to be to get the point across.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:28.640]   And we've got to enhance our attention span.
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:32.640]   And this idea that our entire society is run by 30-second sound bites is absurd.
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:35.640]   So part of this is my--I didn't mean to get that into it,
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:40.640]   but part of this is my issue with that is that finance is complicated sometimes,
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:48.640]   and I need to communicate clearly, but I'm not going to do this stuff a disservice.
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:51.640]   If something is worth knowing, it's worth understanding fully,
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:56.640]   and I can't explain something in depth in a short period of time.
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:57:02.640]   So I don't make any--so there's that--yeah, I apologize.
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:04.640]   I'm kind of bumbling with my point.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:10.640]   My point is--to sum up this point--is that the show needs to be long enough
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:14.640]   to get the point across and not one minute longer,
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:18.640]   and I need to develop and maintain those skills to get the point across
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:22.640]   in the minimum amount of time, but then also to be confident enough
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:25.640]   to get the point across in a long enough time.
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:29.640]   As far as the daily format, let me tell you why I'm doing the daily format,
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:31.640]   just so that you know.
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:34.640]   I mean, if you're listening at this point, then I want you to know
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:37.640]   why I think this format is a really good format.
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:41.640]   There's a reason why most of the major radio shows are on every day.
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:44.640]   Now, I don't claim to be the next Rush Limbaugh--
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:46.640]   I think he still has the most popular show--
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:49.640]   or the next Dave Ramsey or the next Glenn Beck.
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:51.640]   But there's a reason those shows are on every day,
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:54.640]   and I just figure there is a value for this,
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:58.640]   and I think the value of podcasting with a greater integration
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:04.640]   into cars, into houses with Bluetooth, and with mobile connectivity
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:08.640]   and everything--the value of podcasting is that there's no reason
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:13.640]   why we can't transition from broadcast radio to things distributed
[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:14.640]   over the Internet.
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:16.640]   For example, like I said, I was listening to Glenn Beck's show
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:17.640]   over the Internet.
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:21.640]   I don't listen to anything on the radio unless I don't have an Internet connection
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:24.640]   because a lot of times I want to listen to something that's not offered
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:25.640]   in my local area.
[00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:28.640]   And it just makes sense to me--I can't prove it--but it makes sense to me
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:33.640]   that if the radio guys can have a couple hours a day every day
[00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:37.640]   and have a large audience, then there's got to be an audience for podcasts.
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:41.640]   So I think we're committed in our content with podcasting--
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:45.640]   people expect, "Well, my podcaster's only going to produce one show a day,"
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:48.640]   but if it's good, if you like it, wouldn't you like more content?
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:50.640]   So I don't know if I'm right about that or wrong.
[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:53.640]   I may change and go to once a week or four times a week or two times a week.
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:54.640]   I don't know.
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:57.640]   But I was curious if anyone would miss the show, and it warmed my heart.
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:00.640]   Thank you, Nick, for shooting me a note this morning and saying,
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:02.640]   "Hey, where's the show?"
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:06.640]   And I was wondering if anyone listening--because the challenge of being a podcaster
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:07.640]   is you don't get a ton of feedback.
[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:10.640]   You've kind of got to go on faith and trust yourself.
[00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:14.640]   But I wrote him back, and I said, "Nick, thanks so much for writing me a note.
[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:16.640]   I wondered if anyone would miss the show."
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:17.640]   So thank you so much.
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:18.640]   I appreciate that.
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:20.640]   It really means a lot to me.
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:23.640]   And I really would like this show to be a daily show,
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:28.640]   and I really would like to provide the content for someone to tune into every day
[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:31.640]   on their morning commute and get something thought-provoking.
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:33.640]   Now, I don't want to just repeat myself every day.
[00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:35.640]   I want each show to be different and unique.
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:40.640]   And hopefully the format that I've chosen--and that's why I chose the format that I have--
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:45.640]   hopefully the format that I've chosen is conducive to good content.
[00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:51.640]   Hopefully the--for example, I could easily start five podcasts.
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:52.640]   One could be a Q&A.
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:56.640]   One could be talking about in-depth financial planning, the technical side.
[00:59:56.640 --> 01:00:00.640]   One could be about the non-technical sides of financial planning,
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:04.640]   the behavioral stuff, the PF stuff, personal finance stuff, that kind of thing.
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:07.640]   One could be listener questions.
[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:08.640]   One could be current events.
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:11.640]   But my thought is that you just pick and choose.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:15.640]   I expect some people to tune in because they're interested in the CFP curriculum,
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:20.640]   which is kind of my general guiding line for the financial planning topic.
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:24.640]   Some people may tune in because they're interested in the listener Q&A.
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:29.640]   So I hope that there's enough variety that you can pick and choose what you are--
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:31.640]   what you're interested in doing.
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:36.640]   And the other thing--the other reason why I'm doing daily--
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:41.640]   I really want to be able to do this show as my primary source of income.
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:46.640]   And I don't know exactly what the path to that is going to be,
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:50.640]   but it just seems to make sense to me that if other people can make--
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:52.640]   if other people can make money on broadcasting
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:54.640]   and make enough to support themselves,
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:01:00.640]   I feel like my greatest skill in life is the ability to assimilate complex information
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:04.640]   and convey it to other people in an interesting way that is actionable.
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:08.640]   Now, I recognize that skill may be immature,
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.640]   but I feel like that's my greatest skill,
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:14.640]   is to be able--again, to be able to absorb complex information
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:18.640]   and focus on what actually matters and weed out the junk.
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:23.640]   And so my hope is that people who value that can find it.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:26.640]   And so it just seems to me that if a daily show--
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:31.640]   if I'm committed to doing a daily show that has a much higher degree of stickiness
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:34.640]   and a much higher degree of the ability to give a lot of information,
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:37.640]   and I can give a lot of value to the marketplace,
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:39.640]   I can give a lot of value to you,
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:44.640]   and then at some point in time I'll be able to gain some financial compensation for that,
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:47.640]   which will allow me to not have to spend so much time
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:50.640]   on some of the other activities that take up most of my day.
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:54.640]   And this is just very much a test of the market.
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:57.640]   This show--it's a hobby for me,
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:00.640]   and I think there's a place for me to continue doing it as a hobby,
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:04.640]   but I certainly couldn't do it on an everyday basis if it were just a hobby.
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:07.640]   Profits and losses is how--
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:10.640]   Profits and loss is how, in a capitalistic system,
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:13.640]   we find out what the market values.
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:16.640]   And so I have to be able to create profits off of this show
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:22.640]   for me to continue to dedicate the five hours a day that I spend working on it.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:27.640]   And I've got some plans for it, but more than anything,
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:29.640]   I was just struck coming away from this show
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:32.640]   by the value of the Podcast Movement Conference,
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.640]   by the value of community.
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:37.640]   And I've struggled to clearly say what this show is about
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:39.640]   because I want it to be about so many things.
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:42.640]   And I've spent a lot of time kind of writing ideas down,
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:46.640]   and I think I'm gaining a much greater sense of clarity about my goals for the show.
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:50.640]   And the key is to help people free themselves.
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:56.640]   To me, I see, in some ways, every aspect of life as fully integrated.
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:00.640]   And I see--I've done a lot of research on the schooling system--
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:03.640]   I won't even say education system--on the schooling system.
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:06.640]   And it helped me so much to listen to that seminar
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:11.640]   that I listened to at the Ultimate History Lesson with John Gatto
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:18.640]   because it helps things to come into clarity for me.
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:26.640]   And our lives are conditioned in so many ways toward a sense of slavery,
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:30.640]   but it's a very gentle slavery, a wage slavery.
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:33.640]   And I'm going to do some shows on this because--
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:36.640]   I plan a separate show on this. I won't go into it in detail.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:43.640]   But many of us are trapped in a system that we didn't design.
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:48.640]   We're trapped in a system that we kind of accepted without knowing the terms of the system.
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:51.640]   And I see ways to get free of it.
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:56.640]   And money involves--every single goal that any of us has involves money to some degree.
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:03.640]   And if we can solve this money problem, we can gain a degree of freedom for ourselves.
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:08.640]   And my show is dedicated to helping--
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:15.640]   is dedicated to my learning and being able to clearly articulate the path to freedom
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:19.640]   and taking as many people as possible with me.
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:24.640]   And this antiquated financial system of put 10% of your money into an IRA,
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:29.640]   buy a bunch of mutual funds, and life is going to be great is a bunch of crap.
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:33.640]   It doesn't work. I did it for six years, and I'm just frustrated.
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:36.640]   I was frustrated by how it simply doesn't work.
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:41.640]   And again, not that it can't work, but that it doesn't work.
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:45.640]   And all the stuff that we read and all the stuff that we learn and all the stuff that we learn about,
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:51.640]   it's nuts because it sounds good, but the reality is that there's many people--
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:57.640]   not all, but many people--who are just miserable in that system.
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:02.640]   And we can get out of the system, but we have to see various ways out of it.
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:06.640]   And I see dozens and dozens and dozens of ways out of it.
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:13.640]   But there is a full integration between the technical side of financial planning,
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:18.640]   the behavioral side of financial planning, and every other aspect of life.
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.640]   And that's what this show is about.
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:24.640]   If you want to show--and by the way, I'm not angry about anything.
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:27.640]   I'm just trying to--and maybe I shouldn't say "you" because if you're listening to this point still
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:31.640]   and this show, we're an hour in--I thought it was going to be shorter.
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:35.640]   If we're an hour in and you're listening to the show, then maybe you get it.
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:43.640]   But if you want a show that just simply says, "Hey, here's how you allocate a retirement portfolio,
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:49.640]   and I'll give you five options, and you can do 60/40 or 40/60 or 80/20 or 20/80,"
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:50.640]   there's plenty of that out there.
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:56.640]   Just go--shoot--turn on MS or CNBC or whatever, and you get plenty of that.
[01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:59.640]   But I'm telling you, it doesn't matter.
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:03.640]   It does matter in a sense, and I'll teach you through all of that.
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:07.640]   But I'm so uninterested in that because the difference in your life
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:13.640]   between a 60/40 stocks and bonds allocation and a 40/60 allocation,
[01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:17.640]   the difference in your life between that decision is incredibly minute.
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:20.640]   Now, over the course of a 30-year period of time, does it make a difference?
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:21.640]   Absolutely it does.
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:25.640]   But over the course of the next three days, it makes no difference.
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:28.640]   And the point is that the next three days, this is the only life that you have.
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.640]   This is the only life that I have.
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:34.640]   I'm not getting any younger, and I'm not going to sit around
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:39.640]   and spend the best 30 years of my life, the best 40 years of my life,
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:41.640]   in order to support a tax system I disagree with,
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:44.640]   fund a bunch of crap all around the world that I don't want to fund,
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:47.640]   spend a bunch of time making a bunch of other people rich,
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:49.640]   and in the meantime, not be present with my family,
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:51.640]   not live the life that I want to live.
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:54.640]   I'm sorry. I may die tomorrow.
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:59.640]   And I'm not willing to get all emotional on you.
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:02.640]   I'm not going to my grave with my music still in me.
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:04.640]   What a waste.
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:08.640]   And the financial stuff is not the limiting factor on it.
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:11.640]   The limiting factor is our conditioning, is our brain,
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:14.640]   is how we think, is how we view the world.
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:19.640]   And I'm going to figure out the paths that work,
[01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:21.640]   and I'm going to take people with me.
[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:24.640]   And even if it's--again, if it's--how exciting.
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:28.640]   I had some conversations with a couple people
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:32.640]   at the Podcast Movement Conference, and I just came away thinking,
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:35.640]   how exciting to just spend time with these few people
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:39.640]   who are setting themselves free to live the life that they want to live.
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:41.640]   And everything matters.
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:44.640]   So in one way, I care about the numbers, but in the other way, I don't.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:46.640]   I just care about you.
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:49.640]   And I'd rather have 10 people, a community of 10 people,
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:52.640]   going on this path and actually taking action
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:56.640]   than have a massive podcast of 300,000 listeners
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:59.640]   that I can pimp a bunch of stuff for people who save me money
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:01.640]   and make $100,000 a month.
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:07.640]   Who cares about that if my show is not actually accomplishing something?
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:10.640]   So I guess that's the message.
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:12.640]   That's the message that this show is about.
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:17.640]   It's about discovering ways for you to free--for me to free myself
[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:22.640]   and for you to free yourself to live the life that you want to live.
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:25.640]   And not in the stupid, you know, buy a million-dollar house.
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.640]   If you want to buy a million-dollar house, go buy one.
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:28.640]   You know, that's fine.
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.640]   But live the life that you really want to live
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:33.640]   and see through the materialism and see through the consumerism
[01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:38.640]   and see through the crap that people have told you is supposed to be your goals.
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:41.640]   I'm sure Mercedes-Benz are great cars, but I'm not going to buy one
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:45.640]   just because they put a bow on it and put a Christmas commercial.
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:47.640]   It's a bunch of nonsense.
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:49.640]   We only get one life.
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:57.640]   And there ain't no U-Haul trucks driving behind the hearse, as they say.
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:01.640]   We only get one life.
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:04.640]   And I'm a day older than I was yesterday.
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.640]   And I'm older now than I've ever been before.
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:11.640]   And guess what? You're older now than you've ever been before.
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:15.640]   And I'm not going to sit around and wait on this financial system
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:23.640]   that expects me to sell my soul into slavery for decades.
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:27.640]   Now, that doesn't necessarily mean I'm not willing to work for somebody.
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:28.640]   I am.
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:31.640]   It doesn't necessarily mean that everybody needs to be entrepreneurs.
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:32.640]   They don't.
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:35.640]   It doesn't necessarily mean that everybody needs to be financially independent
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:36.640]   and sit on the beach.
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:39.640]   We don't.
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:42.640]   But we do need to make sure that what we're doing every day
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:49.640]   is in line with our values and the life that we've designed for ourselves.
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:51.640]   And that's what this show's about.
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:55.640]   So I hope that it can continue to be a useful resource for you.
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:57.640]   I am inspired.
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:00.640]   And in many ways, it doesn't have much to do with necessarily
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:03.640]   any one specific thing that I heard at the conference
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:05.640]   or any one specific thing.
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:08.640]   It just--probably more than anything,
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:11.640]   I was inspired by some of the people that I met.
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:13.640]   When you see people living life on their own terms
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:17.640]   and choosing to live life on their terms, that's exciting.
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:20.640]   Don't waste your life.
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:22.640]   We only got one of them, and it's so easy.
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:25.640]   We hear that so much in today's world.
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:28.640]   We hear that so much with the motivational speaker.
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:30.640]   It's almost become a cliche.
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:37.640]   But the reality is you get one life, and I ain't wasting mine.
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:39.640]   So that's my show for today.
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:42.640]   I hope that you found something useful.
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:44.640]   You found some useful nugget.
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:46.640]   I want to thank you for listening.
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:48.640]   It's so thrilling.
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:52.640]   Every piece of feedback I get, every email that I get, it's so thrilling.
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:54.640]   And I want to be direct.
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:56.640]   I do not have all the answers.
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:59.640]   Have a few, and I'm going to give you everything I got,
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:02.640]   and then together we can find out some of the other answers.
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:04.640]   Had a listener email me last week and say,
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:06.640]   "Joshua, you're doing an awesome show,
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:11.640]   and I want to be on it because I think I got something to contribute."
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:12.640]   And it was awesome.
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.640]   I'm going to be interviewing him soon.
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:15.640]   I'll bring him to you soon.
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:17.640]   If that's you, if you've got something to contribute,
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:20.640]   if you're listening to this topic, if you're thinking about this stuff,
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:21.640]   email me.
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:22.640]   I'll have you on the show.
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:24.640]   We're not going to create the same old, same old,
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:28.640]   where I go out and interview the people that are the podcast circuit people
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:31.640]   where you can hear everywhere else.
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:34.640]   Let's figure out together the stuff that works.
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:40.640]   And if you've got ideas about ways that you've become more free,
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:41.640]   bring them on.
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:43.640]   Bring them to the audience.
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:46.640]   So I appreciate you listening.
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:48.640]   That's it for today's show.
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:49.640]   I hope that you've enjoyed it.

[01:11:57.640 --> 01:11:59.640]   the number one way that would be helpful to me,
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:01.640]   please leave a review on the show.
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:03.640]   That is super, super useful.
