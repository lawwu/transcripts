[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   I'm 30 years old and I feel like I should have my life together by now.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.320]   I don't like my career.
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.840]   I'm not healthy and I'm constantly stressed about money.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.040]   Do you have any advice or simple actions I can implement in my life on a daily basis
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.680]   to make progress and head in a positive direction?
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.760]   Well, so the reason why I included this question in today's episode, which is really about
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.400]   our relationship with technology, is that I'm making the guess that the first obstacle
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:34.240]   to clear on the path away from the shallows in which Adam is mired and towards a deeper
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:41.520]   life, the first obstacle to clear away here is probably a harmful relationship with technology.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.080]   So for people of this age, you're in your 20s, you're in your 30s and you feel stuck,
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.040]   often one of the things that is keeping you stuck is these tools, is what's coming in
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.360]   over your phone and what's coming in over your smart TV.
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.280]   The reason why it keeps it stuck is because these tools are optimized to scratch the itches
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.280]   that are core to our humanity.
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.280]   We want to connect to other people.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.560]   We want to have efficacy.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.720]   We want to do things that are recognized.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.640]   We want to have standing in our community.
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.400]   We want to be inspired by beauty and on craftsmanship.
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.800]   All of these are deep human instincts that are wired to push our lives in more productive,
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.040]   deeper directions.
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.760]   But there's apps on your phone and on your tablet and on your smart TV that can satisfy
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.160]   those urges just enough to keep you satisfied.
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.760]   Okay, I guess I'm okay to keep you stuck in your status quo.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.200]   You're texting and on social media enough that you feel like, well, I'm not literally
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.200]   alone.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.480]   I'm talking to people.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.920]   So you consider that it's scratched.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.960]   You're making progress in a video game and that's just enough of scratching that itch.
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.560]   If I want to make something of myself and be recognized by my community that you're
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.080]   not forced to get up and do something.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.880]   You're yelling at people on Twitter.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.240]   You have a tribe on there.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.000]   We're yelling at the libs or we're yelling at the MAGA crowd.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.360]   That kind of scratches barely this itch of like, I want to be involved in something bigger
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.600]   than me that matters.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.400]   The itches are scratched just enough that you stay on the couch and you stay stressed
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.280]   and you stay like your life isn't put together and like nothing is happening.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.280]   This is the danger of these tools is that they prevent us.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.760]   They prevent us from getting fed up enough to actually make changes.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.720]   So this is why I want to say, let's start.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.720]   Let's start with reevaluating your relationship with technology.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.120]   And this is where I want you to do something like we've been talking about, like zero based
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.000]   technology budgeting.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.680]   Get all this stuff out of your life.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.360]   Take a 30 day break from all of these optional tools.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.640]   No video games, no social media, no YouTube, no streaming.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.960]   Spend those 30 days aggressively self-reflecting and experimenting with analog activities that
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.440]   are meaningful to you.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.520]   Figure out what's going on with your life.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.520]   Face and confront.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.840]   This is Nietzsche looking into the abyss, what you're not happy about in your life,
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.000]   why?
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.440]   And then move past this to self-author what you want your life to look like in five years.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.520]   So you have clarity about what you dislike now.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.320]   You have clarity about what you would love in your life going forward.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.280]   You have clarity through your experimentation of what really is important or meaningful
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.640]   to you, what you really enjoy and what you don't.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.880]   And then rebuild your technological life from scratch.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.200]   Everything has to earn its way in for a particular purpose.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.320]   I care about this.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.800]   What's the right way to use technology to do this?
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.840]   I care about that.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.040]   What's the right way to use technology to do that?
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.560]   When you do the zero based budgeting, most of this stuff that's gunking up your life,
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.040]   Adam, that's keeping you quiescent, that's keeping you just satisfied enough that you
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.840]   don't get off the couch is going to be gone.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.680]   If you recognize, hey, I'm 30, I'm 30 and a man and I want to stand up and be a useful
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.000]   member of society and respected by my community.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.560]   When you know that's really valuable to you and you know that there's some self-incrimination
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.360]   about you not doing that and you're trying to build up from scratch, well, what technology
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.560]   can help me do that?
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.720]   You're not going to answer if you're being honest, well, I just want to make it to the
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.840]   next level in World of Warcraft or whatever.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.640]   No, you're saying, no, no, okay, I need to actually do something here that's going to
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.640]   be meaningful.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.000]   Can technology help me?
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.360]   Maybe it can help me find a group and connect to a group where I can then go in real life
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.560]   and join that group and make progress.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.320]   So it's going to completely reinvent your relationship with technology.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:22.080]   So instead of it keeping you pacified, it instead becomes a tool you deploy in the construction
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.080]   of a deeper life.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.460]   All right, so once you've done that, once you've cleared out the technological pacification,
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.600]   now we can work our way through what I call the deep life stack.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.480]   You can work your way through the layers of the deep life stack on your way towards a
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.640]   deeper life.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.420]   We talk about this a lot, so I'll move quickly, but you would start then with habits and discipline.
[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.480]   So pick a couple of areas of your life you've identified as being important and have a daily
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.480]   discipline that you follow, a habit you follow every day.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.600]   It should be tractable but non-trivial.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.200]   This is all about just telling yourself the story of I can do things that are important
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.240]   even if I don't have to.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.880]   I can make progress on parts of my life I care about because I think it's important
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.360]   in the long term even though I don't want to do it in the short term.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.440]   As part of that discipline stack, also start tracking in a central place.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.920]   Here's the systems and habits and disciplines I follow.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.000]   That thing is going to grow.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.800]   That document will grow as you make your way through the stack.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.080]   Then you move up to the values layer of the stack.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.320]   Now you really clarify and codify what you learned during your technology zero-based
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.800]   budgeting exercise.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.800]   What am I all about?
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.160]   You need to have a code.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.920]   This is what I'm about.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.200]   This code is not just here's things I care about.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:41.360]   It has to be a psychological/philosophical game plan not just for how do I excel but
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.080]   how do I make it through the hard parts.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.000]   What's important to me and what's going to pull me forward through the parts that
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.280]   are really hard especially early on when I feel like nothing's going right.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.640]   The code should tell you what am I going to do when things are going really well and how
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.560]   I'm going to live up to that.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.480]   You want to have your first draft of this code.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.920]   If you're from a religious background you're going to find a lot of useful work there.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.400]   If you're not you can find a lot of good useful work in philosophy.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.080]   But you want to be really clear about what you're writing down here and don't worry
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.080]   about getting it right.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.080]   That can evolve.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.480]   Then you move your way up to the control layer of the stack.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.920]   It is now and only now Adam that you start to get organized, get the messy parts of your
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:23.100]   life together, get your finances in order, get your fitness in order, get your productivity
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.720]   systems running so you're not just all over the place, get your act together and work,
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:33.240]   build up that career capital so people start seeing you Adam as this guy gets it done.
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.920]   He does it when he says he's going to do it and he does it at a high level.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.920]   Why do you do that?
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.440]   Because that's going to give you leverage to start shaping your career towards what
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.960]   matters to you.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.080]   But remember we're not getting our act together.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.200]   We're four steps in here.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.640]   We've already started clearing out the technological pacification.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.940]   We've done discipline.
[00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.760]   We've done values.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.440]   Only now do we have the foundation we need to actually power through the difficulty of
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.440]   organizing our lives.
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.000]   Then you get to the final layer of the deep life stack is where you're going to have
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.560]   vision.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.280]   You begin planning to make your life more remarkable.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.960]   The first time you go through this, you'll choose one area of your life and say, "How
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.880]   am I going to make that area of my life more remarkable?"
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.480]   Maybe it's a professional thing or maybe it's a fitness thing.
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:26.220]   I'm going to become incredible shape and become a Cameron Haynes style, deep back country
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:31.680]   bow elk hunter that's going to require me to train marathons daily or whatever it is.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.280]   Maybe it's an intellectual pursuit.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.480]   You're going to take one part of your life and make it remarkable.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.720]   This is going to take you about a year and you're going to be so much better at this
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.080]   point Adam.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.720]   Then you just keep revisiting this.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.160]   "Hey, as technology creeped back into my life in an unhealthy way, let me re-clarify
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.520]   in zero-based budget, work your way up the stack."
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.520]   Do that once a year.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.720]   Adam, you're like a year away from your life being a lot better.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.360]   You're five years away from your life being something that people remark about.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.200]   I have complete faith in that.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:05.040]   But this is the new thing I'm adding now because I've realized this listening to you, my listeners.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.840]   You have to think about the technology use like the same way you would think about perhaps
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.760]   an alcohol or drug problem if you were pursuing a deep life.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:18.040]   Until you solve that, you're going to have a lot of trouble with all the other things.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.200]   You want to start with getting that technology monkey off your back and then we can work
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.200]   our way through the deep life stack.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.640]   All right, I think we have time for one more question, Jesse.
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.920]   Yeah, we got one more question from Julie.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.720]   "How can I stay on top of current events while still living deep?
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:38.400]   It's so easy to get sucked into social media scrolling, but what about the news?"
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:46.520]   Well, Julie, I'm assuming you're not a network television news director.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:54.280]   You're not someone who is sitting backstage at the NBC nightly news panning cameras and
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.820]   telling producers to go after stories.
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.560]   You're not a news director, so you can chill out about the news.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.520]   You don't need to know everything that's going on.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.000]   You're not even really learning everything that's going on in social media.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.040]   You're getting a bunch of takes on things that are going on.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.200]   So my first thing I'm going to say is just chill out about feeling like you have to be
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.200]   up on everything.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.660]   You're not a news director.
[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:16.660]   So what should you do instead?
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:21.060]   Just have a much more minimalist news consumption ritual.
[00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.800]   Take a weekly newspaper or even easier, go to Starbucks on Sunday.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.380]   They sell the newspapers there, buy the Sunday paper, read it for an hour.
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:33.080]   That alone, you will be just as informed as you are now with a lot less stress.
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:40.160]   Now, if you don't want to do that, there are news digest emails that you can get from newspapers
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.160]   with a digital subscription.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.740]   There's news roundup podcasts that are both daily and weekly.
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:47.520]   Listen to some of those.
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.200]   Put on NPR when you commute to work and listen to morning edition.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.200]   They'll cut.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.200]   There's a major story going on.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.160]   You know, there's an earthquake somewhere or something's on fire.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:00.360]   They'll tell you about it and that's enough and you know enough.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:05.160]   Now I know this might sound radical, but let me tell you, uh, if we go back, what's this
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.800]   2000, if we go back about 10 years, let me tell you who did adopt this approach.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:14.760]   The news consumption, everybody everywhere, because it was the only way to do it.
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.240]   There wasn't social media and you know what?
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.240]   People were fine.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:22.680]   This idea that in 2009 people just stumbled around blindly.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.040]   Like I don't know what's going on.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.440]   Like who's the president really?
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.440]   That guy.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.440]   All right.
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.440]   I mean, okay.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.440]   What's going on?
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.440]   Who, who, who died?
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.440]   Okay.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.520]   Hey, I didn't know there was no place I could go where, uh, strangers were yelling at each
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.520]   other about the news.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.880]   So how would I possibly know what was going on in the world?
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:45.120]   Somehow people knew what was going on in the world 10 years ago, even without social media
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.920]   services they could look at all the time.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:51.240]   So just go back and tap into that 2009, 2008 version of yourself.
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.520]   You'll be perfectly informed, but I'm glad you bring it up, Julie, because this is one
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.120]   of the last traps.
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.400]   I think people that have a pretty good relationship with technology, one of the last traps.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.240]   It still snags them as this news thing.
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.240]   It really is.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.320]   Uh, I think it's a storyline of the services themselves.
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.320]   You gotta be connected.
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.680]   You gotta know what's going on.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.000]   This is where everything's happening.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.720]   It's not, there's plenty of ways to get enough news without having to be staring at your
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.960]   phone all day.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.400]   Hey, if you liked this video, I think you'll really like this one as well.
