[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.740]   How do you think about the strategy of going through Amex membership rewards cards or Mr as you've been saying, or all their airline hotel cards,
[00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:21.720]   I would do the other cards first, just because they have so many other rules around it. So there's something called the four or five, six rule. So for their credit cards, you can only have four or five or six of them. Their Mr cards don't have that rule.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:36.400]   So you can actually get as many of them as you want at any time. So you generally want to start at the credit cards first, because that just makes more sense, like to start those clocks, because that's going to be like your bottleneck. Okay, and that's all the Marriott Hilton.
