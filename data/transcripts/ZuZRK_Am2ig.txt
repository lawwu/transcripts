[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520]   What is the balance for you in terms of structure and lack of structure?
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.080]   And I'm not going to ask for your daily routine.
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.720]   We know that you get up early, you train.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.320]   But I do have some specific questions that I think would be helpful in putting some meat
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.320]   on the kind of the notions about you.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.660]   And again, this isn't to pick into your life, but more to grab, well, it's to pick into
[00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.660]   your life.
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.960]   The, so a question I asked you in the lobby, because it's one that, you know, having seen
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.480]   your content for a long time and really benefited from it.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.280]   I was curious, you get up early at about 4.30, you train every morning.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.480]   How long do you train for?
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.480]   And is there any global structure to that?
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.760]   And of course everyone needs different programs, but do you, is it like weight training one
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.560]   day, cardio training the next day?
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.560]   Are you combining them?
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.560]   Is it always an hour?
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.560]   Is it always half an hour?
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.360]   I think people would benefit from getting a little bit more understanding of what that
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.000]   looks like for you with the caveat that everyone has different needs, levels of, you know,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   background, et cetera.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.520]   I'm intensely curious about this and I'm certain I'm not the only one.
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.520]   So do you want to talk about weightlifting or rock and roll on the guitar?
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.640]   I want to talk about, um, let's you're, let's talk about the most structured first part
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.640]   of your day.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.840]   And then let's talk about the least structured part of your day, at least the part that you
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.040]   can share with the, with the world.
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.040]   Yeah.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.640]   Uh, waking up early and I'm going to work out and depending on what's going on that
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.240]   day, if I have an early flight, I might work out for eight minutes, right?
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.360]   I might go in and do 2000 meters on the roller, get, get a sweat going hard as I can.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.360]   And then I'm done.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.640]   And cause I got to go catch a flight.
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.980]   So that could be happening.
[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.200]   Maybe I'm supposed to go surfing in the morning.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.120]   I wake up, the waves are terrible.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.640]   And so now I've got nothing to do.
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.040]   I've planned out, you know, to be surfing for two or three hours and now I'm not going
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.040]   to go surfing.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.400]   So I'm going to go, I'm going to go lift and I'm going to go play in the gym and do a bunch
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.400]   of stuff.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.680]   I'm gonna spend two or three hours in there.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.700]   I love doing that.
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.960]   So the workout could be anywhere between what I just say eight minutes and three hours and
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.680]   it could be anything in between.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.140]   I fully enjoy the, the physical aspect of working out.
[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.600]   So if I have more time to spend in the gym, I'll spend it.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.000]   I remember my dad saying at one point, if I retired, I wouldn't know what to do.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.400]   And I, I was thinking to myself, are you serious right now?
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.900]   You know, if I didn't have anything to do, I'd spend six hours a day in the gym.
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.000]   That's been four hours doing jujitsu.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.260]   Like I could fill my day.
[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.720]   I could fill every day with just physical activity, things that I just like doing.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.920]   But that's so wake up early, get a sweat going and do I lift?
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.920]   Yes.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.920]   Do I do cardio?
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.920]   Yes.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.920]   Do I run?
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.920]   Yes.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.920]   Do I sprint?
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.920]   Yes.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.920]   Do I lift heavyweights?
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.920]   Yes.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.920]   Do I swing kettlebells?
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.920]   Yes.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.440]   I, I do everything and, and anything and I enjoy all of it and I'm not really good at
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.440]   any of it.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.520]   You know, I'm not, I'm not really good at any one aspect of physical activity.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.960]   I, I'm, there's people that are infinitely better at me in every aspect of, and I'm not
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.880]   just talking about, oh, this guy's a world-class limp.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.880]   No, there's like a guy named Fred down at the gym that can deadlift more than me.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.160]   There was a guy when I was at SEAL team two, there was a guy who was probably five, seven
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.680]   and he looked kind of chubby and he was older than me and he could run faster than me and
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.680]   he could bench more than me.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.680]   Those guys that were out there.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.680]   It was just so bothersome.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.680]   They're out there.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.960]   They, they, they got some engine in there related to something.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.280]   I mean, I do think there are genetic differences in terms of people's resilience and workout,
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.400]   but even just grip strength is highly, highly subjected to like genetic influences, maximum
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.400]   grip strength.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.760]   But of course there's a huge range in what people can develop, but I guarantee your grip
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.280]   strength is, is greater than mine.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.280]   People ask me this all the time.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.640]   Who would win in arm wrestling between you and Jocko?
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.640]   My Jocko.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.640]   Who would win in jiu-jitsu?
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.640]   Jocko.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.080]   You know, there's a lot of technique in arm wrestling.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.360]   I have to imagine they're putting their body behind it.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.360]   They're putting their back in.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.360]   It's not just that.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.480]   Like there is legitimate technique in arm wrestling.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.880]   There's hope for me yet.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.880]   Yeah.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.440]   There's, no, like if we could bring a female arm wrestler in here that knows how to arm
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.640]   wrestle, because I don't know how to arm wrestle either.
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.800]   And she would be both of us because there's a lot of, there's a lot more technique in
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.920]   arm wrestling than you know.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.360]   Then most people recognize there's all these little games that are going on.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.760]   There's all this little arm position that you get.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.480]   So just like everything else, it's technique.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.040]   There's a lot of technique in arm wrestling.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.040]   That's good to know.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.040]   I didn't know that about arm wrestling.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.960]   I think we all start off with some genetic predispositions, both good and bad for different
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.960]   things.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.520]   And then there's, as far as we know, there's a huge range based through neuroplasticity
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.360]   and muscle adaptation, et cetera, in what we can obtain.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.600]   So I never want genetic predisposition to serve as a barrier.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.000]   No one knows also what the upper limits of any of these things are.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.600]   And some of the best examples we know from sport and certainly from academia are people
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.800]   who knew they were at a disadvantage and just worked 10 times harder than everybody else
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.600]   because they had an ax to grind with their genetic disadvantage, which is really cool
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.000]   at the face of it.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.800]   So you get, you get the training and do you track your training in a detailed way?
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.120]   Are you keeping track of lifts?
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.360]   And so I write down what I do and I'll write down, I write down what I do every day.
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.200]   And that way I can go back and say, you know, what was I doing back then?
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.560]   Because I might go through some phase where I'm trying to do more pull-ups or I'm trying
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.240]   to deadlift more and I'm trying, or whatever the, whatever the thing is, I'll go back in
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.280]   because I got bored of deadlifting after a while.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.040]   And let's face it, if you just want to be a good deadlifter, you're not going to be
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.040]   that fast, right?
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.720]   You're, you're going to be slow on long runs.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.760]   So you don't want to go too deep into deadlifting and you don't also don't want to be so good
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.140]   at long runs that you can't deadlift, you know, a good amount of weight.
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.700]   So I got to go through phases and I'll get into something for a while and I'll get into
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.700]   something else.
[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.740]   So I do log down what I'm doing.
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.180]   So I can look back and say, oh dang, you know, I'm, I'm not even close to as strong as I
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.180]   used to be.
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.620]   Need to get back to that.
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.220]   I'm fascinated by the concept of energy.
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.220]   I think it's one of the most interesting aspects in all of biology, all of psychology and all
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.220]   of life.
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.640]   And what, when I say energy, I mean the distinction between being back on your heels, flat footed
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.980]   or forward center of mass, you know, and I get the impression.
[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.060]   And I think everyone gets the impression that you're somebody with a lot of energy.
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.660]   And I wonder whether or not you wake up with a lot of energy and you feel like you have
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:19.160]   to burn it off with this physical activity and work and other demands in your life.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.400]   Or do you find that you wake up and your energy is kind of neutral and exercise and physical
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.180]   activity gives you energy?
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:31.060]   Because I think this is one of the key things out there, I think that acts as a barrier
[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.420]   for people doing more with their body because they, maybe they don't want to tire themselves
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.460]   out or maybe they don't feel like they have enough energy to begin with.
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.500]   It's also feeds into this idea that, oh, you know, some people just have a lot of energy,
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.580]   they're really physical and other people aren't.
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:51.780]   So on, let's just say on most days, do you wake up feeling like you want to burn off
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.300]   energy, build energy?
[00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.540]   What does exercise mean to you?
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.820]   And then maybe we can talk about some of the underlying stuff going on there.
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.260]   Cause I think we both might find it interesting.
[00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.180]   I would say it's both, right?
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.980]   There's no way I can sit here and say, oh yeah, every day that alarm clock goes off
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.460]   and I'm like, oh yeah, let's rock and roll.
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.460]   Not certainly.
[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.460]   That's not the case.
[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.940]   It's also certainly not the case that every day I'm like, oh God, not again.
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:13.940]   No.
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.980]   I'd say most of the time the alarm clock goes off and I don't think a bunch.
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.020]   Like when my alarm clock goes off, I don't, I don't think a bunch, I don't debate with
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.020]   myself.
[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.020]   I'm not negotiating.
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.740]   I just, the thing goes off and I'm doing what I'm supposed to do.
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.060]   Sort of robotic.
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:33.380]   Now this, this much I can say, when you go and work out, you're going to feel better.
[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.560]   You will get energy from working out you.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.060]   That is, that is a guarantee.
[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.540]   If you go work out, you're going to feel better.
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.580]   If you go break a sweat, you're going to feel better.
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.460]   You're going to get more energy from it.
[00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:50.900]   And look, you got to go really, really hard to where now you feel more tired when you're
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:51.900]   done.
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.780]   And even that, I mean, you got to go psycho.
[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.220]   I'll do that occasionally, but I don't do that on a daily basis.
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:04.660]   You know, at the end of a day, if I wake up, lift, run, surf, and then I do jujitsu in
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:11.220]   the afternoon, like at the end of that day, I'm tired and I feel tired.
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.780]   But normal day working out just makes you feel better.
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.900]   It definitely gives you, it definitely gives me energy I should say, cause I guess I'm
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:18.900]   not everybody.
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:19.900]   Yeah.
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.460]   It's, I think it's a very important point because one of the things that we are learning
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.540]   from circadian biology, you know, time of day effects and sunlight and all that stuff
[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.380]   that we talked about in our podcast that you've done intuitively, right?
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.380]   This is what we kind of arrived to.
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.380]   It was kind of crazy.
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.660]   Last time we had a conversation is that so many of the things that science is telling
[00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:40.740]   us to do and that we emphasize on the podcast, this podcast you've been doing or are built
[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:41.740]   into military schedules.
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:46.500]   And one of them is this notion of waking up early and getting physical early in the day.
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:51.460]   And I suppose if we were to just throw one blanket rule on the table to encompass the
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:59.300]   broadest number of themes, it's that once every 24 hours we each and all get a big increase
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:03.020]   in this release of the hormone cortisol, which everyone says, Oh, cortisol, it's terrible.
[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.640]   You know, he's going to burn you out, adrenal burnout, all that stuff.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:12.820]   But it's a non-negotiable peak and you want it to arrive early in the day and viewing
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:19.860]   sunlight, physical activity, caffeine, and in particular intense exercise all amplify
[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.460]   that cortisol peak.
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:26.700]   In fact, I think it's the numbers I'm seeing is just sunlight viewing gives you a 50% increase
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.020]   in that cortisol exercise.
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.380]   On top of that, another 50 to 75% increase.
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:34.020]   So this huge release in this hormone that everyone thinks is terrible, but actually
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:39.460]   sets this huge wave in motion for the rest of the day, which gives you more energy, higher
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.700]   levels of immune function, more focus, et cetera.
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:46.300]   And does indeed, as you mentioned in your example of your daily life sets a timer so
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:51.620]   that about 14 to 16 hours later you're sleepy, which is what you want 14 to 16 hours later.
[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.940]   Unless of course you're running vampire shifts in the military or you're on shift work, but
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.740]   most people aren't of course.
[00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:02.180]   So I think the idea that movement and exercise gives us energy, I think is an important idea.
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:06.380]   And it's something that I was, frankly, I was hoping your answer would be that as opposed
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:11.940]   to that, you know, you wake up every day and you just want to just attack the world because
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:15.420]   you have so much energy getting out of bed, because frankly, I never feel that way, but
[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.500]   I always feel better after I train, always.
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:23.100]   And of course there are times when I crash in the early afternoon if I train really,
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:30.100]   really hard, but usually that's when I over-caffeinate to an outrageous degree and then I don't nourish
[00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.300]   after or I over-nourish.
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:36.540]   So this is the other thing that eating, the whole rest and digesting, the digest word
[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:41.200]   in there is meant to, it's there for a reason, which is that when we eat a really big meal,
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.220]   we actually need to slow down.
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:47.380]   So I hate to get into daily schedules at the level of nitpicking and nutrition is about
[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:51.300]   the most controversial topic on the internet.
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.480]   But do you nourish after you train?
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:59.740]   And if you do, do you do it to the point where you kind of like, okay, I'm mostly full or
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:00.740]   I'm full?
[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.620]   Are you trying to really nourish yourself or do you find that eating slows you down?
[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.620]   I find that eating slows me down.
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:11.860]   And I would say, again, it's weird how some of this stuff is like, the main reason I got
[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:15.900]   in the habit of waking up early and working out is because if you do it before anyone
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.660]   else is awake, then they can't bother you and you can get stuff done, right?
[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.460]   You go to the SEAL team and you get there before anyone else is there.
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:23.140]   No one can say, "Hey, can you help us with this?
[00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:24.140]   Hey."
[00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:25.140]   No one sent you an email.
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.980]   So you get that time, you get it done and it's yours, right?
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:33.140]   I remember when you were on my podcast and I don't wear sunglasses when I run in the
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.980]   morning because I sweat and it fills my sunglasses.
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:39.700]   It's not because I want to let the UV light into my eyes.
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:40.700]   That's not what-
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:41.700]   Cortisol boost.
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:42.700]   Yeah, cortisol boost.
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:43.700]   I didn't know that.
[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:48.700]   It's cool that I know it now, but I just did it because I don't want to sweat and my sunglasses
[00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:49.700]   can't see.
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.820]   So I just run without and I put a hat on.
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:58.820]   As far as eating, I don't like to do physically active things with food in my stomach.
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:11:59.820]   That's just the way it is.
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:00.820]   Yeah, me either.
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.020]   And so I don't want to...
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:06.220]   And what really keeps that in line for me is I'm doing jujitsu in the afternoon.
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:11.380]   And so if I'm eating a big lunch, by the time the afternoon rolls around, I'm kind of, I
[00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.620]   got food in my gut and I just don't like that feeling.
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:18.780]   So no, I don't eat a big meal until I'm kind of done with the physical stuff for the day,
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:22.500]   which is usually at night, six, seven o'clock at night, which I guess there's some bad things
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.500]   about that.
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:24.500]   I eat too late.
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:29.060]   Well, the data say, you know, if you're, yeah, we could go down a rabbit hole with this and
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:32.460]   then someone's going to pull up some little clinical study and then another one that counters
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.460]   that.
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:38.300]   But the data essentially say that having a regular meal schedule that allows you to sleep
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:42.580]   well at night, whatever that means for you, and that allows you to be active and focused
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.540]   when you need to be active and focused, that's the ideal schedule.
