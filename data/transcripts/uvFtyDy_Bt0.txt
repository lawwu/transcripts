[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920]   One of the most influential and controversial thinkers in the world
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.780]   He is known as one of the world's leading experts on economic development
[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:15.800]   One of the most famous political scientists in history
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:22.800]   We're talking about moral and political principles here
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.460]   I would suggest that all four wars could be ended quickly great power politics is now back on the table
[00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.460]   If we are anything as a world community, we have to implement what we've said
[00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:47.680]   I'm excited for this panel. We're going to talk about foreign policy
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:54.260]   We have I think two of the most interesting imminent renowned thinkers about foreign policy
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.380]   Professor John Mearsheimer from University Chicago and professor Jeffrey Sachs from Columbia. So great to have you guys here today
[00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.900]   It's
[00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.900]   It's a it's a big world and there's a lot of things happening
[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.900]   So let's just jump into it the big news over the past week was that Dick Cheney endorsed Kamala Harris for president
[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.100]   I think for people who see the world in
[00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.380]   Partisan political terms this might have been surprising, but I don't think that you guys were that surprised by that
[00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.760]   Do you see an underlying logic to this Jeff? Why don't I start with you? I
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:37.080]   Think it's obvious. There's basically one deep state party and that is the party of Cheney
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.840]   Harris Biden
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.120]   Victoria Nuland my colleague at Columbia University now
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:51.580]   And Newland is kind of the face of all of this because she has been in every administration for the last 30 years
[00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.260]   She was in the Clinton administration
[00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:01.300]   Wrecking our policies towards Russia in the 1990s. She was in the Bush administration
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.220]   junior
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.100]   with Cheney
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.220]   Wrecking our policies towards NATO enlargement
[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.700]   she was in then the Obama administration as
[00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.680]   Hillary's
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.260]   Spokesperson first and then making a coup in Ukraine in February 2014. Not a great move
[00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.400]   Started a war then she was Biden's
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.540]   Undersecretary of State now
[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.700]   That's both parties
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.480]   it's a colossal mess and
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.420]   She's been Cheney's
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.740]   Advisor she's been Biden's advisor. She she
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.380]   and
[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.100]   Makes perfect sense. This is the reality
[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.860]   We're trying to find out if there's another party. That's the big question
[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.220]   John what's what's your thought on that? Do you see any difference between?
[00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.980]   Republicans and Democrats. No, I like to refer to the Republicans and the Democrats is Tweedledee and Tweedledum
[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:08.740]   It's hardly any difference I actually think the one exception is that
[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.860]   former President Trump when he became president in
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:20.900]   2017 was bent on beating back the deep state and becoming a different kind of leader on the foreign policy front
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.460]   But he basically failed and he is vowed that if he gets elected this time
[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:33.740]   It will be different and he will beat back the deep state. He will pursue a foreign policy. That's fundamentally different
[00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:41.540]   than Republicans and Democrats have pursued up to now and the big question on the table is whether or not you think Trump can
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.420]   Beat the deep state and these two established parties and I'd bet against Trump
[00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.340]   John and Jeff, but let's start with John. Can you actually define for us for me?
[00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.740]   I don't understand when people say deep state what it is. I almost viewed the term comically
[00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.060]   we have one of our friends in our group chat who he called deep state who's
[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.340]   Deep deep state. He's really in the deep state, but we say it as a joke
[00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.340]   But for maybe the uninitiated, what does it actually mean? What are their incentives? Who are they?
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.100]   Jeff maybe on a starter John you want to start?
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:21.100]   Yeah, I'll say a few words about it when we talk about the deep state. We're talking really about the administrative state
[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.500]   It's very important to understand that starting in the late 19th early 20th century
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.260]   given developments
[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260]   in the American economy
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.860]   it was
[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:40.740]   imperative that we develop and this was true of all Western countries a very powerful central state that could run the country and
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.300]   over time that state has grown in power and
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:50.980]   Since World War two the United States as you all know has been involved in every nook and cranny of the world
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.980]   Fighting wars here there and everywhere and to do that. You need a very powerful
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.620]   Administrative state that can help manage that foreign policy
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.600]   But in the process what happens is you get all of these high level bureaucrats middle level and low level
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:14.300]   bureaucrats who become established in positions in the Pentagon the State Department the intelligence community you name it and
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.620]   they end up having a vested interest in pursuing a
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:26.700]   Particular foreign policy and the particular foreign policy that they like to pursue is the one that the Democrats and the Republicans
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:34.060]   Are pushing and that's why we talk about Tweedledee and Tweedledum with regard to the two parties you could throw in
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.260]   The deep state as being on the same page as those other two
[00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.900]   institutions
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:47.620]   there's a very interesting interview of Putin in Figaro in 2017 and he says
[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.420]   I've dealt with three presidents now
[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.680]   They come into office with some ideas even
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:00.980]   But then the men in the dark suits and the blue ties and then he says I wear red ties
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:07.700]   but they were blue ties they come in and explain the way the world really is and there go the ideas and
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.460]   I think that's Putin's experience. That's our experience. That's my experience
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:20.020]   Which is that there's a deeply entrained foreign policy. It has been in place in my interpretation for many decades
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.900]   But arguably a variant of it has been in place since 1992
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:31.380]   I got to watch some of it early on because I was an advisor to Gorbachev and I was an advisor to Yeltsin
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:37.340]   And so I saw early makings of this though. I didn't fully understand it except in retrospect
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:43.940]   But that policy has been mostly in place pretty consistently for 30 years
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:49.220]   And it didn't really matter whether it was Bush senior whether it was Clinton whether it was Bush jr
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:55.460]   Whether it was Obama whether it was Trump after all who did Trump hire? He hired John Bolton. Well the
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.380]   pretty deep state
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.100]   That was the end of they told you know, he explained this is the way it is
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.900]   And by the way Bolton explained also in his memoirs when when Trump didn't agree
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:12.900]   We figured out ways to trick him basically. So and what what are their incentives? Is it war? Is it self-enrichment?
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:18.060]   Is it power? Is it all three? Is it some car or is it? Yeah, is it is it just is there a
[00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:25.140]   Philosophical entrenchment or is it just this inertial issue that like once a policy begins? It's hard to
[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:29.540]   Change and the system's just working with 10,000 people working towards it
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:34.740]   You know if I were lucky to sit next to the world's greatest political
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.660]   philosopher, which I am
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:44.740]   He'd give you a good answer, which is that the right answer which is if you want to interpret American foreign policy
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.740]   It is to maximize power
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.260]   and
[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.560]   He gives a John gives a an explanation of that. We have
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:57.440]   Some differences, but I think it's a very good description of American
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.900]   Foreign policy, which is that it's trying to maximize
[00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:08.580]   Global power essentially to be global hegemon. I I think it could get us all killed
[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:13.740]   This is because it's a little bit delusional in my mind, but not not the I
[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:19.700]   Not not his interpretation of their idea, but the fact that they hold that idea is a little weird to me
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:26.680]   But in any event, that's the idea and every time a decision comes inside that I've seen
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.280]   I'm an economist so I don't see the security decisions the same way
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:37.020]   But every decision that I've seen always leans in the same direction for the last 30 years
[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.980]   Which is power as the central objective
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:44.480]   So Clinton faced an internal
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.580]   cabinet
[00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.100]   Really debate should NATO be enlarged?
[00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:55.300]   This is a post-cold war phenomenon that it's well, I'll let John take that
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:03.060]   Two very quick points. First of all, I do believe that the people who are in favor of this foreign policy
[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:10.620]   Do believe in it. It's not cynical. They really believe that we're doing the right method. Yeah
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:11.140]   Yeah
[00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:15.020]   The second point I would make to you and this sort of adds on to what Jeff said
[00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:18.820]   Jeff said power has a lot to do with this and is a good realist
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:23.140]   I of course believe that but it's also very important to understand that the United States is a
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:28.300]   Fundamentally liberal country and we believe that we have a right we have a responsibility
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:35.140]   And we have the power to run around the world and remake the world in America's image
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:39.980]   most people in the foreign policy establishment the Republican Party the Democratic Party
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.620]   They believe that and that is what has motivated
[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:49.940]   Our foreign policy in large part since the Cold War ended because remember when the Cold War ends
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.620]   We have no rival great power left
[00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:58.420]   so what are we going to do with all this power that we have what we decide to do is go out and
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:03.700]   Remake the world in our own image. So that's a that's a values point of view though, right?
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:08.140]   That there are values that they hold dear that that many do hold dear that
[00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.420]   liberalism
[00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:16.940]   Democracy does ultimately I believe I've heard this reduce conflict worldwide that there's an importance that we've never seen to
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:24.100]   Democratic nations since World War two go to war and that there's a reason why we want to see
[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.740]   liberalism kind of
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:32.260]   Breed throughout the world and it's our responsibility for world for global peace to make that a mandate
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:37.180]   Let me step in for one moment. Just okay, very quick. I'm and by the way, I'm I'm I'm
[00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:41.380]   What do you call it where you pull the spirits of the the voice of others?
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:45.740]   But I'm I'm just trying to channeling channeling. That's the word. I want to be very clear. I am
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.560]   Forever thankful that I was born in a liberal democracy and I love liberalism
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.580]   But the question here is do you think that we can run around the world?
[00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:01.520]   Imposing liberal democracy on other countries and in some cases shoving it down their throat
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:08.420]   Doing it at the end of a rifle barrel and my argument is that's almost impossible to do it almost always
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:12.020]   backfires think Iraq Afghanistan so forth and so on and
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:18.680]   Secondly you begin to erode liberalism in the United States because you build the deep state
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.380]   right and you want to understand that a lot of the complaints here about
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:30.040]   Cracking down on freedom of speech and so forth and so on are related to the fact that we have this ambitious foreign policy
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.780]   Those two things go together in very important ways. What an irony
[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.380]   Let me let me disagree just a bit
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:43.260]   Because we agree actually on the behavior and I've learned I'd say most of that from you
[00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.740]   That it's power-seeking
[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.540]   Truly John in my work 40 years
[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:54.660]   Overseas, I don't think the US government gives a damn about these other places
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:59.020]   I don't think they really care if it's a liberal democracy if it's a dictatorship
[00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.820]   They want the right of ways they want the military bases
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:08.580]   They want the state to be in support of the United States. They want NATO enlargement
[00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:14.620]   I don't I know you've you've written and there are some who believe in state building
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:19.660]   God if they do they are so incompetent. It's unbelievable
[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:22.860]   but
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:27.620]   Professor I'll give you an example if I put just one one example
[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:32.860]   I'm a friend with one of the only PhD
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.020]   Afghani
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.020]   economist senior person in the US
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.540]   Academia over the last 30 years
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:49.800]   You would think that the State Department if they were interested in state building would ask him one day one moment
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:56.900]   Something about Afghanistan never happened never happened. Not even one question never happened. He asked me
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:01.520]   Can you get me a meeting with the State Department? They were completely uninterested
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.380]   This is this is about power
[00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:07.020]   You're too idealistic John
[00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:14.100]   They don't care about the other places they may feel we should be
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.740]   Whatever we want free and so forth, but freedom
[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:23.900]   I've been I've seen my with my own eyes the coups the overthrows the president's
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:31.200]   Democratic president's led away. They don't care at all. This is Washington be a realist. Come on
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.140]   professor Mearsheimer, I
[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.820]   When we talk about the power
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:40.540]   There are other people in the world who are trying to accumulate power
[00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:46.740]   We live in a multipolar world right now and they have in some cases very nefarious or bad intent
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:50.980]   And they do not have democracy. So it's one thing to you know, tell
[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:57.740]   People in Afghanistan you need to evolve, you know to be a perfect democracy like the one we have here
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:02.280]   I think we all agree that's unrealistic and insane and not practical
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:09.460]   But what about the free countries of the world uniting together to stop dictators from invading other free countries?
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:15.260]   Is that noble is that a good use of power and a good framework for America to evolve to?
[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.780]   No, I don't think so
[00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:24.660]   I think that what the United States should do is worry about its own national interest in some cases
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:32.620]   That's going to involve a line ourselves with a dictator if we're fighting World War two all over again. It's December 8th
[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:40.540]   1941 you surely would be in favor of a lying with a doubt not with Adolf Hitler with Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.180]   against
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:46.500]   Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, sometimes you have to make those kind of compromises
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.380]   As I said before I love liberal democracy
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:56.180]   I have no problem a line with liberal democracy, but when you begin to think in the terms that you're thinking you end up
[00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:04.620]   With an impulse to do social engineering around the world and that gets you in all sorts of problems. Well, what I'm proposing is when
[00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:11.860]   Dictatorships invade other countries then we take action. It depends maybe defend them. So yeah, of course
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.240]   I mean when Russia invades Ukraine
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:23.180]   Basically, what you're saying is you want to go to war on behalf of Ukraine against Russia. Are you in favor of that?
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:26.860]   No, I would say diplomacy would obviously be what we want to exhaust
[00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.580]   But if they do roll into other free countries
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:33.380]   I think there's an argument for the free countries of the world to get together and say to dictators
[00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.380]   We're not going to allow this
[00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.740]   But I come in here
[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.960]   Could I clarify a few things
[00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.340]   Look first of all
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:54.260]   Almost all the time that we intervene it's because
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:59.260]   We view this as a power situation for the u.s
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.820]   so whether it's Ukraine or
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:07.700]   Syria or Libya or other places even if we define it as
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:12.660]   Defending something believe me. It's not about defending something
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:17.180]   It's about a perception of u.s. Power and u.s. Interest and it's in
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:21.460]   objectives of u.s. Global hegemony and
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:24.020]   If we analyze the Ukraine
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:31.820]   Conflict just even a little bit below the surface. This is not a conflict about Putin invading Ukraine
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:38.740]   This is something a lot different that has to do with American power projection into the former Soviet Union
[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.740]   So it's completely different
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.740]   second if we
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.780]   decide were
[00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:46.780]   The police which we do
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:50.380]   You can't imagine how
[00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:55.940]   Cynical bullshit we use to justify our actions
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:17:01.780]   We used the cynical bullshit that were defending the people of Benghazi
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:06.360]   To bomb the hell out of Libya to kill Muammar Qaddafi
[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:14.340]   Why did we do that? Well, I'm kind of an expert on that region and I can tell you maybe because Sarkozy didn't like
[00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:15.180]   Qaddafi
[00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:19.780]   There's no much deeper reason except Hillary liked every bombing
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:25.380]   She could get her hands on and Obama was kind of convinced my Secretary of State says go with it
[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:31.260]   So why don't we go with the NATO expedition? It had nothing to do with Libya it on it unleashed
[00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:38.620]   15 years of chaos cheated the UN Security Council because like everything else we've done it was on false
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:43.740]   Pretenses we did the same with trying to overthrow Syria. We did the same with
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:49.880]   Conspiring to overthrow Viktor Yanukovych in Ukraine in February 2014
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:58.240]   So the problem with this argument is we're not nice guys. We're not trying to save the world. We're not trying to make democracies
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:06.060]   We had a committee by the way of all the luminaries you could mention, but they're the neocon crazies
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.660]   But they're luminaries the committee for the people of Chechnya
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.500]   Are you kidding?
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:16.740]   Do you think they even knew where Chechnya is or cared about Chechnya?
[00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:23.980]   But it was an opportunity to get at Russia to weaken Russia to support a jihadist movement inside Russia to do
[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.540]   This is a game
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:31.140]   But it's the game that John has described better than anyone in the world. It's a game of power
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:35.480]   It's not that we're defending real things if you want to defend real things
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:41.020]   Go to the UN Security Council and convince others because the other countries are not crazy
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:45.180]   And they don't want mayhem in the world, but we play games
[00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:50.580]   So they say that's a game Iraq, which was obviously a game before we went in it was a
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:55.180]   Obviously Colin Powell could not move his lips without lying that day
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.380]   Obviously and so they said no
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:04.400]   But if we're real about our interests, then you go to the UN Security Council and then it's not just on us
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.260]   It's actually then a collective security issue
[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:15.020]   Professor Mishra if we were to take Jeffrey's position here that we are exerting power for the sake of you know
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:19.740]   Our reputation and in fact to weaken dictatorships if I'm if I'm summarizing correctly here
[00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:26.940]   Is that not a good strategy to weaken dictators around the world who might like to invade other countries?
[00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:30.500]   Is there is there a framing in which you could see that being?
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.580]   for
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:38.380]   You know a world where democracy and people living freely has gone down in our lifetimes
[00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:44.460]   Is that not noble is there not a justification somebody can make for I'm not saying I have that but I'm just trying to steal
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.340]   me on the other side of this is
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:53.900]   Weakening dictators and despots a good strategy. It depends. Well, let's talk about the two that we have, you know
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:59.740]   Xi Jinping, I think you wanted to get to eventually and then Ukraine and Putin are these people worth
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:06.100]   Trying to you know contain or even weaken. Well in terms of China
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:14.020]   I'm fully in favor of containing China. Okay, so containment check. It's containment. I'm not interested in regime change
[00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:20.020]   I'm not interested in trying to turn China into a democracy not gonna happen. Yeah, not gonna happen
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:27.020]   We tried it actually and I thought it was foolish to even pursue a policy of engagement toward China with regard to Russia
[00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.300]   I don't think Russia is a serious threat to the United States
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:34.940]   And indeed, I think the United States should have good relations with Putin
[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:40.340]   It's a remarkably foolish policy to push him into the arms of the Chinese
[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:44.900]   There are three great powers in the system the United States China and Russia
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:50.380]   China is a peer competitor to the United States is the most serious threat to the United States
[00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:55.060]   Russia is the weakest of those three great powers and it's not a serious threat to us
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:21:01.720]   If you are playing balance of power politics and you're interested as the United States in containing China
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.420]   You want Russia on your side of the ledger?
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:10.580]   But what we have done in effect is we have pushed Russia into the arms of the Chinese
[00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:18.280]   This is a remarkably foolish policy and furthermore by getting bogged down in Ukraine and now bogged down in the Middle East
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:25.980]   It's become very difficult for us to pivot to Asia to deal with China, which is the principal threat that we face
[00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:37.940]   I think I think I could I just say two-thirds, right? Perfect
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:49.260]   I just wanted to add a footnote, which is that China is also not a threat
[00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:58.140]   It's just not a threat. I mean we're gonna get to it. China is a market. It's got great food great culture
[00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:04.380]   Wonderful people civilization ten times older than ours. It's not a threat. Well as an economist
[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:08.660]   Can you talk about the impact of a cold or hot?
[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:14.360]   Conflict with China from an economic perspective given the trade relationship. Yeah, I would wreck California for one thing
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:18.180]   It would destroy the economy that you guys are making completely
[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:22.900]   This economy has been the biggest beneficiary of China's rise probably in the whole world
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.140]   So it's crazy
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:27.140]   maybe if you're worried if you're
[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:34.100]   Really worried about whether a worker in Ohio has a particular job on a particular assembly line
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:41.700]   Then you can be anti China if you're worried about the tech industry about California about peace and the future
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:45.740]   You should be pro China. That's all so why does it become so universal to?
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:52.180]   Assume that we are already in a state of conflict with China on not just party lines, but like
[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:54.780]   almost any spectrum you could kind of
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:55.700]   like
[00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:57.300]   consider
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:02.900]   Said it exactly right and he predicted it better than anyone in the whole world in
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:06.940]   2001 he said when China becomes large
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:13.820]   We're going to have conflict because that's John's theory and it's right as a description of American foreign policy
[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:19.380]   That we are for power. They are big. Therefore. They're an enemy. They're an enemy of our
[00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:26.420]   Inspiration to the city is trapped. Let's let John jump in here. Do you want you want me to say okay?
[00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:30.300]   If I talk about this, yeah. Yeah, I mean I think I think that
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:36.980]   What's interesting? I mean you and Jeff I think arrive at similar conclusions about Ukraine
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:45.660]   But different ones on China, right because Jeff is an economist and I think sees the world and fundamentally positive some ways based on
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.540]   the potential for trade
[00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:53.100]   Economics basically, whereas you see the world as more of a zero-sum game based on the balance of power
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.500]   Why don't you just explain that difference? Okay?
[00:23:55.500 --> 00:24:03.180]   It is very important to emphasize as David was saying that Jeff and I agree on all sorts of issues including Ukraine and Israel
[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.580]   Palestine, but we disagree
[00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:10.500]   Fundamentally as he just made clear on China and let me explain to you why I think that's the case and then
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:13.300]   Jeff can tell you why he thinks I'm wrong
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:22.540]   It has to do with security whether you privilege security or survival or whether you privilege prosperity and
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:27.700]   Economists and I would imagine most of you in the audience really care greatly about maximizing prosperity
[00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:34.220]   For someone like me who's a realist what I care about is maximizing the state's prospects of survival
[00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:40.140]   And when you live in an anarchic system and in IR speak that means there's no higher authority
[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:46.220]   There's no Night Watchman that could come down and rescue if you get into trouble and this is the international system
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.180]   There's no higher authority in that anarchic world
[00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:55.540]   The best way to survive is to be really powerful as we used to say when I was a kid on New York City
[00:24:55.540 --> 00:25:01.980]   Playgrounds you want to be the biggest and baddest dude on the block and that's simply because it's the best way to survive if you're
[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:08.100]   Really powerful nobody fools around with you. The United States is a regional hegemon
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:14.920]   it's the only regional hegemon on the planet we dominate the Western Hemisphere and what China has
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:18.260]   Begun to do as it's got increasingly
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.500]   powerful
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:27.380]   Economically is translate that economic might into military might and it is trying to dominate
[00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:31.140]   Asia it wants to push us out beyond the first island chain
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.900]   It wants to push us out beyond the second island chain
[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:40.660]   It wants to be like we are in the Western Hemisphere and I don't blame the Chinese one bit if I was the National Security
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:44.620]   Advisor in Beijing, that's what I'd be telling ZZ ping
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:48.820]   We should be trying to do but of course from an American point of view
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:55.560]   This is unacceptable and we do not tolerate peer competitors. We do not want
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:26:00.620]   Another regional hegemon on the planet in the 20th century
[00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:05.160]   There were four countries that threatened to become regional hegemons like us
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.500]   Imperial Germany
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:14.980]   Imperial Japan Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union the United States played a key role in putting all four of those
[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:21.180]   Countries on the scrapheap of history. We want to remain the only regional hegemon in the world
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:23.980]   We are a ruthless great power
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:32.160]   never want to lose sight of that fact and the end result of this is you get an intense security competition between China and
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:39.680]   The United States and it revolves around the concept of security not prosperity
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.740]   I think this is what you just very quickly
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:49.060]   So what you see beginning to happen is that it's in all domains where the competition takes place
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:53.380]   Especially high-tech. We do not want them defeating this
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:58.660]   Defeating us in the high-tech war. We are competing with them economically
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:05.900]   We are competing with the militarily and this is because the best way to survive is for us the United States of America
[00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:09.560]   To be the only regional hegemon on the planet
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:15.500]   So Jeff let me let me set it up for Jeff here so
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:21.860]   Jeff I you and John I think agree that the the game on the board is
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:28.060]   Power-seeking. I think what John is saying is there are smart ways and dumb ways to pursue power
[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:33.220]   The containing China is a smart way what we're doing in Ukraine is a dumb way
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:39.100]   Whereas it seems like you're saying that all power-seeking behavior is bad. That's not the game. We should be playing
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:42.500]   We should somehow opt out of that. Is that is that kind of where you're going?
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:47.780]   It's a it's not a bad way to say it, but I would I would put it in another way
[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:50.860]   I read a very good book John's
[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:53.860]   and
[00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:56.380]   And John
[00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:58.620]   Described
[00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:01.740]   I'm gonna quote him, but he can quote himself afterwards
[00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:05.740]   He said that the regional hegemons
[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:11.980]   don't threaten each other actually why because we have big ocean in between I
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:19.860]   Deeply believe that China is not a threat to the United States and
[00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:26.360]   I deeply believe the only threat to the United States period in the world
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:31.260]   given the oceans given our size and given the military is
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:33.980]   nuclear war I
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:37.200]   Deeply believe we're close to nuclear war
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.220]   because
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.140]   we have a
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.700]   Mindset that leads us in that direction
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:52.260]   We have a mindset that everything is a challenge for survival and that escalation is therefore always the right approach
[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:57.300]   My view is a little bit of prudence could save the whole planet
[00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:59.180]   so
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:04.140]   Why I don't like Ukraine is that I don't see any reason in the world
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:08.780]   That NATO has to be on Russia's border with Ukraine
[00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:13.580]   I was as I said Gorbachev's advisor and Yeltsin's advisor
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.360]   And they wanted peace and they wanted cooperation
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:22.740]   But whatever they wanted they did not want the u.s. Military on their border
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:27.620]   So if we continue to push as we did we would get to war
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:35.500]   John explained that better than anybody. We're now at war and even this morning there is further escalation
[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:41.980]   Blinken has said well if the Iranians give these missiles, then we will give missiles to hit deep into Russia
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:45.140]   this is a recipe and then we had
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:49.340]   Bill Burns the CIA director say last week an
[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:54.920]   Absurdity that he knows but CIA directors never tell the truth if they do they lose their job
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:59.380]   But he said don't worry about nuclear war. Don't worry about saber-rattling
[00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:06.660]   My advice to you is worry a lot about nuclear war and so be prudent
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:12.060]   You don't have to put the u.s. Military on Russia's border
[00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:19.580]   Okay, and my advice to Russia and to Mexico when I'm going to Mexico tomorrow, I'll give them a piece of advice
[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:24.540]   Don't let China or Russia build a military base on the Rio Grande
[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:30.620]   Not a good idea for Mexico not a good idea for Ukraine not a good idea for Russia
[00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:34.300]   Not a good idea for China. Not a good idea for the United States
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:39.860]   We need to stay a little bit away from each other so that we don't have a nuclear war
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:47.140]   By the way, I do recommend another good book and that is Annie Jacobson's nuclear war a scenario
[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:51.500]   It takes two hours to read the world ends in two hours in the book
[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:56.120]   and it's a very persuasive a guide that
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:59.660]   One nuke can ruin your whole day as they say
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:06.580]   My my strong advice on this therefore is recognize
[00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:13.020]   China first of all is not a threat to the United States
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:21.340]   Security big oceans big nuclear deterrent and so forth second. We don't have to be in China's face
[00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:26.100]   What do I mean by that? We don't have to provoke World War three over Taiwan
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:31.660]   That's a long complicated issue, but this would be the stupidest thing for my grandchildren to die for
[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:37.980]   Unimaginable and I resent it every day when we play that game
[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:42.820]   we have three agreements with China that say we're going to stay out of that and
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:47.420]   We should and then China would have no reason for war either
[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.260]   China and
[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:53.140]   Then on the economic side, let me just reiterate
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:32:00.780]   Because I was asked yesterday and there was some surprise. Was it good to let China into the the WTO?
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:08.260]   I said, of course it enriched all of you, by the way, it enriched me it enriched this country it enriched the world
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.380]   Including enriching China, that's normal
[00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:15.300]   Economics is not a zero-sum game. We all agree on that
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:20.540]   I believe that security doesn't have to be a zero-sum game either
[00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:23.620]   we can stay a little bit away from each other and
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:26.700]   China does not spend its time
[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:29.980]   Moaning America being a Western Hemisphere
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:36.660]   Hegemon they don't that's not their greatest interest to bring down American
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:42.620]   Power in the Western Hemisphere Jeff. What about the energy? Let's let John respond to this
[00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:47.980]   Just very quickly. Most of you have probably never asked yourself the question
[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:54.140]   Why is the United States roaming all over the planet interfering in every country's business?
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:56.140]   It's in part because it's so powerful
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:33:01.180]   But it's also because it's a regional hegemon, which means we have no threats in the Western Hemisphere
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:09.240]   so we are free to roam the great danger Jeff if China becomes a regional hegemon and
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:14.280]   Doesn't have to worry about security and they behave like us. Yeah, then they behave like us
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:23.340]   But my point to you Jeff is let's prevent that from happening by preventing them from becoming a regional hegemon
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:31.140]   We don't want them to have freedom to roam. You were talking about them putting military bases in Mexico. Yeah, that's our great fear
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:36.700]   It's not my great fear. They have no interest in doing so because they don't want to get blown up either
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:42.860]   So they do seem to have a big interest Jeff in Africa, India, Russia, and they are say it again
[00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:45.940]   China has a major
[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:51.400]   Doesn't military bases there. Well, they're building nuclear power plants and trade and they're building
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:58.860]   That let's go compete that way I'm all in favor of that Jeff that's because they're not a regional hegemon yet
[00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:04.220]   Yeah, if you try to prevent them from being a regional hegemon
[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:11.980]   We're gonna end up in World War three because as you say yourself that this can absolutely spill over into war
[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:18.060]   I don't want it to spill over into war on the theory that maybe someday they behave differently
[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:22.040]   That's not a good theory for me that part. So John can we?
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:26.880]   contain China prevent them from becoming a regional hegemon without
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:30.840]   Directly defending Taiwan. I mean, isn't that where the rubber meets the road?
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:33.260]   No, it's not just Taiwan
[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:38.300]   I mean one could argue there's sort of three flash points in East Asia that you folks should keep your eye on
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:44.940]   one is obviously Taiwan two is the South China Sea and three is the East China Sea and I think
[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:49.940]   David that the place where a conflict is most likely today is not over Taiwan
[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:55.180]   I could explain why I think Taiwan it's not a serious problem at the moment or for the foreseeable future
[00:34:55.180 --> 00:35:00.540]   The South China Sea is a very dangerous place. We could end up in a war for sure
[00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:03.920]   Even if we did not defend Taiwan
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:09.540]   So Taiwan you don't want to overemphasize I agree with that
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:16.520]   I agree with Jeff that we definitely don't want a war and we certainly don't want a nuclear war and he is
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:23.600]   Absolutely, correct that there's a risk of a nuclear war if a war breaks out of any sort between China and the United States
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:29.580]   Many of us in the audience remember the Cold War and this was an ever-present danger in the Cold War
[00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:36.460]   but my argument is that this is inevitable because in a world where you don't have a higher authority and you
[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:44.140]   Care about your survival. You have a deep-seated interest as any state in the system to be as powerful as possible
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:46.660]   John that means dominating your area
[00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:49.060]   There is one
[00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:53.460]   Player on this chessboard that hasn't come up yet. And then maybe we could skate to where the puck is going
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:56.540]   You know when you talk about the South China Sea, okay
[00:35:56.540 --> 00:36:01.620]   Sure, South Korea, Japan, Australia all those major players there. They're just a couple of hundred million people
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:04.220]   But then China is in population decline
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:07.420]   She apparently is self-destructing in terms of trade
[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:11.940]   Seems like containment's working pretty well there because of all the self-inflicted wounds
[00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:19.940]   But the fastest growing country the fastest growing economy the quickest to develop is India and they seem to have a very pragmatic approach
[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:25.140]   Hey, they'll buy cheap oil from Putin and they are their own sovereign country with their own point of view
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:31.980]   Would we not be really well advised over the next 10 to 20 years to make that our priority and India's role in this?
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:39.180]   How do you look at them? Well, we definitely view India as an ally, right? It's part of the quad, which is this
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:47.820]   This Rube Goldberg type alliance structure that we put together in East Asia that includes Australia, Japan the United States in India
[00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:49.420]   and
[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:51.020]   India is
[00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:58.660]   Smartly maintaining its good relations with Russia the Indians understand like Jeff and I do that the Russians are no great threat
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:02.980]   But from India's point of view, the real threat is China, right?
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:06.220]   Right, and there are two places where India cares about China
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:12.220]   One is on the India China border up in the Himalayas where they've actually had conflicts
[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:17.060]   Right, and there's a real danger of war breaking out the second place
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:23.340]   Which is maybe even more dangerous not at the moment, but will be over time is the Indian Ocean
[00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:29.260]   Because the Chinese are imitating the United States. They not only want to be a regional hegemon
[00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:32.440]   They want to develop power projection capability
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:39.060]   So the Chinese are building a blue water Navy that can come out of East Asia through the Straits of Malacca
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:42.940]   through the Indian Ocean to the Persian Gulf and
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:48.940]   once you start talking about going through the Indian Ocean the Indians get spooked and
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:56.020]   That's when the Americans and the Indians come together. Okay, let's think of this from an engineering point of view if we could
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:38:04.840]   Why are the Chinese developing the Navy because for 40 years I've read
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:08.980]   essays on all of the choke points
[00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:15.380]   In the South China Sea the East China Sea the Indian Ocean against China
[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:22.940]   That's our policy choke points. Look at the Malacca Straits. Look what we can do here first island chain
[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:30.140]   This is American strategy. Can we keep the Chinese submarines out of the Pacific Ocean first China first?
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:35.620]   Island chain and so forth. So of course they react they're rich
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:42.180]   they're gonna build a Navy so that they can get their oil on which their economy runs can we be a little bit sensible with
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:43.620]   them and
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:49.460]   Decide how we're not going to have choke points and then we don't have to have a nuclear war which is really going to ruin our day
[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:57.500]   That's the point. We can think a little bit we can understand it from their perspective. We can understand it from our perspective
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:04.820]   Deconfliction by the way, I don't believe India is an ally
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:08.100]   India is a superpower
[00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:15.940]   India is gonna have its own very distinctive interest. Thank you. It's not going to be an ally of the United States
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:20.460]   I happen to like India enormously and we're making their policies
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:24.660]   But the idea that India is going to ally with the United States against China
[00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:27.820]   in somebody's dream
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:36.740]   In Washington because it's another delusion in Washington because they should get a passport and go see the world and and on and
[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:39.020]   understand something
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:42.420]   But Jeffrey if they
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:48.900]   These are my failed students in Washington right now because they didn't listen to their professor Jeffrey
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:52.460]   We're making our iPhones in India. Now. Is that not?
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:40:00.500]   We're moving iPhone production Cooper maybe Cooper you're into economics here and that impact
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.980]   You got Apple moving out of China. You've got Japan
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:09.940]   Funding people leaving China to Vietnam and to India. Is that not the solution here as we decouple from China?
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.860]   It seems like they come back to the table
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:15.860]   We had Xi Jinping kick all the venture capitalists all investment out of China
[00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:20.300]   He got rid of all the education startups and then whatever two or three years later
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:24.180]   He's in San Francisco asking all of us to invest more money and say where'd you go?
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:26.580]   Okay, first of all, I
[00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:33.900]   Invite me back ten years and we'll see how smart all these decisions are because Xi Jinping's it's incorrect
[00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:36.420]   No, I'm talking about yes, we've moved to India
[00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:41.260]   That's our great ally and then then we're gonna have other other issues. Well, you know, I'm okay
[00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:44.980]   I think you said that Xi Jinping's trade policy is
[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:52.700]   Employed self imploding or something. It seems like there's a lot of self-inflicted wounds when you not let me explain what the wounds are
[00:40:52.860 --> 00:41:00.140]   okay, the wounds are the United States deliberate policy to stop you from selling things to China and
[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:06.220]   To stop China buying things from you. That's not self-inflicted. Oh, no, you're wrong. This is a clear wrong here
[00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:12.320]   Wait a minute. We're just to say let me say yeah, because this is very important for the economy of the people in this room
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.940]   This is a decision that was taken around
[00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:17.740]   2014
[00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:24.060]   to contain China and it's been systematically applied since then and
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.580]   It's not a surprise that
[00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:27.780]   Biden
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:35.460]   Kept all the things that Trump did and added more and now Trump says I'm gonna do all the things that Biden has kept in
[00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:39.380]   Place and I'm gonna do more. This is not a self-inflicted wound
[00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:46.420]   The United States has closed the market to China. Okay, is that smart? No, it's not smart
[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:53.740]   Is it leading to I is it by the way recuperating American manufacturing jobs?
[00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:55.780]   zero
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:42:00.380]   It may shift them a bit. It may may make things less efficient
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:05.700]   It may may make all of you lose a bit more money or not make as much money
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:12.580]   But is it going to solve any single economic problem in the United States? No way
[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:14.580]   I
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:19.460]   Just want to ask Jeff a question on this
[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:27.660]   My argument is that this is the way the world works. Yes, I know and it is and it is
[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:33.100]   But if I'm describing how the world really works, how do you beat me?
[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:36.420]   The reason is you've described a world
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:39.580]   You've described I think better than any
[00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:48.420]   Person I ever read or know how American foreign policy works. I think it's likely to get us all blown up
[00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:51.020]   you you not and
[00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:56.980]   you title not not because of John but because he's made an accurate description of a
[00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:00.620]   profoundly misguided approach which is
[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:03.540]   power-seeking
[00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:05.540]   even if you're safe as a
[00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:10.780]   Regional hegemon, you're never safe. If another regional hegemon does what you do
[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:16.500]   No, you can't allow that to happen. So you have to meddle every single place in the world this now
[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:21.780]   All I'm saying wait, let me just finish because important that it is important to say
[00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:26.500]   Try this in the nuclear age. You don't get a second chance
[00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:32.740]   So this to me is the most definitive fact of our lives
[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:40.960]   Which is we are now in a war direct war direct war not proxy war direct war with Russia
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:47.560]   Which has 6,000 nuclear warheads. I can't think of anything more imbecilic than that
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:52.440]   Aside from the fact that I know step by step because I saw it with my own eyes
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:59.040]   How we got into that mess because we thought we had to meddle up to including
[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:05.300]   Putting NATO into Georgia in the Caucasus of all places and Ukraine
[00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:11.060]   So we made that because we have to meddle because we couldn't let good enough
[00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:16.100]   Stand if we do the same with China, there will be a war
[00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:24.340]   But it's not like reading about the Crimean War or World War one or World War two. That's my difference
[00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:27.860]   this is a fine theory that explains a lot of things but
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:30.700]   Damn, if you can make
[00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:32.940]   chat GPT or you can make
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:38.060]   Optimus or you can make all the rest we can avoid nuclear war
[00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:41.900]   So just do a little bit better than saying it's inevitable
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:45.620]   All right, so
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:47.940]   We only have a minute left. I want to give it to John
[00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:52.660]   He had a question. I know but we only have a minute left and it's not we got five minutes
[00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:56.100]   This is the best panel I've ever been on in my life. Can we just have ten minutes?
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:59.740]   We got to add five or ten minutes the best panel. Is this the best?
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:11.020]   Okay, we got five minutes so before before we leave this topic John your book is called the tragedy of great power politics
[00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:18.140]   You clearly understand the tragic aspect of how great power rivalry great power competition can lead to disaster
[00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:23.060]   What Jeff is saying is we're now in the nuclear age and it's gonna lead to nuclear war
[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:30.140]   So do we have to be on this path or is there a way off of it two points in my heart?
[00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:34.620]   I'm with Jeff in my head. I'm not with Jeff
[00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:40.380]   I wish he were right, but I don't believe he's right to answer your question head-on
[00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:44.660]   I believe that there is no way out. We are in an iron cage
[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:49.620]   This is just the way international politics works and it's because you're in an anarchic
[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:56.980]   System where you can never be sure that a really powerful state in the system won't come after you and inflict a century of national
[00:45:56.980 --> 00:46:04.900]   Humiliation on you so you go to great lengths to avoid that by trying to gain power at the expense of another
[00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:10.180]   Power and that leads to all sorts of trouble. Can war be avoided?
[00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:17.120]   I like to distinguish between security competition, which I think is inevitable and war which is where security competition
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:25.100]   Evolves into war. I think war can be avoided and we were thankfully successful in that regard during the Cold War and
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:32.700]   Hopefully that will be the case in the US China competition moving forward. Can I guarantee that?
[00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:34.540]   No
[00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:42.100]   Does this disturb me greatly? Yes, but again, this is just the tragic aspect of the world we live in
[00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:44.540]   Let me just ask one because we're a little bit
[00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:48.860]   I know we were gonna try and talk about Middle East it for a good chunk of this. I just want a scenario
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:56.440]   Propose or kind of give you guys a scenario get your reaction because it is kind of what feels to be the most imminent
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:58.940]   theater of conflict
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:00.700]   the West Bank
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:02.500]   the
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:07.540]   Israelis are buttressing the settlements. There's a lot of checkpoints things are getting very tense
[00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:11.340]   They're running raids and it's becoming a very difficult place to live for Palestinians
[00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:15.220]   And there's a real concern that the West Bank collides Israelis and Israelis
[00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:21.600]   But there's a real risk that the West Bank collapses and turns into a real conflict zone if that happens
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:26.320]   The Jordanians are sitting right there and they're not gonna let Palestinians get slaughtered
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:29.580]   They're gonna have to do something and there's such a strong ally of the United States
[00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:33.020]   Does that trigger a theater of?
[00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:38.540]   Response where what is Saudi going to do are others going to be drawn to the region?
[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:43.020]   Does the collapse of the West Bank or the the conflict that seems to be brewing in the West Bank?
[00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:48.300]   become this kind of tinderbox for everyone showing up and getting involved and
[00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:54.300]   And create some sort of regional issue that we get drawn into in a bigger way
[00:47:54.300 --> 00:48:02.300]   Can I start and have John have the last word? I I work each day at the UN and
[00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:06.300]   Discuss this issue with ambassadors from all over the world
[00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:14.560]   there is over the last 50 years a an agreement on what would make for peace and
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:17.020]   the agreement is
[00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:19.020]   two states
[00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:23.020]   Maybe with a big wall between them on the 4th of June
[00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:31.580]   1967 borders with a state of Palestine being the hundred ninety-fourth UN member state and its capital in East
[00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:37.980]   Jerusalem and control over the Islamic holy sites and that is international law the
[00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:44.060]   International Court of Justice just reaffirmed that the Israeli settlements in the West Bank are
[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:46.180]   illegal
[00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:47.300]   the
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:49.260]   International Criminal Court
[00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:56.260]   Is likely to find or ICJ is likely to find that Israel is in violation of the 1948 Genocide Convention
[00:48:56.260 --> 00:49:00.240]   Which I very much believe it to be in violation
[00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:03.400]   so my own solution to this is
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:09.300]   Implement international law two states build the wall as high as you need to build
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:16.980]   But you give Palestinian rights you establish a state of Palestine. You stop the Israeli slaughter of
[00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:20.660]   Palestinians you stop the Israeli apartheid state and
[00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:24.620]   You have two states living side by side
[00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:27.500]   Israel is dead set against that
[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:29.740]   the entire
[00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:31.740]   Israeli political
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:36.500]   Governance now is dead set against that hundreds of thousands of
[00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:42.640]   Illegal settlers in the West Bank are dead set against that Smotrich, Ben-Gavir, Gallant
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:50.180]   Netanyahu are dead set against that so my view is it has nothing to do with what Israel wants it has to do with
[00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:56.660]   Enforcement of international law so I want to see this imposed not because Israel agrees to it
[00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.660]   but because it is imposed and
[00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:06.060]   There is one country that stands in the way of imposing this not Iran not the Saudis not
[00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:12.860]   Egypt not Russia not China not any country in the European Union one country in one country alone
[00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:18.740]   And that is because of the United States of America and the Israel lobby
[00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:24.660]   Somebody wrote a very good book about that too that I know the best book ever written about it by John
[00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:27.340]   and
[00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:34.000]   That's what stops the solution that could bring peace, and I believe we should bring peace because
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.940]   Not only would that bring peace to the Palestinians and peace to the Israelis
[00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:45.140]   But it would avoid potentially another flashpoint that could easily end up in World War three
[00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:51.260]   Let me answer your question about escalation potential the Jordanians coming in
[00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:58.920]   Israel faces three big problems aside from problems with centrifugal forces inside the society
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:04.100]   One is the Palestinian problem, which is both in Gaza and in the West Bank
[00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:08.940]   That's one two is Hezbollah and three is Iran I
[00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:14.460]   Think there is virtually no chance of what you described happening
[00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:19.540]   Which is if the Israelis were to go on a rampage in the West Bank similar what they've done in Gaza
[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:26.560]   That the Jordanians would come in or the Egyptians or the Saudis. They simply don't have the military capability
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:30.820]   This is a scenario where the Israelis completely dominate
[00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:37.600]   So in terms of escalation with regard to the Israel-Palestine problem, I don't think there's much potential
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:40.500]   Hezbollah is a different issue
[00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:44.460]   But mainly because it's linked with Iran, right?
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:49.300]   And Iran is the really dangerous flashpoint because as you know
[00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:55.100]   The Russians are now closely allied with the Iranians. The Chinese are moving in that direction as well and
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:57.880]   if
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:01.100]   Israel gets involved in a war with Iran
[00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:07.660]   we're going to come in in all likelihood remember when the Israelis attacked the
[00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:11.020]   the Iranian
[00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:16.500]   Embassy in Damascus on April 1st on April 14th
[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:23.980]   The Iranians retaliated a reciprocal response. Yeah, but but we were involved we were we were forewarned weren't we?
[00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:28.420]   Yes, we're for work. But the point is that we were involved in the fighting, right?
[00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:33.380]   We were involved with the Israelis with the French the British the Jordanians and the Saudis
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:40.540]   We were all involved in the fighting. So this gets at the escalation problem now to counter the Iranian
[00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:42.380]   escalation scenario
[00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:49.660]   The fact is Iran does not want a war with the United States and the United States does not want a war with Iran
[00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:51.660]   And it's the Israelis
[00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:57.260]   Especially Benjamin Netanyahu has been who has been trying to sort of suck us into a war
[00:52:57.260 --> 00:53:02.420]   Because he wants us the United States to really whack Iran
[00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:08.380]   Weaken it militarily and especially to go after its nuclear capabilities because as you well know
[00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:12.220]   They are close to the point where they can develop nuclear weapons
[00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:18.340]   So the Israelis are the ones who want us to get involved in a big war with Iran
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:25.060]   That's the escalation flashpoint and the sixty four thousand dollar question is whether you think the United States and Iran
[00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:33.700]   Kind of colluding can work together to prevent the Israelis from getting us that that question will be answered based on the next
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:36.220]   Who leads the next?
[00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:40.900]   Administration. Well, if you believe that it matters who leads the next
[00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:46.860]   Thank you, let me just say
[00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:50.300]   Jeffrey and John now, I know why
[00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:56.980]   Sacks will not stop talking about you to the most amazing panel of the event so far. Give it up
[00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:59.540]   for Jeffrey Sachs and John Mearsheimer
[00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:04.300]   Wow
