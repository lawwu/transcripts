[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   At the recent Pastors' Conference in the Twin Cities, it was an opportunity to
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.920]   think about pastoring and evangelism. Pastor John, how can pastors think and
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.000]   live more evangelistically?
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.880]   There's probably no pastor who's satisfied with his own life of personal
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:33.720]   witness concerning Christ. We are public figures who preach sermons and lead
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:46.520]   meetings and do devotions, and we are as slow as anybody probably to be out among
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.680]   unbelievers, maybe even slower because our job tends to surround us with
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.400]   believers. And so Darren Patrick was urging pastors to seek to move beyond
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.760]   that private circle of believers. And he just gave one example, there's nothing new
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.760]   about this, it wasn't even original with him, he was quoting somebody else, but it
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.960]   was refreshing to me again. Made a difference yesterday, even as I walked
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:23.720]   into Precision Tune, with my oil chains. Darren said, "When you walk from one room
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.760]   to another, it might be from the kitchen to the living room, it might be from the
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:36.000]   sidewalk into Starbucks, it might be from one aisle over another aisle in Target," he
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.120]   said, "ask the question, 'What is God doing here?'" Which simply, for me, I mean there
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.960]   are a lot of ways to take that. It's based on John, I think, 519, where Jesus
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.040]   says, "I only do what I see the Father doing." But what it says to me is, I want to be a
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:01.720]   person who walks in the awareness of God's activity. And my goodness, even as a
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.920]   pastor, I can slip out of that. I can enter my day, I can go get my oil
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.840]   changed, I can eat at McDonald's, and I wake up two hours later and realize
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.960]   I've not had any consciousness of God or of God's activity. Well, if I'm walking
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.560]   in obliviousness to God's activity in the world, how am I going to interact
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.240]   with people at a God level, where He might be preparing them for some word
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.680]   from me or from some action from me? So I was so helped by just the simple
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:43.000]   statement, "Be aware of God as you move from one part of your day to another. Ask
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.640]   God, 'What are you doing here? How might I join with you in your saving, helping
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.280]   purposes?'" And then just enjoy the ride as He leads us. Thank you, Pastor John,
