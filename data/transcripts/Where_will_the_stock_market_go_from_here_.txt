[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai, and in this episode I want to talk about the
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.880]   stock market.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.480]   In particular, what I think about the stock market at this level, we're close to $3,000
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.500]   on the S&P 500.
[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.200]   And why I realized I don't like to talk about the stock market and I don't like to write
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.200]   about the stock market, because there are so many opinions.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.160]   If I talk about why I sold stocks, I'm going to get bashed on the one side from bullish
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.720]   investors who think that's a ridiculous idea.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.520]   And then when I talk about why I'm willing to buy some stocks, I get bashed on the other
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.760]   side from bearish investors who think it's absurd.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.400]   So that is the interesting thing about the stock market.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.160]   It is the market.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.400]   And a market needs to have a buyer and a seller.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.680]   So whatever information I put out there is going to be refuted by probably half the readership
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.000]   or half the listenership.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.120]   And that's fine, everybody has an opinion.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.000]   But it's just the shelf life on talking about stocks at a particular moment in time, like
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.320]   right now, might only be around a week or a month because stocks are, especially in
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.920]   volatile times, always moving.
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.040]   Whereas when I talk about real estate, there's some really longer term trends and some fundamentals
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.600]   that we can discuss that can last for a very long, long time.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.800]   Now obviously I can talk about long term trends and fundamentals with the stock market, but
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.600]   I realized I just don't like to do it.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.520]   I spent 13 years of my career in equities, so that's stocks.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.260]   And I've seen people do very well and I've seen people who I thought were really smart
[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:42.500]   just overthink things and significantly underperform or lose money in a decent market.
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.800]   And so stocks, it's really up to you to decide whether this is the right asset class for
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.800]   you.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.760]   It's always going to be around 20% of my net worth, plus or minus 5%, because that's
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.640]   just how I like it.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.360]   I don't like the volatility of stocks as much as other asset classes.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.720]   I do appreciate the 100% passive income from the dividends that I receive.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.120]   And I also appreciate that there's no carrying costs for stocks.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.040]   But I'd much rather talk about long term trends, such as the post I wrote called Focus on Trends,
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.960]   Why I'm Investing in the Heartland of America.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.920]   I wrote that several years ago, maybe it was 2016 or 2017.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.160]   But the thesis was that thanks to technology and the trend of telecommuting and working
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.000]   from home, more and more people would escape expensive, very densely populated areas and
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.080]   go to less expensive areas and find a better life with lower cost of living expenses if
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.480]   they could make a comparable income.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.440]   And what we're seeing now, obviously, with the lockdowns, the quarantines, the shelter
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.480]   in place, the pandemic, and so forth, is that there is an acceleration of that trend going
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.600]   forward.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.160]   So as an investor, it's much better to focus on trends, long term trends, identify those
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.480]   trends, and invest in those long term trends for the future.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.440]   Otherwise, investing, thinking, researching, analyzing stocks, specific stocks, is a very
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.320]   tiring endeavor.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.860]   It actually will create a lower return on effort if you have to always think about the
[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:17.860]   short term.
[00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:18.860]   So you want to think about the long term.
[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.440]   So obviously, the longest term and the easiest way is to just invest in the S&P 500.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.600]   And that's where I have the majority of my equity investments in.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.480]   But I do have a significant portion of my equity investments in individual stocks, because
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:40.160]   I believe that I have the insights to hopefully identify trend long term.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.480]   And that one trend that I identified in stocks over the past 15 years has been investing
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.240]   in technology stocks.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.240]   I'm here in San Francisco.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.040]   I hear about technology all day long.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.720]   Technology and the internet is the future.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.840]   I even left the finance industry to focus on Financial Samurai, which is an online media
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.680]   company that is also dependent on technology and the rise of internet penetration rates
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.840]   and usage.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.580]   So I'm all in on this trend.
[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.040]   I'm living, breathing this trend.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.580]   And I'm investing in this trend.
[00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.760]   And I think the technology trend is going to continue.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.760]   So really spend some time focusing on trends.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.520]   In this podcast, I just want to share what I'm doing with my money with regards to stocks.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:29.040]   First of all, I want to say that I have many, many different public investment portfolios.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.440]   Because I don't have a job anymore, I rolled over my 401k to a rollover IRA.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.760]   Because I have Financial Samurai, I created a SEP IRA.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.260]   Because I did freelance work as a 1099, I created a solo 401k.
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.360]   And because I have children, I created 529 plans.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.440]   So whenever you hear me talk about stocks, and you hear someone else talk about stocks,
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.660]   you can't just automatically think the person only has one stock portfolio.
[00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.500]   I think most people have multiple stock portfolios.
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.340]   Maybe not as many as I do.
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:13.540]   But I think most people have a taxable investment account, a 401k, those two portfolios.
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:19.060]   And if he or she does not, then they're probably a single person with a very simple life.
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.060]   And that's cool.
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.060]   That's not a problem.
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.000]   But when you listen to stock investment advice, or you listen to people talking about the
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.660]   stock market and investing, you've got to really understand where he or she is coming
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.940]   from.
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:38.160]   And where I'm coming from is that I haven't had a job, I haven't had a day job since 2012.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:45.600]   And I rely on my taxable investment portfolio to help fund my retirement lifestyle or my
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.880]   existing lifestyle right now.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.720]   I really don't want to go to work.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:55.640]   Therefore, my taxable investment portfolio, which is my main portfolio, there's two portfolios,
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.640]   is more important.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:03.520]   It's more conservative, and it's much larger than my tax advantageous investment portfolio,
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.320]   such as my 401k, 529 plan, solo 401k, SEP IRA, and so forth.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:14.000]   I cannot afford to lose a lot of money in my taxable investment portfolio.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.280]   That's why it's conservative.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.160]   That's why I'm shooting for single digit returns.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:25.200]   I don't have a withdrawal rate for my investment income, because thankfully, I'm able to live
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.520]   below the return rate and below the dividend yield rate.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.360]   And that's really financial independence 101, having a large enough investment portfolio
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.280]   spit off a large enough amount of income, so it can cover your desired lifestyle expenses.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:46.720]   Now, as for my tax advantageous portfolios, those are long, long term investments.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.960]   And I don't have as much fear about them because they're being invested for the next 15 to
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.000]   18 to 20 plus years.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.760]   And so in that kind of time horizon, okay, obviously losing 30% of the value of these
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.560]   portfolios is really going to hurt.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.560]   And it stinks.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.560]   It sucks.
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.560]   I hate it.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.060]   I actually want to sell everything and just kind of be really conservative.
[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:12.760]   But I know over the long term, stocks are provided roughly around a 10% compound annual
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.080]   return since 1926.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.200]   And that's including dividends reinvested.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.560]   All right, so hopefully you understand where I'm coming from.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.200]   I've got a larger taxable investment portfolio.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:29.160]   And I've got multiple smaller tax advantageous portfolios when you combine them, they're
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.280]   still much smaller than my taxable investment portfolio.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.920]   So you might be wondering, where do I think the stock market will go?
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:40.560]   What is my crystal ball say with the S&P 500 at close to 3000?
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:46.840]   Well, I talked about predicting a stock market bottom in March, where it was going to bound
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:53.040]   them around 2300 to 2400 and I would be buying the S&P 500 below 2400.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:59.160]   The S&P 500 did indeed bottom at around 2250, somewhere around there.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:05.480]   And it's just shot up by about 33% at the time of this episode.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.480]   So what now?
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:12.280]   Well, I have sold all the stock that I bought in March.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.780]   And I put a lot, I put a lot into the market, I put about $500,000.
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:20.520]   So am I up 30% or $150,000 on the $500,000?
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:25.920]   Nope, not at all, because I was buying on the way down, and I was selling on the way
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.920]   up.
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:33.040]   So overall, I probably made about about a 15% return on the $500,000.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.520]   And that's about a 70 $75,000 return.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.960]   Does that sound good?
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.040]   It's okay.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:43.360]   What's more important for me is the rebound in my overall portfolio, because that is much
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.820]   greater than the $500,000.
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.440]   And so I've sold all those stocks that I bought.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.560]   And I've sold a little bit more from the tech stocks that have had a huge rebound, like
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.560]   Tesla.
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.320]   I mean, Tesla went to like 900, and then it went down to 400.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.320]   And then it went up to 850.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:01.640]   And I'm like, okay, you know what, that volatility is just a little too crazy.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:07.160]   I'm going to pare down about 50% of my holdings and just de-risk, de-risk, de-risk.
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.240]   And the reason why I've decided to de-risk is very simple.
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:16.540]   We've come so far so quickly, and valuations are at around 22 times forward earnings.
[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:21.860]   So if you look at the history of the stock market, 22 times forward earnings is about
[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.980]   as high as we were back in the early 2000s.
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.780]   That was during the dot-com bubble.
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:31.820]   And I don't think, I don't think that analysts have been cutting their estimates fast enough
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.220]   and aggressive enough.
[00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:40.280]   Overall, the S&P 500 earnings are being cut by about 15% to 17%.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:45.760]   They're getting cut more and more as time goes on, as we realize the lockdowns are lasting
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.880]   longer than expected.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.440]   And I think as we realize that a lot of these jobs are just not coming back.
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:57.200]   But if you think about it, if you cut earnings, this is consensus earnings on the S&P 500
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:05.980]   by only 15% to 17% for the year, does that reflect the proper devastation of the economy?
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.500]   I don't think so.
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.220]   15% to 17%.
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:12.780]   Okay, yes, there are definitely sectors that are doing well.
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:17.860]   A little over 20% of the S&P 500 is made up of the gorillas that are doing really well,
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.980]   the Googles, the Amazons, the Microsofts.
[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:24.180]   So fine, their earnings might be up.
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.780]   Let's just take a look at them one by one.
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:28.820]   No, let's not do that because that's just a little too complicated.
[00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.160]   But again, think about it.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:37.540]   Is a 15% to 17% earnings per share cut for the S&P 500 in 2020 enough?
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:38.540]   I don't think so.
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:44.540]   And because I don't think so, I think the true price to earnings ratio for the S&P 500
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:50.440]   is not 22 times, it's probably more like 25 times.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.700]   So it's more expensive than what the current estimates are.
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:58.300]   Because I think the current estimates are still too high.
[00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.240]   So everything is relative, folks.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.900]   Everything is about expectations when you're investing.
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:10.040]   And I personally believe that with a 32% plus rebound since the March lows, I think investors
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:16.960]   are expecting a much faster and much stronger recovery than what's really going to happen.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.000]   Let's hope there's no second wave.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.860]   Let's hope there's no another one month lockdown during winter.
[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:23.860]   Let's hope.
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.080]   But the reality is, there is that chance.
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:31.760]   And I want everyone, when they're investing with their active money, to think in bets,
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:32.760]   to think in probabilities.
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:41.060]   If we're at 3000 on the S&P 500, and the record was something around 3350, what is the probability
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:46.600]   that we're going to reach a new record high by rising another 10% to 12%?
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:52.220]   Versus what is the probability that we'll probably be range bound maybe between 2600
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:55.220]   and 3000 for the remaining year?
[00:11:55.220 --> 00:12:01.460]   And what is the probability that we might go down and retest the lows or break the lows?
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.460]   Think about it.
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:03.460]   Just think about it.
[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:04.460]   Take your time.
[00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:10.420]   My thoughts are that there's a 30% probability, I think, we reach new record highs, which
[00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:15.800]   sounds kind of crazy given there's 40 million unemployed Americans, probably going to go
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.960]   to 50 million.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.620]   A lot of these businesses are not coming back.
[00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:22.380]   And a lot of these jobs are now coming back.
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:27.780]   But the Fed and the government have been all in on supporting the economy and various asset
[00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:28.780]   classes.
[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:35.580]   So 30% chance that the markets could retest and reach new record highs.
[00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:43.020]   I think there's a maybe 50% chance that we just kind of trade range bound between 25,
[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.980]   2600 and 3000 on the S&P 500.
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:53.860]   And on the downside, I think there's probably a 30% chance that we retest the lows.
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:58.780]   So not a great chance to reach new highs, not a great chance to reach new lows.
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:03.680]   I think the lows are in when we reach 2250 in mid-March.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.680]   So what does that mean?
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:05.680]   What does that mean?
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.080]   That means that we're probably going to be range bound, I think, for the foreseeable
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.140]   future.
[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:15.820]   And that means that the easy money, the easy money, the easy rebound money has been made.
[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:21.140]   So the easy money has been made, then it's likely that your money stuck in the stock
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:27.860]   market is going to be dead money for the foreseeable future, or it's going to go down in value.
[00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:32.780]   And given this is what I believe, I've decided to take profits and take money off the table
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.860]   with my taxable investments, because I have a new mission.
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.740]   I have a new mission in 2020 and 2021.
[00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:43.400]   And that is to find great deals in the real estate market.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:49.260]   Now admittedly, it is proving to be more difficult than I thought it would be.
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.940]   But I think that value is out there.
[00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:58.820]   And I cannot risk losing, you know, 20, 30, 40% of my money in the stock market if I'm
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.540]   looking to buy another property.
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:07.460]   My taxable investment money is used to pay for the life that I want to live right now,
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:12.760]   whether it's through providing income, through dividend income, or whether it's by providing
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:17.620]   capital, enough capital for me to buy a good deal on a property, and then I would just
[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.380]   rent out my existing property going forward.
[00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:23.980]   There's always a right now use for my money.
[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.740]   And that's what I want everybody to practice thinking about.
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:33.260]   There's no point saving, working so hard, taking risk, investing money, and never spending
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.420]   your investment dollars on a better life.
[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:42.580]   You want to consistently every year, use some of your profits to pay for a better life.
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.020]   Your life is not guaranteed.
[00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:48.580]   We all know this, especially given what's going on with the world right now.
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:54.180]   If you die with mega millions of dollars or way more than you ever need, you lose.
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:59.180]   That's just a waste of time, waste of stress, waste of energy.
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.120]   You've got to figure out how to consumption smooth.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:08.180]   And the way to do that is to just do some modeling, spend some time, go into Excel,
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:13.260]   type out what your savings would be over the next 5, 10, 20, 30 years, estimate the potential
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:14.500]   returns.
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.700]   And if you die with too much, no, no, no, you got a course correct.
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:22.260]   You got to spend a little bit more money on yourself, on your family, your friends, on
[00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.800]   institutions and people who need the money.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.460]   Do whatever it takes.
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:30.780]   Just don't die with too much money in the bank or in your investment accounts.
[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:36.220]   Now for all my tax advantageous investment accounts, for the most part, I've pretty much
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:37.940]   kept them intact.
[00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:43.620]   I'm not going to be de-risking my 529 plans for my kids because they won't need them for
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.980]   another 15 to 18 years.
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:46.980]   And I don't want to stress about it.
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.580]   I just don't want to think about that stuff.
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:54.380]   Just set it, forget it, and spend my energy and time living the life that I want.
[00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.500]   Now as for your investment accounts, you should think about it the same way.
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:01.900]   You should identify purposes for every single investment account.
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:07.500]   Your 401k and your IRA and your Roth IRA should be there to provide for a comfortable retirement
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.900]   after the age of 59 and a half.
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:15.260]   So if you are decades away from 59 and a half, or even if you're just one decade away from
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:19.260]   59 and a half, you probably don't want to touch your investments.
[00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:23.660]   I mean who would have thought that we would have rebounded by 30% with such devastation
[00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.500]   in the economy?
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:26.500]   Not me.
[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.540]   I definitely didn't think we rebounded this quickly.
[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:31.820]   So you just never really know.
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:37.180]   And therefore, if you can't time the market, which most of us cannot, including myself,
[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:42.980]   I can't time it properly, then you should probably just leave these type of investment
[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:46.540]   accounts alone and continue to dollar a cost average over time.
[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:50.940]   You know dollar cost averaging as you get older and wealthier is easy.
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:57.500]   The 401k maximum contribution, for example, is $19,500 for 2020.
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.980]   $19,500 shouldn't be a majority of your income.
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:05.040]   You know if you make, let's say, $100,000 household income, you're contributing less
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:08.460]   than 20% of your gross income in your 401k.
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:13.460]   That is not that risky, especially if you spread it out over 12 months.
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:20.180]   But in terms of investing a large amount of money, let's say $50,000, $100,000, or $5,000
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:24.660]   to $10X, which you normally invest in the market, that is something different.
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:28.920]   That is something that I don't think it's wise to invest a larger sum of money after
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:33.780]   a massive rebound when value regions are very expensive and expectations are very, very
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:34.940]   high.
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:40.260]   It was okay to do that when expectations were very, very low when the Dow was at $18,500
[00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.940]   and the S&P 500 was at $2250.
[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:49.540]   But now, I think the risk/reward ratio is not in the investor's favor right now.
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:55.260]   As a result, I'm not willing to put new money to work in my taxable investment accounts.
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:18:02.100]   Or my tax advantageous accounts, yeah, dollar cost average, $6,000 in your IRA, okay, no
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.100]   problem.
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:08.140]   $19,500 in your 401k, okay, no problem.
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:14.940]   But investing $50,000, $100,000, multi-hundred thousand, millions right now, it just doesn't
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.140]   seem like a good idea.
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:22.980]   Now even though I am skeptical of the stock market after this huge rebound, and I fear
[00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:28.780]   that we're going to be in a trading range or just go lower, I still am not going 100%
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:29.780]   cash.
[00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:33.780]   Again, because I have purpose for every single investment account.
[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:39.620]   And let me just share some reasons why maybe the stock market will continue to hold up
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.220]   and reach new record highs, right?
[00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:45.660]   I think there's a 30% chance we keep on going higher and we'll be higher by the end of the
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:46.700]   year.
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:53.580]   So one, there are plenty of people benefiting from this crazy depression pandemic recession.
[00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:57.540]   Not everybody is losing like the media makes it out to believe.
[00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:02.300]   If you want less stress, if you want to feel less freaked out, you got to stay away from
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.260]   the news folks, you got to stay away from the media.
[00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:08.720]   Maybe listen to Financial Samurai or other people who have more balanced viewpoints,
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:13.980]   because the media tends to want to talk about more horror stories to drive more views and
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:14.980]   more clicks.
[00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:16.940]   That's the way it is.
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:18.740]   Negativity sells better than positivity.
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.580]   Nobody wants to hear someone doing really well during a pandemic.
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:25.900]   Two, the Federal Reserve is definitely on the investor's side.
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:31.120]   Fed Chair Powell has implicitly said he's going to do whatever it takes and use whatever
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:36.420]   amount of the Fed's balance sheet to support the economy and buy assets.
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:42.060]   They can buy everything because they, or we, America, we can print an endless amount of
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.940]   money and we are a global currency.
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:47.540]   Three, the federal government is on our side.
[00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:53.020]   They too can just lend out money, forgive money, create all these infrastructure works
[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:56.220]   projects to help millions of people get jobs again.
[00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:02.300]   That's what happened with the New Deal when FDR announced it between 1933 and 1939.
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.980]   There's no doubt this is going to happen again in 2020, 2021.
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:10.940]   Four, there could be a vaccine that comes sooner rather than later.
[00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:12.300]   You know, it's a race for billions.
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:16.580]   Whoever finds it is going to be a very, very wealthy person.
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:22.980]   So you've got companies like Gilead, AstraZeneca, Moderna, all racing to find that vaccine and
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:26.500]   they are just going to crush it if they do find it.
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:29.220]   Five, you want to hedge against a layoff.
[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:34.700]   The irony about what we're seeing right now is that the more a company lays off and the
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:40.900]   more the economy has shown a rise in unemployment claims, the stronger the stock market has
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.260]   gotten.
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.700]   You see this time and time again when a company announces massive layoffs, the stock shoots
[00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:46.820]   up.
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:51.980]   Every week in April when there were record high unemployment claims, the S&P 500, the
[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.940]   Dow, the Nasdaq, they all shot up.
[00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:59.740]   And they shoot up because the idea is that there's going to be hopefully more stimulus,
[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:04.800]   more support from the Fed and the government, and that companies are going to be just as
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:10.340]   productive and have higher operating profits with less overhead.
[00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:15.060]   Another reason why to own stocks is because of low bond yields.
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:16.380]   Everything is relative in finance.
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:20.340]   So stock investors look at bond yields, which is the risk-free rate of return, specifically
[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:25.600]   U.S. Treasury bond yields, like the 10-year bond yield, and think, "Okay, how much equity
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.500]   risk premium do I deserve?
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:32.620]   Am I willing to demand to take more risk in the stock market?"
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:37.900]   Well, if you look at the 10-year bond yield, it's currently around 0.6 to 0.7%.
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:39.020]   That's ridiculously low.
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:43.360]   So nobody investing in bonds is trying to make a lot of money.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.420]   People are investing in bonds for safety.
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:50.940]   And so when an investor thinks about relative returns, he or she thinks, "Well, 10-year
[00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:55.980]   bond yield, the 30-year bond yield is so low, and if the dividend yield on the S&P 500 is
[00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:00.540]   higher, well then, not only am I getting a higher dividend yield, I have the potential
[00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:02.620]   to make a higher capital return."
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:10.100]   And history suggests that back in 2008 and 2009, when the S&P 500 index dividend yield
[00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:15.500]   was higher than 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yield, it was a good time to buy.
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:18.980]   But that time is a little bit different from this time because we've already rebounded
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:19.980]   by a lot.
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:26.940]   If I were to tell you this back in March about the dividend yield of the S&P 500 higher than
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:30.940]   30-year Treasury bond yield, which it was, that would have been a great indicator.
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:34.900]   But now, it's really tough.
[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:39.060]   And then finally, I think it's worth noting, it's worth noting that there's a tremendous
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:42.820]   amount of cash on the sidelines.
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:48.820]   As the stock market has gone up, the cash hoard on the sidelines has gone up, up, up,
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:49.820]   up.
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:56.620]   We're talking about something like $4.8 trillion worth of cash, which is more cash by about
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:00.000]   a trillion than back in August 2008.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.420]   So having a lot of cash on the sidelines is definitely a good indicator for a potential
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:10.900]   continuation of the stock market rebound if there's more good news on the coronavirus
[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.540]   fund and on the economic front.
[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:15.540]   It is a ton of cash, folks.
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:19.100]   And I definitely encourage you to click over to the post and check out that cash on the
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:23.120]   sidelines chart because it is massive.
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:28.520]   Those with experience or who've lived through the dot-com bubble crash, the global financial
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:36.540]   crisis in 2008 and 2009, realize that cash is very, very valuable during times of uncertainty.
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.420]   People who didn't have cash weren't able to survive.
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:43.900]   They had to liquidate their homes and their investments at the bottom.
[00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:48.860]   Those who didn't have cash couldn't take advantage of fire sale prices in various types of asset
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:49.940]   classes.
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:55.380]   So a lot of people have learned from the past and are starting to hoard cash to be better
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.460]   protected this time around.
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:59.400]   Cash is really important.
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:05.160]   Please have a higher than normal cash amount because this thing ain't over yet, folks.
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:09.840]   And if you think it is over this quickly, well, I got a Dumbarton Bridge to sell you.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.440]   Overall, I am optimistic.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:16.440]   I'm optimistic that we're not going to fall into the abyss because the federal government
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.440]   and the Federal Reserve are going to save us.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.400]   They're going to save us.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:26.720]   And up until this global pandemic, the economy was looking great.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.240]   Balance sheets were very strong.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.880]   Profitability was very strong.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.200]   Household balance sheet was very strong.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.580]   We've been doing a great job since 2009, 2010.
[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:41.980]   So long as the government can keep supporting us during the lockdown period and during the
[00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:46.700]   gradual opening up period, I think we're going to be okay.
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.660]   So keep the faith, folks.
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:52.200]   And I hope this is the last I'm going to talk about the stock market for a while because,
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:56.520]   man, I really don't enjoy talking about it, even though you might enjoy hearing about
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:57.520]   it.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:01.720]   And if you appreciate this episode, I'd appreciate a great review and a share.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.920]   Thanks so much, everyone, and I'll see you guys around.
