[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:14.040]   the Gospel according to St. John in chapter 7 and verse 6, the sixth verse in the seventh
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.480]   chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:32.280]   Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come, but your time is always ready.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.640]   Now in order to remind you of the context of that statement, let me read again from
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.180]   the first verse of this chapter.
[00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:48.400]   After these things Jesus walked in Galilee, for he would not walk in Jewry, because the
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.360]   Jews sought to kill him.
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.840]   Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.480]   His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence and go into Judea, that thy disciples
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.160]   also may see the works that thou doest.
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.920]   For there is no man that doeth anything in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.920]   openly.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:20.520]   If thou doest these things, show thyself to the world; for neither did his brethren believe
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.360]   in him.
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:31.240]   Then said Jesus unto them, My time is not yet come, but your time is always ready.
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:38.080]   The world cannot hate you, but me it hateth; because I testify of it, that the works thereof
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.680]   are evil; go ye up unto this feast.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:48.640]   I go not up yet unto this feast, for my time is not yet full come.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.400]   When he had said these words, he abode still in Galilee.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:00.040]   But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.240]   as it were in secret.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:12.120]   But I want in particular this evening to deal with the statement in this sixth verse, "My
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:23.000]   time is not yet come, but your time is always ready."
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.600]   We come back, in other words, to a further consideration of this incident recorded here
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:35.500]   at the beginning of this seventh chapter of the gospel according to St. John, this tragic
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:46.880]   picture of the way in which the Lord Jesus Christ was misunderstood, and how eventually
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.300]   he was so misunderstood that they cried, "Shouting away with him, crucify him!"
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.160]   And he died upon a tree.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.480]   What of course makes the tragedy so great, and what heightens it so much at this point,
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:12.160]   is that we are shown the opposition and the unbelief, even in the case of his own brothers.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.360]   It was bad enough, as I was saying last week, that the Jews, the authorities of the Jews,
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.920]   the religious people, the Pharisees and scribes and doctors of the law, should misunderstand
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.100]   him and not believe in him. But what could be more tragic than that those who thus were
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:36.640]   bound to him by blood relationship and had been brought up in the same home and house,
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:43.480]   should as the fifth verse tells us, be guilty of unbelief.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.120]   Now we last Sunday evening spent our time in analysing some of the general manifestations
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:57.640]   of unbelief and some of the causes of unbelief. But now we continue with that matter this
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:07.880]   evening. Here, I say, is still the same picture of unbelief. Unbelief is always baffled by
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:17.560]   the Lord Jesus Christ, baffled by him himself, baffled by what he did, baffled by what he
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.120]   didn't do. He is a problem, a puzzle, an enigma to the unbeliever. That's why he is
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.480]   an unbeliever. That was the trouble with these brothers of his. They failed at all those
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.200]   points. Now the mistake, of course, with the unbeliever
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:47.640]   is that he tries to understand. That is the root cause of his error and of his trouble.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.860]   We were indicating how these brothers of his, in their self-confidence, didn't hesitate
[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.720]   to come to him, as you see, and criticized him, and indeed to point out what they regarded
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.040]   as obvious inconsistencies in him. He seemed to be behaving in such a foolish and ridiculous
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:10.040]   manner. Why stay up there in Galilee when the crowds were to be found in Jerusalem?
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.960]   Galilee of the Gentiles. Why stay there when he ought to be there, with just a handful
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.760]   of poor people surrounding him, but all the nobility and the great people and the doctors
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.720]   of the law, they're all up in Jerusalem. Why does he do this sort of thing? They say
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.040]   the thing is almost ridiculous. On the one hand, you claim that you have come as a great
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.720]   messenger and deliverer, and you have got a message for the whole world. Well, they
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.840]   say, if that is really what you do claim, well, why don't you go up to Jerusalem and
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:47.240]   do it? There is no man that doeth anything in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:53.400]   openly. You're seeking to be known openly? Well, then, if so, why not go to the place
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:59.800]   where you'll get the maximum publicity? Why not go up to Jerusalem? Why stay here in Judea?
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.240]   Now there they are, you see, they are self-confident. They not only criticize him, they don't
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.240]   hesitate to give him advice and tell him what he ought to be doing. Now that's typical
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:14.120]   of the whole attitude of the unbeliever as we saw it last Sunday night. He's the judge,
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.840]   you see, of the revelation, the judge of the Lord Jesus Christ. He ought to do this, and
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.520]   he should be doing that, and he shouldn't be doing this other thing. That's his attitude,
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:30.760]   and that's the root cause of his trouble. He's trying to understand him, and he cannot
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:39.800]   understand him. His brothers thought they could understand him, but they couldn't.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.960]   The word which comes, therefore, to the unbeliever from the New Testament is this, "Give up
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:53.840]   trying to understand, and instead of that, begin to listen." These men did all the talking.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:59.760]   It's only now that our Lord has given an opportunity of addressing them. He just stayed up in Galilee,
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.760]   as we are told. He didn't make any statement about it, he just stayed there. But his brethren,
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:10.000]   therefore, said unto him, and they bring it all out. But then, after they finished, he
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.880]   began to speak to them. And that's the thing that we are considering this evening.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:24.200]   My dear friend, if you are not a Christian, it is probably because you've spent the whole
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:30.640]   of your time in talking about Christianity without knowing what it is. You've been arguing
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:35.440]   and debating, and you say, "This is what I say." Have you ever read the Bible? I mean
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:43.720]   by that, right through from cover to cover. Do you really know the case for Christianity?
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:49.600]   We've all been like these brothers. We do all the talking, and we don't have the sense
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:57.520]   to stop and listen and let him speak, and then discover the truth. Now, that is the
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:04.360]   first step in salvation, always. Christian people in this congregation will confirm what
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:09.440]   I'm saying. The first thing that happens to us when we're on the road to salvation is
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:17.640]   that we are silenced, and we rarely begin to think and to listen to what is being said
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:22.360]   for the first time. Until then, we've simply been expressing our prejudices, defending
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.040]   our position. We don't want to hear. We are waiting for the speaker to finish in order
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:30.360]   that we can bring in our answer. We're not really listening at all. We're defending ourselves,
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:36.120]   putting up the camouflage. It's hopeless. It's fatal. The first step on the road to
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:44.080]   salvation is that we are silenced, and we begin to listen to what he has to say. And
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:50.880]   then if we do so, he will speak to us, and he will help us to understand the enigmas
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:55.600]   and to solve the problems, as he did with his brothers on this occasion. He explains
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:03.240]   himself and his conduct to them. But even that, you see, in and of itself is not enough,
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.640]   but that is the first thing that we've got to do. We've got to listen to him and to
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:13.680]   his explanation. We've got to receive the understanding that he's giving us. For now,
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:20.040]   he begins to address them and to say to them, "My time has not yet come, but your time
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:28.480]   is always ready." Now, what does he mean? Well, let me try and divide it up like this.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:37.960]   He starts, of course, by calling attention to himself. He always does that. That's the
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:46.400]   first thing. You notice how he puts it? "My time, your time." Have you noticed how he
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:54.680]   goes on doing that, how he does it right through the pages of the four Gospels? He says, "I
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:10:03.200]   go to my God and your God. Ye have heard that it has been said by them of old time, 'I
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:14.520]   say unto you, ye are from beneath, I am from above.'" These are his typical characteristic
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:20.920]   statements. He's already been doing that. We've had instances of it before in the third
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:28.560]   chapter of this Gospel according to St. John. This is what he claims for himself. "Art
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:37.480]   thou a master of Israel," he said to Nicodemus, "and knowest not these things? Verily, verily,
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:43.320]   I say unto thee, we speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen, and ye receive
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.960]   not our witness. If I have told you earthly things and ye believe not, how shall ye believe
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:54.560]   if I tell you of heavenly things? And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:11:04.600]   down from heaven, even the Son of Man which is in heaven." Now that's his basic claim.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:14.080]   He doesn't hesitate to set himself in a category entirely apart from the whole of mankind.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:19.660]   You see, we've got to start with the person of Jesus Christ. And most of the trouble which
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:24.800]   people experience in their consideration of Christianity stems from this initial failure.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:30.440]   They will persist in starting with the teaching. They don't start with the person. But we have
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:35.200]   to start with the person. So he gives his brethren this kind of shock. They've been
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:43.640]   talking to him easily and familiarly, "Our brother." And he says, "My time, your time."
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:54.880]   He has a fundamental cleavage. In other words, we are standing face to face with this central
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:06.800]   and most vital fact of all, that Jesus of Nazareth is the eternal Son of God. Therein
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:11.560]   lies the uniqueness of this Christian message, this Christian faith. This isn't a teaching
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.040]   amongst teachings. What is it? Well, this is a revelation from God, the God who spoke
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:20.920]   in times past to the fathers and through the prophets and in other ways and means, has
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:29.960]   spoken in these last days unto us in his Son, who is the brightness of his glory and the
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:39.280]   express image of his person. The staggering, astonishing, amazing thing that the everlasting
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:46.440]   Son of God has been here in this world in the flesh, in the likeness of man, in the
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:52.720]   likeness of sinful flesh. Don't you agree with me, my friends, that it is because men
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:57.640]   and women are not staggered and arrested and silenced by that, that they talk so much about
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:07.320]   Christianity without knowing what they're talking about? You read these Gospels and
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:15.880]   you will find that the people who received salvation and came to rejoice in him are those
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:22.320]   who came to him seeing or feeling something about him which was unique and listened to
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:28.040]   him, sat at his feet. They were the people who were blessed. There's a supreme example
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:32.640]   of this for me to leave this point. Take a man like Saul of Tarsus, afterwards the Apostle
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:39.880]   Paul. Here was a man, you see, who said a great deal about Jesus of Nazareth and Christianity.
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.700]   He tells us in his bit of autobiography, "I verily thought with myself that I should do
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:48.960]   many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth." And he had waxed eloquent about
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.880]   this, this new sect, this teacher, this nobody, this carpenter who'd never been trained as
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:57.500]   a Pharisee, who'd set himself up as an interpreter of the law, and who'd gathered a rabble of
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:01.840]   ignorant people round and about. He'd said tremendous things about this, and he'd expressed
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.640]   his opinion, and he'd quoted Scripture, and the whole thing was plain and clear. He'd
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:19.020]   demolished Christianity. But the moment he saw him, he was silenced. And the great authority
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:28.320]   became a babe, and cries out in his helplessness, "What wilt thou have me to do, Lord?" No longer
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:36.640]   the great pronouncements, no longer the brilliant arguments. He's as helpless as a child. Yes,
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:44.260]   our Lord had said that, hadn't he? Except ye be converted and become as little children,
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:48.340]   ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of God.
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:54.640]   Oh, my dear friend, let me ask you this question as I leave this particular matter this evening.
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:15:01.900]   Have you realized that you're dealing here with the eternal Son of God come down in the
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:07.300]   flesh? In all your arguments and disputations about Christianity and what you think and
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:17.720]   say, have you confronted him? And can you explain him? Can you deal with him? Can you
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:27.320]   encompass him with your mind? My time, your time. He claims to be unique, and I'll sum
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:34.340]   it up by putting it like this. Either what he's saying is true, or else this is the
[00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:41.200]   greatest piece of sherry frontery, not to say lunacy, that the world has ever known.
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:46.240]   Consider it. This ordinary man, this carpenter, this man who's been brought up in Nazareth,
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:56.600]   here he stands and says, "My time, your time." This is either true, or else Christianity
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:03.280]   is the greatest nonsense that the world has ever heard. But it all, you see, impinges
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:16.080]   upon him. Do we start then by accepting his evaluation of himself? Do we realize, therefore,
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:21.560]   that as we look at these matters, we are treading on very holy ground, and we should come with
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:28.640]   due reverence and with godly fear, and listen to what he's got to say? Listen, he seems
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.960]   to be saying to his brothers. Listen to me, don't you realize who I am and what I am?
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:41.160]   Am I just one of you? Don't you see the difference? My time, your time. The person.
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:47.760]   But let me go on. The second thing is this. He reveals unto them that he has come into
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:17:00.640]   this world in order to carry out a plan. Then Jesus said unto them, "My time is not yet
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:07.360]   come." What's he talking about? Well, what he's saying clearly and obviously on the
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:15.920]   surface is this, that none of his actions are haphazard. None of his actions, none of
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:24.800]   his conduct is accidental. It is all according to a plan. He says, "All right," he says,
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.200]   "you can go up to Jerusalem now. You can go at any moment you like, whenever you like.
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:33.880]   I can't." What's he saying? Well, he's saying obviously that he is working according
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:39.320]   to a plan and according to a program. Indeed, he is saying this to them, that he doesn't
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:44.080]   decide what he does. Now, as you read, especially in this Gospel
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.440]   according to St. John, you will find that he makes a very great point of that, and he
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:52.920]   goes on repeating it. He says things like this. He says, "The words that I speak unto
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:18:01.120]   you I speak not of myself, but the Father that sent me hath given me the words." Had
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:07.520]   you ever confronted that? "It's not my own idea," he says, "it isn't my own teaching.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:14.600]   I have been given what I say to you." He says exactly the same about his works. "The
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:26.680]   works that I do I do not of myself, but the Father that sent me, he doeth the works."
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:30.240]   Listen to him in his great high priestly prayer recorded in the seventeenth chapter of this
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:37.160]   Gospel. "Father," he says, "I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do." Now,
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:44.760]   that's what he's saying. My time is not yet come. All that he says and all that he
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:53.000]   does, and even the timing of what he does, is not his own, it is the Father's. This
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.440]   is of the very essence of the Christian message, my friends. The Lord Jesus Christ, the Son
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:05.520]   of God, came into this world to carry out God's plan. Everything he does is under the
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:12.960]   control of God. Do you realize that what we have recorded in the pages of these four Gospels,
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:17.920]   which is explicated in greater detail in the book of Acts and in the epistles, is this,
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:23.880]   is a plan which God planned before the very foundation of the world with respect to this
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:30.480]   world. Before the world was ever made, before there was anything in it, before man was created,
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:36.680]   God had planned this great plan of sending his Son into the world. It's a scheme, it's
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:42.000]   a plan which is worked out in detail, and especially the time element has been determined.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:54.880]   My time is not yet come. I am come, he says, to do the will of him that sent me. And his
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:20:00.720]   one concern is always to be carrying out this will, is to be carrying out this particular
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:07.360]   plan. There's a very dramatic incident, of course, which puts this before us with particular
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:13.840]   clarity, and that is the incident in the garden of Gethsemane. There is our Lord, the end is coming,
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:18.320]   you see, the end of the plan is at hand, and he knows what's involved, what the next step is.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:23.600]   And there you see him in the garden, alone, praying, and sweating drops of blood onto the
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:31.000]   ground. What's he saying? This is it, Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass by. Nevertheless,
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.280]   not my will, but thine be done. There, that cup, the drinking of that cup is a part of the plan.
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:40.840]   It's the only thing he ever queried, but he did, he said, is it possible that this should pass by?
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:45.640]   Is there any other way whereby I can do this work? If it be possible, let this cup pass by.
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:51.320]   Nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done. He come, he hath come to do his Father's will,
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:56.600]   and he's carried it out in every detail. Yes, and the timing, I say, in particular,
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:10.760]   everything is planned. And he will do nothing at all until the proper time for it has actually
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:18.960]   arrived. Now then, it is this, I say, that gives us to the key, gives us the key to the understanding
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:25.040]   of his extraordinary behaviour, which on the surface appears to us, as it did to his brothers,
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:31.960]   to be so utterly contradictory. Listen to this, verse 1, "After these things Jesus walked in
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:40.640]   Galilee, for he would not walk in Julie, because the Jews sought to kill him." Now then, he justifies
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:46.720]   that and repeats it in this sixth verse, "My time," he says, "to go up to that feast is not yet come."
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:57.200]   And yet what I read in verse 10 is this, "But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:04.920]   unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret." He doesn't go up, he explains why he
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:12.720]   doesn't go up, and then he goes up. And his brothers and others say, "Well, what is this?
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:18.040]   Is there any rhyme or reason in it? Isn't this blatant contradiction?" Let me give you another,
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:24.440]   take this first verse again, "After these things Jesus walked in Galilee, for he would not walk
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:34.120]   in Julie, because the Jews sought to kill him." Later on, this is what I read, "He set his face
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:43.840]   steadfastly to go to Jerusalem." His followers pleaded with him not to go. They said, "That fox
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:48.240]   Herod desireth to kill thee." They said, "Don't go up there, you know perfectly well that if you
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:52.880]   go there you'll be arrested. That Herod is plotting against you and the Pharisees and scribes of
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:59.920]   John." And yet he set his face steadfastly to go to Jerusalem. He wouldn't go to Jerusalem because
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:05.920]   the Jews sought to kill him. He goes deliberately, sets his face steadfastly to go to Jerusalem,
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:15.440]   and cannot be dissuaded from going. How do you reconcile these things? Well, there are many
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:21.680]   other illustrations and examples of the same thing. Do you remember what we are told in the
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:26.440]   second chapter of this Gospel? He was at the marriage feast in Cana of Galilee, you remember,
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:31.560]   and suddenly they ran out of wine. And his mother said to the people present, "Go and ask him,
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:36.920]   he'll provide you with wine. Go and ask him." And you remember the answer he gave. He turned to his
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:47.360]   mother and he said this, "Woman, what have I to do with thee? Thine hour is not yet come." And
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:54.760]   then in a few moments he turned the water into wine. How do you explain that sort of thing? What
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:24:00.440]   exactly does it mean? Let me give you another. You'll find it in the eleventh chapter of this
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:08.040]   Gospel, the case of Lazarus, who was a great friend of our Lord. "And Lazarus was taken ill,
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:17.600]   and his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick." But listen,
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:27.320]   when Jesus heard that, he said, "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God,
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:36.440]   that the Son of God might be glorified." Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:47.720]   Then listen, "When he had heard, therefore, that he was sick, he abode two days still where he was."
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:59.560]   I ask you, is there any sense in it? He loved Lazarus, he loved Martha and Mary. They send
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:04.320]   him an urgent message saying, "Lazarus is ill, he's desperately ill, he's on the point of death."
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:10.000]   But the sixth verse says, "When he had heard, therefore, that he was sick, he abode two days
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:18.760]   still in the same place where he was." And then later he went up. Well, I could keep you at great
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:25.520]   length with these apparent contradictions, these so-called inconsistencies. But there are many
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:32.360]   others. Listen to this, "Here he is healing miracles, performing his healing miracles,
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:37.280]   and the crowd gathers, and they're listening intently and hanging upon his lips. And when he
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:42.480]   sees that, he deliberately goes away and begins to work in another city. Here is a man who's
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:46.280]   suddenly healed by him, and he tells the man, 'Tell nobody of the thing that has happened to you.'
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:51.400]   You say, 'What is this? Were it not his brother's perfectly right, he seems to be attracting
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.480]   attention by his miracles. He seems to want to have a crowd and preach, and yet the moment he
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:26:00.080]   gets it, he walks away. Here he heals a man and tells him, 'Don't tell anybody a word. Keep this
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:07.000]   as it were to yourself.' And his brethren, you see, in the light of all this, they put this question
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.960]   to him, 'There is no man that doeth anything in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:21.280]   If thou do these things, show thyself unto the world. Be consistent.' Well, now then, our Lord,
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:27.760]   I say here, is answering these questions and showing that far from being any inconsistency,
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:37.480]   he is just working out according to the great plan of God. My time is not yet come. What's he mean?
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:49.560]   Well, what he means is this. If he had gone up with the crowd and the procession to Jerusalem,
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:57.840]   his coming would have been well known and advertised. There would have been a demonstration
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:04.880]   because the people were beginning to become interested in him. And that undoubtedly would
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:09.040]   have led to his immediate arrest, and he would immediately have been put to death.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:20.600]   But the time of his death had not yet arrived. Later on he went up to Jerusalem in the most
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:25.720]   public manner possible. And you remember that the people came out, and they took off their
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:29.960]   clothes and threw them on the road before him, and they cut down branches from the palm trees,
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:36.560]   and they shouted, 'Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord,
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:41.960]   his triumphal procession, his royal march into the city of Jerusalem!' Yes,
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:46.640]   but it led immediately and directly to his death, as he knew it would.
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:58.280]   But you see, what he is saying here is that the time has not yet come. My time is not yet come.
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:06.600]   There was a fixed time for his death. There were certain things that he had to do before that
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.520]   should happen. 'Oh yes, he's come to die. Yes, but he's come to die at a given point,
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:15.560]   at a given moment, not immediately.' No, no, so he stays up in Judea. He goes up secretly,
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:20.120]   in private and not openly. He tells these people not to broadcast the thing. The time
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:26.040]   hasn't come yet. Everything is fixed. Everything is decided. Everything is determined.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:36.360]   And then, when the time came, he turned to his father and said, 'Father, the hour has come.
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:44.880]   Glorify thy son, as thy son hath also glorified thee.' What is the upshot of it all? Well,
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:55.080]   it's this. The death of the Lord Jesus Christ on that cross on Calvary's Hill was not an accident.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:29:04.720]   That wasn't a political matter that was dying. No, no. This wasn't the result of the machinations
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:08.880]   of the people and the jealousy and bitterness. Of course, all that came into it, but that isn't
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:14.680]   the explanation of the death upon the cross. That is something that was determined in that
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:20.320]   eternal counsel and plan of God before the foundation of the world. These are the words
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:25.960]   that are used in the Scriptures, 'The Lamb of God slain before the foundation of the world.'
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:35.280]   And the very moment was fixed and determined. Never think again of the death of the Son of
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:45.160]   God on Calvary's Hill as an accident. Never think of that only in terms of the actions of men. He
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:50.880]   had come from heaven in order to accomplish that death. That was the thing you remember
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:55.840]   that Moses and Elias were talking to him about on the Mount of Transfiguration. They discussed
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:00.680]   with him the exodus that he should accomplish at Jerusalem. It was all known, and the exact
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:04.960]   time was known. My dear friend, how have you thought of the death of Christ until this evening?
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:09.920]   Have you said, 'Ah, that was the greatest tragedy that the world has ever known. There was a man
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:15.520]   before his time. There was a political seer that was ahead of the generations. Oh, what a tragedy!
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:20.600]   Like the death of Socrates, the world wasn't good enough for him. Oh, it was the fate of a pioneer.'
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:26.040]   Is that your way of thinking of it? If it is, you have never understood it. You are as blind as his
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:38.560]   own brethren were. My time has not yet come. I am not going up now, he said, with you. I am not
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:44.320]   making my triumphal procession now. That is going to come, but not yet. I know what I am doing. I
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:54.960]   have come to die. Yes, but in my way and at the right time. Did you know, had you realised and
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:31:04.040]   believed, that the cross of Calvary and the death of the Son of God upon it was something that was
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:14.520]   planned and determined by the Eternal God in his great plan and scheme of redemption before the
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:22.480]   foundation of the world? My time! I am doing the Father's will. And it ended in his putting himself
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:30.560]   as a lamb at his disposal, that he might become the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:40.680]   whole world. Let me hurry to my next point, which is this. This plan which he has come to carry out
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:52.200]   is a plan that is entirely different from what the world expects. It is something which the world
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:32:00.160]   cannot understand. He, the Son of God, has come into the world, I say, to carry out a plan
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:06.160]   determined before the foundation of the world. Yes, and it is a plan that is absolutely different
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:13.120]   from and contradictory of everything that men had ever thought or imagined. It is something that men
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:26.280]   cannot understand. Where do you find that, says someone? Listen. My time is not yet come, but your
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:32.080]   time is always ready. Now, what does he mean by that? What does he mean by saying that their time
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:38.080]   is always ready? I have a feeling, you know, that this point is the most important point at this
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:45.760]   present hour in particular. I think the greatest confusion in the world tonight is the confusion
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:52.000]   about the Christian message, and it is at this point that the confusion is greatest of all. What
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:33:02.840]   do you mean, says someone? I mean this. Christianity is regarded as but a great moral and ethical
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:13.160]   teaching. It is regarded as something that is concerned primarily about the great big problems
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:18.600]   of the political and the social order. At least, if you read the newspapers, I suggest to you that
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:22.600]   that's the impression you get. If you listen to the wireless and look at the television, that is
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:27.920]   the impression you're given of Christianity, that its great concern is to banish war, abolish bombs,
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:34.240]   and so on and so forth. That's Christianity. That's its business. That's its primary objective. So,
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:41.200]   it is regarded as one of the great moral, ethical teachings. They may grant that it is the greatest,
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:49.120]   that it is the best, and that it is the highest. But after all, it is one in a series. And,
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:55.280]   of course, it is something that men can understand, and something that men can appreciate.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:34:02.360]   That is why you quite often read statements such as this which I read in a newspaper not so long
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:11.360]   ago. It said, "The work of the Church and of Christianity is rarely being done today by people
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:17.200]   who don't claim to be Christians at all." It said, "The real work of the Christian Church in this
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:22.200]   matter of war and the bombs and so on is being done by people like Bertrand Russell and A. J. P.
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:27.760]   Taylor and J. B. Priestley and so on, all of whom are infidels and skeptics and deny the Christian
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:33.600]   faith and pour scorn upon it and spit upon it." But that is what is being said, that they are
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:39.880]   doing the work of Christianity. And there are those who, in the name of Christianity, align
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:46.520]   themselves with them, and who say it is because the Church is not dealing with these things that
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:51.040]   the common people are not listening to the Gospel. They say, "Why are your churches and chapels empty?"
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:56.080]   It is because you are always preaching about some personal salvation and about some world to come,
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:01.400]   and men and women are interested in politics and in economics and in war and in bombs. If you
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.600]   had only preached those things, the people would understand and they would come and believe,
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:09.280]   and your churches would be full and Christianity would be flourishing. Isn't that the argument?
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:19.800]   The Christian message, you see, is thought to be something that appeals to the natural men if it
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:27.280]   only really speaks to him in his own kind and currency, as it were. But this is how our Lord
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:38.040]   puts it, as he put it to his brethren on that occasion, "My time is not yet come, but your time
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:49.720]   is always ready." "What does he mean?" I ask. Well, this is the answer to that. That was the very
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:57.600]   position which his brothers took, the position that is so popular today. "Why don't you come
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:02.480]   and say it?" they say. Then the people would realize and understand, and they would be with
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:10.360]   you. That's exactly the argument which his brothers used. And what he says to them is this,
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:20.720]   "My time is different from your time. It doesn't matter when you go up, because whatever you may
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:25.760]   say, there's nothing new about it. It doesn't matter when you speak, the world will always
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:30.640]   receive it, because the world will always agree with it, and the world will be always sympathetic
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:35.080]   to it." They wanted him to go up and declare himself as a king, and to head up a great army,
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:39.760]   and defeat the Roman tyranny, and set up a great kingdom, and Israel would be supreme over all.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:44.560]   The people are waiting for it. Of course they are. But he says, "That's your time, that isn't mine.
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:50.320]   Your time is always ready. Get up and say things like that, and people will always listen. If the
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:55.260]   church talks about slums, and if the church talks about money, and if the church talks about... the
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:59.520]   people will listen. They understand, and they'll applaud. Of course they will. That sort of time
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:13.960]   is always ready." But he says, "My time is not ready." Why not? "Oh, well, because it's entirely
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:24.000]   different. Because it belongs to a different order, and a different category. Because it is
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:35.720]   not in series with all that has gone before. Mine, yours. Because it is entirely new. Because
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:40.240]   there's never been anything like it before. Oh yes, the time of the other things is always ready.
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:46.160]   The world is familiar with them. There it is. But not this. This is new. This is unexpected.
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:53.000]   This comes in from above. The world is not always ready for this." Indeed, he goes further, and he
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   says, "The world doesn't understand it." "You go up," he said to his brothers. "Say what you like.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.960]   Do what you like. Everybody will understand you. Your time is always ready. You don't need any
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:11.160]   interpreter. But you know," he says, "the world doesn't understand me and my message. It doesn't
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:16.600]   understand what I'm talking about. Did you hear Paul saying it in 1 Corinthians 2? 'The natural
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:22.560]   mind receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for it is foolishness unto them. Neither
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:29.120]   can it, for it is spiritually discerned.' Here was the Son of God in the world, and the princes of
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:33.800]   this world didn't know him. For had they known him, they would not have crucified the Lord of
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:41.240]   glory. The preaching of the cross is to them the perished foolishness. To the Jews it's a stumbling
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:47.960]   block, and to the Greeks it is nothing but sheer folly. My time is not come. Your time is always
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:52.840]   ready. Of course, there may be a new philosopher. He may have a new emphasis. Yes, but after all,
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:56.880]   he's like all the other philosophers. It's only a little bit of a difference in accent,
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:02.720]   a little bit of underlining here or there. It's not absolutely new, but his is. My time,
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:12.520]   your time, your time is always ready, but not mine." This is not only new and unexpected.
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:24.960]   This is not only something that the world cannot understand. The world doesn't like it. The world
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:38.800]   hates it. The world cannot hate you, but me, it hateth. It cuts across all our categories. It
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:45.400]   demolishes all our philosophies. It's absolutely strange, something the world has never seen or
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:52.280]   heard of before. My time, your time, yours is always ready, not mine. Mine is something
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:57.120]   revolutionary, and it has to come in God's way and in God's time. What's he talking about?
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:09.760]   Well, that is his way, you see, of defining his gospel, emphasizing its utter, absolute uniqueness,
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:17.160]   its difference from everything else. What is it? Is it a social scheme, a political scheme? Is it
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:21.760]   something about international conditions? Is it some protest that any sort of man can make,
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:26.640]   whether he's Christian or not? No. What is it then? What is this thing, this unique thing he's
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:35.960]   talking about? Well, I'll tell you. It's the incarnation. The message of Christianity,
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:42.720]   as I've been emphasizing at the beginning, is to say that when the times were fully come,
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:51.600]   God sent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the law. No, no, not some improved political or
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:57.960]   social or ethical scheme or system. No, no, but the coming into the world of the Son of God. Are
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:02.000]   people ready to listen to that? Of course not. That doesn't get reported in the newspapers,
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.800]   does it? But if I were to preach about Nyasa then tonight, or make a strong protest about this or
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:11.680]   that, the papers would be interested. Of course, the time for that is always ready, but not for
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:18.160]   this. This comes out of eternity into time. Incarnation, the miracle of the incarnation,
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:28.480]   the virgin birth, the two natures in the one person. That's the thing. And then redemption.
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:41.080]   He hasn't come into the world to make protests. He's come into the world to save the world. Not
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:47.080]   to save it by improving it. No, no. It's to save it by taking its sins upon himself in his own holy
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:53.040]   body and bearing their punishment on the cross on Calvary's hill. Does the world understand it? It
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:42:01.680]   spits upon it. It ridicules it. It hates the blood of Christ. He knew what he was talking about. His
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:09.040]   time has not yet come. The time of the other things is always here. The world understands it.
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:14.800]   It's in series. But he has come to talk about and to bring redemption. He has come to make his soul
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:21.720]   an offering for many. He has come that God may lay upon him the iniquity of us all. He has come
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:27.920]   to be the Lamb of God that breaketh away the sins of the world. Does the world understand why his own
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:32.320]   disciples couldn't understand it and stumbled at it? When he first announced it even to them,
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:37.560]   Peter stepped forward impulsively and said, "This be far from thee, Lord. It shall not happen unto
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:42.800]   thee." And he rebuked him saying, "Get thee behind me, Satan. For thou savourest not the things that
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:50.800]   be of God, but the things that be of man." Incarnation, redemption, broken body, shed blood.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:59.400]   That's the message. Something the world knows nothing about. It doesn't understand it. It
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:04.120]   doesn't see its relevance. It feels that it's remote and has nothing to do with the urgent
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:09.360]   problems of the hour. But this is what he talks about. And he stays in Galilee and doesn't rush
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:26.760]   up to Jerusalem. What else? Regeneration. He hasn't come merely to teach men and to reform
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:38.840]   them and to improve them a little. He has come to give them a new birth, a new nature. His message
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:48.360]   is, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, accept a man, be born again." He cannot see the kingdom of
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:55.040]   God. Your time is always ready. A man doesn't need to be born again to make protest against war and
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:44:00.240]   bombs and this and that. No, no. But a man must be born again before he can begin to appreciate
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:11.280]   this. Regeneration. And then he talks about his kingdom, the new kingdom he's going to set up,
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:18.840]   the church. Something spiritual and not material. Something belonging to the unseen,
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:27.520]   not the visible. "My kingdom," he says, "is not of this world." And what he was saying,
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:31.720]   in effect, to his brothers, you see, was just this. He says, "That's what I've come about.
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:37.680]   And that's why I'm not coming up now in public with you. You go up. You belong to the world and
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:41.200]   you think like it and they'll understand you. Say what you like. But you know the things that I've
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:45.240]   got to say, the world won't understand and it won't like them and it'll hate them. So I'm
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:53.040]   staying where I am until my time has come." "I am not joining your procession," he told them.
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:59.120]   And he said further to them, "You are not joining my profession. There are no atheists,
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:05.720]   there are no sceptics, there are no blasphemers in the procession of the Son of God. I do not
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:11.200]   march with the priestlies and the Bertrand Russells, etc. No, no. The message that I have
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:15.520]   is a message they don't like. They hate it. They abominate it. They ridicule it."
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:25.920]   Christianity doesn't combine with that kind of thing. There is between that kind of thing and
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:38.680]   Christianity the gulf that is separated by my time, your time. The plan that he has come to
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:50.040]   carry out and to fulfill is a plan that the world is ignorant of and doesn't understand,
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:46:02.480]   and doesn't like. But thank God I'm ending on this point. Listen. He carried it out in spite
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:13.960]   of men's sins and misunderstanding and their devilish unbelief. He had come to carry out
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:23.800]   the plan. And he wasn't deflected from it, and he could not be deflected from it. He came into
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:31.160]   the world to carry out God's plan, and he did carry out God's plan. His mother didn't understand it,
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:36.880]   his brothers didn't understand it, his own nation of the Jews didn't understand it. But
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:41.240]   thank God, though the whole world didn't understand it, though the disciples all
[00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:55.080]   forsook him and fled, he went on. And he carried it out alone. He trod the winepress alone.
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:47:04.080]   They all forsook him and fled, but thank God he went on. "The hour is coming," he said,
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:14.160]   "and now is, when he shall all forsake me and I shall be left alone." But though he was alone,
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:23.840]   he went on. Unbelief and even enmity and hatred made no difference to him, and made no difference
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:29.720]   to the carrying out of the plan. He did it in spite of us. And this is the most marvellous
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:37.360]   thing of all. He was doing it and he was carrying it out, not only in spite of this unbelief,
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:46.600]   but he was carrying it out in God's way for the sake of the very unbelievers who didn't believe
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:54.080]   it. Oh, that's the glory of this way of salvation. Did you notice Paul putting it there in that
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:58.200]   fifth chapter of the epistle to the Romans? That's why I read it to you. It's the great
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:04.560]   commentary on the verse we are considering tonight. "God commendeth his love toward us,
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:16.560]   in that while we were yet without strength, in due time, at the right moment, Christ died for us."
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:25.440]   Who did he die for? He died for sinners. He died for the ungodly. But listen even to this,
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:42.680]   "while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son." Is their love
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:48.080]   comparable to this? Here he is, he's come into the world, what for? To carry God's plan out.
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:53.360]   What is God's plan? To save men. Who are the men he's come to save? His own brothers who
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:57.520]   misunderstood him, who didn't believe in him, who argued with him, denounced him,
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:01.360]   tried to make him look ridiculous, offered him advice, told him what he was to do. And
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:08.160]   while they were showing their enmity, and even others that were worse, he was coming and he was
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:18.720]   carrying out a plan that was designed to save them. Thank God, I say, for this. He saves us
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:29.000]   in spite of ourselves. He saves us in spite of our unbelief. It is he who has done it all,
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:34.120]   while we were sinners, while we were ungodly, while we were unbelievers, while we were enemies.
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:42.800]   There are people, I am certain, in this congregation tonight who are unbelievers
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:50.080]   until this moment, and yet the Son of God has died for you. You who deny him, you who criticize him,
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:56.000]   you who laugh at him, you who are at enmity with him, he died for you. He died for his enemies.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:08.680]   He carried out the plan that men could not understand for the very men that couldn't
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:19.920]   understand. That is God's love. God commendeth his love toward us. Oh yes, sometimes you will
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:26.600]   find a man who is prepared to die for another. Perhaps, perchance, for a righteous man,
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:31.800]   someone would even dare to die. There are deeds of heroism, but oh, listen to this.
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:39.000]   God commendeth his love toward us in that while the world was in sin and had enmity against him,
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:46.680]   he planned the way to save them. And the Son of God was dying on the cross for people who hated
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:54.360]   him, who reviled him like Saul of Tarsus, who regarded him as a blasphemer. And that's the
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:59.360]   thing, you see, that gave Paul the shock of his life and the shock from which he never recovered.
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:08.080]   The Son of God, he said, who loved me and who gave himself for me. I was former a blasphemer
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:17.120]   and injurious and a persecutor. Even while I was doing that, he had died for me. Thank God.
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:26.360]   God's way of salvation is not dependent upon our understanding, upon our time. It is all in
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:32.920]   his own eternal will and counsel. It is all his own grace and love and compassion and kindness
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:44.960]   and glory. It is all his. And before we can understand this and receive it and be saved by
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:54.920]   it, we need to have a new understanding. We need the operation of the Holy Spirit upon us.
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:52:01.160]   "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God." You need the Spirit of God
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:06.960]   within you. And then, and then only, you'll see it. And you'll see what? A mass of contradictions?
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:17.400]   No, no. The most perfect, glorious, harmonious scheme that the world will ever know of—the
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:33.480]   perfect plan of God. All who believe in him and who are saved by him, glory in this, in the plan
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:42.160]   of redemption, in the perfect ordering, in the timing, above all in the death, in the cross of
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:52.960]   Christ thy glory, towering o'er the wrecks of time. When I survey the wondrous cross, the Jesus
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:58.200]   that stayed in Galilee because the Jews wanted to kill him, and then went steadfastly when the
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:07.760]   hour had come, oh, how I thank him for his obedience. He obeyed for me. He carried out
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:19.760]   God's plan to the smallest detail, that I might be rescued and redeemed. Thank God for his time,
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:34.560]   which is so different from our time. Thank God for God's gospel, God's way of salvation. It is
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:41.920]   a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world, what for?
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:49.800]   To reform, to protest, to put an end to war, and to make a better world. No, no. Thank God to save
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:54:05.840]   sinners, of whom I am the chief, and so are you. My dear friend, have you listened to him? Have
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:10.600]   you listened to him as he speaks about himself? Have you hearkened to him as he tells you why he
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:15.640]   came into the world, why he behaved as he did, why he delayed, why he went, why he didn't,
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:21.040]   why he did? Have you sat at his feet? Have you looked at him? Have you heard him? And have you
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:29.240]   heard him saying that he has come into the world to introduce this grand redemption, whereby you,
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:35.680]   though you are a rebel against God and a vile sinner that deserves nothing but hell, may be
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:43.520]   pardoned and forgiven, reconciled to God, indeed become a child of God, and be enabled to look
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:51.880]   forward to the joys and the pleasures of everlasting and eternal bliss in his most holy presence. Amen.
[00:54:51.880 --> 00:55:02.120]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
