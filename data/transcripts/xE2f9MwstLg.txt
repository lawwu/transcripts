[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.560]   Today's question gets to the heart of what we do here at DesiringGod.org and the question
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.480]   comes to us from Barry in Columbus, Ohio.
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.620]   Pastor John, I have a history question for you about the DG slogan.
[00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.580]   God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him.
[00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.180]   How did the slogan come to be written?
[00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.800]   Did it come to you alone or were others involved and how?
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.240]   Did Christian hedonism flow from the statement or was the statement a distillation after
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.200]   the theology was already developed?
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.600]   What role did the line from the Westminster Confession of Faith play in your own statement?
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.240]   Thank you for your diligence and precision in all of your teaching over the years.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.720]   Now this would be an interesting little research project for somebody to do.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.120]   Maybe you Tony, you're good at this.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.960]   I haven't done it, but my guess is that an electronic copy of Piper's Collected Works
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.160]   exists somewhere, which came out this year.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.760]   Those Collected Works came out this year and with a search, you could probably find out
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.320]   or anybody could, I suppose if they had it, find out what was chronologically the first
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.600]   appearance of that phrase, God is most glorified in us when we're most satisfied in Him, in
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.600]   all my published writings.
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.840]   I don't have any idea what the answer to that is, but let me try to answer Barry's questions
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.040]   as best as I can reconstruct things from my memory.
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:41.720]   First, the vision of life called Christian hedonism preceded by quite a few years, the
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.280]   slogan, God is most glorified in us when we're most satisfied in Him.
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.720]   My guess is if you date my awareness of these things, my discovery of these things from
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:03.680]   age 22, which I would roughly, it was probably another 12 or 15 years before I ever used
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.680]   that statement.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.220]   I don't know when I first used it, but I'm sure that I was thinking in terms of Christian
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.380]   hedonism long before that formulation ever came along.
[00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.600]   What I said for years was that one of the greatest discoveries I ever made was that
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.480]   God's passion to be glorified in John Piper's and John Piper's passion to be happy were
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.440]   not at odds because they came to fulfillment in one and the same act, namely the act of
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.060]   worship.
[00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:46.080]   My heart's praising God was not only magnifying His name, it was also bringing my joy in Him
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.020]   to consummation.
[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:54.640]   So wonder of wonders, I didn't have to choose between glorifying God and being happy because
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.600]   God's glory was shown in my happiness in God.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.880]   And you can see right at this point that we're just inches away, just inches away from the
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:14.800]   slogan because all I had to do was make those truths pithy and rhyming.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.840]   And here's just a little glimpse into how I write and preach.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.740]   Somewhere along the way, as I was preparing one of the dozens and dozens of messages over
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.220]   the years that I gave on Christian hedonism, somewhere along the way, as I was preparing
[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:42.600]   a message, I was trying to find a fresh way to put the truth into a pithy, memorable form,
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.600]   which I still do.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.200]   I still want to find new ways.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:54.700]   And the words came, "God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him."
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.300]   So the slogan did not come first.
[00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.040]   The reality came first.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.900]   And then over the years, with every new opportunity to explain the reality, I would be grasping
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.020]   for fresh ways to say it.
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.340]   And that formulation stuck.
[00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:20.060]   Now, as far as those who helped me, the most important thing to say would be the psalmist,
[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.220]   "Praise yourself in the Lord," and Jesus calling for rejoicing in the midst of the worst suffering,
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.420]   and the apostle Paul with his passage in Philippians 1 especially.
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.220]   So the reality, the people that helped me were Bible writers.
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.540]   And as far as the formulation goes, Jonathan Edwards would be the person who helped me
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.680]   most.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:50.040]   With regard to Paul, Philippians 1, 20 to 23 contains the reality that Christ is most
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:57.560]   magnified in us when we are most satisfied in Him, especially at the moment of suffering
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:04.720]   and death, because Paul explains that his passion is that Christ be magnified in his
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:11.440]   dying because at the moment of death, Paul considers it gain to lose everything here
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:21.640]   and have only Christ, which I sum up as Christ was most magnified in Paul's dying when in
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.360]   his dying, Paul was most satisfied in Christ.
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.360]   And so it's a short jump from that to the simpler phrase.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.320]   Jonathan Edwards, he comes within millimeters of what I'm saying.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.320]   Here's what he wrote.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:44.600]   The most important quote from Edwards on Christian hedonism for me, "God glorifies himself toward
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:50.880]   the creatures in two ways, by appearing to their understanding and two, in communicating
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.880]   himself to their hearts and in their rejoicing in him, the manifestations which he makes
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:58.880]   of himself."
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:11.760]   God, here it is, "God is glorified not only in his glories being seen, but in its being
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.240]   rejoiced in."
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.240]   Let me shorten that.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:22.100]   God is glorified in his glory being rejoiced in.
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.040]   All I did was make that rhyme.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.480]   That's all I did.
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.480]   So there it is.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.320]   I didn't make it up.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:37.280]   He goes on, one more sentence, "When those that see it delight in it, God is more glorified
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:44.760]   than if they only see it," which so easily becomes, "The more they delight in the glory
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.680]   of God, the more God is glorified in them."
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.440]   And you just see we're just millimeters away from the slogan.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.600]   The last thing Barry asks about is the role of the Westminster Catechism question.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.560]   What is the chief end of man?
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:06.120]   The answer to that question was a stimulus from early on, very early on, from the very
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:16.480]   beginning you might say, a stimulus to figure out what they meant by the word "and."
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:23.240]   And it became a confirmation later that Christian Hedonism really is what they were thinking.
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.560]   Here's their answer.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:32.480]   Man's chief end is to glorify God and enjoy him forever.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.280]   And I was entranced by the word "and."
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.280]   Glorify God and enjoy him.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:49.600]   Before—I would say long before—I noticed that the word "end" is singular.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:59.360]   Man's chief end—not ends—end, one end, is two things, to glorify God and enjoy him,
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:06.120]   which certainly seems to say that these two are not two distinct acts, glorifying and
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.160]   enjoying, but one act.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:13.320]   In fact, I don't think I'd seen that when I wrote the book Desiring God.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.440]   Not sure about that, but I think that's the case given the way I unpack it at the beginning
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.520]   of that book.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:27.960]   And my way of seeing their oneness is that the enjoying of God to the fullest in all
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:34.480]   we do is the way we glorify him to the fullest in all that we do.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:41.760]   So however it is that all of this came together for me, here I am at age 71, more thankful,
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:49.080]   more full of thankfulness than I've ever been that God has shown me these things from
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:57.200]   his word because few things, maybe none, have ever revealed my own sinfulness more, and
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:04.600]   the preciousness of the gospel more, and the true goal of life more, and the real path
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:12.240]   of holiness more, and the ultimate ecstasy of eternity more than the truth that God is
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:18.080]   most glorified in me when I am most satisfied in him.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.080]   Amen.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.480]   It is a profound point.
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.800]   Thank you for giving your life to explaining it and helping us all see it as well, Pastor
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.800]   John.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.800]   I'm really grateful.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.640]   And thanks for listening and making this podcast a part of your day and a part of your workout
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.640]   and a part of your commute.
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.600]   However you listen, thank you for joining us.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.400]   Three times a week we publish and you can subscribe to our audio feeds and you can keep
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.360]   up with our new episodes through the feeds, and you can search our past episodes in our
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.840]   archive and even reach us by email with a question about what DG is all about, like
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.640]   this question from Barry.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:54.120]   You can do all that through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:59.480]   Well if you read the precious gospel of John, you will eventually come to that rich 15th
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:04.080]   chapter where Jesus talks about what it means to abide in him.
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.040]   So what does it mean for our lives?
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:11.580]   How do we abide in Christ and what does this look like in our daily lives?
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:15.960]   We will hear from John Piper when we return on Friday with a listener's question on that
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:16.960]   very point.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.960]   I'm your host Tony Reinke and we will see you then.
