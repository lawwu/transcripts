[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.640]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.640]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.400]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.840]   On today's show, my guest is Jules Haas.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.520]   Jules is an attorney specializing in real estate and estate planning.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.240]   Jules, you live and practice in New York City, New York State, where in New York are you?
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.840]   Yes, good morning, good afternoon, Joshua.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.160]   Yes, my office is in Midtown Manhattan.
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:11.840]   I am at 845 3rd Avenue, New York, New York, which is Midtown Manhattan, which is between
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.120]   51st and 52nd Street, for those of your audience that know the Manhattan landscape.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.160]   So I invited you on today to talk about real estate, and we'll talk about it on a more
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.120]   kind of technical advanced level.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.280]   Specifically what I want to discuss with you to start with is the concept of entity selection.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.000]   Before we do that, I'd love for you just to sketch out a little bit of your resume.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.120]   How did you get involved in the area of real estate law and estate planning law?
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.360]   Okay, sure.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:53.800]   Well, I've been practicing for over 30 years, and it's sort of like many things that you
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.520]   do, it's sort of like where you sort of end up.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.640]   When I started practicing, the firms that I work with originally dealt with estate,
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.680]   estate planning, all sorts of trust and estate issues, and real estate as well.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.520]   This is New York City, so it's hard to actually do anything in the practice of law without
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.440]   running into some sort of real estate issue.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.360]   In New York City, real estate really is a very large umbrella, because you're dealing
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.720]   with all types of different entities that qualify as sort of real estate.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.480]   You're dealing with the regular type of real estate that you might know as a house,
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.400]   commercial buildings, you have condominiums, you have co-op apartments, and all of these
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.800]   things have various flaws and complexities unto themselves.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.920]   Then you're dealing with leases and the full area of real estate.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.920]   It's really quite encompassing, and New York City's certainly a very challenging and complex
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:14.960]   place for those of your audience that have ever dealt with issues or transactions in
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:15.960]   the city area.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:22.160]   It's a little bit mind-boggling to me to even consider the idea of trying to work in
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.200]   an area like real estate in New York City.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.240]   I don't know, maybe I'm too much of a country bumpkin to be comfortable in that type of
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.680]   environment, but I've got to imagine it's led to some interesting cases for you to practice
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.680]   on.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.760]   Yes, it's always a challenge.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.480]   Even the simplest type of transaction where you just want to do a closing can get quite
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.080]   involved, particularly where you're dealing with various issues concerning real estate,
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.200]   whether it's certificates of occupancy, whether it's zoning problems, whether it's building
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.760]   code issues, you name it.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:04.080]   When you're dealing with the city of New York, you can imagine the layers and layers of regulations
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.160]   and conditions that you have to deal with.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.360]   Well, that's good for your job security, so we can be thankful for that.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.920]   Well, that's true.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:22.720]   I was going to say that's true, but at the end of the day, sometimes you say, "Well,
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.400]   this is a bit much for even this transaction," but you're right.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.920]   I want to begin simple, but we need to establish just some preliminary groundwork specifically
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.640]   due to location.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.400]   If I'm considering – let's say I am a real estate investor and that's who our
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.920]   conversation is going to be geared toward.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.920]   If I'm considering investment property and I'm considering taking advice, you're
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.960]   in New York City, I'm in West Palm Beach, Florida, and I have listeners in Wyoming.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:59.040]   How much of real estate law is federal versus state in character?
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.040]   Okay.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:08.880]   Well, for the most part, real estate law is really state-oriented.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.360]   There are buildings and different issues, environmental or whatever, that may go over
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.520]   into the federal area, and certainly there's federal housing and all sorts of things that
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.680]   you have to deal with if you're dealing with commercial properties where you're
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:33.080]   dealing with tenants that might be in federally subsidized housing, but for the most part,
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.360]   real estate rules and laws are state-oriented.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:47.560]   So I'm licensed in New York, and so I can't practice in another state, and even if – so
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.240]   if a client comes to me and says, "Oh, I want to buy a house.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.600]   I want to do this transaction in New Jersey," which is just a stone's throw away from
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.840]   Manhattan, I wouldn't even begin to attempt to do that.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:08.320]   Quite frankly, the way real estate transactions occur are extraordinarily different in New
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.200]   York than other states from what I understand.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:20.720]   In New York, I'd say there's somewhat more complexity and more formality.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:28.960]   Many times, people that are out of state really don't understand how the real estate
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:35.520]   transactional type of approach is in New York until they – even banks don't really
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.520]   understand it.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.800]   I mean, many times when I've had to close loans, out-of-state banks don't really
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.720]   get it if they're closing a loan, let's say, on a cooperative apartment.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.720]   It takes – it's not really real estate.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.760]   It's really stock in a cooperative corporation.
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.040]   So you really have to sort of understand what's going on.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:58.560]   Each side has to have a separate attorney, which doesn't have to happen in other states.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.640]   The real estate broker can't be the lawyer.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:06.280]   The title company shouldn't be the attorney representing a party.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:12.240]   So there is a lot more formality and a lot more – I don't want to say regulation
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:17.620]   but certainly rules that apply when you're dealing with New York state and certainly
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.620]   New York City.
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:27.440]   So the next question I'm going to ask and is – let's say I want to purchase a rental
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.640]   house and I'm trying to face the decision of whether I should just simply purchase that
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:41.040]   house in my own name or whether I should try to establish some kind of entity for whichever
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.040]   purpose.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.160]   Is that even a question that can be answered on a national basis or is that entirely state-specific?
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.160]   Okay.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:53.280]   Well, I can't speak for other states because, again, I don't practice there and I have
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.360]   no experience there.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:01.160]   However, I'll make a general statement to this effect.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:08.560]   When you're purchasing real estate or any type of rental type of property, if you're
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:18.320]   purchasing that asset in your name individually and there's some issue that arises along
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:26.200]   the lines of liability, somebody falls down in the house, the house blows up or some other
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:34.480]   incident occurs and somebody is looking to the owner of that property to sue them.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.800]   If you own something in your individual name and certainly this is the case in New York
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:45.260]   and probably prevails throughout the United States, you're going to be individually
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:53.520]   responsible for what occurred, which means that your individual assets would be subject
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.840]   to that liability.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:03.160]   What you're looking to do is limit your liability as much as possible.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.200]   Now, how do you limit your liability?
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:12.280]   Well, the first order of business, of course, when you own any type of commercial entity
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.280]   is to get insurance.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.200]   You're going to have liability insurance and certainly you should have a sufficient amount,
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.840]   particularly in this day and age when somebody falls down and they skin their knee, they're
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.560]   going to sue you for a million dollars.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:31.760]   You want to make sure you've got sufficient liability if something happens on your property.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:39.760]   In addition to that, particularly here in New York, what most commercial folks do is
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.040]   they will put the ownership into an entity.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.120]   An entity will be typically one of two things.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:55.280]   It will either be a limited liability company or it will be a small business corporation,
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.440]   you know, an S-type of a S-corp.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:05.200]   When you do that, what ends up happening is that your liability is going to be limited
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:12.800]   to the value of whatever that property is because there's no individual ownership.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:18.600]   They can't go past the value of that property and look at your individual assets.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:23.960]   You may have individual assets of, I'll make this up, $5 million, but the house that you
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.360]   are owning there is a million.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:32.640]   If it's owned in an LLC or an S-corp, that's all they could get.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:40.960]   When you're buying any type of a real estate property or commercial property, nine times
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:47.400]   out of ten, you're going to want to put it into some type of entity for purposes of liability.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:56.880]   Now, there may be other aspects to that as well that might give you some tax advantages,
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:02.440]   but really those are more individual issues and you really need to discuss that with your
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.280]   individual accountant and see how that's going to work.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:11.840]   If you're just buying this yourself, it's just a one-person entity, then most of the
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:16.760]   income and expenses are going to flow through to you individually.
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:23.820]   If there are a lot of folks in the company or the LLC, then obviously there are different
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.320]   issues that you have to consider.
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:31.040]   I don't know if that answers the question, but I think that overall you really want to
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:36.160]   think about having an entity for purposes of liability, if nothing else.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:43.920]   The challenge in that advice is how to figure out how to apply it to scale, meaning this.
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:50.160]   If I'm going to buy a 30-story apartment complex in New York City, without question, there
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.800]   will be an entity associated with it.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:58.600]   But we're dealing on a very different scale versus me buying the house next door for $150,000
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:03.800]   and renting it out for $1,200 a month.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:12.440]   When you size down the scale of the property and you start to think about the hassle, the
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:18.400]   expense of appropriately selecting the entity, of appropriately designing it and establishing
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:25.040]   it, if we're doing a corporation, when you think about the challenge of managing that
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:30.480]   separate corporation, pursuing the corporate formalities, when you think about doing that
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.280]   within the scale of one house, it becomes a little bit challenging.
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.800]   Then you go ahead and get another one and you say, "Well, should I do separate?
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.280]   Should I try to separate these houses?
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:44.200]   Should I try to run this as one entity with multiple houses underneath it?"
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.480]   It's a little bit challenging to know what's appropriate.
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:52.160]   So how would somebody in that situation know at what point in time they should pursue the
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.400]   hassle and the expense of working through an entity?
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:05.440]   Sure. I think that right at the beginning, even if you're doing a $150,000 house and
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:12.360]   in the New York City area, if you can find a $150,000 house, then that's great.
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:19.120]   But you're talking about properties here that tend to have much higher values.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:29.280]   But even at the $150,000 level, the liability that you can incur because of things that
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:36.080]   can go wrong, such as someone getting injured, such as some catastrophe happening with respect
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:47.360]   to the property, it doesn't take that much time and effort and cost to consider taking
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:52.760]   the steps of doing it in an entity form.
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:59.560]   So what you need to do, as any good investor would, is A) and I tell this to people all
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.060]   the time and it's amazing.
[00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.800]   People come and they say, "Well, I'm thinking about buying this.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.800]   What should I do?"
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.920]   And I say, "Do you have an accountant?"
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.600]   I'm an attorney.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.300]   I'm not an accountant, but I say first because the accountant is going to have to keep the
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:22.080]   records of if you're having rent, if you're taking deductions such as depreciation, whatever
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.800]   you're doing, you're putting yourself into a world where you really need an accountant
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:30.760]   and you shouldn't necessarily be doing your own tax returns, although I know a lot of
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.840]   people do that with the programs they have out there now.
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.440]   But I always say, "Do you have an accountant?
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:41.000]   Speak to your accountant and then speak to me."
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:49.640]   And it doesn't cost that much to form an LLC and basically operate a single person through
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:50.640]   an LLC.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:59.120]   Now certainly, once a client is aware of the issues, then certainly they can make their
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.440]   own choice.
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:05.640]   At a minimum, you'd go back to your fallback position, which is what I mentioned right
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:10.120]   at the beginning, and what you do is you have a lot of insurance.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:14.660]   And that's really your first wall of protection.
[00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:20.280]   Make sure that you have a significant amount of liability insurance.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:25.680]   And I think that a lot of people don't realize that it's not really that expensive and if
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.960]   you spend a couple of extra dollars, it's worth it.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:36.560]   And on the individual level, you can go out and attach an umbrella policy and you can
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:41.200]   probably get those types of policies right through your auto insurance or other insurance
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.400]   that you may have, which will add another layer of protection.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:52.080]   And you can see if that umbrella insurance would cover any liability that may occur with
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.440]   respect to property that you own.
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:00.760]   And the insurance company may say, "Fine, we'll cover it," and you pay X number of dollars
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.000]   more a year.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.520]   But it's really worth it to get an extra million or two insurance just to be on the safe side
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:12.760]   and not have to worry about when somebody brings an action because they got injured
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:18.880]   on your property or a worker falls down or something occurs, that it's going to affect
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:27.680]   you personally and possibly ruin you financially for the long term.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:34.880]   So I've decided to follow your advice and purchase my rental house within a legal entity.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:40.360]   How do I choose the correct legal entity?
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:46.880]   In New York, many times LLCs have become very popular.
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:54.440]   There's what we call franchise tax that you have for a corporation and they're very easy
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.000]   to be formed.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:04.560]   But either entity, whether it's an S-corp or an LLC, those are sort of the basic entities
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.840]   that people choose.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:13.200]   And in LLC, basically you pick a name, it gets registered with the state just like an
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.200]   S-corp does.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:22.200]   With a single entity, everything flows through to the individual owner, all of the tax income
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.440]   and expenses.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:33.640]   So I'd say more often than not, you'll spend a little bit of money to create the LLC, but
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:37.720]   with the operating agreement, they'll be fairly straightforward and you'll be the managing
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:46.800]   partner, the managing entity, and you'll control the company in its entirety.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:55.240]   So it's typically a very simple and easy way to move forward.
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:18:01.960]   And it might cost you a couple extra dollars on your taxes as far as your preparation,
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.320]   but it serves a good purpose.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:09.440]   In my state, it's easy to establish an LLC.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:14.520]   You can just go to sunbiz.org and set it up.
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.440]   You just simply file it, you pay the fee, and you get the boilerplate documents from
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.240]   the state.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:25.840]   How do you decide if those boilerplate documents are sufficient for your real estate operating
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:31.360]   activities versus the need to establish custom documents?
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:40.000]   Well, obviously you would speak with a professional advisor, most likely an attorney.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:49.480]   But I would say that for the most part, your basic operating agreement for an LLC for an
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.880]   individual is going to do the trick.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:58.040]   It gets obviously more complicated when you've got partners and you need agreements and who's
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:05.800]   going to be the managing person and all of that, and who's going to make the decisions.
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.080]   Then you get into areas that are much more complex.
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:15.600]   And if you're doing S-Corps, you have shareholder agreements and things that get fairly complicated.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:23.040]   But for the most part, following the roadmap that you just gave, you can read through it.
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:30.520]   There are some services out there that might provide you with a bit of an explanation.
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:37.880]   And like anything else you do now you have the internet, you can do your own research,
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:44.320]   so to speak, and understand what it is that you're dealing with, and then go ahead and
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.320]   begin.
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:52.840]   And like I said, speak with an attorney, speak with your accountant and other professionals.
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:59.800]   You know, it's always a good idea also to speak to people that are in the industry,
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:06.120]   so to speak, that do the same thing or have done the same thing that you want to do, and
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:12.000]   see what their experience is like and what they've done.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.660]   And again, you can get this information online.
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:22.160]   You can probably find some real estate groups in your locality.
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:33.040]   And I'm sure that there are loads of networking places you can go to where real estate people
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.600]   meet whether it's real estate brokers, people that are investors.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:41.760]   I mean, in New York, obviously, you can go to networking groups all day long and do nothing
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:42.760]   else.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:43.840]   There's loads of them.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.120]   So that's a good way to become experienced.
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:52.320]   Whenever I have clients coming in, they've never done something before and they don't
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:21:00.280]   have any experience, I just encourage them to go out and understand what they're doing.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:05.440]   The most important thing when you're buying real estate, whether it's for investment,
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:12.000]   even for your own residence, is to understand what you're doing and to have a plan.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.560]   Understand what the cost is, understand what the expenses are going to be, understand what
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:25.000]   the mortgages are about that you're going to incur liability for and how the mortgage
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   is going to work.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.520]   And it may very well seem daunting at first, but it's like anything else.
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:37.080]   Once you start to look into it, you become familiar, like anything you do.
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.080]   Buying a car.
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.960]   If you're buying a car, you're going to go online.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:45.080]   You're going to go do a lot of research and say, "Listen, which is the best economy car
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.080]   in its class?
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.080]   Do I like this?
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.080]   Do I like that?"
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.920]   You're going to go into 15 dealers.
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.120]   And so you do the same thing when you're buying real estate.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:59.080]   And it's a very important thing because you're risking a lot of money.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.440]   Because not only are you risking the money you're putting in, that's personal assets
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:07.320]   that you have, many times you're going to go and get financing.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:12.320]   And so if your rental property is not going to work out, you're going to end up like a
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:21.480]   lot of people have over the last 10 years, getting stuck in a situation that you can't
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.840]   afford.
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.920]   And that's the last thing you want to do because it's the last project you're going to be in
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:32.240]   because you're going to ruin your credit and you're going to not be able to succeed as
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.880]   you wanted to do.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:41.400]   So I may have diverged off of your original question, but I think that due diligence,
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:45.520]   understanding what you're doing, getting as much information as you can, speaking to as
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:52.120]   many people as you can, and understanding the different aspects of the investment and
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:23:00.080]   the entity that you're going to be using will be worth your while.
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:08.200]   So that's the most fundamental advice I could give to anyone really in any field, but particularly
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:13.560]   when they're starting to look to invest in real estate.
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:20.880]   Let's say that my highest priority in my real estate activities, whether it's for personal
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:26.080]   properties that I want to own for my own use or whether it's for rental activities, is
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.120]   privacy.
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.680]   And I'm willing to pay for that privacy.
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:36.240]   How do I purchase and own real estate in the most private way possible such that it would
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:42.400]   take a very determined investigator a very long time to be able to connect the ownership
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.280]   of a property with me?
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:51.400]   Well, it sort of goes back to what entity do you want to use?
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:59.400]   So obviously if you buy something in your individual name, somebody can find out who
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:05.920]   owns that property very easily by just looking at the land records and seeing who owns the
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:06.920]   deed.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.040]   So that gives you no privacy.
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:16.120]   And just as a note, and I'm not sure how the records are down in Florida or West Palm,
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:27.640]   a number of years ago here in New York City, they introduced probably the best system imaginable.
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:35.480]   It's called ACRIS, and I don't remember what ACRIS stands for, but it's A-C-R-I-S.
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:43.400]   And for the five boroughs of New York City, you can look up all of the real estate recorded
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:47.160]   documents for any piece of property.
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:52.800]   So if I'm looking at a property in Brooklyn or Manhattan or wherever it is, I can basically
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:25:00.480]   go to my computer and I can look up by what we call block and lot or by address or name,
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:04.400]   and I can find that property and I can look at the deed, I can look at the mortgage, I
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.680]   can look at all of the recorded documents.
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:15.520]   So it's a marvelous system to understand what's going on with any piece of real estate.
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:20.400]   And like I said, if it's in your individual name, I can tell you in five minutes who owns
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.400]   that property.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:26.600]   Now, if the property's owned in the name of an LLC or a corporation, obviously you're
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.560]   going to see ABC Corporation.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:33.240]   Well, again, you're not going to know who owns ABC Corporation.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:38.000]   So then if I'm looking to do an investigation, what would I do?
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.640]   Well, I might look at the tax records, try to see where it's sent.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:50.400]   It might be ABC Corporation, Care of, John Doe or something like that.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:54.520]   Or I can go and look at the certificate of incorporation or the filing certificates for
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:26:00.720]   the LLC and see if there's a ... because there'll be an individual name many times mentioned
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:07.800]   in those documents so that I can find that individual and see who's connected with the
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:08.800]   corporation.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:16.240]   Now, obviously if you're getting more sophisticated and you're getting into other levels, you
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:20.120]   can have one entity owning another entity.
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:26.040]   And then you have various layers of entities owning various pieces of property.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:33.320]   So you have ABC Corporation owning XYZ Corporation, which then owns the property.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:46.720]   So depending upon how much secrecy you want, you can try to create as many layers as possible.
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:53.520]   At the end of the day, if I really want to find out about something in this day and age,
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:59.200]   you can probably trace something back if you were caught enough at it.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.200]   Right, right.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:08.480]   And I'm not here referring to ... I mean, you give the FBI warrants and time and there's
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.320]   almost no secret that can be kept.
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.320]   So I'm not referring here to ...
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:12.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.320]   No.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.040]   But you know what?
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:21.840]   I can dial up a private investigator, which in my practice we use now and again for various
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.080]   things, which is no bad connotation.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:31.000]   But many times we need to find a person that's disappeared or we need to get more information
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.160]   about something that's going on that we just can't necessarily get ourself.
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:40.880]   And lo and behold, there's so much information out there.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:49.160]   There's just so many avenues to find stuff that ... I don't know what your newspaper
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:54.320]   is down there, but up here you can read the New York Post and everybody's life is on the
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.000]   front page.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.240]   So there's not much you can hide.
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:05.920]   So in real estate, there are two things that I often hear about, and I'm not sure how ... I
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.920]   wouldn't expect this to be a major part of your practice.
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.800]   So feel free to say, "Hey, this is not something I'm interested in."
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:15.360]   But I hear a lot, "If you're interested in privacy about establishing an Illinois land
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:26.880]   trust or using a New Mexico LLC, because they can be established to be more private."
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:33.760]   Are you aware, first of all, of those two tools as means to accomplish this goal?
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:38.560]   I'm not, so I can't really speak to it.
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:48.040]   But I can, again, I would just say that I'm not sure at the end of the day how private
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.880]   you can ultimately be.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:55.840]   I mean, you've seen what's gone on, and it may very well be that by using those entities
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:01.800]   and using trust companies and having them establish certain ownership interests for
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:09.440]   you, you might be able to create an extra level of privacy.
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:21.440]   But you've seen with the various offshore companies and offshore accounts and all of
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:31.760]   the other things that recently have been disclosed, there's fewer and fewer places to provide
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:32.760]   that.
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:39.520]   And it will create that type of lack of detection.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:43.320]   My concern primarily, and the reason I'm broaching these questions is, do you remember, what
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:48.200]   was it, a year or two ago that dentist shot the lion in Africa?
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:56.880]   And then was pilloried by the US American society around him for shooting the lion.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:02.320]   As far as I'm concerned, that story should be an incredible wake-up call to it and to
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.440]   people.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:08.480]   And one of the benefits that we have in today's world is free and easy communication.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:14.920]   So it's a wonderful thing that almost any person can have a simple platform for publishing
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:19.040]   information, and it goes out without censorship and without restrictions.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:26.360]   The problem is that we have created in this country such a polarized society where people
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.720]   feel so strongly about just destroying other people.
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:38.120]   And whether it was, who was it, the dentist who shot the hunter, and they destroyed his
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.320]   business, just absolutely destroyed his business.
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.120]   He had to lock his doors.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:48.120]   Or the one where Indiana, the pizza maker in Indiana, where the guy, I think the guy's
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:52.960]   daughter goes on TV to do an interview about homosexual marriage in Indiana, and he just
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.640]   destroyed his business overnight.
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.680]   And he had to shutter his doors.
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:02.800]   And so one of the concerns that I have is for any person, if you – the dentist just
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:10.760]   went out for a normal hunt just the normal way that he did with his big game hunts.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:15.420]   As far as I know, although I know there were people that were concerned about some of his
[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:22.680]   practices, but I never saw any evidence to indicate that he knowingly committed a crime.
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.880]   And all of a sudden, everything was destroyed.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:29.960]   So in that circumstance, if I were that dentist, and obviously he was wealthy, I mean, his
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:35.080]   hunts like that are costing tens of thousands of dollars, I would be very concerned about
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:41.320]   making sure that the Internet police aren't going to have easy access to knowing to what
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.560]   I own and where I hold it.
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:48.200]   And I'm very concerned about, as people build wealth, their ability to maintain privacy.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:52.200]   Now, the Internet police are also pretty capable investigators and researchers.
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:57.680]   There have been some interesting stories done where people pull out details and just individual
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:02.960]   people collaborating can basically expose every detail of your life.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:09.160]   But I'm very concerned about this trend and I'm very concerned about people taking
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:14.680]   simple steps to protect themselves before they wind up on the front page of the newspaper.
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:15.680]   Right.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:18.600]   No, I agree with you.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:25.600]   Because of the advent of the communication systems that we have today, the Internet and
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:33.880]   all the social media, literally with a push of a button, information goes out and it's
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:34.880]   worldwide.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:42.520]   It used to be years ago, obviously, all you had was the print media and some TV and some
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.280]   radio and whatever.
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:46.080]   But of course that's changed now.
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:59.400]   And there is a, as they say, it's the gotcha society where everybody's trying to get
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:06.440]   someone because it just sort of, let's put it on YouTube and have the video of the guy
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.040]   shooting the lion or whatever it might be.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.960]   So yes, it's a problem.
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:16.480]   And, you know, it's very, it's almost impossible to control entirely.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:22.760]   And I agree with you that whatever you do, you know, you should take whatever steps you
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:30.320]   can to, you know, maintain your privacy and keep things under control.
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:35.840]   I think a lot of times things happen when they get out of control.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:41.480]   And so as long as you follow, you know, at least attempt to follow the rules and, you
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:46.440]   know, do what's, you know, what you're supposed to do.
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:53.760]   You know, problems arise when you step over boundaries.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:34:00.960]   You know, in New York City, you may remember about six months ago, there was this gigantic
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.400]   explosion that killed some people in a restaurant.
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.640]   It was downtown Manhattan.
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.600]   And why did it occur?
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:16.680]   It occurred because the folks were, you know, if I remember, you know, connecting gas lines
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:23.200]   and doing construction and other things that were outside of the building codes and not
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:26.880]   getting proper permits to do what they were supposed to do.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:34.080]   Now, you know, you may save a couple of dollars if you do that, but the long term consequence
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.040]   doesn't really pay.
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:42.080]   So you know, yes, you can, you know, put your real estate holdings in an entity and, you
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:46.480]   know, run your properties in a professional way.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:52.640]   You know, if you go out and run your properties in an unprofessional way or a way that tries
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:58.200]   to skirt the rules and regulations, even if you don't think those rules and regulations
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:01.280]   are appropriate, well, then you're going to have problems because people are going to
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.920]   start to complain.
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:08.240]   You know, then they're going to, you know, send information out that you're, you know,
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:11.000]   a bad guy or whatever it might be.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.840]   And then you're going to have people starting to look at, you know, what's going on.
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:21.240]   You know, so if your grass is growing on your property and it's, you know, over the top
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:25.080]   of the building, you know, people are going to start to complain to the town and the town's
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.400]   going to say, "Who owns this house?"
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.880]   And we're going to start to fine you.
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:33.240]   And pretty soon, you know, the neighbor's going to call the six o'clock news and they'll
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:36.200]   bring the cameras out and say, "Oh, look at these people.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:37.640]   Look at how they're running this house.
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:41.760]   They've got, you know, chickens in the backyard and they, you know, don't cut their grass."
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:49.920]   And all of a sudden, you know, you're a media star that you didn't want to be.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:59.080]   So I think that part of it is not only how you own things, but it's how you conduct yourself
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:01.160]   and how you conduct your business.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:09.840]   There's no guarantees, but as long as you do things professionally and in a way that,
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:19.480]   you know, is supposed to be done, so to speak, you lower the risk of, you know, things going
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.480]   wrong.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:26.600]   Again, no guarantees and things, you know, as they say, things can go wrong.
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:29.000]   You know, if they can go wrong, they will go wrong.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.840]   But you know, don't do anything, you know, just haphazardly.
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:37.880]   If you're going to be a real estate investor, you know, don't go into it and say, "Oh, you
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.000]   know, so-and-so did this.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.840]   I'm going to make a million dollars," because it's almost a guarantee that you're going
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:43.840]   to lose.
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:45.480]   You've got to understand what you're doing.
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.240]   You've got to be professional.
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:54.000]   You've got to, you know, as they say, dot your I's, cross your T's, and try to do everything
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   as best you can.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:02.840]   And if you do that, I think, you know, most of the time, you're going to come out ahead
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:05.920]   and you're going to also feel good about what you're doing.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:11.160]   So that would be, again, you know, another very important line of advice that I would,
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.520]   you know, give.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.680]   I fully agree with that advice.
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:19.880]   I think all of us should walk in the light in everything that we do.
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:24.720]   You know, when I prepare my tax returns, a question I ask myself is, "Am I ready to
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:28.160]   hit publish and publish this on the internet?"
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:34.000]   Because it's certainly been a transition for me going from a private, somewhat anonymous
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:41.440]   person to being a public figure, and to some degree, I come under-I feel that burden of
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:44.000]   scrutiny.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.880]   And I agree with you that our business practices must be excellent in everything that we do.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.800]   We must be excellent.
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:56.520]   I don't want to go back to the world of filters and sensors and et cetera.
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:01.920]   I don't want to go back because the fact that anybody in the world can pull out their cell
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:08.480]   phone and point it at a police officer or point it at an agent of government or point
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:13.960]   it at a gang member or something like that, record and live stream that video to the world
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:20.760]   – that is an incredibly positive thing and it will lead, as it has already been leading,
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:25.360]   systematically to the rollback of oppression and to the expansion of liberty.
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:30.080]   My concern is with that, we've lost the gatekeeping function.
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:34.960]   And so historically, if the newspaper reporter came out and interviewed you, the newspaper
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:40.560]   reporter first had a professional reputation to maintain of doing an excellent job.
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:45.200]   Then they had an editorial staff and a fact-checking staff who would say, "Can you prove this?
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.200]   Is this documented?
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.200]   Do you have this interview?
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.600]   Do you have this evidence?"
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:54.600]   And so then when the story was published, there was a higher likelihood that it was
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:55.600]   true.
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:59.440]   Well, in today's world, there's no accounting for truth.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.160]   Nobody is liable for it.
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:08.960]   Anybody can say anything that they want and something can go viral in moments without
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:11.120]   anybody having control over it.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:15.360]   And so the best example is from time to time, there was a big one six months ago when Mark
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:20.000]   Zuckerberg established one of his charitable trust or whatever and it said if you post
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.580]   this – no, it was the Facebook privacy thing about, "Hey, I'm posting this because
[00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:25.160]   Facebook is going to take my property.
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:26.480]   Facebook, you do not have permission."
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:33.320]   Well, this thing is a total hoax but people lack – most people lack any ability or like
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:35.660]   just desire to fact-check anything.
[00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:39.940]   And so they spread misinformation widely and you put these things together, it leads to
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:48.420]   a recipe of – it leads to a real risk that you have to protect yourself not only from
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:55.380]   the dangers of misbehavior, doing gas work without permits and appropriate safety precautions
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:40:00.740]   but you also have to protect yourself from the danger of somebody spreading malicious
[00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:05.940]   unfounded allegations or perhaps even more importantly in the world we live in today
[00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:10.980]   of somebody taking issue with you based upon a political or moral stance.
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:16.540]   I come back again to the baker in Indiana whose business was essentially destroyed because
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:20.700]   they had the unfortunate circumstance of having a politically unpopular opinion and being
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:22.420]   interviewed about it on the news.
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:26.180]   The activists came in, destroyed the Yelp site, had to shut the business down for a
[00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:27.180]   few days.
[00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:30.060]   I've never gone back and followed it up to see where things are today.
[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:33.460]   Those were – that was based not upon any misbehavior.
[00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:36.380]   That was not based upon discrimination in business practice.
[00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:40.980]   That was not based upon mistreating of employees or breaking any laws.
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:46.380]   That was based upon an ideology, a political ideology of disagreement and saying let's
[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:49.900]   use these tools and let's spread it.
[00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:51.300]   And it's actually a major concern.
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:54.300]   I mean I was stunned to see – I don't know if you saw the article in the New York
[00:40:54.300 --> 00:41:01.980]   Times a couple of weeks ago where the Obama administration admitted that in the wake of
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:08.900]   the Iran negotiations that they had seasoned and salted the experts in advance of that,
[00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:16.300]   all of the social media experts in advance to say kind things about the Iran deal.
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:21.220]   This official admitted in print in the New York Times as a named source, not in any kind
[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:26.460]   of anonymous off the record, as a named source, yeah, we went ahead and we positioned these
[00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:27.460]   things.
[00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:32.940]   We positioned these experts, I think it was 40-something experts out there to agitate
[00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:37.400]   for our position and this was publicly admitted.
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:42.820]   So in the climate of these things with regard to wealth, the concern is this is a major
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:46.340]   risk that we have to take steps to protect ourselves.
[00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:52.740]   Those steps come by keeping to ethical, careful business practices that we should always be
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:56.100]   proud for our books to be shown to the light of day.
[00:41:56.100 --> 00:42:01.140]   We should be proud to invite any news camera, any crew onto our property to demonstrate
[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:03.200]   what we're doing in the activity.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:12.020]   But we also have to be thoughtful in how we prepare for baseless allegations which people
[00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:16.980]   could assume to be true either because they lack the ability to fact check and research
[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:21.060]   them because in the press there's no innocent until proven guilty, there's guilty until
[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:22.060]   proven innocent.
[00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:25.780]   Thankfully, the courts still have a different standard but in the press that can destroy
[00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:26.780]   a business overnight.
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:27.780]   Of course, I understand.
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:34.860]   So I didn't mean, sorry, I used that as my soapbox but it's a concern for me.
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:45.820]   But I think what you say is just sort of fundamental and in the United States people have the greatest
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:55.540]   liberty in the world and because of the liberty there are certain aspects to it that you can't
[00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:56.940]   necessarily control.
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:04.220]   But I think that just being diligent and understanding it like you said is very important.
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:12.980]   So did you want me to say a few words about estate planning and getting into the topic?
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:13.980]   Yes, you stole it all.
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:14.980]   I was just going to go there.
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:18.100]   I'm going to go to the segue and segue in there.
[00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:24.100]   So tell me about how this different type of entity ownership can affect probate in the
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:25.940]   settlement of our estate, please.
[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:28.740]   Sure, yeah.
[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:34.700]   And it's important because when you own, no matter what you own, again, it's important
[00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:35.820]   to have a plan.
[00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:40.180]   So you own a house in your name, you own a house in an LLC, you own a house in a corporation,
[00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:47.740]   but what happens with respect to your estate if something happens to you?
[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:54.340]   Well the most important thing that anybody should, that everyone should consider is that
[00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:56.980]   they first need, that they should have a will.
[00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:00.060]   They should do their will.
[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:07.260]   Because if they don't have a will, and this is statewide, all states are the same, if
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:13.740]   you don't have a will, your assets are going to go pursuant to the laws of the state.
[00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:18.940]   So for instance, in New York, if you don't have a will, you die without a will, in New
[00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:24.380]   York your assets are going to your spouse and children, and if you don't have a spouse
[00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:29.300]   or a child, it's going to go to your parents, your parents going brothers and sisters, nieces
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:31.900]   and nephews, and on down.
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:37.180]   Problem that presents is that you don't have the opportunity to plan who's going to get
[00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:38.180]   what.
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:44.020]   Now obviously if you have a wife and children, that's sort of, most of the time, easy, although
[00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:50.500]   you know, it may very well be that you don't want a child to have control over assets or
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:56.820]   have all of the assets or you've made gifts over time to one child and you're going to
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:00.060]   benefit other children in your will.
[00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:08.460]   But in many cases, folks don't have a spouse or children, and their parents may be the
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:14.900]   people next in line, and it may not be the best estate planning to leave your assets
[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:25.940]   to your parents, who may be elderly and not in a position to either handle those assets
[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:33.740]   or it may very well affect the parents' estate plan by loading up all of those assets into
[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:35.900]   their estate.
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:39.580]   And then you get down to brothers and sisters and nieces and nephews, and again, who do
[00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:41.900]   you really want to benefit?
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:49.260]   So the most important thing is to actually think about doing a will so you have a plan
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:51.340]   in front of you.
[00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:56.140]   And then once you take that step, then you have to think about, "Okay, well, I'm doing
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:57.300]   my will.
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:00.540]   What do I want my will to say?"
[00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:06.700]   And again, I think, you know, nowadays you can go online and you can do a will and you
[00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:12.140]   can look at all of this information, and many people do that.
[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:20.300]   But I think that particularly if you're owning property and there are significant, potential
[00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:26.580]   significant consequences to what you're doing, again, it's a good idea to sit down with a
[00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:35.060]   professional so you can understand, you know, A, what is the will going to accomplish, and
[00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:43.700]   B, you know, what's the best way to have this document signed and executed so it will be
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:44.940]   effective?
[00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:51.460]   And another important aspect here, and again, I talk about these things because in my experience
[00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:57.200]   it's the most ignored or misunderstood area.
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:00.140]   People need to understand what a will can do for them.
[00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:04.020]   A will is going to control an asset that's in your name alone.
[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:07.660]   So if I have a piece of real estate that's in my name or in a company that I control
[00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:14.340]   entirely, that, the will's going to say where it goes, pursuant to the will provision.
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:19.620]   But if I own something jointly with somebody else, so let's say I own the real estate,
[00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:25.420]   but it's jointly owned with my wife or with my brother or my friend, right, that property
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:29.460]   is going to automatically go to that person if you own it as joint tenants with rights
[00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:30.620]   of survivorship.
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:34.380]   And I'm pretty sure, I mean, again, I'm talking New York law, but, you know, for the most
[00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:38.860]   part I think the laws are pretty uniform along those lines throughout the country.
[00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:45.180]   So people don't really consider all of the aspects of their plan, and that same rule
[00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:50.180]   is going to control with respect to assets that have beneficiaries.
[00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:54.700]   So let's say you have a retirement account, let's say it's a 401(k), let's say it's a
[00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:58.540]   pension, let's say it's an IRA, or let's say you have life insurance.
[00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:03.220]   All of those assets can have designated beneficiaries.
[00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:08.300]   So when you put that beneficiary on there, when you die, that asset is automatically
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:12.780]   going to go to that person, regardless of what your will says.
[00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:16.020]   So people sit down and they think about, "Well, I'm going to do my estate plan, I'm going
[00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:20.260]   to write my will, and I'm going to say, 'Okay, leave everything to so-and-so.'"
[00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:25.900]   But they don't remember that 20 years ago, you know, they put a different person on as
[00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:30.300]   the beneficiary of, let's say, their IRA when they opened it up and they went into the bank
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:33.620]   and they sat down and they filled out the form, or they put them on their insurance,
[00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:39.660]   or they've got these various things through their employer that they filled out 20 years
[00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:42.020]   ago when they first started to work there.
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:45.380]   So a lot of times I'll sit down with clients, I'll say, "Okay, what are your assets?
[00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:47.100]   You own this, you own that.
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:53.180]   And who's your beneficiary on your retirement account, your 401(k)?"
[00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:54.540]   And they'll say, "Oh, I don't really remember.
[00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:56.180]   I filled it out such a long time ago.
[00:48:56.180 --> 00:49:01.660]   You know, maybe it was my brother because I wasn't married back then, or my life situation
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:05.380]   has changed and I put my parents down and I don't want my parents to get it because
[00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:08.540]   it's going to screw up their estate plan.
[00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:12.460]   You know, they shouldn't have all this money into their accounts now."
[00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:15.940]   So when you sit down, you've got to think about all of these things.
[00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:17.820]   You've got to think about what you own.
[00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:23.220]   You have to think about how you own it, and then you have to develop a plan that's going
[00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:26.420]   to reflect what your intentions are.
[00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:29.540]   And these intentions and circumstances can change over time.
[00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:34.060]   So you constantly have to think about whether or not you should update your will.
[00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:37.860]   Now, obviously you don't have to update a will every other day, but you know, five years,
[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:39.780]   10 years, situations change.
[00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:40.780]   People die.
[00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:46.180]   People are no longer intended to be beneficiaries.
[00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:50.460]   So you really have to consider all of these aspects.
[00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:56.300]   And you know, it's just part of, if you're going to take on the responsibility of owning
[00:49:56.300 --> 00:50:05.900]   stuff and building up an estate, you should make sure that an estate can benefit somebody
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:08.980]   in the future pursuant to what your wishes are.
[00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:12.500]   And you really need to think about estate taxes as well.
[00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:16.740]   Now, on the federal level, you don't have to worry about estate taxes until you get
[00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:22.460]   to, I forgot the exact number this year, it's 5.4 million, I think 5.435, something like
[00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:23.940]   that million dollars.
[00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:28.340]   So anybody that can have an estate, you're not going to have federal estate tax if your
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:31.020]   estate is under that number.
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:37.260]   And if you have a spouse, everything you give to your spouse, you give to them tax free.
[00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:40.900]   That's what we call a 100% marital deduction.
[00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:47.460]   So technically speaking, on the federal level, two people that are married can dispose of
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:55.900]   over $10 million of assets without worrying about any, you know, with proper planning,
[00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:58.780]   without worrying about any federal estate tax.
[00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:04.740]   Now, on the local level here in New York State, the cutoff point is, I forgot what it is exactly,
[00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:11.580]   is 4 million something, and within a year or two, it's going to be equal to the federal
[00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:12.900]   exemption as well.
[00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:17.260]   I know down in Florida, I don't believe you have an estate tax at all.
[00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:21.660]   And I don't believe you have any local state tax as well.
[00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:26.620]   So depending on the jurisdiction that you're in, you know, state income tax.
[00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:31.140]   So depending on the jurisdiction you're in, you know, you have different considerations
[00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:35.620]   and different impacts, you know, that may occur.
[00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:40.220]   So it's important to sit down with your professional advisors, and it's important to plan this
[00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:41.220]   out.
[00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:46.620]   You know, some people do regular wills, some people do what we call living wills, you know,
[00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:52.300]   where they put everything in a living trust, where they put everything in a trust right
[00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:53.300]   away.
[00:51:53.300 --> 00:52:01.340]   So, you know, those are all planning vehicles that people need to think about and discuss
[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:02.340]   so they understand.
[00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:06.300]   And again, you can go on the internet, you can learn a lot about this.
[00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:15.020]   You know, I have a website that has loads of articles about real estate, about wills.
[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:20.860]   I publish a blog every week, a New York Probate Lawyer blog, where I publish an article every
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:27.180]   week about, you know, some aspect of probate law or guardianship.
[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:34.740]   So there are loads of resources that people have at hand where they can learn about, you
[00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:37.900]   know, these different areas, and they should take advantage of it.
[00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:42.960]   Yeah, it takes a little time and effort, but it's well worth it to make sure that things
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:43.960]   occur.
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:48.340]   I mean, every day I'm involved with cases in the surrogates court, which is the probate
[00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:54.940]   court here in New York, where things just weren't done right and people are fighting
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:53:00.300]   about various things, whether it be will contests or other things.
[00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:06.140]   I mean, you know, I've seen cases where people do wills and then, you know, they end up doing
[00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:08.260]   another will and they don't tell people about it.
[00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:12.140]   And then the second will is found and they're fighting about whether or not that will is
[00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:13.140]   valid.
[00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:22.780]   You know, recently in the news you read about Summer Redstone, who was the, you know, head
[00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:31.100]   of Viacom, and there is a trial going on as to whether or not his, you know, this woman
[00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:39.300]   who he was friends with has the right to make decisions for him and whether there's a health
[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:43.420]   directive that's valid that he signed for her.
[00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:47.780]   And you know, this fellow obviously is suffering from dementia and, you know, he has to go
[00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:52.180]   through a trial to see, you know, who's going to make decisions for him.
[00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:57.700]   And this is a fellow who's, you know, the head of Viacom that owns CBS.
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:02.900]   So you know, no matter what you do, you know, you read every day about all of these, you
[00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:04.580]   know, these issues.
[00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:10.660]   You could just recently, Prince, you know, died and apparently didn't have a will.
[00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:13.700]   And you know, so they have all these relatives saying, "Oh, you know, I'm his next of kin.
[00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:14.700]   I'm his sister.
[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:19.020]   I'm his, you know, half-sister and brother and I should share his estate."
[00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:24.700]   I'm sure if he had, you know, if he had the opportunity to go back and change this, you
[00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:27.820]   know, he'd say, "Well, I want, you know, this to happen."
[00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:33.260]   Maybe he'd want to set up a foundation or give some of his works to a charity.
[00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:34.260]   Who knows?
[00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:38.780]   But if you don't do it, you know, you can't, you know, can't see it fulfilled.
[00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:45.660]   So that again is, you know, some very important advice that I would give to folks to, you
[00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:49.700]   know, think about these things and understand it in connection with all of their real estate
[00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:52.140]   and, you know, whatever assets they have.
[00:54:52.140 --> 00:55:01.220]   You know, it's the, you know, it's just one part of being, you know, responsible about
[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:04.180]   what's going on in your life.
[00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:10.300]   So there's one final question for you specifically with regard to probate and specifically with
[00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:14.380]   regard to real estate.
[00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:20.600]   One of the most valuable benefits of real estate is that – excuse me.
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:25.060]   One valuable aspect of real estate is that it's capital property.
[00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:31.180]   And so at the death, at my death, if it's capital property, my capital property that
[00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:34.140]   I leave to my heirs will receive a step up in tax basis.
[00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:40.020]   So for the benefit of the audience, if I buy the property for $150,000 and I die – excuse
[00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:41.020]   me.
[00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:44.820]   I own the property and let's say I want to sell it for $450,000.
[00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:51.620]   Well, if I sell it while I'm alive, I'm going to incur $300,000 of taxable gain and
[00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:54.620]   I'll owe income tax on that taxable gain.
[00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:59.960]   But if I die and leave that capital property to my beneficiaries, they will inherit it
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:07.660]   and at the time of death, it will – they will inherit it with a tax basis of $450,000.
[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:14.540]   And as long as I am – as long as I can avoid the estate tax by simply being under the exemption
[00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:19.820]   amounts and let's assume that for the sake of simplicity because if I have an estate
[00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:22.940]   that's in excess of the exemption amounts, I have a $50 million estate.
[00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:25.720]   I've got a plan for the estate tax that would be due on that.
[00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:28.740]   But here we're just talking about a person with a couple of rental houses.
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:34.900]   If I die and leave that $450,000 property to my beneficiaries, they can then take it,
[00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:35.900]   turn around.
[00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:40.620]   They can sell that property and they'll have $450,000 that comes to them completely
[00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:45.580]   income tax-free and – income tax-free which is really nice.
[00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:52.660]   Now if I own that property within a corporation, an LLC or a trust, let's just restrict it
[00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:55.360]   to an LLC or a corporation.
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:57:02.340]   What is the tax treatment of that rental house for my heirs with regard to them receiving
[00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:03.340]   the property?
[00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:04.340]   Okay.
[00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:14.300]   Sometimes that can be an issue because you may not get within the entity the same step
[00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:17.920]   up in basis.
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:23.900]   So it is something that you need to look at closely and you need to understand it within
[00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:33.060]   the context of your estate and how your ownership of the property is going to benefit you while
[00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:39.940]   you're alive and ultimately what your plans are for that property.
[00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:41.380]   You're going to be selling the property.
[00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:47.820]   You're going to be taking the proceeds and then reinvesting it during your life.
[00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:55.340]   But I have run across that issue in the past and I don't recall the exact provision under
[00:57:55.340 --> 00:58:01.980]   the tax code, but I do recall that there have been issues as to whether or not you can get
[00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:09.340]   that same step up in basis because you don't own the property individually and it doesn't
[00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:15.980]   get stepped up inside of the entity.
[00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:21.940]   So you may not get that same benefit with respect to the step up and then when you sell
[00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:28.140]   it, obviously, or the estate sells it or the beneficiary sells it, ultimately you may end
[00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:33.880]   up with some type of an income tax gain.
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:37.300]   So again, it is something you need to look at in your overall plan.
[00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:39.620]   I'll have to keep digging into that.
[00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:44.340]   It's a question I was thinking about the other day and I didn't know the answer because I
[00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:46.540]   guess it would depend on the valuation of the shares.
[00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:51.860]   So an S-Corporation and LLC are both pass-through entities, so we would have to value the member
[00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:55.380]   units or the shares in some way.
[00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:57.380]   It's interesting.
[00:58:57.380 --> 00:59:01.940]   I'll have to keep looking.
[00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:07.740]   I have come across and I can't recall this section of the tax code, but I think that
[00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:13.580]   there have been issues about getting the step up because of the intervening layer of the
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:14.580]   entity.
[00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:15.580]   Right.
[00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:16.580]   Right.
[00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:22.980]   And really what that points you to is that no matter what you do, you need to look at
[00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:28.420]   it and understand what you're doing in the context of how you want to plan this out so
[00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:34.100]   you understand what the consequence will be with respect to what you're doing and then
[00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:42.700]   weigh what you're doing or what the potential result would be from what you're doing against
[00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:44.880]   not doing it or doing something else.
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:47.460]   And then you can make what we call a good business decision.
[00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:48.460]   Indeed.
[00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:58.420]   Jules, your website is JulesHasAttorney.com and I'll link that in the blog post and show
[00:59:58.420 --> 00:59:59.420]   notes for today's show.
[00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:02.980]   Any other websites or resources that you'd like to share with my audience that would
[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:05.300]   be helpful to them?
[01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:15.660]   I think that obviously my website is helpful and I have a blog as I said.
[01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:17.260]   I do this myself.
[01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:21.700]   You can just type in estate planning.
[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:24.060]   You can type in anything on real estate.
[01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:28.660]   When I have issues or questions, you can just go surf the web.
[01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:35.340]   I mean there's not one particular area that I would suggest or recommend but anything
[01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:41.500]   that you're looking at, obviously look at more than one site because you're going to
[01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:48.580]   get additional information and then you're going to be able to assess the value of the
[01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:49.980]   site that you're looking at.
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:54.380]   Obviously some sites have more information or more detailed information and may really
[01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:57.820]   hit the mark on the question that you're asking.
[01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:02.620]   And your tax questions, again, you can look them up.
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:03.780]   It's an amazing thing.
[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:06.660]   I always wonder how all that information gets out there.
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:09.260]   It's amazing but it's there.
[01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:12.940]   It's like I need this information, I need a recipe, boom.
[01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:15.060]   You punch the button and you got it.
[01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:16.060]   Indeed.
