[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.080]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.920]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.760]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.080]   Today, my guest is Dr. Sarah Gottfried.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.160]   Dr. Sarah Gottfried is an obstetrician gynecologist
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.960]   who did her undergraduate training in bioengineering
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.400]   at the University of Washington in Seattle.
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.040]   She then completed her medical training
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.440]   at Harvard Medical School,
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.320]   and she currently is a clinical professor
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.680]   of integrative medicine and nutritional sciences
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.800]   at Thomas Jefferson University.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.440]   She has also been a clinician treating men and women
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.220]   in various aspects of hormone health and longevity
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.200]   for more than 20 years.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.760]   She is an expert in not just traditional medicine
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.880]   as it relates to hormones and fertility,
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.960]   but also nutritional practices,
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.280]   supplementation and behavioral practices,
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.440]   and combining all of that expertise
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.600]   in order to help women navigate every aspect and dimension
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.000]   of their hormones, longevity, and vitality,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.360]   ranging from puberty to young adulthood,
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.080]   adulthood, perimenopause, and menopause.
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.300]   And nowadays, she's also treating men across the lifespan
[00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.080]   in terms of longevity, vitality, and hormone health.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.100]   During today's discussion,
[00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.920]   Dr. Gottfried shares an enormous amount of information
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.080]   and tools that women can apply toward their hormone health,
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.240]   fertility, vitality, and longevity.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.800]   We discussed the gut microbiome,
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.400]   which many people have heard about,
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.500]   but Dr. Gottfried points out the specific needs
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.120]   that women have in terms of managing their gut microbiome
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.100]   and the ways that that influences things
[00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.080]   like estrogen levels and metabolism,
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.440]   testosterone, thyroid, and growth hormone, and much more.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.120]   We also discussed nutrition and exercise.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.360]   We touch on how the omega-3 fatty acids
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.120]   play a particularly important role
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.800]   in managing female hormone health.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.840]   Dr. Gottfried points out why women have particular needs
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.680]   when it comes to essential fatty acids
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.440]   and how best to obtain those essential fatty acids
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.960]   for hormone health.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.820]   We also discuss exercise, and she offers
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.960]   some surprising information about the types and ratios
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.460]   of resistance training to cardiovascular training
[00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.600]   that women ought to use
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.160]   in order to maximize their hormone health.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.280]   We also talk a lot about the digestive system.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.420]   This was a surprising aspect of the conversation
[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.580]   I did not anticipate.
[00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.560]   Dr. Gottfried shared with us, for instance,
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.420]   that women suffer from digestive issues
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.940]   at more than 10 times the frequency that do men,
[00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.820]   and fortunately, that there are tools specific to women
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.660]   that they can use in order to overcome
[00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.480]   those digestive issues, and that in overcoming
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.480]   those digestive issues, they can overcome
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.840]   many of the related hormone issues that so many women face.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.640]   Dr. Gottfried also shares with you tremendous knowledge
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.160]   about the specific types of tests, not just blood tests,
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.760]   but also urine and microbiome tests that women can use
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.160]   in order to really get a clear understanding
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.320]   of their hormone status, not just of present,
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.040]   but also where the trajectory of their hormones
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.980]   is taking them.
[00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.880]   So we have an avid discussion about puberty,
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.880]   about young adulthood, adulthood, perimenopause,
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.900]   and how best to manage and navigate perimenopause
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.320]   and menopause, including a discussion
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.080]   about hormone replacement therapy.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.400]   In addition to her academic and clinical expertise,
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.560]   Dr. Gottfried has authored many important books
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.020]   on nutrition, hormones, and supplementation
[00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.200]   as it relates to women and to people generally.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.560]   The two books that I'd like to highlight
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.200]   and that we've provided links to in the show note captions
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.600]   are "Women, Food, and Hormones" and "The Hormone Cure."
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.160]   I read "The Hormone Cure" and found it
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.440]   to be tremendously interesting and informative,
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.880]   not just in terms of teaching me about female hormone health
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.080]   and various treatments for female hormone health,
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.560]   but also as a man trying to understand
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.400]   how the endocrine system interacts with mindset,
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.320]   nutrition, and supplementation more generally.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.320]   So I highly recommend "The Hormone Cure"
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.920]   for anybody interested in hormones and hormone health,
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.360]   and "Women, Food, and Hormones" in particular for women,
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.660]   although again, both books are going to be
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.200]   strongly informative for women wishing to optimize
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.880]   their hormone health, vitality, and longevity.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.480]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.200]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.440]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.100]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.780]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:04.940]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.680]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.720]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.880]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.960]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.700]   I spent a lifetime working on the biology
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.360]   of the visual system, and I can tell you
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.880]   that your visual system has to contend
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.620]   with an enormous number of challenges
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.540]   in order for you to be able to see clearly.
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.720]   So for instance, when you go from a very brightly lit area
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.160]   to a dim lit area, your visual system has to make
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.920]   all sorts of adjustments that allow you
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.700]   to still see your environment.
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.860]   Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses were built
[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.120]   with the biology of the visual system in mind.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.680]   So no matter what environment you're in,
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.840]   you'll be able to see with perfect clarity.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.500]   And they have terrific aesthetics
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.900]   and an enormous number of choices in terms of aesthetics.
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.220]   So unlike a lot of so-called performance eyeglasses
[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.640]   out there that only give you the option
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.540]   to wear the ones that make you look like a cyborg,
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.220]   they have those options, but they also have a lot of options
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.400]   with aesthetics that you would be perfectly comfortable
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.840]   wearing to work or to dinner or anywhere else.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.880]   If you'd like to try Roca glasses, you can go to roca.com,
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.120]   that's R-O-K-A.com, and enter the code Huberman

[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.880]   Again, that's R-O-K-A.com,
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.200]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.000]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.980]   Thesis makes custom nootropics.
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.640]   And as many of you know, I'm not a fan of the word nootropics
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.040]   because nootropics means smart drugs.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.220]   And as a neuroscientist, I can tell you,
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.100]   there is no neural circuit in the brain for being smart.
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.080]   Thesis understands this and has designed different nootropics
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.600]   in order to bring your brain into specific states
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.980]   for specific types of work.
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.060]   So for instance, for creative work
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.060]   or to engage with more focus or to give you more energy
[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.700]   for cognitive or physical work.
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.760]   So with Thesis, they'll design custom nootropics for you
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.160]   that will allow you more focus, better task switching,
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.780]   more creativity, and so on.
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.160]   And they'll be sure to include only the ingredients
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.680]   that you want and not the ingredients that you don't.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.880]   I've been using Thesis for more than a year now,
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.960]   and I can confidently say that their nootropics
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.940]   have been a total game changer for me.
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.480]   I like the clarity formula
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.080]   prior to long bouts of cognitive work
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.360]   or the energy formula prior to physical workouts.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.200]   If you'd like to try
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.960]   your own personalized nootropic starter kit,
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.040]   go online to takethesis.com/huberman.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.480]   You'll take a brief three minute quiz
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.400]   and Thesis will send you four different formulas
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.760]   to try in your first month.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.280]   Again, that's takethesis.com/huberman
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.880]   and use the code Huberman at checkout for 10% off
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.960]   your first box.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.460]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.880]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.080]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.740]   That means the exact ratios of electrolytes are an element,
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.640]   and those are sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.140]   but it has no sugar.
[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.860]   I've talked many times before on this podcast
[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.520]   about the key role of hydration and electrolytes
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.880]   for nerve cell function, neuron function,
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.660]   as well as the function of all the cells
[00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.580]   and all the tissues and organ systems of the body.
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.880]   If we have sodium, magnesium, and potassium
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.520]   present in the proper ratios,
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.520]   all of those cells function properly
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.560]   and all our bodily systems can be optimized.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.440]   If the electrolytes are not present
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.220]   and if hydration is low,
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.180]   we simply can't think as well as we would otherwise,
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.560]   our mood is off, hormone systems go off,
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.640]   our ability to get into physical action,
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.300]   to engage in endurance and strength
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.900]   and all sorts of other things is diminished.
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.500]   So with Element, you can make sure
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.160]   that you're staying on top of your hydration
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.000]   and that you're getting the proper ratios of electrolytes.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.320]   If you'd like to try Element, you can go to Drink Element,
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.800]   that's lmnt.com/huberman,
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.640]   and you'll get a free Element sample pack
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.560]   with your purchase.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.400]   They're all delicious.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.820]   So again, if you want to try Element,
[00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.360]   you can go to elementlmnt.com/huberman.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.480]   The Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.320]   is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.640]   To find the supplements we discuss
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.880]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.500]   you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S,
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.080]   livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.080]   I should just mention that the library of those supplements
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.640]   is constantly expanding.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.760]   Again, that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.840]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Sarah Gottfried.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.120]   Dr. Gottfried, Sarah, welcome.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.640]   - Thank you, so happy to be here.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.940]   - Yeah, I'm delighted and very excited to ask you
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.780]   about an enormous number of topics.
[00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.400]   You are expert in so many things.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.560]   So the challenge for me is going to be
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.480]   to constrain this walk, as it were,
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.580]   but I'm hoping that we can touch on
[00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.540]   a great number of things today.
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:14.460]   The first of which is really about hormones
[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.860]   and female hormones in particular.
[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.700]   And I have a question, which is,
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:22.440]   is it ever informative for a woman,
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.560]   regardless of age, to know something about her mother's,
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.160]   perhaps even her grandmother's experience
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.820]   vis-a-vis hormones, not just pregnancy challenges with,
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.740]   or ease with pregnancy and child, rearing childbirth,
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.900]   this sort of thing, but what sorts of conversations
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.360]   should women be having with themselves
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.240]   and with family members to get a window
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.780]   into what their specific needs might be?
[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.580]   - Love this question.
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:54.120]   So my work is really at the interface
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.360]   between genetics and environment.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.260]   So your question gets to both.
[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.920]   And I think it's essential that you understand
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.900]   what your grandmother went through.
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.140]   I'd even say your great-grandmother,
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.980]   depending on longevity in your family.
[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.940]   So I grew up with my great-grandmother, I get that.
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.940]   And especially your mother.
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:19.500]   So I would probably start first with trauma,
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.300]   an intergenerational trauma,
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:25.340]   because I think that affects the endocrine system so hugely,
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.260]   especially cortisol signaling,
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.720]   but the broader pine system,
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.260]   psycho-immuno-neuro-endocrine system.
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:38.220]   And then there's, you know, if I think about the stages,
[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.360]   the life cycle that a woman goes through,
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.460]   if you think about puberty, I think,
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.360]   I don't know how genetically determined
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.500]   the age of puberty is.
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.260]   Certainly there's a lot of environmental influences,
[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.380]   like toxins can affect it.
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:59.220]   But pregnancy, the age at which you start to go through,
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.100]   perimenopause, menopause,
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.940]   many of those have a genetic component.
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:06.900]   So with pregnancy, I mean,
[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.380]   you can certainly think the shape of the pelvis,
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.660]   your ability to have a vaginal birth,
[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.200]   some of that is genetically determined.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.580]   I mean, you do have, you know,
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:20.300]   the sperm donor affecting some of that.
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.460]   But, you know, in my family, for instance,
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.420]   we have no cesarean sections.
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.620]   So everyone goes through this process
[00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.140]   of a relatively easy vaginal birth.
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.600]   I was a forceps baby, but, you know, for the most part,
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.820]   you can find out about that.
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.260]   And then there's certain female conditions
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:43.300]   that have a very strong component genetically,
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.300]   most of which run in my family.
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:49.180]   So that includes endometriosis, fibroids,
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.060]   I just had a hysterectomy.
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:56.060]   I had 50 plus fibroids and polycystic ovarian syndrome.
[00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:00.100]   - And of those three, how frequent are those?
[00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.600]   And maybe I can constrain the question a little bit
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.860]   by saying today's discussion,
[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.760]   I imagine is going to be heard by men and women
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:07.840]   of all sorts of ages.
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.260]   So maybe I'll direct the question a little bit toward,
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.300]   you know, at what age should these discussions start?
[00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:19.780]   You know, we always imagine that women in their 30s
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.820]   and 40s and 50s and onward should be getting certain tests
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:26.220]   and addressing things like ovarian reserve
[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.860]   and other sorts of things.
[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:31.140]   But, you know, maybe we could march through and just say,
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:35.180]   for a woman in her teens who's already hit puberty,
[00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.140]   what sorts of biomarkers,
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:40.700]   whether or not they're blood-based or phenotyping,
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.800]   you know, the outward appearance of,
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.820]   should those young women be paying attention to,
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.660]   likewise for women in their 20s, 30s,
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.260]   maybe we could take it more or less by decade,
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.580]   starting at puberty, assuming that woman hits puberty
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.260]   sometime between what is it now?
[00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.480]   The average in the U.S. is somewhere between 12
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.420]   and 16 years old, do I have that right?
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.380]   - No, you do not.
[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.960]   - Oh, great, I love to be wrong, so.
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:08.580]   - So it used to be 12 to 16, I would say 50 years ago.
[00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.800]   It's been moving younger.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.700]   And we think some of that is related to toxin exposure,
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:20.220]   as I mentioned, but I was 10 when I went through puberty.
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.860]   So, well, I should say men are key.
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:26.300]   And I started growing breasts much before that.
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:30.580]   So I think now I'm gonna step away
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:31.640]   from the science for a moment.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.140]   I'm gonna do that pretty fluidly and I'll try to call it out.
[00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:39.200]   I think there's also a huge influence from stress
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.480]   and like the development of the adrenal glands.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.000]   So going back to the science,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:51.140]   the issue in teenage years is that the hypothalamic,
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:56.420]   pituitary, adrenal axis, and I like to think of it broader.
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:01.420]   So stay with me, hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal,
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:06.420]   gonadal of recent women, testes men, thyroid, gut axis.
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:10.320]   So that to me is the control system.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.300]   So I'm kind of expressing my bioengineering side here.
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.140]   - Well, I think it's great to include the other organs
[00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:19.140]   and tissue systems of the body, because as we both know
[00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.140]   that the narrow definition of just hypothalamic,
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.940]   pituitary, adrenal, it can't be just that, right?
[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.020]   - No. - It can't.
[00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:27.100]   - No. - Yeah.
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.080]   - It doesn't tell the whole story.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:34.080]   So if you look at the main sex hormones
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:38.060]   in a young woman who's in her teenage years,
[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:42.140]   the hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal, gonadal part of that
[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:44.100]   is not fully mature.
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.340]   So they're more likely to skip periods,
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.340]   especially under stress.
[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.940]   They have a lot of influences.
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.100]   It really doesn't get well-established
[00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.240]   until you're done with adolescence.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:58.580]   And I'm told that adolescence now is till like age 25 to 26.
[00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:00.860]   I heard that and I was like, "I've got two daughters."
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.300]   And I was thinking, "That's a really long time."
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:08.180]   - And not just psychologically defined or biopsychosocial?
[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.340]   - Mostly psychologically defined.
[00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:12.340]   I heard that from a psychologist.
[00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:17.220]   So biomarkers you asked about.
[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.900]   In your teenage years, what I think is really interesting
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.520]   is to look at cortisol.
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.900]   To look at the dance between estrogen and progesterone
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.700]   in those years is less helpful
[00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.660]   because I think there's a lot of variability
[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.140]   due to the immaturity of the system.
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.780]   If you've got someone who's got really regular periods,
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.860]   it's probably better to do some benchmarking at that age.
[00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.820]   But generally I find that benchmarking
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.360]   is best performed in your 20s or 30s.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:48.360]   - Are periods not that regular in terms of duration
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:52.840]   of the menstrual cycle when the menstrual cycle first sets in?
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.240]   - It depends.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.180]   So I was like clockwork every 28 days
[00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:00.200]   until I had my hysterectomy in August.
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.840]   Same thing with my daughters.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.220]   I've got two daughters, one's 17, the other's 23.
[00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:09.280]   For a lot of women, they're not regular.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.880]   And then there's the whole piece of oral contraceptives
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.920]   and other forms of contraception
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.920]   where you have no idea what the normal cycle is.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.460]   And I hope we'll have some time
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.480]   to talk a little bit about oral contraceptives
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:26.280]   because I think this is now opinion again and not science.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.800]   I think it is the number one endocrinopathy
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.900]   that is iatrogenic for women.
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.080]   - We will definitely talk about it.
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.480]   I get a lot of questions about oral contraceptives
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.240]   in the social media space
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:43.160]   and also questions about IUDs quite a lot.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.000]   - Totally.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.840]   - In particular, copper IUDs, non-hormonal IUDs.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.880]   So we will definitely touch on that.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.440]   - I'm an IUD crusader,
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.640]   so I just want to give you that warning.
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.600]   - You're a fan, do I have that right?
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.560]   Or you're anti-
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:56.760]   - I am a huge fan.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.280]   - Uh-huh, which IUDs in particular?
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:03.520]   - So I like copper because it's non-hormonal.
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.300]   It's as effective as getting your tubes tied.
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.140]   - Who would have thought?
[00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:07.960]   - Right.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.440]   - Is that toxic to the sperm mobility?
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.940]   Is that how it works?
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.520]   That's my understanding of it is that it basically,
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.080]   it's like more or less an electric fence
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.720]   to the sperm cap and just that's it.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.160]   - Electric fence is a bit of a harsh analogy,
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.140]   but I'll work with that.
[00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.120]   But it's, you know, to have something
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.720]   that can last for 10 years
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.360]   so that you really have complete autonomy
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:35.840]   and sovereignty over your sexual life, that's profound.
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.000]   And to not get all those downstream risks
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.740]   that are associated with a birth control pill.
[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.280]   The other thing that's important to know about it,
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.580]   I know this is a sidebar,
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:46.680]   women who use the copper IUD
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.220]   have the highest satisfaction rate
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:54.220]   of anyone on contraceptives, the highest satisfaction rate.
[00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:59.280]   And yet it is the least used of all forms of contraception.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:04.760]   Now my favorite is vasectomy, but short of vasectomy,
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.520]   I think the IUD is a really great choice.
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.000]   There are some risks associated with it.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.920]   I'm not saying it's risk-free, but I love the IUD.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.060]   And I love it for younger women too.
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.520]   'Cause it used to be that when I went through my training,
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.200]   which was 30 years ago, we were told, you know,
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.240]   don't put it in someone who hasn't had a baby.
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.960]   And that is patriarchal messaging.
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.720]   But getting back to your original question,
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.960]   which is about biomarkers per decade.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   In your 20s, that's when you want to do some base casing
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.200]   with estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:44.640]   So I think it's really helpful to know about this tango.
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.480]   You're from Argentina or your father.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.920]   - I have Argentine lineage.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:48.760]   - Yes.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.600]   - My grandparents did tango into their late 80s.
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:56.220]   I am, I'm in my late 40s and I still haven't started.
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:57.300]   So I suppose there's time.
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.780]   - It might be time for you to do that.
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:00.620]   - Okay.
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.280]   - There might be a factor in their longevity.
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.460]   Did they have good health span?
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:05.460]   Not just life span?
[00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:08.660]   - And my grandfather smoked cigarettes daily,
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:11.320]   remained mentally sharp until he died in his late 90s,
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.020]   but almost burned down their apartment several times,
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.440]   falling asleep with a cigarette in his mouth.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.980]   So I don't recommend anyone smoke by the way,
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:21.180]   but it was a coffee, mate, red meat and cigarettes.
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.220]   And they lived into their 90s.
[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:25.540]   So that side of my family has the genetic advantage.
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:29.020]   The other side, less so, but in any event,
[00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:32.200]   tango is a 2023 goal.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.300]   It has been every year.
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:37.140]   - I'm going to hold you accountable to that.
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:37.980]   - Okay, will do.
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.220]   And no, there will be no YouTube video of me doing tango.
[00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.380]   - At least not initially.
[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.960]   - Tim Ferriss, actually, a phenomenal podcaster,
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:48.980]   as we know, he's a bad-ass tango dancer.
[00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.740]   I know this through various sources.
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.340]   - Yes, I've seen.
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.960]   Yeah, so this tango between estrogen and progesterone
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.660]   is incredibly important.
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:58.500]   You want to have the right lead.
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.820]   You want to have the right follow between the two hormones.
[00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.540]   Again, I'm stepping away from my science hat.
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.860]   But what happens a lot of the time
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:10.460]   is that estrogen dominates in that tango.
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.820]   And when that happens, it sets you up
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:17.820]   for greater risk of fibroids, endometriosis, breast pain,
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:23.020]   probably in association with the microbiome
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.100]   and the estrobilome.
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:26.980]   - Can you familiarize me with the estrobilome?
[00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:28.980]   - Yeah. - I'm delighted to know
[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.700]   that I don't recognize the term.
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:34.460]   - Yeah, so the estrobilome is the set of microbes
[00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:38.600]   in, and their DNA, their DNA mostly,
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:42.980]   in the gut microbiome, that set of microbes in their DNA.
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:46.900]   So it's in the, if you look at the totality,
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:52.780]   the subset of particular bacteria modulate estrogen levels.
[00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:58.080]   So a lot of this work was spearheaded by Martin Glaser.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:03.580]   And what we know is that there are some women
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:08.580]   who have an estrobilome that makes them have a greater risk
[00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:13.780]   of certain estrogen-mediated conditions like breast cancer,
[00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:18.380]   endometrial cancer, and in men, prostate cancer.
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.700]   So the estrobilome is incredibly important.
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.140]   There's not a lot of attention paid to it.
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:26.660]   But I always think in terms of my patients,
[00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:30.580]   could this be someone who's got a faulty estrobilome,
[00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:35.580]   and we need to adjust it with some of the microbiome
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:41.360]   modulating nutrients, nutraceuticals that we have,
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.420]   so that they're less likely to have that tango
[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.940]   that's not working with estrogen or testosterone.
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.740]   So getting back to the biomarkers,
[00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:53.900]   if you gave me an unlimited budget,
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:57.180]   which I kind of have with some of my clients
[00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:00.020]   that I work with now, what I would wanna know
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.860]   is estrogen, progesterone, testosterone,
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.600]   and I want the timing right for that.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.060]   I'd wanna know about DHEA
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.540]   and sort of the whole androgen pathway.
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.280]   I'd wanna know about the metabolites of estrogen
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:18.260]   because some of them are protective and very helpful.
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:21.660]   Others are a bit like Homer Simpson.
[00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.980]   I mean, they are just like causing all kinds of problems
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:28.200]   in your body, increasing the risk of quinones,
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:32.420]   like DNA damage, and potentially an increased risk
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:36.040]   of breast cancer, although that data I think is mixed.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.200]   I'd also like to know about their stool.
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.300]   So I wanna know about the microbiome.
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.940]   So the best that we have right now is to look
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:47.300]   when we do stool testing, and I do a lot of stool testing.
[00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:51.020]   We can look at things like beta-glucuronidase.
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.600]   Are you familiar with BG?
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.340]   - I'm familiar with it as a term.
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:57.060]   And so for those listening, very often,
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:58.860]   not always when you hear an ACE, A-S-E,
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:21:59.940]   you're dealing with an enzyme.
[00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.100]   So we can take a stab there.
[00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.660]   And it sounds like it's somehow involved
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:08.620]   in glucose metabolism of some sort, or is it?
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:10.140]   - Glucuronidation.
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.760]   So it's involved in, when you produce estrogen in the body,
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.600]   this is like the simplified version,
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:21.460]   but when you produce estrogen, you are meant to use it,
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.660]   like send it to the receptors where it's meant to go,
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.300]   and then lose it.
[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:28.480]   You don't wanna keep recirculating the estrogen,
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.980]   like bad karma.
[00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.540]   And that's what happens with people
[00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:35.140]   who have high beta-glucuronidase.
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:36.660]   So it's this enzyme that's produced
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.400]   by three bacteria in particular in the gut.
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.940]   And I see a lot of men and women
[00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:45.140]   who have elevated beta-glucuronidase,
[00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:47.960]   and then they have some estrogen dominance related to that.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.620]   Is that the total reason?
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:50.860]   We don't really know.
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:53.260]   But it's one of the drivers, it's one of the levers.
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:55.720]   - And it can be detected from a microbiome,
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:56.900]   AKA stool sample.
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:57.800]   - That's right.
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:01.040]   - And in terms of blood testing or various tests
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.080]   for these other biomarkers,
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:05.280]   getting estrogen, testosterone, and other ratios,
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:09.180]   I realize people have different means, financial means,
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:12.280]   but in general, people wanting to do a blood test,
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.680]   it sounds like they're going to need to do it,
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.480]   women will need to do it at different stages
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.640]   of their menstrual cycle if they had to pick one,
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.120]   either in the follicular phase
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:25.360]   or in the luteal stage of their ovarian menstrual cycle,
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.720]   excuse me, ovulatory menstrual cycle.
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:30.940]   When would you suggest they do that if they had to pick one?
[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:33.060]   - So if you forced me to pick one,
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:38.060]   I would say probably day 21 to 22 for someone in her 20s.
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:42.300]   So we're focused right now on that decade.
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:45.120]   So for most women, they've got a menstrual cycle date
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.260]   that averages out at 28 days.
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:51.480]   So this is about a week before they start their period.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:54.360]   For women who are more irregular, it's harder to do that.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:57.940]   As women get older, and we'll talk about this in a moment,
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.120]   usually the cycle gets a little shorter.
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:04.080]   So as they start to decline in their progesterone production
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.960]   their period gets a little closer together.
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.920]   Like mine before August was about every 26 days.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:14.920]   So at that point you want to test sooner, like day 19, 20.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.660]   And I'm not talking about blood tests.
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.040]   So a blood test is the cheapest thing.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.320]   It's usually what's covered by insurance.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.660]   But my preference would be to do dried urine.
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.100]   I like to use saliva for cortisol.
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.780]   I like to use dried urine so that I get metabolomics
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:32.680]   in addition to the levels of these hormones.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.200]   And if I'm forced to, I'll use blood testing.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.580]   And that's certainly the gold standard
[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:40.180]   for all of these hormones that we're talking about.
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:43.920]   But it's not as comprehensive.
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.960]   And as you know, it's a quick little snapshot
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:49.100]   while the needle's in your vein for 30 seconds.
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.200]   - Yeah, the salivary cortisol makes sense to me
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.100]   'cause my understanding is that you get free cortisol
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:54.600]   which is the active cortisol.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.680]   You said with urine, you're also getting the metabolites.
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.520]   - That's right.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.200]   - And then for blood testing,
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.200]   you're getting sort of a crude window into the averages.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.840]   - A static, total level.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:11.280]   So let me go back and say one other thing about biomarkers.
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.100]   A big part of the testing that I do
[00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.540]   in phenotyping my patients, I practice precision medicine.
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:21.540]   So I like to almost start with nutritional testing.
[00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:26.880]   I don't think I've ever had a teenager.
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:30.140]   I've got some NBA players that are 19, 20, 21.
[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:34.580]   So maybe those count, but those are men, obviously.
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:38.100]   But for nutritional testing,
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.900]   that would be potentially a helpful thing
[00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:41.380]   to do in your 20s.
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:43.140]   Becomes less important as you get older
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:46.060]   and you develop more micronutrient deficiencies,
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.620]   but micronutrients play a huge role
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.380]   in terms of hormone production.
[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:53.820]   Magnesium, the magnesium is hugely involved
[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:57.340]   in the way that you get rid of estrogen, as an example.
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.400]   So micronutrient testing, what I usually do
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.200]   is a combination of blood and urine.
[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.780]   And so I'm looking at all of the micronutrients
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:08.780]   that we can measure that have some clinical
[00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:10.760]   scientific basis behind them.
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.020]   If I could do that for a teenager,
[00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:15.340]   I think it might be helpful
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:18.960]   because I recently gave a lecture
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:22.960]   on breast cancer risk reduction, another quick sidebar.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:29.140]   And I was sad to find that intake of vegetables,
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:34.540]   polyphenols is such an important predictor
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:36.040]   of future risk of breast cancer,
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.760]   like when you're 50, 60 plus.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:42.340]   And the most important time is when you're a teenager.
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.220]   Now I have one daughter that eats vegetables, she loves them
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:48.300]   and I have another daughter who eats food that's beige.
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.600]   And it's very hard to get her to eat the volume
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:55.540]   of vegetables, five colors a day, which is what I do.
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:27:00.540]   And if you have evidence that you could show
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:05.620]   a 17 year old that they've got micronutrient gaps,
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:08.620]   I think that would be a motivator
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:13.160]   for them to eat differently at a time when it's so critical,
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.520]   even though it's 25 years in the future,
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.140]   that it's going to potentially change
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.080]   this arc that they're on.
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.360]   - What do you do for a young woman
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:25.640]   who doesn't like vegetables or is not somehow able
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:29.540]   or willing to get those five colors a day of vegetable
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:32.260]   to help support the microbiome?
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:37.180]   Are supplements a useful tool in that case?
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.500]   What other sorts of tools, behavioral or otherwise,
[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:40.600]   are useful?
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:41.620]   - Such a good question.
[00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:45.320]   So here I'm going to invoke Rob Knight at UCSD.
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:50.320]   So I think his gut project has really been helpful
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.380]   in terms of understanding what kind of modulators
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.500]   are going to be important.
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.860]   So what I try to get that person to do,
[00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:01.900]   and I don't see many teens anymore other than NBA players,
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:05.060]   what I try to get them to do is to have a smoothie.
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.140]   Very hard to get them to have a smoothie every day,
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:08.660]   but if I could get them to have a smoothie
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:12.500]   three times a week and to throw some of these vegetables in,
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:13.900]   that makes a huge difference.
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:15.340]   I mean, we know that makes a difference
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.300]   in terms of microbiome change.
[00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.740]   - To be blending up broccoli or kale.
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:20.580]   - Cauliflower.
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:22.220]   So cauliflower is great. - Yellow peppers even,
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:24.060]   they're putting things into the smoothie.
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.060]   - Yeah, I don't know if you can get a teenager to do that,
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:27.600]   but they often will use,
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.480]   like I have them do steamed broccoli that's in the freezer
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.900]   because it's got very little taste.
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.500]   So they could do that in a chocolate smoothie.
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.780]   They could add some greens.
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:37.860]   I like greens.
[00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:40.700]   Powders are super convenient.
[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.700]   So that with kind of a taste that they like,
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.260]   whether that's chocolate,
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:47.380]   which is what most of my clients want,
[00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:50.660]   or vanilla with berries and that sort of thing.
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:53.940]   So that can go a long way if you don't like vegetables.
[00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.080]   And short of that, I would say some supplements,
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.100]   but I would say that's a distant second
[00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:59.460]   to making a smoothie.
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:02.140]   I've got one patient that I have to mention
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:07.140]   because he took this to the extreme.
[00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:12.420]   So he is a retired physicist professor at UCSD.
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:15.460]   He found out that his microbiome was a hot mess
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:19.020]   and developed autoimmune disease.
[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.820]   And so he became hell bent,
[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:25.540]   like only a physicist could on changing his microbiome.
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:27.660]   And he dramatically shifted it
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:31.040]   by having a smoothie every day
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.900]   with 57 vegetables and fruits in it.
[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:36.580]   - 57 independent.
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.260]   - 57 independent.
[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:42.700]   So, I mean, this just warms my heart
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:44.220]   the way that he did this.
[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:45.980]   But he would go to the farmer's market.
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:48.980]   He would just get a bunch of this, a bunch of that.
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:51.520]   And he would go home, make the smoothie,
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.860]   and then stick it in the freezer.
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:55.120]   So he'd have a serving every day.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.680]   And he became a completely different person
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.800]   based on this microbiome change.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:05.800]   His autoimmune disease is in remission.
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:10.820]   He dropped a huge amount of weight.
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:13.040]   He went from being kind of this phenotype
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:16.360]   that I know you know well of a professor,
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.220]   high performing, traveling around the world
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.960]   on so many boards, so much innovation,
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:23.520]   so many great ideas, super computer guy,
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.140]   to being someone who gets up in the morning,
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:31.100]   gets in his hot tub, exercises for one to two hours a day,
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:33.100]   and then does a little work.
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.500]   He completely shifted the way that he lives.
[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:39.140]   And his microbiome shift, who knows what's the chicken
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:40.780]   and what's the egg there?
[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:43.820]   But he had a huge change in his physiology.
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.780]   Glucose went from being quite high.
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.720]   He had, and he tracks all of this, of course.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.460]   It's like on a Jupiter. - Scientist after all.
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:52.300]   - Right. - Yeah.
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:53.660]   - Retired, I suppose, might've had.
[00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:57.980]   - And he's retired, but he's got the longest time series
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:00.000]   of anyone I know.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   And he's tracked his glucose and insulin
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   going back 20 years.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.140]   So he can show you, okay,
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:08.960]   here's where I started having my smoothie,
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.560]   and here's how my glucose and insulin changed
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:12.900]   as a result of that.
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.300]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.340]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:19.780]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.160]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:25.060]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.740]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:29.960]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.560]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.620]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:35.620]   once or usually twice a day
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:39.220]   is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.300]   Our gut is very important.
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.860]   It's populated by gut microbiota
[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:44.620]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system,
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:47.020]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:50.660]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:52.520]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:56.360]   are optimal and vital for microbiota health.
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:57.920]   In addition, Athletic Greens contains
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.820]   a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals
[00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.700]   that make sure that all of my foundational
[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:05.160]   nutritional needs are met, and it tastes great.
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.620]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:10.020]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:11.980]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:14.300]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:16.880]   while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera.
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:20.300]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:22.980]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:24.340]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:27.520]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.060]   - Is there a case for, I'll say young women,
[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:34.580]   but young women and men using over-the-counter probiotics
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:36.020]   as a way to enhance the microbiome?
[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:37.180]   This is something I hear about a lot.
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:39.920]   I've heard that excessive doses of capsule probiotics
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.660]   can give a brain fog-like condition.
[00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:45.540]   I personally don't use capsule probiotics
[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:47.300]   unless I feel like my system
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.060]   is under a significant amount of stress,
[00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:51.660]   in which case I might add that in for brief periods of time,
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:55.200]   or if I've just taken antibiotics for a period of time.
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.660]   Do you ever recommend that the college student
[00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:59.120]   or the high school student,
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:02.560]   that she or he take capsule probiotics?
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.220]   Assuming that they're getting,
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.380]   let's say three to five servings of vegetables per day,
[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:09.980]   either in smoothie form or some other form,
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:12.940]   what are your thoughts on supplementing probiotics?
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:16.280]   - It sounds like such a simple question.
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.380]   It is such a complex answer.
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:20.820]   And I don't think we really have the answer.
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:23.100]   So I'll tell you the way that I approach it.
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:27.180]   I look for randomized trials to support my use of probiotics
[00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:29.600]   and frankly, I'm underwhelmed.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.700]   So I've seen some data,
[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:35.460]   if I invoke my NBA players for a moment,
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.420]   almost every player I've tested
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:40.420]   has increased intestinal permeability.
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:42.760]   They just have such a high training load,
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.900]   probably mediated by cortisol,
[00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:47.060]   very high glucoses when they drain,
[00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:50.060]   that they have increased intestinal permeability.
[00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:53.980]   So those tight junctions in their intestine become loose.
[00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:56.500]   They develop a lot of inflammation as a result of that.
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.060]   And when you're a professional NBA player
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:01.580]   and you're making 20 million a year,
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:03.180]   like you don't want a lot of inflammation.
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.620]   You want a little bit to like help your muscles recover,
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:09.580]   but you don't want it to be adding to problems
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:10.980]   when you develop an injury.
[00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:12.180]   - So this is leaky gut.
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:13.460]   - Leaky gut.
[00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:16.940]   I don't love that term, but yeah, we'll use it here.
[00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:20.340]   So there's a particular probiotic
[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:23.500]   that is helpful in athletes with leaky gut.
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.340]   So that's the kind of specificity
[00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:28.020]   and randomized trial that I'm looking for.
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:29.040]   The rest of it,
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:34.300]   I think there's support if you find help from it,
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.500]   as you described, if you take a course of antibiotics.
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.700]   I mean, first of all, I would question whether you need them,
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:41.420]   but there's a ton of ways. - Yeah, I try and avoid them.
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:43.740]   There have been instances where they've been prescribed
[00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:45.660]   and I took them mostly in the past, like it was in college.
[00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:46.840]   They seemed like they kind of gave them out.
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:50.300]   You had a science infection, they give you antibiotics.
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:52.020]   - Yeah, the worst treatment ever.
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:54.680]   Yeah, so if you're coming off of antibiotics,
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:55.980]   I think that's a good time to do
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:58.620]   what we call replacement dose probiotics.
[00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:03.620]   I think what's far more interesting is prebiotics.
[00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:07.180]   I think the data is much better for prebiotics
[00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:11.740]   and the selective use of polyphen.
[00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:15.460]   - How would a person in their teens and twenties
[00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:16.720]   or any age for that matter,
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:20.780]   know whether or not they have nutritional deficiencies?
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:22.540]   What is the best way to analyze
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:24.840]   if one is getting enough magnesium?
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.020]   And for that matter,
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:29.060]   what is going to be the best way to test the microbiome?
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:30.700]   You said stool sample,
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:32.860]   and I'll come right back with the same question
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:34.500]   I asked about a blood test.
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:38.420]   What time of day, when during the month
[00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:40.900]   to establish a baseline?
[00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:44.480]   So this would be prior to embarking on 97 vegetables
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.020]   or however many per day.
[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:47.120]   - I was only 57.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.920]   - Well, I love the idea that you're telling us,
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.220]   if I'm gathering correctly,
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:52.840]   is that yes, there's a case for probiotics,
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:55.040]   but for the typical person, regardless of age,
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.760]   eating more vegetables or drinking more vegetables,
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.060]   as the case may be,
[00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:01.760]   is going to be beneficial for the gut microbiome,
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:04.400]   perhaps without the need to go test whether or not
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.540]   one is making a certain number
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.640]   of estrogen-related metabolites or not.
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.180]   Just that that's a great starting place,
[00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:11.360]   eat or consume more vegetables.
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.000]   But if one wants to analyze their gut microbiome,
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.380]   are there good tests available to the general public?
[00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:18.840]   This has been, I'm not going to name companies,
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.860]   but I've been tracking this over the years,
[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:23.100]   and it's never been clear to me that we know
[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:26.620]   what constituents of the gut microbiome are best.
[00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:28.980]   You know, we know that dysbiosis is bad,
[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:31.540]   and we know that diversity of the microbiome is good.
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:34.580]   We hear this, but no one's ever told me that you want
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:38.740]   a particular ratio of one microbiota to another
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:41.620]   in a way that has made any sense to me at least.
[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:43.020]   I'm not a microbiologist,
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:46.540]   but whereas with, you know, with testosterone in men,
[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:48.260]   we hear, okay, you want your free testosterone
[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:50.920]   to be about 2% of your total, perhaps.
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.220]   With women, women are going to have more testosterone
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:56.100]   than estrogen on average, but still less than men
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:58.260]   when you look at testosterone, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:00.300]   But you can kind of get some crude measures,
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.720]   but for the microbiome, it just seems like long lists
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:05.600]   of microbiota for which I just get dizzy.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:08.620]   I just, if you just wrote out a bunch of Is and Ls and Ss,
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:10.160]   you'd kind of halfway,
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:12.580]   you're getting a bit the same information.
[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:14.760]   I'm not trying to poke at that field as a beautiful field,
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:19.600]   but they haven't told me what my microbiota ought to look
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.100]   like, like what's a healthy microbiome chart.
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:24.640]   - Well, that's because we don't know.
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.300]   I mean, the best we have is Rob Knight's work,
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:30.640]   but even that is limited in terms of, you know,
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:33.800]   can I tell you that a woman in her 20s should have
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:36.560]   this particular pattern with her microbiome?
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.220]   No, I can't.
[00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:40.780]   So let me go to your first question,
[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:43.460]   'cause I think you just asked about six.
[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:46.460]   Your first question is about nutritional testing.
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:51.460]   What I like to do with nutritional testing is run a panel
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:55.860]   that's looking at antioxidants, so like vitamin A,
[00:37:55.860 --> 00:38:00.820]   vitamin C, alpha lipoic acid, plant-based antioxidants,
[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:03.000]   'cause you can measure that in the blood.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.660]   I like to look at some of the key vitamins,
[00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:08.780]   especially the B vitamin range,
[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:10.420]   because as you probably know,
[00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:14.780]   if you've got particular genetic polymorphism,
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:17.960]   so you might be less likely to be absorbing the right level
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:21.600]   of vitamin B9, folate, vitamin B12, et cetera.
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.760]   I'm also looking, going back to the antioxidants
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.700]   at glutathione, because I think that's such
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:29.500]   an important lever when it comes to detoxification,
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.540]   which we haven't talked about yet.
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:33.480]   And then I'm looking at some of the minerals.
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.220]   Magnesium is really the most important,
[00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:37.900]   and we know that somewhere around 70 to 80% of Americans
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:39.260]   are deficient in magnesium.
[00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:41.980]   That's like the lowest hanging fruit.
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:43.940]   - I would be curious, for instance, like with magnesium,
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:46.500]   if that number of people are deficient,
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:47.860]   does that mean that that number of people
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:50.400]   should be targeting their nutrition towards foods
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:53.260]   that contain magnesium and or supplementing with magnesium?
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.700]   And if so, what forms of magnesium?
[00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:58.180]   We've talked about Mag-3 and 8 for sleep.
[00:38:58.180 --> 00:38:59.020]   There's a Mag-Citrate.
[00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.320]   There's so many forms.
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:01.640]   It can be a little bit of overwhelming to people.
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:05.140]   So any detail in sourcing, I would appreciate it.
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:07.980]   - Great, so first, in terms of testing,
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:12.460]   what I prefer to do is to mention more than one lab
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:13.660]   and more than one brand.
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:17.860]   And I'm speaking mostly from experience.
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:22.860]   So for testing, I do a lot of Genova NutriVols.
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:28.300]   During the pandemic, they developed an at-home test.
[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:30.420]   Normally with a NutriVol, you have to get your blood drawn
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:32.540]   and you have to do a urine sample.
[00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:34.240]   So a lot of people can't do that.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.720]   The great thing about this test is your insurance
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.880]   usually pays for most of it.
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:42.360]   And so the copay is about $150.
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.480]   So during the pandemic, they developed another test
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:48.600]   called Metabolomics, which does much of the same testing,
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:49.900]   but it's a finger prick.
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:53.020]   So most of my patients prefer that.
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:56.020]   In fact, they haven't gone back to the NutriVol.
[00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:58.220]   Second lab is SpectraCell.
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:01.020]   I use SpectraCell occasionally.
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.700]   I find it not quite as easy in terms of fitting
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:07.180]   into my practice, but I've got friends and mentors
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:12.180]   like Mark Houston, who does a lot of kind of precision
[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:15.400]   cardiometabolic health.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:18.820]   He thinks SpectraCell is the best test out there.
[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:21.280]   So you asked about magnesium.
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.740]   You have to measure red blood cell magnesium,
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:25.460]   like whole blood.
[00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:30.460]   And with deficiency, it's interesting with supplementation.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:34.960]   For my patients who tend toward constipation,
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:37.080]   and that's frankly about 80% of the women
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:38.040]   that I take care of.
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:38.880]   - Really?
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:39.800]   - Yes.
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:42.460]   - Wow, I'd be curious as to why that is.
[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:46.260]   I can guess, diet, stress.
[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:50.120]   - Patriarchy, rage.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:52.820]   - So psycho-- - That they may not know about.
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:54.440]   - So the pine.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:55.480]   - The pine system.
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.920]   - Right, psychology, immunology,
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.380]   neural and endocrine factors combined.
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:02.220]   - Yes.
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:04.940]   And then I would say there's another factor,
[00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:09.940]   which is being female is a health hazard.
[00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:16.580]   So we have twice the rate of depression, insomnia.
[00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:19.300]   We've got three to four X increased risk
[00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:21.260]   of multiple sclerosis.
[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:23.500]   We've got five to eight times the risk
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.240]   of thyroid dysfunction.
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:29.380]   So if you just look at that, and you look at subtle
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:32.060]   pre-clinical thyroid dysfunction,
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:34.420]   a huge number of the women that I take care of,
[00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:35.980]   well, let me back off.
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:38.380]   A large number of the women that I take care of
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:40.940]   have thyroid dysfunction that's contributing
[00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:42.900]   to constipation.
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.740]   And if we go back to that control system,
[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:46.600]   the hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal, thyroid,
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:51.600]   canal, gut axis, and they have a lot of perceived stress,
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:54.500]   together with this borderline thyroid function
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:57.260]   that no mainstream medicine doctor has told her
[00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:58.500]   is a problem.
[00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:00.460]   And then she's got a problem with the tango
[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:02.340]   between estrogen and progesterone.
[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:06.020]   She's gonna tend toward constipation.
[00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:08.660]   Women have a lot more constipation than men.
[00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:12.900]   The gut is about 10 feet longer in women compared to men.
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:15.140]   We should talk about some sex and gender differences
[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:16.580]   and define those.
[00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:21.180]   And they are much more likely to have a torturous colon.
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:23.700]   And the way you know that is you get a colonoscopy
[00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:26.420]   and they tell you, yeah, it was really hard.
[00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:28.900]   Like, get in there and do what we need to do.
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:31.740]   - As a brief tangent, but I think this is the time to ask,
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:36.000]   at what age now do physicians insist
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.200]   their female patients get colonoscopies?
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.180]   For men, I think the age used to be 50.
[00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:45.040]   Now it's getting ratcheted back to 45 or 40.
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.900]   Again, these are recommendations, not requirements,
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:48.500]   but they're pretty strong recommendations
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:50.700]   from depending on where you live, et cetera.
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:53.900]   For women, how early do you think they should get
[00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:57.700]   a colonoscopy to explore for possible polyps
[00:42:57.700 --> 00:42:59.780]   and/or colon cancer?
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:00.900]   - Yeah, it's a really good question.
[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:01.940]   I don't know the answer.
[00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:04.860]   So what I've always operated with is 50.
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:06.500]   The way that I answer that is to go
[00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:09.400]   to the U.S. Preventive Task Force rating
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:12.780]   to determine based on their synthesis of the data
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:14.660]   what age is the most appropriate.
[00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:17.460]   Has it changed, as you just described from men,
[00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:18.820]   from 50 to younger?
[00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:21.500]   I don't know, so we should fact check that.
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:25.460]   All these additional health hazards for women.
[00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:28.340]   You mentioned some of the,
[00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:31.140]   you broadly mentioned psychological impact, right?
[00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:33.220]   And of course these things are all related,
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:34.540]   psychology, immunology.
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:36.180]   And then one of the, I think, wonderful things
[00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:40.140]   about neuroscience and science in general and medicine
[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:42.280]   is that there's now an understanding
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:44.440]   that all the organs are connected to one another.
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.280]   - It's a network.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:46.100]   - It's a network.
[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:49.700]   And that the microbiome sits at a key node
[00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:50.840]   within that network.
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:54.040]   And I think most people accept that now.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.160]   - Yes.
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:56.120]   - That seems to be a theme
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:58.280]   that at least in the last 10 years is really wonderful
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.600]   because certainly for neuroscience,
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:03.860]   it was thought that unless it's in the cranial vault,
[00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:05.880]   it's not neural, which is ridiculous
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:08.600]   'cause there's lots of nervous system outside the skull.
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:09.820]   But in any case-
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:10.840]   - Can I interrupt for a second?
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:11.680]   - Yes, please.
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:12.800]   - So I think you're right
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:16.400]   that there's an understanding about the network effect.
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:21.400]   But I think that as much as I love mainstream medicine
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:25.360]   and I trained in it, and I'm so grateful for my education,
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:27.840]   I still think it is a silo-based way
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.160]   of taking care of patients.
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:31.460]   So even if there's an understanding of the network effect
[00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:33.460]   more at the science level,
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:35.840]   or as you described in neuroscience,
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:39.700]   there's still, you know, if you are a woman
[00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:42.060]   who has constipation, fatigue,
[00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:49.180]   maybe an autoimmune condition, feel stressed out all the time
[00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:51.240]   feel like your hormones are out of whack,
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:55.360]   you get sent to the gastroenterologist for the constipation.
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:57.880]   You get sent to the rheumatologist
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:59.620]   for your autoimmune issues.
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:02.440]   You maybe get sent to an endocrinologist
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:04.560]   if you've got thyroid problems.
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:08.820]   And there's very little collaboration between these groups.
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:10.620]   So even though there's an understanding
[00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:13.840]   of the network effect, in real life,
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:15.040]   it's not happening.
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:19.840]   - Let's go deeper down that path
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:21.680]   'cause you point out something really important
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.500]   and you've mentioned constipation a few times.
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:27.360]   Can we view constipation as a serious enough symptom
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:29.200]   that it warrants an immediate intervention?
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:33.120]   That is, does it flag or signal problems
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.960]   that are severe enough that that should be the issue
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:38.560]   that's dealt with for anybody that's experiencing it?
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.560]   And I mean, it's sort of an odd topic for many people
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:41.980]   'cause they think, oh, you know, bowel movements
[00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:45.580]   or there's that kind of pre-adolescent humor around this.
[00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:47.240]   But I think it's so important.
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.960]   What I'm hearing you say is that constipation
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:51.240]   is far more common in women
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:55.180]   and it signals many problems occurring.
[00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:58.440]   Does that mean that women should address constipation?
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:01.600]   And if so, what's the best way to address constipation?
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:05.560]   - Yeah, I love this question because you're doing,
[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:07.600]   can we have a quick little meta conversation?
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:10.120]   So you're doing something that I knew you would do,
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:14.040]   which is you're teaching me something and you're changing,
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.120]   like there's a social genomics thing happening
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:18.280]   where you're changing my thought about this.
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:19.640]   So I just wanted to acknowledge that.
[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:20.480]   Thank you. - Thank you.
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:23.800]   Well, I think for me, when I hear that there's a kind of,
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.240]   you're talking about a phenotype,
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:26.460]   constipation is a phenotype.
[00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:29.160]   It's one that people generally don't wear a T-shirt
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:31.660]   explaining it to people, but that I'm guessing
[00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:36.260]   anything to do with sexual health, bowel health, urology,
[00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:40.020]   people just don't talk about for all sorts of reasons.
[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:42.100]   And those reasons are probably so obvious
[00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:43.960]   that they're not even worth discussing.
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:45.600]   And also because we won't change them
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:47.360]   except by talking about them.
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:51.560]   So if you say women are far more constipated
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:54.560]   and that's signaling a larger set of problems,
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:55.960]   then my immediate thought is,
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:57.920]   well, will relieving constipation,
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:01.920]   pun intended retroactively,
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:07.400]   will that assist in a great number of issues
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:08.980]   and/or will it get them down the road
[00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:11.120]   of thinking about those other issues more specifically?
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:12.520]   Like, do I need more magnesium
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:15.040]   or should I be putting vegetables in my smoothie?
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:18.360]   So I'm curious about constipation as a target
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.440]   for intervention that then opens up
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:21.520]   a bunch of other discussions.
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:22.800]   'Cause there are these certain nodes
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:25.820]   in the mental health, physical health space
[00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:27.880]   that when someone, like we talk a lot
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:30.280]   of deliberate cold exposure, do I think it's magic?
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.100]   No, but I think that if someone's getting themselves
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:33.680]   into a cold shower once a day,
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:36.460]   it opens up a number of questions about themselves
[00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:38.320]   and reveals a number of things to themselves.
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:40.360]   I'm like, how do I buffer stress?
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.440]   What sorts of levels of control do I actually have?
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:43.280]   And on and on.
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:46.160]   So perhaps not the best example, but-
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:47.940]   - Some of us hate cold exposure.
[00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:48.780]   - Right, which is-
[00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:51.620]   - And we have like a gene that makes us stress out
[00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:53.400]   like you wouldn't believe with cold exposure.
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:56.380]   - Which I would argue makes it very likely
[00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:58.260]   that even 10 seconds of cold exposure
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:47:59.780]   gets you the effect that you want.
[00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:01.600]   As opposed to someone who adores cold exposure
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.920]   like a penguin, needs a lot more cold exposure
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:05.820]   for it to have the adaptive response.
[00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:09.220]   Anyway, that's my way of gumbing through that.
[00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:12.320]   Quite, you're quite correct.
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:13.160]   So-
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:14.220]   - So let's answer this question.
[00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:15.260]   - The constipation issue.
[00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:17.460]   - Yeah, so this is how you're changing
[00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:19.260]   the way I think about this.
[00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:22.180]   So you're asking, okay, instead of looking at constipation
[00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:24.280]   as a constellation of symptoms,
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.620]   what about if you just used it on its own
[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:31.620]   as sort of a key indicator or signal of dysfunction
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:38.860]   with my network or maybe something broader?
[00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:40.360]   And I think that's right.
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:43.420]   So it makes me think of a few things.
[00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:45.600]   It makes me, you're also changing this book
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:47.780]   that I'm writing on autoimmunity and trauma.
[00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:49.060]   So thank you for that.
[00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:53.380]   So women experience more trauma than men.
[00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:54.660]   This is well-established.
[00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:57.220]   If you look at the ACE studies that were done
[00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:00.100]   by the CDC and Kaiser in 1998,
[00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:02.200]   we know that men for the most part,
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:07.200]   middle-aged men have about 50% of them
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:09.540]   experience significant trauma
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:11.780]   as defined by the ACE questionnaire.
[00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:16.220]   Women are at 60% and that's pretty durable since 1998.
[00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:20.220]   So women have more, they have different forms of abuse,
[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:22.260]   much more likely to have sexual abuse.
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:27.200]   They have a different HPA response than men.
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:31.100]   Their perceived stress tends to be higher
[00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:33.120]   and I'm generalizing for a population.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:36.940]   Side note, in precision medicine, we don't do that.
[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:40.060]   We do medicine for the individual, not the population,
[00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:41.600]   not medicine for the average.
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:47.480]   And so if you look at the physiology of a female,
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:52.240]   I think that constipation and that need to control
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:54.760]   and restrain and hold things in,
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:58.100]   tighten the anal sphincter,
[00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:00.380]   I think that's part of the physiology.
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:02.240]   So I'm veering away from the science,
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:06.220]   but I do think that it is a really important signal
[00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:08.340]   to pay a lot of attention to.
[00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:10.940]   Now, you also asked about microbiome testing.
[00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:11.780]   Should we do that or do you-
[00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:13.420]   - Yeah, well, I have a couple more questions
[00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:14.400]   about constipation.
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.780]   I never thought I'd ask this many questions
[00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:17.620]   about constipation, but now I'm fascinated.
[00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:18.620]   By the way, also this morning,
[00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:19.840]   I taught medical students at Stanford
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.940]   about the fact that we are basically a series of tubes.
[00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:23.700]   So you talked about the anal sphincter.
[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:26.140]   We are a set of sphincters from one end to the other.
[00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:27.420]   I mean, we are a set of tubes,
[00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:29.100]   our nervous system being one of those tubes.
[00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:31.060]   And I think in Eastern medicine,
[00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:32.380]   they talk about the various locks
[00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:33.840]   between those tubes and chambers,
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:35.860]   and it's not without coincidence.
[00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:37.840]   There's some real wisdom there, of course.
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:41.020]   - Wait, did you just talk about energetic anatomy?
[00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:41.860]   - More or less.
[00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:42.700]   I didn't say the word chakras,
[00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:44.700]   but I might in passing.
[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:46.100]   - Well, it's the bandhas that you work with.
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:49.460]   - The bandhas, right, are the sphincters, right?
[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:50.620]   Yes, that's right.
[00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:51.840]   Thank you for that.
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:55.140]   So what defines constipation?
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:57.140]   I mean, in other words, let's think about the healthy,
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:58.340]   rather than thinking about the unhealthy,
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:00.700]   is how many bowel movements
[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:05.100]   should a woman or a man have per day,
[00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:07.220]   assuming, and this is where it gets tricky,
[00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:09.100]   because some people are doing time-restricted feeding,
[00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:09.940]   some people are eating more,
[00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:11.420]   some people are eating more fiber, more bulk,
[00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:12.460]   larger meal at the end of the day,
[00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:13.860]   a larger meal at the beginning of the day.
[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:16.980]   We will never be able to sort out all those variables,
[00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:21.220]   but on average, how many bowel movements
[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:24.420]   and is timing during the day for bowel movements
[00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:26.440]   at all informative?
[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:28.300]   - What works for you?
[00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:30.020]   - Well, when I'm asleep,
[00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:31.500]   generally I don't want a bowel movement,
[00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:33.020]   so I'm going to be like most people, right?
[00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:34.340]   - Well, sleep is primary for you.
[00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:35.740]   - Right, exactly.
[00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:38.140]   I always assumed that morning time
[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:41.780]   was a healthy time for bowel movements,
[00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:47.040]   and I think almost everybody, babies included,
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:51.120]   recognize the feeling of being lighter and more energetic
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:54.480]   when they've evacuated their colon.
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:56.380]   In fact, so much so that I'm obsessed
[00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:58.460]   with Jungian and Freudian psychology
[00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:00.700]   that the first thing we learn when we come into this world
[00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:01.820]   is that we want something,
[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:06.020]   we feel some sort of autonomic arousal, stress,
[00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:07.980]   whether or not it's food or warmth
[00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:09.500]   or the need to have a bowel movement.
[00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:11.020]   And one of the first things that parents learn
[00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:12.580]   is how to recognize that,
[00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:15.020]   not by the odor coming from the diaper,
[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:17.620]   but by the look on the baby's face or their agitation.
[00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:21.500]   Agitation signals the need for some sort of relief,
[00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:23.740]   temperature relief, food relief,
[00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:25.020]   evacuating the bowel relief.
[00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:28.900]   So my understanding is that as autonomic arousal increases
[00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:29.820]   in the early part of the day,
[00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:31.820]   ideally after a good night's sleep,
[00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:33.380]   that bowel movements become more likely,
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:35.340]   unless that arousal becomes so great
[00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:38.860]   that then people feel sort of quote unquote locked up
[00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:42.060]   because of the balance of the autonomic features.
[00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:44.100]   So early day, I'm guessing,
[00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:45.600]   and again in the second half of the day,
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.260]   and here I'm totally guessing,
[00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:49.020]   and certainly not having to wake
[00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:50.420]   in the middle of the night.
[00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:53.740]   Yeah, those are my best guesses.
[00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:54.820]   - That's great.
[00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:56.580]   So I would agree with that.
[00:52:56.580 --> 00:53:00.140]   When I was at Harvard Medical School in UCSF for residency,
[00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:01.820]   I was taught that constipation
[00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:05.180]   is having a bowel movement less frequently
[00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:06.980]   than once every three days.
[00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:10.260]   - Sorry, I don't think I've ever laughed out loud
[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:11.940]   on this podcast as a consequence
[00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:14.060]   of textbook medical knowledge.
[00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:15.140]   Are you kidding me?
[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:15.980]   - Is that ridiculous?
[00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:18.060]   - Well, that sounds like, and here, pun intended,
[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:22.020]   that sounds like the conclusion of some very-
[00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:23.460]   - Constipated person. - Emotionally
[00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:27.440]   and in other ways constipated individuals.
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:29.820]   And again, this might seem like an odd conversation,
[00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:32.180]   but the discussion around constipation
[00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:35.920]   is present in psychological literature
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:38.660]   because of this relationship to the autonomic system.
[00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:41.060]   - Well, it's a metaphor in literature.
[00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:42.340]   It's crucial.
[00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:45.200]   So you spoke to a number of different threads
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:46.900]   that I think are important here.
[00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:48.780]   So that's the definition that I learned.
[00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:51.060]   And I heard that and I was like, hell no,
[00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:52.340]   that doesn't work for me.
[00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:54.820]   It doesn't work for anyone I know.
[00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:59.020]   And I spent a lot of time, especially in medical school
[00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:02.660]   and in my internship where you rotate on medicine,
[00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:06.660]   dis-impacting women, like older women who come in
[00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:08.940]   who haven't had a bowel movement in a month.
[00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:09.780]   - Whoa.
[00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:13.120]   - And let me tell you, that is not nice for anybody.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:15.500]   - Believe me, I became a scientist and a physician
[00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:18.700]   for a number of reasons, both positive and negative.
[00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:19.820]   That's one of them.
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:23.740]   - Yeah, so my definition of constipation
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:28.740]   as a Western, mostly white girl is that
[00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:32.580]   if you're not having a bowel movement every single morning
[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:36.500]   and you have a feeling of complete evacuation,
[00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:39.820]   anything less than that is constipation.
[00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:41.440]   So that's how I define it.
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:45.380]   If you're in India and you're eating food
[00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:47.780]   that's got a fair amount of microbes in it,
[00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:51.560]   it's less sanitary, I'm using that word,
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:54.900]   as carefully as I can.
[00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:58.820]   Generally, they have a bowel movement after every meal.
[00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:00.260]   But they've got a different microbiome,
[00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:01.900]   they're exposed to different microbes.
[00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:03.940]   Here in the US, I would say Wednesday,
[00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:08.120]   you also spoke to something very important,
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:11.100]   which is the balance between
[00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:13.000]   the parasympathetic nervous system,
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.180]   rest and digest and poop,
[00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:17.420]   versus the sympathetic nervous system,
[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:20.100]   kind of the on button, you know,
[00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:23.100]   fight, flight, freeze, fawn.
[00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:28.460]   So I think for those of us who've got issues
[00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:33.460]   with autonomic balance, it can lead to constipation.
[00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:37.220]   And I like that constipation could be pulled out
[00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:40.740]   and kind of writ larger as an important signal.
[00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:43.260]   - What sorts of tools do you recommend people use
[00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:48.260]   to relieve constipation in eating more fiber?
[00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:52.220]   Sounds like reducing stress is going to be a huge one.
[00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:53.060]   - Yes.
[00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:56.060]   - What are your favorite stress reduction tools?
[00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:59.780]   I like to divide these into real-time tools.
[00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:03.220]   So a big proponent of like physiological sighing,
[00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:04.680]   real-time, you know, these sorts of things,
[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:07.960]   but things that can really lower the baseline
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:11.980]   on stress overall to facilitate constipation
[00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:15.780]   and other broad indicators of health.
[00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:21.180]   - So I'm not a fan of lowering stress.
[00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:23.660]   I'm a fan of lowering perceived stress.
[00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:26.060]   And I think the distinction is really important.
[00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:30.740]   I learned when I was in my 30s
[00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:35.620]   that I was a massive stress case and I didn't know it.
[00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:39.420]   It was just sort of, I think I, through residency,
[00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:41.000]   through working 120 hours a week,
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.620]   I just was so accustomed and sort of entrained.
[00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:48.220]   - That was 120, not under 20 folks.
[00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:50.300]   Not unusual in medicine.
[00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:52.200]   - Well, they've changed training
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:55.100]   so that you work no more than 80 hours a week now,
[00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:57.460]   but that was before my time.
[00:56:57.460 --> 00:57:02.460]   So I became accustomed to a massive amount of cortisol,
[00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:10.480]   massive, and I would say I've spent the past 20 years
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:13.500]   really working on perceived stress to find,
[00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:16.460]   I think all of us need an a la carte menu
[00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:18.940]   of what is most effective.
[00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:23.080]   So what works for me now at my age is different than,
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:25.900]   you know, the TM I did as a college student,
[00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:28.860]   transcendental meditation, it's different than the,
[00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:31.460]   I became a certified yoga teacher when I was in my 30s.
[00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:34.220]   That is very effective for a lot of people.
[00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:37.660]   It wasn't enough for my matrix.
[00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:39.620]   I do holotropic breath work.
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:43.120]   I didn't read it, but I saw that she just had a paper
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:47.340]   in cell on your sign and it kind of,
[00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:50.800]   it made me think like, teach me how to sigh,
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:52.580]   teach me how to sigh, like,
[00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:54.120]   can you say a little bit about that?
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:55.160]   Like, how do you do it?
[00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:56.880]   - Yeah, very briefly, that study was,
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:00.120]   we wanted to find a minimal effective dose intervention.
[00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:00.960]   - Yeah, five minutes.
[00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:02.360]   - So I just wanted, yeah, so five minutes a day.
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:04.360]   We needed to figure out what people would do every day.
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:07.680]   And we were monitoring subjective mood, et cetera,
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:09.600]   but also biometrics remotely.
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:10.440]   So it was kind of a nice study.
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:11.520]   - Which biometrics?
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:12.360]   HRV?
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:14.700]   - HRV, nighttime sleep.
[00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:15.820]   - Portisol?
[00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:16.880]   - I wish.
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:18.880]   So this was done during the pandemic,
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:20.220]   more than a hundred subjects.
[00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:23.060]   The advantage was that we got data 24 hours a day
[00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:25.640]   'cause they're pinging us in their data wearing-
[00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:26.840]   - HRV 24?
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:27.680]   - Yeah.
[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:28.500]   - Nice.
[00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:29.340]   - So that was nice.
[00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:31.040]   Resting heart rate, subjective mood,
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:32.780]   we would get in touch with them daily.
[00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:35.460]   So when people were swapped between groups,
[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:36.300]   like any good study,
[00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:39.760]   but five minutes a day of sort of standard, if you will,
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:41.560]   forgive me, meditations or just sitting,
[00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:42.940]   no instructions about how to breathe,
[00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:45.600]   just focusing on closing their eyes
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:47.520]   and focusing on focusing.
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:50.820]   Another group did box breathing.
[00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:53.200]   Inhale, hold, exhale, hold for equal durations.
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:55.680]   The duration of each of those inhales and holds
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:58.280]   was set by their carbon dioxide tolerance.
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:01.500]   So somewhere between three and eight seconds,
[00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:04.440]   depending on how well they regulate to carbon dioxide.
[00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:06.700]   Another group did cyclic sighing.
[00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:08.660]   So this would be double inhale through the nose.
[00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:10.180]   So big inhale through the nose.
[00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:13.260]   [inhales and exhales]
[00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:17.620]   Followed by a, to lungs, empty exhale.
[00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:20.700]   That second inhale after the first big long inhale
[00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:21.780]   through the nose is really important
[00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:24.820]   because it makes sure that all the collapsed avioli
[00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:26.520]   of the lungs snap open. - Totally.
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:27.360]   - And then the exhale,
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:29.260]   you offload a lot of the carbon dioxide.
[00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:31.660]   - That's very similar to holotropic breath work.
[00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:35.360]   - Yes, not unlike holotropic breath work.
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:37.860]   Little bit pranayama-ish,
[00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:42.100]   but the exhale is rather passive as opposed to active.
[00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:45.120]   And then the fourth category was cyclic hyperventilation,
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:48.800]   which is a lot like Tummo, AKA Wim Hof-ish breathing,
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:50.200]   different than Wim Hof breathing.
[00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:51.900]   So this would be, [inhales and exhales]
[00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:54.960]   so very active inhales and exhales.
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:58.100]   Every 25 cycles of inhale exhale, that would be one cycle.
[00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.820]   Long exhale, hold lungs empty.
[01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:03.180]   15 to 30 seconds.
[01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:05.980]   Then repeat for about five minutes.
[01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:07.300]   Everyone did that for five minutes.
[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:09.100]   And what we found was that the cyclic sighing
[01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:12.220]   led to the greatest improvements in mood around the clock,
[01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:15.060]   not just around the practice or during the practice,
[01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:17.740]   as well as lowered resting heart rate,
[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:20.020]   improvements in sleep, et cetera.
[01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:21.700]   - And you got it published in Cell.
[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:22.940]   That's so amazing. - Yeah, we were very fortunate.
[01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:23.780]   Yeah, we were very fortunate.
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:28.220]   I think that, thankfully, the reviewers and editors
[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:31.140]   understood that these minimal intervention things
[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:33.100]   hopefully are going to be of use to people.
[01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:34.660]   - So useful to people.
[01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:37.280]   I mean, how often do you read a paper like that
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:40.940]   that could offer a behavior change
[01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:43.300]   that is so easy to implement?
[01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:45.680]   I mean, I love that question.
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:46.520]   - Thank you.
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:49.400]   - So what about, did you tell them not to drink?
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.820]   Because alcohol has such a huge effect on HIV.
[01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:53.360]   - Yeah, so in this case, we didn't tell them
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:55.420]   to alter anything else about their behavior.
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:57.660]   - Just hoping it was background kind of across the same--
[01:00:57.660 --> 01:00:58.500]   - All groups.
[01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:00.120]   - Yes, and some were Stanford students.
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.700]   Others were from the general population.
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:05.780]   - Any frat boys that were drinking heavily?
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:06.620]   - Probably not.
[01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:08.620]   Well, during the pandemic, I think alcohol intake
[01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:11.420]   went way up across the board.
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:13.140]   I mean, if I had a magic wand,
[01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:15.140]   I would ask that people either not drink
[01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:17.260]   or drink two drinks per week maximum.
[01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:19.960]   At least that's my understanding of the literature.
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:22.420]   - Are you familiar with the WHOOP data with alcohol?
[01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:24.220]   - No, but we have a collaboration with WHOOP
[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:25.740]   through that paper.
[01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:28.740]   And it certainly disrupts patterns of nighttime sleep.
[01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:30.840]   In particular, from my understanding,
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:33.280]   that first phase of sleep that's related
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:34.980]   to the massive growth hormone release
[01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:37.020]   that we all really need and want in the first--
[01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:38.420]   - And you didn't measure growth hormone.
[01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:39.460]   - We did not, no.
[01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:40.980]   The second iteration of this study
[01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:43.460]   will certainly include free cortisol by saliva.
[01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:44.300]   - A hormone panel?
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:45.140]   - Yeah, hormone panels.
[01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:47.380]   Well, I'm beginning to think that we should also
[01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:49.200]   be asking people how often they're going to the bathroom
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.040]   and what time of day.
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:50.860]   - Yes.
[01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:52.220]   - I mean, this thing around constipation
[01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:54.060]   is super interesting.
[01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:56.740]   And I think that plus blood markers,
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:58.600]   and then I'm very excited to learn
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:02.280]   that urine contains additional markers
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.260]   that could be informative.
[01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:05.800]   So yeah, it was a fun study,
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:09.440]   not easy study to do with that number of subjects.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:12.220]   - Takes a lot of training for your research assistants.
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:13.060]   - Yeah, it was a big group.
[01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:15.860]   It was nine people in our group and three clinicians
[01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:18.340]   and a lot of phone calls and a lot of back and forth.
[01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:20.300]   But, you know, and thank you to the subjects
[01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:22.800]   who served as the real life guinea pigs.
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.440]   So yeah, I think that stress, you know,
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.900]   people's, I think people are starting to appreciate
[01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:28.800]   that there are ways that they can relieve their stress
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:33.620]   that don't only fall under the categories of vacation
[01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:34.460]   and meditation.
[01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:36.080]   But I want to say that meditation
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.460]   is obviously a wonderful tool.
[01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:42.100]   It's just, it's a tool not unlike any other tool
[01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:45.100]   that is great for some people and less great for others.
[01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:46.380]   - Well, certainly it's a great tool
[01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:49.480]   and it's got such a scientific basis behind it.
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:52.760]   But there's so many things on this a la carte menu.
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:57.760]   Sex, orgasm, connection, feeling heard and seen and loved.
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:01.940]   - Yeah, let's talk about that.
[01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:03.540]   You know, you mentioned earlier that all these stress
[01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:05.940]   factors, you said patriarchy, right?
[01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:10.940]   But I think what, if I may, at risk of just strengthening
[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:15.140]   that statement, I mean, that to me is signaling
[01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:17.640]   a bunch of other factors around, as you said,
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:20.220]   like keeping things in.
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:25.560]   What do you think explains, let's talk about that.
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:27.640]   Because I think that that's likely to have raised
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:28.800]   a certain flag in people's minds.
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:30.360]   Like what exactly is she talking about?
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:32.560]   Are you talking about less opportunity?
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:37.200]   Are you talking about less opportunity to vocalize?
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.560]   Are you talking about less opportunity
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.080]   to vocalize and be heard?
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:41.520]   I mean, I realize that there are an infinite number
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:43.200]   of variables, but given that it sounds
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:46.800]   like a really strong input to the system,
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:50.700]   what I mean by that is that psychology is influencing
[01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:55.700]   biology and you're saying that these power dynamics,
[01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:59.420]   structures and dynamics are impacting.
[01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:00.960]   I'd love to, let's hear your thoughts on that.
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:04.860]   Because I hate to let a flag like that go by
[01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:05.900]   without fleshing it out.
[01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:07.460]   - Never waste a good flag.
[01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:10.020]   - Well, and let's preface it by just saying that like,
[01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:11.980]   people will have different opinions on this and that's,
[01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:12.860]   and I think that's healthy.
[01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:14.940]   And like with the discussion about constipation,
[01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:16.920]   let's talk about what people aren't willing to talk about
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:17.860]   when it comes to health.
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:18.940]   - Love it.
[01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:22.700]   So we might need to talk about patriarchy on part two,
[01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:25.700]   but I'll give you some material that I've been working with.
[01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:30.740]   I started, I did not even understand the existence
[01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:34.440]   of patriarchy until I was a bioengineering undergraduate.
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.020]   - At MIT, I should mention,
[01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:40.780]   which has always had a bit of a skewed mail
[01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:42.820]   in terms of faculty numbers.
[01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:44.920]   - Well, that's true at most universities.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:46.940]   - That's true, well, my postdoc advisor was the late
[01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:51.100]   Ben Barris, who was a female to male transition,
[01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:53.160]   transgender, first transgender member
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.340]   of the National Academy of Sciences,
[01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:55.240]   one of my closest friends.
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.780]   Unfortunately, he died of pancreatic cancer.
[01:04:57.780 --> 01:04:58.780]   We were very, very close.
[01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:00.900]   They're actually making a documentary about Ben.
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:02.340]   But Ben, this is interesting,
[01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:06.780]   Ben went to MIT because he wanted to be around a lot of men.
[01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:08.040]   That's a lesser known fact,
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:11.500]   but then he was a very strong advocate for women.
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:14.140]   He went as Barbara when he was Barbara.
[01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:17.780]   And by the way, he's given me permission to share all this.
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:18.720]   Prior to his death,
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:21.820]   I recorded a lot of conversations with Ben.
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:23.680]   I only ever knew him as Ben, by the way.
[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:28.680]   But when he was at MIT, he was identified female.
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:33.740]   And he later talked about the intense suppression oppression,
[01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:37.120]   literally is how he described it,
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:40.040]   especially given that he was performing so well.
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:43.420]   - Yes, so you just defined patriarchy.
[01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:44.700]   You did it yourself.
[01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:46.900]   A couple things.
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:50.160]   When I was in bioengineering,
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:53.220]   I took a women's studies class.
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:56.340]   And it was all about teaching undergraduates
[01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:58.700]   about the existence of patriarchy,
[01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:02.840]   which I would define maybe at its simplest as power over.
[01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:06.660]   I'm not saying men are patriarchy.
[01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:10.160]   I'm saying something very different, which is power over.
[01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:13.720]   Let me correct one thing that you said.
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:16.440]   I didn't go to MIT as an undergraduate.
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:19.060]   So I was in Alaska,
[01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:21.060]   and I went to the University of Washington
[01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:22.340]   for bioengineering.
[01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:24.220]   - In Seattle. - In Seattle.
[01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:28.380]   I dropped out of a graduate program in bioengineering
[01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:32.260]   to go to the Harvard MIT program
[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:35.380]   for health sciences and technology in Boston.
[01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:36.680]   - Thanks for that clarification.
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:39.060]   University of Washington, also a wonderful place.
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:41.780]   I have many, many, many, many, many
[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:43.220]   wonderful close colleagues there.
[01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:46.320]   It's an incredible place, especially for vision science.
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:49.540]   - It's especially good for engineering, bioengineering.
[01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:54.540]   But yeah, so my MD is jointly between MIT and Harvard,
[01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:59.780]   and it's the oldest, maybe largest,
[01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:01.620]   although Harvard says this a lot,
[01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:04.220]   program for biomedical engineers
[01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:09.220]   and MD PhD's physician scientist training program.
[01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:12.260]   - Great, thanks for that clarification.
[01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:14.420]   I'm going to blame the internet for this one.
[01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:18.180]   I am, I think we need to send our Wikipedia editors out.
[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:19.660]   - I think LinkedIn is correct.
[01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:20.620]   - Okay, great.
[01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:23.580]   Well, Wikipedia editors, note,
[01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:27.020]   get out there and make the correction, now you heard it.
[01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:30.480]   So stress, what you're really talking about
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:34.520]   is systemic stress in the body as a consequence,
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:37.200]   excuse me, of systemic stress of environment.
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:38.240]   - That's right.
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.680]   But there's, you know, there's particular forms of it.
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:44.680]   I would say this also relates to white privilege.
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:48.980]   It relates to racism.
[01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:51.300]   And when you look at, you know,
[01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:56.300]   kind of the way that systems, including my beloved MIT,
[01:07:56.300 --> 01:08:00.200]   the way that they're set up is that might makes right.
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:03.440]   And generally the people that are the strongest,
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:05.180]   you know, big men, strong men,
[01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:08.300]   they're the ones who tend to be the most successful.
[01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:10.940]   So for people who are BIPOC,
[01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:14.220]   for people who don't have white privilege,
[01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:16.780]   for women, it's a different experience.
[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:21.140]   And so I'm using patriarchy as kind of a umbrella here,
[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:24.580]   but it connects to many other things.
[01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:26.220]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:29.300]   and thank our sponsor, Inside Tracker.
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:31.760]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:34.300]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:35.940]   to help you better understand your body
[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:37.780]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:40.420]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:42.840]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:44.860]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:47.460]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:49.520]   The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:53.060]   however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors,
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:54.580]   lipids and hormones and so forth,
[01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:56.340]   but you don't know what to do with those data.
[01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:58.100]   Inside Tracker solves that problem
[01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:00.440]   and makes it very easy for you to understand
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:03.460]   what sorts of nutritional, behavioral,
[01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:06.300]   maybe even supplementation-based interventions
[01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:07.460]   you might want to take on
[01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:10.060]   in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors,
[01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:11.840]   hormones, lipids, and other things
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:13.800]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:16.820]   to bring those numbers into the ranges that are appropriate
[01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:18.700]   and indeed optimal for you.
[01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:20.080]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:22.620]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman

[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:29.400]   to get 20% off.
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:30.860]   I want to use this as an opportunity
[01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:34.820]   to A, keep this in mind as we turn to a question
[01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:37.700]   that I didn't close the hatch on earlier,
[01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:40.700]   and it's my fault, which is I'm now clear on the fact
[01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:44.180]   that a woman in her late teens, early 20s
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:45.000]   ought to know something
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.900]   about her testosterone, estrogen, thyroid, cortisol levels,
[01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:51.780]   should start at least thinking about her microbiome,
[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:56.220]   should be thinking about how many bowel movements
[01:09:56.220 --> 01:10:00.060]   and the timing of those bowel movements per day, really.
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:03.820]   And I'm assuming that what I just described
[01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:08.580]   is also true for women in their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s,
[01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:11.660]   on up to hundreds, is that correct?
[01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:12.740]   - That's correct, but I would say
[01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:17.740]   that there are differential opportunities by decade.
[01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:21.820]   So I'm glad she's circled it back
[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:24.820]   to teenagers and testosterone,
[01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:28.020]   because I think if you know, for instance,
[01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:32.640]   in your teenage years, that you have high androgens
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:35.380]   and that you've got this potential phenotype
[01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:37.380]   way into the future that you may not even notice,
[01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:39.640]   I mean, maybe you notice you've got a few extra hairs
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:41.800]   on your chin or something,
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:43.900]   if you know that your testosterone is elevated
[01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:47.020]   or some other androgen, it might change the arc
[01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:48.740]   of how you take care of yourself.
[01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:52.100]   So I think that could be very helpful in your teenage years.
[01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:55.820]   In your 20s, for people who are a stress case like me,
[01:10:55.820 --> 01:11:00.820]   so age 27 on the wards at UCSF,
[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:03.700]   if I had known that I was such a high cortisol person,
[01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:06.500]   I think I would have done things differently.
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:08.700]   I would have changed my behavior.
[01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:11.560]   And I don't know because I didn't base case these,
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:16.560]   but your testosterone can decline starting in your 20s,
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:21.740]   kind of depending on how much stress your matrix is under.
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:24.580]   So for women that can start as early as 28,
[01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:28.740]   usually your testosterone declines by about 1% per year.
[01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:31.340]   - What level of testosterone do you like to see in a woman
[01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:34.520]   once she's sort of post, let's say after age 25?
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:35.780]   What kind of range is healthy?
[01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:37.980]   I know what the reference range is only
[01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:39.540]   because I know one could look it up.
[01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:41.960]   I don't know off the top of my head, admittedly.
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:46.960]   But what's a kind of a nice reference point there?
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:49.580]   - So the way I tend to describe this on podcasts
[01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:52.260]   is the top half of the normal range.
[01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:53.360]   - Great.
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:56.300]   - So that I think is a good benchmark.
[01:11:56.300 --> 01:12:01.300]   For PCOS, generally it's much higher than that.
[01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:03.020]   I've seen patients with PCOS
[01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:05.780]   where their total testosterone is 100 to 200.
[01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:08.160]   - Do they always have peripheral manifestations of that?
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:10.940]   A little bit of hair, the skin plaques I've heard about,
[01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:11.940]   so darkened skin plaques.
[01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:13.140]   - Irregular periods.
[01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:13.980]   - Regular periods.
[01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:17.300]   I get a lot of questions about PCOS.
[01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:18.140]   - Yeah.
[01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:21.540]   - And you're the first person we've had on this podcast
[01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:25.260]   that's really qualified to talk about PCOS in a real way.
[01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:27.740]   So here we're talking about too many androgens,
[01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:30.740]   cysts on the ovary, irregular ovarian,
[01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:32.820]   excuse me, I keep saying that,
[01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:35.020]   ovulatory/menstrual cycle.
[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:38.920]   What are some other indicators?
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:41.580]   And do you recommend that women
[01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:43.380]   start taking androgen blockers?
[01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:45.220]   Or, I mean, how do,
[01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:46.780]   it seems to be a lot of PCOS out there.
[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:48.980]   I'm hearing about it a lot.
[01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:50.640]   - So glad you asked about this.
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:55.640]   So PCOS is one of those really poorly understood conditions
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:59.020]   that gets, it kind of flies below the radar
[01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:01.260]   until a woman wants to get pregnant
[01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:05.080]   or she's got some other issue that drives her to a physician.
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:09.540]   The problem is that it is a syndrome, right?
[01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:12.280]   So polycystic ovary syndrome,
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:15.540]   sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome.
[01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:18.340]   And syndromes don't necessarily fit together
[01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:22.540]   into a really clear diagnostic criteria.
[01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:24.580]   So in this instance,
[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:27.080]   there are three different criteria that we look for.
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:28.780]   So cysts on the ovaries,
[01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:33.540]   having clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenism,
[01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:36.780]   so that could be hirsutism, acne, other things,
[01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:39.140]   and then usually irregular periods.
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:40.540]   And the way that that's defined,
[01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:43.500]   at least by the latest criteria,
[01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:47.740]   is having a period every 35 days or less.
[01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:51.180]   So typical cycle length, 28 days, 35 days,
[01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:53.520]   you're skipping a period here and there.
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:57.660]   So those are the criteria that we use to diagnose PCOS.
[01:13:57.660 --> 01:14:00.860]   There are about four different systems out there
[01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:02.900]   in the literature for diagnosing PCOS,
[01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:05.580]   which is where it starts to get confusing.
[01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:10.060]   So there's some women who have no cysts on their ovaries,
[01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:12.000]   but they've got hirsutism
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.920]   and they've got irregular periods.
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:15.300]   - Could you define hirsutism?
[01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:17.360]   - Hirsutism is increased hair growth,
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:19.460]   usually in places that you don't want it.
[01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:21.960]   So for women, it can be kind of male pattern.
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:24.660]   They might notice it on their breasts, on their chest.
[01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:30.280]   And then there's, of course, a familial quality to that.
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:31.900]   Like I was just looking at a paper last night
[01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:35.480]   looking at Israelis and how much hirsutism they have
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:38.660]   and whether this is related to CAG repeats
[01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:40.700]   on the androgen receptor.
[01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:42.240]   - Do they get, not Israelis,
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:45.800]   but do women who might have PCOS
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:49.000]   experience androgenic alopecia, so hair loss,
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.720]   that sort of of the quote unquote male pattern baldness?
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.720]   Of course, it's androgen pattern baldness
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:54.940]   as opposed to male.
[01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:57.220]   We're talking about testosterone, DHT related.
[01:14:57.220 --> 01:14:58.680]   - Sometimes, you know,
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:01.160]   this is where I'm going to invoke clinical experience
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:04.360]   rather than what I've seen in the literature.
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:07.780]   Women definitely can have some androgenic alopecia.
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:11.660]   I tend to see it later in life.
[01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:12.980]   But this is an important point
[01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:15.800]   because we think of PCOS as, you know,
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:17.700]   I was just talking about it in teenage years.
[01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:19.460]   Like wouldn't it be nice to know
[01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:21.680]   that you have this phenotype and you're at risk
[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:23.540]   for all the things that people are at risk for?
[01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:25.340]   And we haven't talked about glucose and insulin yet.
[01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:26.180]   We should.
[01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:31.440]   What we know is that PCOS is not just a problem
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:33.580]   in terms of irregular periods
[01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:36.120]   and then difficulty getting pregnant.
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:40.660]   So those are mostly problems in your 20s, 30s, early 40s,
[01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:44.100]   but it is a massive risk factor
[01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:47.120]   for cardiometabolic disease as you get older.
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:50.280]   So many people tend to pitch and hole PCOS
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:52.380]   as a problem of reproductive age.
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:53.540]   We have to be thinking of it
[01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:56.740]   over the entire female life cycle.
[01:15:56.740 --> 01:15:59.140]   And I would say it's even more important
[01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:01.480]   to consider it over the age of 50,
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:04.360]   you know, average age of menopause is 51 to 52,
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:07.620]   because we know that that elevated testosterone,
[01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:11.460]   the high androgens, are probably the greatest
[01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:16.460]   cardiometabolic driver of disease for women with PCOS.
[01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:19.300]   Now, one other thing I wanna mention,
[01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:20.580]   and I still have my notes
[01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:22.180]   that we're gonna talk about microbiome testing
[01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:23.820]   'cause that's such a fun subject.
[01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:28.700]   What I was taught to do, again,
[01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:30.060]   saying this with so much love
[01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:32.780]   for the people who have taught me how to do medicine.
[01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:34.220]   What I was taught to do is that
[01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:35.580]   if you have a woman with PCOS,
[01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:38.140]   you make the diagnosis, you measure her testosterone,
[01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:40.240]   you see if she has acne, blah, blah, blah.
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:43.460]   You ask that woman one question.
[01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:47.280]   Do you wanna get pregnant or not?
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:50.960]   So then you have these women with PCOS
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:52.920]   who get started on a birth control pill
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:54.460]   if they don't wanna get pregnant.
[01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:55.920]   If they wanna get pregnant,
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:57.640]   then you help them get pregnant
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:00.020]   by addressing some of these PCOS issues.
[01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:01.500]   Like maybe you give them Clomid,
[01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:04.720]   or you do something to make them ovulate more frequently.
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.740]   That is the way that
[01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:09.020]   most conventional medicine approaches this,
[01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:11.220]   and it does women a gigantic disservice.
[01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:13.180]   So one of the things I'm speaking into
[01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:16.160]   is the gender gap that exists.
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:20.540]   So my feeling is that the research money
[01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:23.200]   that goes into women's health is abysmal
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:25.300]   compared to what goes into men's health.
[01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:26.120]   - Really?
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:27.280]   - And I think that's changing,
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:29.700]   but there's also a huge lack of awareness
[01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:31.320]   of sex and gender differences
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:35.080]   when it comes to the way that we construct clinical trials
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:36.200]   and other experiments.
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:37.160]   - Well, that's absolutely true.
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.640]   I mean, I've sat on NIH review panels
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:41.320]   for more than a decade now.
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:42.280]   I'm a regular standing member,
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:44.480]   which is only to say that I see the research
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:45.800]   as it's being proposed.
[01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:46.620]   - Yes.
[01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:49.440]   - And now it's required.
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:50.680]   No grant will get funded
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:53.200]   without sex as a biological variable.
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:54.800]   And here I'm, by the way, folks,
[01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:58.880]   this is sex, biological sex, the noun, not sex, the verb.
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:00.800]   Both are super interesting, obviously,
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:03.520]   but when we say sex as a biological variable,
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:06.080]   meaning even if it's a study on mice.
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:07.520]   - Where did that start though?
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:08.520]   - That didn't start that long ago.
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:11.160]   It must've been, I think we can thank,
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.200]   I don't want to miss attribute here.
[01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:14.560]   I think we can thank Francis Collins for insisting on this.
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:16.760]   - Amen, Francis and Bernadine Healy.
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:19.280]   Bernadine Healy has done so much to help us,
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:22.440]   but she made the Women's Health Initiative,
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:25.640]   which I hope we'll get to, which is a hot mess.
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:28.560]   Like so confusing, the data that came out of that.
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:29.980]   - Yes, and these trials are long.
[01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:32.200]   And so the data are only now starting to emerge.
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:35.280]   So just to be clear, I mean, I have a question
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:36.720]   that I don't think is going to take us off track,
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:39.420]   but this is, I'm going to pose this question as a hypothesis
[01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:41.940]   because I think it's likely to be a little bit
[01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:44.800]   of a, not a barbed wire question,
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:47.920]   but maybe like a prickly question when people first hear it,
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:49.360]   but it's posed as a hypothesis.
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:52.960]   You mentioned some of the psychosocial stress issues
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:56.380]   based on at the organizational level, institutional level,
[01:18:56.380 --> 01:18:59.140]   societal level, maybe right down to the family
[01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:03.600]   and just life that are biasing health outcomes
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:06.400]   for the worse in female populations, okay?
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:07.680]   You referred to as the patriarchy.
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:09.360]   I'm just trying to put,
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:11.040]   make sure that we're both talking about the same thing.
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:13.220]   And that's non-exhaustive, I realize.
[01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:14.960]   That's just a subset of the issues.
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:18.680]   I'm also hearing there's a lot more PCOS,
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:23.120]   which is hyperandrogenization of the ovary.
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:26.280]   In there, we're talking about, you mentioned it,
[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:29.360]   excess testosterone, which females naturally
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:32.000]   have more testosterone than they do estrogen anyway,
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.120]   but we're talking about elevated levels.
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:37.180]   Here's a hypothesis.
[01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:40.920]   One hypothesis would be that the increased androgens
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:43.640]   and the PCOS are a consequence
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:46.860]   of the psychosocial conditions that are,
[01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:48.640]   I don't want to say forcing,
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:53.640]   but are biasing the need for females to think, behave,
[01:19:55.020 --> 01:20:00.020]   react, act in certain ways to survive, let alone thrive.
[01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:02.120]   Is that a, I don't say this
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:04.980]   for any kind of political correctness hypothesis.
[01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:08.320]   This is a, in my, this would be a fun, interesting,
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.680]   and I think important study to run, right?
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:12.800]   Depending on stress and the conditions,
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:15.800]   the specific type of stress,
[01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:20.800]   do females underproduce or overproduce androgens,
[01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:23.240]   or is it a neutral effect?
[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:25.120]   Does that make sense?
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:26.640]   - I love this question.
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:29.140]   So let me just paraphrase the last part of it
[01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:30.860]   to make sure I got it.
[01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:32.860]   It sounds like what you're asking is,
[01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:36.820]   could PCOS or at least some phenotypes of PCOS
[01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:40.340]   be a response to what I'm calling patriarchy?
[01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:43.780]   And then you add a second part to it,
[01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:46.360]   which is do healthy women,
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:48.480]   like what is their production of testosterone like?
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:49.320]   Is that right?
[01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:50.900]   - Yes, and with the acknowledgement,
[01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:52.500]   I mean, you're the expert here.
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:55.540]   You're the physician clinician and expert in hormones,
[01:20:55.540 --> 01:20:58.440]   and I'm not, but with the understanding
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:01.060]   that absolute levels of hormones are interesting,
[01:21:01.060 --> 01:21:03.260]   but perhaps not as interesting
[01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:05.680]   as the ratios of testosterone to estrogen.
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:07.720]   So when we're talking about excess testosterone,
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:08.600]   we're really not talking about,
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:10.380]   oh, women making a lot of testosterone,
[01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:12.440]   because frankly, they already make a lot.
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:14.980]   Then most people that weren't aware of that,
[01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:16.840]   I wasn't aware that women make more testosterone
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:17.920]   than estrogen. - And we need it.
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:20.440]   - Right, and so it's not saying that testosterone in women
[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:23.120]   is bad or is always a reaction to the environment,
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:28.120]   but when it becomes super physiological or hyper-elevated,
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:31.500]   I could imagine all sorts of social conditions
[01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:36.020]   that would create that, so in males and females,
[01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:38.380]   but here we're talking about PCOS in females in particular.
[01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:40.960]   So I'd love for you to speculate.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:41.960]   Should we run the study?
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:43.220]   - We should totally run the study,
[01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:46.400]   because I don't know the answer.
[01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:51.200]   I suspect that you're onto something.
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:53.920]   It may not explain all of the women with PCOS,
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:54.780]   because as I mentioned,
[01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:56.720]   there's a lot of different phenotypes,
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:01.060]   but I think it could explain a significant portion,
[01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:04.400]   and you're almost, you're seeing,
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:07.440]   if we look at the gene-environment interface,
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:11.160]   this environmental influence of being someone
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:15.800]   who's got power over you, if PCOS was a response to that,
[01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:20.260]   the way that we treat it would be completely different.
[01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:23.880]   So on the one hand, I wanna be careful
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:27.020]   not to dismiss the suffering and experience
[01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:28.180]   of women with PCOS.
[01:22:28.180 --> 01:22:31.060]   I've got a lot of women with PCOS in my family,
[01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:36.060]   and it is, there's so much pain and suffering,
[01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:37.880]   especially if you wanna have a baby,
[01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:41.860]   and you try for years, and you just can't ovulate.
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:49.120]   On the other hand, I read a paper recently,
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:51.500]   and maybe we could cite this,
[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:55.120]   that compares the phenotype of a woman with PCOS
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:58.500]   to a man who is hypoandrogenic,
[01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:02.040]   and I think that's a really interesting way to look at this,
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:07.040]   because the thread we haven't talked about with PCOS
[01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:11.240]   is the role of insulin and glucose.
[01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:15.460]   So for some of the phenotypes of PCOS,
[01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:19.520]   the problem is hyperinsulinemia, high insulin in the blood,
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:21.600]   is driving those theca cells in the ovaries
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:23.520]   to overproduce testosterone.
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:25.020]   - These women are insulin insensitive,
[01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:27.640]   so more insulin's being cranked out,
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:29.620]   and these cells in the ovary
[01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:31.580]   are therefore making more androgen.
[01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:33.540]   - You don't like to say insulin resistant?
[01:23:33.540 --> 01:23:36.540]   - Oh, I can, I don't have a problem saying insulin resistant.
[01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:37.900]   - Okay, I like the way that's used.
[01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:39.740]   - I'm just a little bit outside the lane lines
[01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:41.220]   of my expertise, so I was trying to use
[01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:42.760]   what is the correct nomenclature
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:44.020]   so that we can make sure they don't hear something.
[01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:45.820]   - Well, what I like about insulin insensitive,
[01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:46.840]   the way that you just said it,
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:49.760]   is that I think that offers people a way in,
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:52.600]   and I love to do that in terms of messaging.
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:54.980]   Insulin resistance starts to lose people
[01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:56.540]   'cause they don't really get what that means
[01:23:56.540 --> 01:23:57.580]   at a receptor level.
[01:23:57.580 --> 01:23:59.380]   - I think I say insulin insensitive
[01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:02.520]   because when people hear insulin sensitive,
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:03.760]   it almost sounds like a bad thing,
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:05.080]   but that's actually what you want.
[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:07.440]   So I think that's how I defaulted to insulin insensitive.
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:09.080]   - What's your insulin?
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:10.000]   - I don't know.
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:10.840]   - What?
[01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:11.680]   - I'm doing a blood test.
[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:12.500]   - Yes, you are.
[01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:13.480]   - I'm due for a blood test.
[01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:15.540]   I had blood work done about eight months.
[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:16.500]   Sure, that'd be great.
[01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:20.020]   I'm always experimenting with different supplements
[01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:21.520]   and different behavioral regimens,
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:24.100]   and I've kept charts since I was 19.
[01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:25.340]   - Oh, you're like my patient.
[01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:27.320]   - I've been sort of obsessed by this,
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:30.800]   and I would say everybody, if you can afford it,
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:33.020]   and at the time actually I had to save up insurance,
[01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:36.700]   wouldn't cover it, get some basic blood work done
[01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:37.780]   so that you have a reference.
[01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:39.040]   - Do it as soon as possible,
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:42.820]   because even, we've been talking about these women
[01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:44.520]   over the life cycle.
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:48.020]   I wish I knew what my insulin was when I was a teenager.
[01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:50.340]   I wish I knew what my fasting insulin was.
[01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:53.720]   I really wish I knew my postprandial insulin,
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:57.180]   like in my teenage years, in my 20s, in my 30s.
[01:24:57.180 --> 01:24:59.700]   Well, I knew it in my 30s, starting at 35.
[01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:02.540]   - Are you a fan of continuous glucose monitors?
[01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:05.140]   - The hugest, most gigantic fan of CGMs.
[01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:08.660]   I've never seen any tool that I've ever used in medicine
[01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:11.040]   change behavior the way that CGMs do.
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:14.140]   - Wow, why do you think they are so effective
[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:14.980]   at changing behavior?
[01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:16.720]   I've tried one and I really liked it.
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:19.740]   I learned that in the sauna, my insulin,
[01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:22.140]   my blood glucose goes up probably by a bit of dehydration.
[01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:24.780]   I learned what kind of foods work for me, which don't.
[01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:26.720]   I thought it was fascinating.
[01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:28.960]   I learned how every behavior you could possibly imagine,
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:31.280]   use your imagination, impacts blood glucose.
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:32.120]   - Totally.
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:33.280]   - It was totally fascinating to me,
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:36.280]   including how two wake ups during the middle of the night
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:39.180]   versus one versus none impacted blood glucose
[01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:40.020]   the next morning.
[01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:40.840]   Fascinating.
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:43.860]   For a data junkie like me, it was like I was in heaven.
[01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:47.060]   Why do you think they are so effective in changing behavior?
[01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:47.900]   Is it because of that,
[01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:49.500]   that people can see that real-time control,
[01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:53.900]   like scan in and like, oh, that's the sandwich glucose?
[01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:54.940]   - I think it's many things.
[01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:59.940]   I think it's generally the enchantment
[01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:02.940]   of learning about your own chemistry and biology.
[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:03.780]   - I love that.
[01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:06.100]   - And I think for me, what I've seen,
[01:26:06.100 --> 01:26:09.340]   I feel like doctors are basically marketers,
[01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:10.860]   like the secret marketing.
[01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:15.240]   Like our job as a physician is to convince people
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:17.240]   to do something that we think is good for them
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:19.560]   based on the best science.
[01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:21.140]   But we can't just say,
[01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:23.580]   here, why don't you fill this prescription for a CGM?
[01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:24.840]   You have to market it.
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:29.000]   You have to say, I think this completely changes
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.900]   the way that you approach your prediabetes.
[01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:34.340]   I think this could dramatically affect
[01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:35.740]   your risk of Alzheimer's disease.
[01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:38.300]   Which you're so worried about that your mother has.
[01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:42.660]   So our job as physicians is to be that sacred marketer.
[01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:45.800]   So CGMs are one of my tools that I think are so crucial.
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:50.400]   So enchantment number two, yeah, it's the real-time effect.
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:53.140]   So if you go get your glucose and insulin measured,
[01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:56.620]   or maybe you do like a two hour glucose challenge test,
[01:26:56.620 --> 01:26:59.660]   where you look at glucose and insulin at the fasting point,
[01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:03.160]   one hour later, two hours later, or more frequently,
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:06.780]   that does not have the same kind of behavior effect
[01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:09.840]   as having continuous data where you can say,
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:13.800]   okay, I drove to see you, Andrew, from my place in Berkeley,
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:17.820]   and it was stressful, it was torrentially raining,
[01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:20.340]   and I know my glucose was elevated.
[01:27:20.340 --> 01:27:22.900]   Like I think really understanding
[01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:27.900]   what the mediators are of your glucose control is essential.
[01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:31.600]   Now that said, it's also kind of a later effect.
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:33.820]   I mean, I'd rather know your insulin.
[01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:38.820]   And we know from the Whitehall study that insulin,
[01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:42.180]   especially postprandial insulin, fasting insulin too,
[01:27:42.180 --> 01:27:44.220]   can change years and years
[01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:46.940]   before you get a change in glucose.
[01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:51.340]   So that's more for pre-diabetes and diabetes.
[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:52.700]   So I think those are the main reasons
[01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:54.760]   why I think it's such an important tool.
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:28:00.620]   Third thing is it democratizes data, which you do too.
[01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:04.020]   I mean, incredible how you do that with your podcast.
[01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:07.920]   But I think one of the most hopeful and exciting things
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:12.680]   that I'm seeing right now in the health space
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:16.580]   is that we're going from this patriarchal relationship
[01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:21.320]   where doctors hold the power and are the gatekeepers of data
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:26.320]   to patients and clients having much more access
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:29.880]   to that enchantment about their own chemistry
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:31.460]   and their own biology.
[01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:33.980]   So to me, that is so exciting.
[01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:38.900]   For me to be able to, I've got probably 100 patients
[01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:41.220]   that are in a data stream with me
[01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:43.620]   where we're looking at their glucose, and I can,
[01:28:43.620 --> 01:28:44.560]   I mean, I'm on sabbatical,
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:45.920]   so I'm not doing this so much anymore,
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:47.780]   but I can call a patient and be like,
[01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:49.420]   "Why is your glucose so high?
[01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:50.260]   "What did you do?"
[01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:51.080]   "Oh, it was my birthday.
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:52.780]   "I had a piece of birthday cake."
[01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:56.320]   That kind of collaboration,
[01:28:57.860 --> 01:29:02.860]   that also is teaching the patient to be their own clinician.
[01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:07.720]   To me, that is a loop of benevolence and integrity
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:11.600]   that I think is essential to creating health.
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:13.760]   We've got a disease care system.
[01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:16.060]   We need the democratization of data
[01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:19.520]   to become a health-based system.
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:20.360]   - Amen to that.
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:23.840]   A million times over, we share that sentiment,
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:25.840]   I can tell it at a deep level.
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:29.000]   I think the pandemic actually assisted in,
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.220]   well, it harmed many things,
[01:29:30.220 --> 01:29:32.280]   but it assisted in people's understanding
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:35.960]   that no magic fairy, nor the government,
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:38.720]   nor anyone was going to arrive at their door
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:41.040]   with a kit of things to make them healthy,
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:42.740]   that provide sunlight, movement, sleep,
[01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:44.760]   and all the various aspects of nutrition.
[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:46.400]   No, nothing.
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:49.620]   Nothing that everyone has to have access to,
[01:29:49.620 --> 01:29:50.600]   first and foremost,
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:53.920]   and then implement those things as best they can.
[01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:56.560]   Speaking of which, and circling back to this idea
[01:29:56.560 --> 01:29:59.620]   of people in their late teens, 20s, 30s, and onward,
[01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:01.640]   if you had a magic wand,
[01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:05.440]   and you could give two or three don'ts,
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:06.560]   or to make it personal,
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:10.860]   if you could go back in time and erase certain behaviors,
[01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:14.720]   what would the don'ts category be?
[01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:17.960]   You can tell us more than two or three,
[01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:22.960]   but if the goal is to maximize vitality and longevity,
[01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:27.160]   and those are not always parallel to one another,
[01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:28.240]   they're certainly not the same thing,
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:32.400]   sometimes orthogonal, but let's just say fertility
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:34.640]   being a proxy for vitality and longevity.
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:35.760]   I think people will sometimes forget this,
[01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:36.840]   that fertility isn't just about
[01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:38.000]   people who want to conceive children,
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.520]   it's also, it can serve as a proxy
[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:41.980]   for vitality and longevity.
[01:30:41.980 --> 01:30:45.480]   So what would you like to see patients,
[01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:47.020]   let's focus first on female patients,
[01:30:47.020 --> 01:30:50.420]   but if it extends to male patients as well,
[01:30:50.420 --> 01:30:54.100]   what would you like to see them not do, or do far less of?
[01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:55.220]   - I really like that.
[01:30:55.220 --> 01:30:58.340]   So I would say a few things, I'll just headline them,
[01:30:58.340 --> 01:31:00.020]   and then we can go into detail.
[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:01.660]   Number one, sleep.
[01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:04.480]   I do want to diverge from you a little bit on some things,
[01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:06.500]   but sleep is probably not one of them.
[01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:07.380]   - No, well, feel free.
[01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:11.300]   I mean, you're the one that worked 120 hours a week.
[01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:12.180]   - I was not sleeping much then,
[01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:13.380]   let's just put it that way. - I can't imagine,
[01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:15.820]   unless you lived in a different reality than I do.
[01:31:15.820 --> 01:31:18.420]   And there are times in my career
[01:31:18.420 --> 01:31:20.260]   where I was pulling all-nighters and sleep-deprived,
[01:31:20.260 --> 01:31:23.520]   there's just, I don't recommend it, but I did it.
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:24.960]   - Yeah, I hope you don't do that anymore.
[01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:27.820]   - No longer if I can avoid it, but there were years,
[01:31:27.820 --> 01:31:30.020]   many years where it was like, all right, here we go.
[01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:35.020]   And I'm quite adept at it for one cycle,
[01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:37.420]   but two nights I kind of start to fall apart.
[01:31:37.420 --> 01:31:38.500]   - Totally. - Yeah.
[01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:42.900]   - So I would say sleep, alcohol, high perceived stress.
[01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:46.540]   And I'd love to talk about maybe the data on telomeres
[01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:47.380]   and what we know.
[01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:49.500]   - So you'd like to see people get enough sleep,
[01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:51.300]   so don't, don't.
[01:31:51.300 --> 01:31:53.180]   - Yeah, not all of these are concordant.
[01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:56.860]   So not enough sleep, too much alcohol,
[01:31:56.860 --> 01:32:01.780]   too much perceived stress, eating the wrong foods,
[01:32:01.780 --> 01:32:08.620]   toxic relationships, and isolation.
[01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:11.820]   And then number six, not moving enough
[01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:18.240]   or not moving and exercising in a way
[01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:20.580]   that really fits with your body.
[01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:22.100]   - Can we start with that one actually?
[01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:23.060]   - Sure. - Just 'cause it's such a,
[01:32:23.060 --> 01:32:24.260]   and then work backwards.
[01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:26.320]   That's interesting.
[01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:29.560]   I think nowadays people appreciate the need
[01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:31.280]   for quote unquote cardio.
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:33.780]   I know that the exercise physiologists cringe
[01:32:33.780 --> 01:32:36.420]   and dissolve into a puddle of tears when I say that,
[01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:39.980]   but getting the heart rate up over some period of time,
[01:32:39.980 --> 01:32:42.380]   longer than 10 minutes in order
[01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:44.960]   to generate cardiovascular health circulation.
[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:47.820]   So, and resistance training of some kind, maybe flexibility.
[01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:52.100]   What do you mean by body phenotype and exercise?
[01:32:52.100 --> 01:32:53.600]   - I'll speak from personal experience.
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:56.020]   So what I did through,
[01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:58.040]   I mean, I gave up my 20s to medicine.
[01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:02.860]   And during that time, I occasionally got to the gym,
[01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:06.240]   you know, at UCSF on Parnassus, you could go to the gym,
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:07.620]   and then as soon as your beeper went off,
[01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:10.680]   you're back into the hospital.
[01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:11.840]   But I didn't exercise much.
[01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:13.900]   I had, do you remember Nordic tracks?
[01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:15.580]   I had a Nordic track in my house,
[01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:17.900]   and that was like it.
[01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:20.980]   What I believe, because for me,
[01:33:20.980 --> 01:33:24.300]   the primary outcome that I'm interested in
[01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:26.400]   is cardio metabolic health.
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:29.380]   So when it comes to exercise, what I really feel,
[01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:31.800]   if we're gonna be at a population level,
[01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:35.660]   I feel that about a third cardio,
[01:33:35.660 --> 01:33:37.980]   two thirds resistance training
[01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:41.420]   is based on my synthesis of the literature,
[01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:43.380]   the best combination.
[01:33:43.380 --> 01:33:44.660]   And I think there's, you know,
[01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:49.140]   as you described with your sign study,
[01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:51.660]   I think there's a minimal effective dose,
[01:33:51.660 --> 01:33:55.460]   which for a population is about 150 minutes.
[01:33:55.460 --> 01:33:58.460]   I think most of us need a lot more than that.
[01:33:58.460 --> 01:34:00.260]   - Per week of- - Per week.
[01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:02.780]   But I think, you know, for me,
[01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:07.780]   because I have a phenotype that produces a lot of insulin,
[01:34:07.780 --> 01:34:11.780]   kind of depending on how I'm on my game,
[01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:13.280]   I have a lot of glucose.
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:17.240]   So I have to exercise a lot more to dispose that glucose.
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:20.220]   So I think you then have to move from medicine
[01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:23.480]   for the population or prescriptions for the population
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:26.060]   to what works for the individual.
[01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:30.020]   - I think that recommendation is fantastic.
[01:34:30.020 --> 01:34:32.700]   I think resistance training, well, let me put it this way.
[01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:34.560]   I'm neither a trainer nor a physician,
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:36.960]   but I've seen in family members that were doing,
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:40.420]   I wouldn't say a lot of cardio, but just cardio,
[01:34:40.420 --> 01:34:42.380]   when they add resistance training,
[01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:45.160]   everything in terms, including their biomarkers,
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:48.000]   have improved dramatically.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:48.960]   - Yes. - This is in particular
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:51.500]   for female members of my family.
[01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:54.500]   - Well, one of the mediators that I think is important,
[01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:57.020]   especially for people who do what I call chronic cardio,
[01:34:57.020 --> 01:35:01.000]   which is what I did, is cortisol.
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:05.560]   So we know that runners, especially marathon runners,
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:08.200]   people who do a lot of cardio
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:09.940]   and don't do much resistance training,
[01:35:09.940 --> 01:35:11.860]   they tend to have much high cortisol levels.
[01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:13.700]   And you can buffer that with vitamin C.
[01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:16.060]   Vitamin C can decrease the effect.
[01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:20.100]   But chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
[01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:22.140]   So quick personal example.
[01:35:22.140 --> 01:35:25.740]   When I first started measuring hormone panels in myself,
[01:35:25.740 --> 01:35:29.840]   I went to my physician and I said, "I'm 35.
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:32.720]   "I've had one kid, I wanna have another kid.
[01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:34.820]   "I've never been so exhausted in my life.
[01:35:34.820 --> 01:35:38.220]   "I just feel like I'm pushing a rock up the hill.
[01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:40.620]   "I've got this belly fat that I don't like."
[01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:44.420]   And I don't wanna have sex with my husband.
[01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:46.620]   So what do you think?
[01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:48.360]   What could we do about this?
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:53.180]   And he offered a birth control pill and an antidepressant.
[01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:54.020]   - Oh, goodness.
[01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:56.140]   - So I left him and I went to the lab
[01:35:56.140 --> 01:35:58.780]   and I ran a hormone panel and my cortisol
[01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:00.940]   was three times what it should have been.
[01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:02.780]   My insulin was in the 20s.
[01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:04.060]   I was fasting.
[01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:06.700]   My glucose was 105.
[01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:10.020]   My thyroid was mildly abnormal.
[01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:12.100]   My progesterone was low.
[01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:15.420]   And that set me on this course of realizing
[01:36:15.420 --> 01:36:18.240]   that what I was doing as a physician,
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:20.880]   taking care especially of women,
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:23.380]   was not getting to some of these root causes
[01:36:23.380 --> 01:36:24.620]   that are so essential.
[01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:28.260]   And I would say I had to start first with cortisol.
[01:36:28.260 --> 01:36:30.580]   At that time, I was running four miles,
[01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:32.460]   three times a week, four times a week.
[01:36:32.460 --> 01:36:35.060]   That was just raising my cortisol further.
[01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:36.780]   So that was not the right exercise for me.
[01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:38.580]   I needed more adaptive exercise.
[01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:41.060]   I started doing Pilates, more yoga.
[01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:42.700]   That helped to lower my cortisol.
[01:36:42.700 --> 01:36:45.780]   I mean, it started me on changing the way
[01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:47.580]   I was managing perceived stress
[01:36:47.580 --> 01:36:50.300]   and it also changed my supplement regimen.
[01:36:50.300 --> 01:36:51.140]   - Can we talk about that?
[01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:53.820]   With the moment you said lowering cortisol,
[01:36:53.820 --> 01:36:56.620]   thought of the two supplements that come to mind
[01:36:56.620 --> 01:37:01.100]   are ashwagandha, which I think can potently reduce cortisol,
[01:37:01.100 --> 01:37:04.780]   but I've heard some recommendations about cycling it.
[01:37:04.780 --> 01:37:06.500]   And I've always wondered about time of day
[01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:09.220]   for ashwagandha intake because sort of, quote-unquote,
[01:37:09.220 --> 01:37:12.140]   want cortisol elevated in the early part of the day.
[01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:12.980]   We know this.
[01:37:12.980 --> 01:37:17.100]   We know you do not want cortisol peaking later in the day.
[01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:17.940]   - No, you do not.
[01:37:17.940 --> 01:37:19.420]   Interferes with sleep.
[01:37:19.420 --> 01:37:21.340]   - Interferes with sleep.
[01:37:21.340 --> 01:37:24.860]   And then the other supplement is rhodiola rosacea.
[01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:26.260]   Am I pronouncing that correctly?
[01:37:26.260 --> 01:37:28.140]   - Yeah, so rhodiola is very effective.
[01:37:28.140 --> 01:37:30.400]   It's been shown in multiple randomized trials
[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:32.860]   to lower cortisol, so that could be very effective.
[01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:33.820]   - What sort of dose?
[01:37:33.820 --> 01:37:35.540]   I've started taking it recently, by the way,
[01:37:35.540 --> 01:37:36.940]   and I made a huge mistake.
[01:37:36.940 --> 01:37:38.140]   I like to make the mistakes first
[01:37:38.140 --> 01:37:41.100]   so then my audiences don't make them.
[01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:43.300]   As I was taking it, I heard it was an adaptogen,
[01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:45.900]   so I thought, oh, I'll take it before resistance training.
[01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:47.460]   But of course you want the cortisol peak
[01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:48.460]   during resistance training
[01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:50.740]   because that's going to set in motion the adaptive response.
[01:37:50.740 --> 01:37:52.060]   So I started taking it later in the day
[01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:53.260]   and it's really improved.
[01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:57.260]   I would say my late day, second half of the day cognition,
[01:37:57.260 --> 01:37:59.300]   this is subjective, to be fair.
[01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:01.940]   I just feel like I'm in a more even plane of attention
[01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:03.540]   in the second half of the day.
[01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:05.520]   - So you're describing an end-of-one experiment.
[01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:07.100]   - Right, anecdotal.
[01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:10.180]   - Well, it is not anecdotal.
[01:38:10.180 --> 01:38:12.620]   So I was taught at Harvard Medical School
[01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:14.720]   that the hierarchy of evidence
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:19.720]   starts at the lowest with expert opinion, case studies,
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:22.100]   then you've got cohort studies,
[01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:25.680]   then you've got observational data that's prospective,
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:27.040]   then you have randomized trial.
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:29.300]   But the highest quality evidence of all
[01:38:29.300 --> 01:38:31.260]   is the end-of-one experiment,
[01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:33.340]   where you serve as your own control.
[01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:34.940]   So what you're describing with rhodiola,
[01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:37.460]   I would frame that as an end-of-one experiment,
[01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:38.640]   where you have a washout period
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:40.500]   and you compare before and after.
[01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:42.380]   And I'd like to measure some other metrics
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:45.520]   to see if there's an effect, including your cortisol.
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:47.980]   So rhodiola has been shown in multiple randomized trials
[01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:49.400]   to reduce cortisol.
[01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:52.380]   The other thing that I think is super effective
[01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:56.040]   is phosphatidylserine, PS for short.
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:39:00.800]   Fish oil also more modestly reduces cortisol.
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:03.800]   Ashwagandha is interesting.
[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:06.920]   So in my first book, "The Hormone Cure."
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:08.860]   - Which I read by the way.
[01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:09.840]   - You did? - I did.
[01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:11.080]   - I was hoping that was the one you read.
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:12.980]   - I did, I read it and it's spectacular.
[01:39:12.980 --> 01:39:15.200]   And I thought going into it, I had this like,
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:16.980]   let's just call it what it was.
[01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:17.820]   It's kind of male bias.
[01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:19.300]   Like, is there going to be anything in here for me?
[01:39:19.300 --> 01:39:22.480]   Because I don't have ovaries and is this going to be,
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:25.400]   and it was immensely informative.
[01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:26.320]   So thank you.
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:28.240]   Yeah, I have very fond recollections
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:29.780]   of the walks I took listening to it.
[01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:31.180]   And then I own the print version too.
[01:39:31.180 --> 01:39:32.880]   So I like to switch back and forth.
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:33.800]   So thank you for that.
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:36.080]   It's a superb book for anyone to read.
[01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:36.920]   - Thank you. - Yeah.
[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:37.960]   - I so appreciate that.
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:42.720]   So in chapter four, you may or may not remember
[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:46.560]   that Ashwagandha, at least the time that I wrote that book,
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:48.880]   Ashwagandha's data is not great,
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:51.040]   but lack of proof is not proof against.
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:53.960]   So with Ashwagandha, most of the data comes
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:57.360]   from thousands of years of using it in diabetic medicine.
[01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:00.800]   And it's considered, again, not my science hat.
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:02.580]   It's considered a double adaptogen
[01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:04.840]   so that it's potentially helpful
[01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:09.400]   when you are a high cortisol phenotype like I was,
[01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:13.060]   like I sometimes still am, or low cortisol.
[01:40:13.060 --> 01:40:16.660]   I haven't found that in my patients,
[01:40:16.660 --> 01:40:18.900]   although I'll give you one exception.
[01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:21.820]   So Ashwagandha is mostly based on animal studies.
[01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:23.620]   There's not as much human data,
[01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:26.640]   but it is used a ton in integrative medicine.
[01:40:29.020 --> 01:40:32.920]   There's one supplement that I found to be incredibly helpful
[01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:36.000]   for people who tend to have high cortisol at night,
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.640]   and that's called a cortisol manager.
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:39.980]   It's by Integrative Therapeutics.
[01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:43.520]   I don't have a second supplement manufacturer
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:44.680]   that makes something similar.
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:46.520]   It's their number one selling supplement
[01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:47.680]   because it's so effective.
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:49.120]   - Is it a cocktail of several things?
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:52.580]   - It's a combination of phosphatidylserine and Ashwagandha.
[01:40:52.580 --> 01:40:54.320]   - Tell me more about phosphatidylserine.
[01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:56.580]   I am familiar with it for,
[01:40:56.580 --> 01:40:58.880]   it's been mentioned by some guests
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:00.700]   that were on the Tim Ferriss podcast long ago
[01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:03.840]   for other reasons, I think, related to sleep.
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:07.060]   And maybe that's another reason why you like it.
[01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:08.700]   But before we move on from rhodiola,
[01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:11.640]   is there a dosage of rhodiola rosacea that you-
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:13.620]   - So I would refer people to my book
[01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:15.520]   because the randomized trials
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:18.360]   and the doses that were used are in there.
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:19.800]   So I can't remember with rhodiola,
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:22.500]   although I took it this morning to prepare to be with you.
[01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:24.760]   - We can look it up and put a show note caption
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:25.800]   so people can link it. - I can remember the dose
[01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:28.560]   with phosphatidylserine 'cause I take that regularly.
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:32.320]   So 400 to 800 milligrams is the typical dose for PS.
[01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:34.560]   And what's interesting is that
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:37.020]   in the randomized trials that were done,
[01:41:37.020 --> 01:41:40.040]   400 milligrams was more effective than 800 milligrams.
[01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:40.880]   - Interesting.
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:42.280]   I've found that for several supplements
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:44.640]   that the lower dose was more effective.
[01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:46.040]   - Yes.
[01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:47.880]   - Yeah, it doesn't matter what those were.
[01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:49.760]   And so when you say PS, you were referring to,
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:51.880]   by the way, folks, not PCOS, just 'cause-
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:52.920]   [laughing]
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:54.440]   Scientists and clinicians are familiar with,
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:56.400]   and military, very familiar with acronyms,
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:59.000]   phosphatidylserine, PS, so 400 to 800 milligrams,
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:00.160]   400 being more effective.
[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:03.400]   Taken later in the day or early day, does it matter?
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:06.220]   - It depends on when your cortisol is high.
[01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:10.880]   So for me, I tend to, what's the pattern for cortisol?
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:13.960]   Typically, it rises to its peak
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:16.160]   30 to 60 minutes after you get up.
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:19.360]   Then it has this gradual kind of asymptotic decline
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:21.080]   until you go to bed.
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:26.080]   So if you're someone like me who peaks way crazy high,
[01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:28.640]   I don't do that anymore, but that's what I used to do,
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:31.320]   I need a phosphatidylserine in the morning.
[01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:33.520]   For people who are high at night,
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:37.720]   who have what's known as a flat cortisol pattern
[01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:42.040]   or a inverted pattern, you wanna take it at night.
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:44.280]   And the flat pattern, just quick sidebar,
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:48.520]   is that that's associated with a number of conditions
[01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:51.220]   that most mainstream physicians don't know about.
[01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:53.860]   So a flat pattern where it's low in the morning
[01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:56.660]   and it's high at night is associated with anxiety,
[01:42:56.660 --> 01:43:00.240]   depression, decreased survival from breast cancer.
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:03.780]   That was studied at Stanford by David Spiegel.
[01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:07.500]   - He was my close even collaborator,
[01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:10.220]   even on the breath work study that we just did.
[01:43:10.220 --> 01:43:11.100]   - Oh, interesting.
[01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:13.300]   - Yeah, he's our associate chair of psychiatry now.
[01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:17.240]   So a wonderful human being has been a guest on this podcast.
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:19.420]   And I'm now fantasizing about a conversation
[01:43:19.420 --> 01:43:23.780]   that includes a panel of incredible minds
[01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:25.400]   like you and David from the clinical side.
[01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:29.440]   So in any case, yeah, the late shifted cortisol, not good.
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:30.600]   - Not good.
[01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:35.600]   And it seems to have the worst immune downstream issues
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:41.580]   of any of the cortisol patterns.
[01:43:41.580 --> 01:43:43.080]   So that's really important to know about
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:48.080]   because it then maps to things like it's related to PTSD.
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:51.440]   So that's the pattern we see like in vets
[01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:54.120]   who've got PTSD as well as others.
[01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:56.860]   It maps to autoimmunity.
[01:43:56.860 --> 01:43:58.700]   It maps to fibromyalgia.
[01:43:58.700 --> 01:44:02.260]   - I was told that one in 12 people
[01:44:02.260 --> 01:44:08.740]   have our heterozygous, so one mutant copy
[01:44:08.740 --> 01:44:13.740]   or hypomorphic for some mutation in adrenal related genes.
[01:44:13.740 --> 01:44:16.180]   So congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
[01:44:16.180 --> 01:44:17.300]   Is that true?
[01:44:17.300 --> 01:44:20.380]   And if so, that means that one in 12 people walking around
[01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:22.220]   are cranking out far too much cortisol
[01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:24.920]   or not enough cortisol or the cortisol system
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:26.320]   is already skewed in a direction
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:27.860]   that makes life more challenging
[01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:29.560]   at the levels we're talking about.
[01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:31.660]   Did I hear that correctly?
[01:44:31.660 --> 01:44:33.700]   'Cause that one in 12 is not a small number.
[01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:34.840]   - It's not a small number.
[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:37.600]   It fits with what I see clinically.
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:39.300]   I mean, I want to see that data
[01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:42.340]   just to see what does that mean?
[01:44:42.340 --> 01:44:46.260]   And could you modulate it with environmental influences?
[01:44:46.260 --> 01:44:48.820]   But it certainly fits with what I see.
[01:44:48.820 --> 01:44:50.900]   I was taught once again in mainstream medicine
[01:44:50.900 --> 01:44:53.560]   that in terms of adrenal function,
[01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:59.780]   it's very binary how most clinicians think about it.
[01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:02.300]   You either have Addison's disease
[01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:03.980]   and you don't make enough cortisol
[01:45:03.980 --> 01:45:06.900]   or you've got Cushing's or Cushingoid pattern
[01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:08.460]   and you make too much cortisol.
[01:45:08.460 --> 01:45:10.820]   And anything in the middle is normal.
[01:45:10.820 --> 01:45:13.540]   And my experience is that hell no.
[01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:16.340]   There are those of us like me who make a lot of cortisol.
[01:45:16.340 --> 01:45:17.760]   I don't have Cushing's.
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:19.620]   Maybe I've got one of these.
[01:45:19.620 --> 01:45:21.220]   I wouldn't call it a mutant gene.
[01:45:21.220 --> 01:45:25.540]   I would call it more of a vulnerable gene.
[01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:26.660]   So maybe I have one of those.
[01:45:26.660 --> 01:45:28.100]   Maybe that's part of the reason why
[01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:30.840]   I make two to three times what I should be.
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:34.500]   - I'm aware of certain groups of individuals
[01:45:34.500 --> 01:45:36.060]   from within the military sector
[01:45:36.060 --> 01:45:40.400]   that there's a more frequent occurrence
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:45.400]   of some mutation in CAH, congenital adrenal hyperplasia,
[01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:46.900]   not necessarily two copies,
[01:45:46.900 --> 01:45:48.480]   which if people look that up, they're going to go,
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:50.820]   oh, wow, there's all these phenotypes
[01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:55.800]   and sort of hypomorphic type things.
[01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:58.200]   Less than or too much cortisol.
[01:45:58.200 --> 01:46:00.300]   And they are very good at staying up
[01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:04.140]   multiple days per night, multiple nights in the series.
[01:46:04.140 --> 01:46:06.140]   So they can pull all nighters very easily.
[01:46:06.140 --> 01:46:08.340]   They can push harder when most people would quit.
[01:46:08.340 --> 01:46:10.380]   And everyone thinks, well, that's a great phenotype to have,
[01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:11.220]   but guess what?
[01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:13.240]   It's because they hyperproduce cortisol.
[01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:16.540]   And so that's interesting.
[01:46:16.540 --> 01:46:19.900]   And I think if we were to panel medical students
[01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:21.800]   and graduate students, and you were to look at,
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:24.120]   who's pulling excessively long hours,
[01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:25.960]   who's stressed out a lot,
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:28.300]   even outside of academia and medicine,
[01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:29.940]   and pushing, pushing, pushing really hard,
[01:46:29.940 --> 01:46:32.820]   I think the ability to push and not crash,
[01:46:32.820 --> 01:46:34.060]   we think of it as adaptive,
[01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:36.660]   but in some sense it's maladaptive over a series of years,
[01:46:36.660 --> 01:46:38.980]   which is sort of what you described earlier.
[01:46:38.980 --> 01:46:40.140]   - Yeah, it's such a good point,
[01:46:40.140 --> 01:46:44.800]   because in some ways you want to select for that
[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:47.620]   in certain professions, like in the military,
[01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:49.020]   like in medicine.
[01:46:49.020 --> 01:46:54.260]   But I would wonder for those folks
[01:46:54.260 --> 01:46:56.220]   about the downstream consequences
[01:46:56.220 --> 01:46:58.100]   of producing so much cortisol.
[01:46:58.100 --> 01:47:00.300]   - No, it's got to be detrimental for their health
[01:47:00.300 --> 01:47:01.140]   in the long run. - It's got to be.
[01:47:01.140 --> 01:47:02.380]   - And you see that.
[01:47:02.380 --> 01:47:05.300]   - But even the data shows that if you're someone like me
[01:47:05.300 --> 01:47:08.420]   who makes a lot of cortisol, higher rates of depression,
[01:47:08.420 --> 01:47:10.700]   like 50% of people with major depression
[01:47:10.700 --> 01:47:13.880]   have high cortisol levels, higher rates of suicide.
[01:47:14.860 --> 01:47:17.660]   Much more metabolic dysfunction.
[01:47:17.660 --> 01:47:19.860]   We know that trauma, as an example,
[01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:24.420]   maps to an increased risk of glucose, metabolism issues,
[01:47:24.420 --> 01:47:26.320]   and certainly high cortisol does that,
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:28.460]   'cause it's, one of the jobs of cortisol
[01:47:28.460 --> 01:47:30.400]   is to manage glucose.
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:35.400]   And it kind of sets you up for this one,
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:39.780]   number five, which is toxic relationships.
[01:47:39.780 --> 01:47:41.880]   You know, someone who hyper-produces cortisol,
[01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:44.520]   it's hard to live with someone like that.
[01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:47.540]   - It's also, I would say people that have this,
[01:47:47.540 --> 01:47:50.820]   let's just call it biological resilience,
[01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:51.880]   it's not always adaptive
[01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:54.260]   because you can stay in bad circumstances longer.
[01:47:54.260 --> 01:47:58.260]   The ability to crash, provided it's not suicide
[01:47:58.260 --> 01:48:03.260]   or life destroying or, you know, long arc of pause
[01:48:03.260 --> 01:48:05.540]   and the requirement to take two years off
[01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:07.180]   from work or school or something,
[01:48:07.180 --> 01:48:10.580]   the ability to keep pressing on is a double-edged sword.
[01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:12.960]   Let's put it that way. - Yes, it is.
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:16.400]   - I want to make sure in staying within this conversation,
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:17.880]   because you mentioned phosphatidylserine,
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:20.820]   we talked about rhodiola, rosacea,
[01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:21.980]   we talked a bit about ashwagandha.
[01:48:21.980 --> 01:48:23.860]   You've also talked about omega-3s
[01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:25.440]   and fish oil in particular.
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:27.160]   I'd love to know your favorite sources of these.
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:30.680]   I think nowadays there's more general acceptance
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:34.360]   that getting these essential fatty acids is important.
[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:37.000]   Do you have a threshold level of sort of grams?
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:40.260]   I've encouraged podcast listeners
[01:48:40.260 --> 01:48:42.740]   to consider, depending on what they're eating,
[01:48:42.740 --> 01:48:46.280]   to try and get a gram of EPA or more per day.
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:47.780]   Does that seem excessive?
[01:48:47.780 --> 01:48:49.980]   And what are the real data on EPAs?
[01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:54.180]   Because then the cardiovascular experts always hit back
[01:48:54.180 --> 01:48:55.220]   and say, "Oh no, you know,
[01:48:55.220 --> 01:48:56.780]   it's not good for cardiovascular health."
[01:48:56.780 --> 01:48:59.140]   And then you go, "Well, it's better than antidepressants
[01:48:59.140 --> 01:48:59.960]   and other studies."
[01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:00.800]   And they go, "No."
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:03.020]   So I feel like if you really want to make your life
[01:49:03.020 --> 01:49:04.900]   difficult, if you want to raise your cortisol,
[01:49:04.900 --> 01:49:06.660]   you go on Twitter and you say something positive
[01:49:06.660 --> 01:49:08.140]   about omega-3s and fish oil.
[01:49:08.140 --> 01:49:09.260]   [laughing]
[01:49:09.260 --> 01:49:11.200]   And you learn a lot.
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:13.660]   What are your thoughts on omega-3s?
[01:49:13.660 --> 01:49:14.500]   I take a lot of them.
[01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:15.640]   I've always been a big fan.
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:16.480]   - Yeah.
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:18.360]   So this is where I personalize.
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:21.100]   I think some people need more than others.
[01:49:21.100 --> 01:49:24.500]   And what I do is I measure your level.
[01:49:24.500 --> 01:49:26.860]   So this gets back to nutritional testing.
[01:49:26.860 --> 01:49:29.480]   So for you, I would suggest an omega quant
[01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:32.820]   or one of my favorite cardiometabolic panels
[01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:35.040]   is to do a Cleveland heart lab.
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:37.880]   So I think they give me the most reliable information,
[01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:40.980]   not just for lipids and subclasses
[01:49:40.980 --> 01:49:43.420]   and NMR fractionation,
[01:49:43.420 --> 01:49:46.100]   but it also gives me an insulin resistant score.
[01:49:46.100 --> 01:49:50.180]   It gives me levels of omega-3s.
[01:49:50.180 --> 01:49:51.020]   - Great.
[01:49:51.020 --> 01:49:52.520]   We'll provide links to these different sites
[01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:53.420]   so that people can look at them.
[01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:55.620]   - But one quick thing about that,
[01:49:55.620 --> 01:49:59.820]   the whole story is not omega-3s and taking fish oil.
[01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:03.180]   So the work of Charlie Surhan at the Brigham
[01:50:03.180 --> 01:50:07.760]   is showing that the way that we resolve inflammation,
[01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:12.840]   our understanding of it is really,
[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:15.320]   I think in the learning to crawl stage.
[01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:19.980]   And so if you look at the omega-3-6 pathway in the body,
[01:50:19.980 --> 01:50:25.640]   fish oils can help kind of push the reactions
[01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:27.280]   in a particular direction,
[01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:29.160]   but typically they're not enough
[01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:31.240]   for the resolution of inflammation.
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:34.560]   Now, what most people do, including my MBA players,
[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:38.280]   is they pop an ibuprofen or something like that
[01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:39.860]   when they've got inflammation,
[01:50:39.860 --> 01:50:42.220]   that's got lots of other side effects
[01:50:42.220 --> 01:50:43.860]   that are not so good for you.
[01:50:43.860 --> 01:50:47.800]   And we know in terms of the resolution of inflammation
[01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:50.660]   that taking something like ibuprofen
[01:50:50.660 --> 01:50:54.000]   reduces the amplitude of inflammation by about 50%,
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.340]   but then it potentially blocks
[01:50:56.340 --> 01:50:59.280]   the complete resolution of inflammation.
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:02.040]   So there's these new supplements that you may have heard of
[01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:04.520]   called Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators.
[01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:06.200]   There's a lot of different supplement companies
[01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:07.440]   that make them.
[01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:10.040]   And that combined with fish oil
[01:51:10.040 --> 01:51:11.860]   seems to be the best combination.
[01:51:11.860 --> 01:51:14.280]   And what I do for athletes who've got
[01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:16.400]   kind of the normal aches and pains
[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:19.040]   of the training load they have
[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:21.800]   is I'll combine a little aspirin,
[01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:24.480]   small dose, just like 81 milligrams
[01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:26.320]   or two of those baby aspirin,
[01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:29.120]   together with fish oil plus
[01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:30.760]   Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators.
[01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:32.020]   And there's some that are NSF,
[01:51:32.020 --> 01:51:33.900]   they're certified for sports.
[01:51:33.900 --> 01:51:38.360]   But the dose, I would say with my patients,
[01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:41.600]   some of them only need 1,000 milligrams,
[01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:44.160]   your gram that you mentioned for the population.
[01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:48.620]   Some of them need six grams together with SPMs.
[01:51:48.620 --> 01:51:51.560]   So I think it has to be personalized.
[01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:56.560]   - How young is it okay for people
[01:51:56.560 --> 01:51:59.000]   to start taking omega-3s?
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:02.720]   For instance, young women in their teens,
[01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:04.040]   in their 20s and their 30s,
[01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:06.440]   young guys in their 20s and 30s,
[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:08.000]   should they take fish oil?
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.360]   Just as a, assuming they're not going to get anything tested.
[01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:11.640]   I'm thinking about the college student
[01:52:11.640 --> 01:52:14.080]   who is really into biomarkers and that sort of thing.
[01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:15.400]   We'll go do some of this.
[01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:19.540]   But many people won't, but they want to do the right thing.
[01:52:19.540 --> 01:52:21.040]   So they'll try and drink a little less, hopefully.
[01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:22.360]   Hopefully they won't smoke or vape.
[01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:24.000]   Please don't smoke or vape.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.480]   The idea that vaping is okay.
[01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:27.760]   It's like, we had it the whole episode, it's so bad.
[01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:29.040]   So bad for everything we're talking about.
[01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:30.480]   - Let's end that chapter.
[01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:31.320]   - Exactly.
[01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:34.840]   So just, hopefully they'll try and avoid those things.
[01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:37.360]   Hopefully they'll avoid hard drugs.
[01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:39.840]   Hopefully they'll avoid getting any STIs.
[01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:42.800]   If they do, they'll resolve them quickly, hopefully.
[01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:45.200]   So, but they might say, oh, well, okay.
[01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:47.440]   I'm willing to take some magnesium
[01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:49.560]   or take some phosphidylserine, buffer my cortisol,
[01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:51.560]   eat some vegetables.
[01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:53.080]   Should they consider taking fish oil
[01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:55.760]   as a kind of across the board inoculatory thing?
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:57.200]   - So I'd like to rank order these.
[01:52:57.200 --> 01:53:00.080]   I would say fish oil, yes.
[01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:01.280]   I think a thousand milligrams
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:03.000]   as a general recommendation is good,
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.400]   but I also have a food first philosophy.
[01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:07.800]   So my preference would be that they're having salmon
[01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:09.880]   or some kind of smashed fish.
[01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:12.560]   And they're getting that as the primary source
[01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:13.840]   of their omega-3s.
[01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:15.960]   And then the days that they don't have fish,
[01:53:15.960 --> 01:53:17.820]   I recommend it probably twice a week
[01:53:17.820 --> 01:53:19.240]   that they take fish oil.
[01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:21.000]   Then I would put magnesium next,
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:22.780]   since so many people are deficient.
[01:53:22.780 --> 01:53:24.440]   Then I'd probably put vitamin D.
[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:27.240]   - How many IU of vitamin D per day?
[01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:30.240]   - Well, you keep asking me this, like for the population.
[01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:31.680]   - Well, let me put it this way.
[01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:36.680]   For the lazy person or, and this is an or, not an and,
[01:53:36.680 --> 01:53:42.080]   or the person who just doesn't have the finances
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:44.120]   to go get levels measured,
[01:53:44.120 --> 01:53:45.920]   'cause our audience has a huge range.
[01:53:45.920 --> 01:53:48.160]   We've got people who can have tons of disposable income
[01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:49.000]   that lives in this body.
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:50.600]   You have no disposable income.
[01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:52.720]   - So 1,000 to 2,000 international units.
[01:53:52.720 --> 01:53:57.200]   But my, what I do is I dose to a serum level
[01:53:57.200 --> 01:53:59.720]   that's between about 50 and 90.
[01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:00.540]   - Great.
[01:54:00.540 --> 01:54:03.880]   - And so I have a vitamin D receptor snip.
[01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:06.280]   And so I need to take about 5,000 a day
[01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:07.720]   to get to what I need.
[01:54:07.720 --> 01:54:09.960]   A lot of people don't need that.
[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:14.960]   And there's some supplements that I don't know if they need.
[01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:17.100]   So you mentioned phosphatidylserine.
[01:54:17.100 --> 01:54:19.060]   For someone who's a college student
[01:54:19.060 --> 01:54:20.900]   and their cortisol is completely normal,
[01:54:20.900 --> 01:54:22.380]   they're wasting their money on PS.
[01:54:22.380 --> 01:54:23.220]   They don't need it.
[01:54:23.220 --> 01:54:25.600]   They might need it later, but they don't need it now.
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:27.180]   - I'd like to make sure that we circle back
[01:54:27.180 --> 01:54:28.940]   to birth control.
[01:54:28.940 --> 01:54:32.200]   In particular, oral contraceptive birth control.
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:37.580]   And we should touch on IUDs perhaps a little bit more.
[01:54:37.580 --> 01:54:41.400]   But what are your thoughts on sort of pure estrogen
[01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:42.240]   birth control?
[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:43.780]   This is what I learned when I was in college,
[01:54:43.780 --> 01:54:46.840]   is that birth control is basically tonic estrogen.
[01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:48.140]   So constantly taking estrogen,
[01:54:48.140 --> 01:54:49.840]   estrogen women are taking estrogen
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:54.840]   so that they don't get the estrogen priming of progesterone.
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:57.480]   You're not getting any ovulation.
[01:54:57.480 --> 01:55:01.560]   And I've known women that have been taking oral,
[01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:05.800]   or that took oral contraception as like estrogen pills,
[01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:09.220]   basically for five, 10, 15 years.
[01:55:09.220 --> 01:55:11.180]   Are there long-term consequences of this
[01:55:11.180 --> 01:55:15.940]   as it relates to pregnancy, PCOS, menopause?
[01:55:15.940 --> 01:55:18.380]   If so, what are some of those consequences?
[01:55:18.380 --> 01:55:20.900]   What are your concerns?
[01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:22.660]   What do you like about oral contraceptives?
[01:55:22.660 --> 01:55:24.940]   What do you dislike about them?
[01:55:24.940 --> 01:55:27.060]   - I like how balanced you asked that question.
[01:55:27.060 --> 01:55:30.580]   So women who take oral contraceptives,
[01:55:30.580 --> 01:55:33.860]   as long as you're describing like 10 years or longer,
[01:55:33.860 --> 01:55:38.420]   we call those Olympic oral contraceptive users.
[01:55:38.420 --> 01:55:40.640]   In terms of benefit, I think that,
[01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:42.860]   especially when they first came out and even now,
[01:55:42.860 --> 01:55:46.980]   it gives women reproductive choice, and that's essential.
[01:55:46.980 --> 01:55:48.860]   As you may know, our reproductive choice
[01:55:48.860 --> 01:55:51.060]   has been declining recently.
[01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:52.580]   So I'm a big fan in that regard,
[01:55:52.580 --> 01:55:56.540]   and we've got a lot of data to show both the risks
[01:55:56.540 --> 01:55:58.560]   and also the benefits of it.
[01:55:58.560 --> 01:56:00.740]   So I'll speak first into the benefits
[01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:05.620]   because I'm gonna get on a soapbox
[01:56:05.620 --> 01:56:07.420]   a little bit about the risks.
[01:56:07.420 --> 01:56:11.120]   So we know that it reduces the risk of ovarian cancer.
[01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:15.500]   So there's something about this idea of incessant ovulation
[01:56:15.500 --> 01:56:18.060]   that is not good for the female body.
[01:56:18.060 --> 01:56:23.060]   So if you look at, for instance, women who are nuns,
[01:56:23.060 --> 01:56:26.900]   who don't take oral contraceptives,
[01:56:26.900 --> 01:56:28.720]   and they have a period every single month
[01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:30.540]   of their reproductive lives,
[01:56:30.540 --> 01:56:33.000]   they have a greater risk of ovarian cancer.
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:38.000]   So if you look then at women who have several babies,
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:41.040]   and they've got a period of time when they're pregnant
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:42.140]   but they're not ovulating,
[01:56:42.140 --> 01:56:44.340]   and then they breastfeed for some period of time,
[01:56:44.340 --> 01:56:46.540]   they have a lower risk of ovarian cancer.
[01:56:46.540 --> 01:56:51.340]   So oral contraceptives help with reducing ovulation
[01:56:51.340 --> 01:56:53.080]   and reducing risk.
[01:56:53.080 --> 01:56:56.580]   We know that if you take the oral contraceptive
[01:56:56.580 --> 01:56:57.580]   for about five years,
[01:56:57.580 --> 01:57:00.260]   it reduces your risk of ovarian cancer by 50%.
[01:57:00.260 --> 01:57:04.320]   And that's significant because we're so poor
[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:07.060]   at diagnosing ovarian cancer early.
[01:57:07.060 --> 01:57:09.480]   There's really no method that's really effective.
[01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:13.020]   We use CA-125 and ultrasound screening,
[01:57:13.020 --> 01:57:15.900]   especially in women who are at greater genetic risk.
[01:57:15.900 --> 01:57:19.460]   But even that, often we diagnose it in a later stage.
[01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:22.300]   - Maybe just because that statement is going to highlight
[01:57:22.300 --> 01:57:24.780]   for a number of people the question of
[01:57:24.780 --> 01:57:27.800]   what are some of the earliest symptoms
[01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:29.660]   that people can recognize without a blood test?
[01:57:29.660 --> 01:57:32.820]   So is ovarian cancer, is it going to be pain?
[01:57:32.820 --> 01:57:35.380]   - So the problem is the symptoms are so vague
[01:57:35.380 --> 01:57:37.820]   and they're so nonspecific.
[01:57:37.820 --> 01:57:40.820]   One of the most common symptoms is bloating.
[01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:42.380]   And we've already talked about constipation.
[01:57:42.380 --> 01:57:45.620]   We've talked about how women have this longer track,
[01:57:45.620 --> 01:57:48.660]   GI track, and so bloating is a really common experience
[01:57:48.660 --> 01:57:50.100]   for most women.
[01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:51.680]   You can have bulk symptoms,
[01:57:51.680 --> 01:57:55.720]   feeling like your lower belly is kind of pressed out.
[01:57:55.720 --> 01:58:00.720]   So the way that we inform women
[01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:02.420]   in terms of watching for this
[01:58:02.420 --> 01:58:07.020]   is to get regular gynecologic exams
[01:58:07.020 --> 01:58:08.340]   for women who are at high risk
[01:58:08.340 --> 01:58:10.820]   where they have, for instance, an ultrasound for some reason
[01:58:10.820 --> 01:58:13.140]   and it shows a mass that we're concerned about.
[01:58:13.140 --> 01:58:14.420]   There's a way to triage that
[01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:17.100]   in terms of what kind of evaluation that they need.
[01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:19.620]   And that's a situation where you might get a blood test
[01:58:19.620 --> 01:58:22.780]   called the CA-125.
[01:58:22.780 --> 01:58:28.100]   Yeah, the problem is the symptoms are so vague.
[01:58:28.100 --> 01:58:30.860]   It could be, it depends on how big the tumor is,
[01:58:30.860 --> 01:58:34.780]   how much bulk you have, what it's pressing on.
[01:58:34.780 --> 01:58:37.260]   So if taking estrogen
[01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:40.980]   and thereby reducing the frequency of ovulation
[01:58:40.980 --> 01:58:43.820]   lowers the risk of ovarian cancer,
[01:58:43.820 --> 01:58:45.420]   should women that are,
[01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:47.060]   even women who are not sexually active,
[01:58:47.060 --> 01:58:49.540]   so they're not actively trying to get pregnant
[01:58:49.540 --> 01:58:51.020]   or avoid getting pregnant,
[01:58:51.020 --> 01:58:52.260]   but if they're not sexually active,
[01:58:52.260 --> 01:58:54.120]   then the probability of conceiving
[01:58:54.120 --> 01:58:57.380]   unless they go through some IUI or some other route
[01:58:57.380 --> 01:58:59.460]   is very low, as far as I know.
[01:58:59.460 --> 01:59:02.460]   That's what I was taught in high school anyway.
[01:59:03.660 --> 01:59:06.160]   - Would they be wise to suppress ovulation
[01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:09.660]   for periodically using hormone-based contraception
[01:59:09.660 --> 01:59:13.340]   just so that they can offset the risk of ovarian cancer?
[01:59:13.340 --> 01:59:15.000]   - That's a very rational question.
[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.600]   And I would say that's what mainstream medicine
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:22.560]   has had at its back to recommend oral contraceptives,
[01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:24.780]   not just for women who are seeking contraception,
[01:59:24.780 --> 01:59:29.260]   but for acne, for painful periods,
[01:59:29.260 --> 01:59:32.060]   for really kind of the drop of a hat
[01:59:32.060 --> 01:59:33.620]   they're prescribing oral contraceptives.
[01:59:33.620 --> 01:59:35.380]   That's what I was taught to do.
[01:59:35.380 --> 01:59:37.340]   But there are so many consequences.
[01:59:37.340 --> 01:59:40.760]   And I think the issue here is more about consent,
[01:59:40.760 --> 01:59:44.400]   because in OB/GYN,
[01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:47.580]   and I started out as a board certified OB/GYN,
[01:59:47.580 --> 01:59:49.220]   and I now mostly see men,
[01:59:49.220 --> 01:59:52.420]   but I was taught as an OB/GYN
[01:59:52.420 --> 01:59:55.060]   to convince women to go on the oral contraceptive.
[01:59:55.060 --> 01:59:57.980]   And I think a lot of that is pharmaceutical influence.
[01:59:57.980 --> 02:00:00.780]   So maybe we could talk about the risks
[02:00:00.780 --> 02:00:04.220]   and why the answer is no to your question.
[02:00:04.220 --> 02:00:05.820]   - As we do that, could I just ask,
[02:00:05.820 --> 02:00:07.700]   is the so-called ring,
[02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:09.940]   it used to be called the NuvaRing,
[02:00:09.940 --> 02:00:10.780]   maybe that's a brand name,
[02:00:10.780 --> 02:00:11.860]   but when I was in college,
[02:00:11.860 --> 02:00:13.940]   there was all this discussion about the ring, right?
[02:00:13.940 --> 02:00:16.980]   By both men and women for reasons that don't belong
[02:00:16.980 --> 02:00:17.900]   on the podcast.
[02:00:17.900 --> 02:00:20.160]   Use your imagination, folks.
[02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:22.740]   So is the ring, obviously,
[02:00:22.740 --> 02:00:25.460]   it's not oral hormone contraception,
[02:00:25.460 --> 02:00:26.760]   but it's hormone-based, right?
[02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:29.000]   The ring is releasing estrogen locally
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:30.100]   as opposed to taking it orally.
[02:00:30.100 --> 02:00:32.900]   But would you slot it under what you're about to tell us
[02:00:32.900 --> 02:00:34.140]   in terms of the concerns?
[02:00:34.140 --> 02:00:37.820]   - So we have less data about the ring.
[02:00:37.820 --> 02:00:41.580]   So the oral contraceptive is two hormones.
[02:00:41.580 --> 02:00:43.600]   It's ethinyl estradiol,
[02:00:43.600 --> 02:00:47.280]   and it's a progestin.
[02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:51.900]   So it's not the normal progesterone that your body makes,
[02:00:51.900 --> 02:00:53.720]   that your ovaries make and your adrenals make.
[02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:58.720]   It is a synthetic form of progesterone.
[02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:03.380]   And it is the same progestin, similar,
[02:01:03.380 --> 02:01:06.980]   same class that was shown to be dangerous and provocative
[02:01:06.980 --> 02:01:08.740]   in the Women's Health Initiative.
[02:01:08.740 --> 02:01:11.520]   So I'm not a fan of progestins.
[02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:14.700]   I do not recommend them for any woman,
[02:01:14.700 --> 02:01:18.580]   unless the consequence of not taking them is surgery
[02:01:18.580 --> 02:01:20.240]   or some other,
[02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:25.520]   unless it gives them some freedom in some way.
[02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:28.180]   So I don't like progestins.
[02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:33.180]   The NuvaRing is estrogen plus progestin,
[02:01:33.180 --> 02:01:36.920]   but it's released transdermally through the vagina.
[02:01:36.920 --> 02:01:41.920]   So given the way that it's delivered to the vagina,
[02:01:41.920 --> 02:01:47.500]   the doses are lower than what's taken orally.
[02:01:47.500 --> 02:01:49.080]   But in terms of some of the risks
[02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:50.080]   that I'm about to talk about,
[02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:52.660]   we don't know about much of the data.
[02:01:52.660 --> 02:01:53.920]   We think that it's similar.
[02:01:53.920 --> 02:01:56.300]   There's probably a spectrum of risk,
[02:01:56.300 --> 02:01:59.560]   and the NuvaRing is a little more towards the middle
[02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:03.200]   than what I'm talking about with oral contraceptives.
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:04.120]   Are you ready for that?
[02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:05.520]   - Yeah, I'm ready for the risks.
[02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:10.220]   - Okay, so like with almost any pharmaceutical,
[02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:14.240]   the oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients.
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:17.980]   So magnesium, there's certain vitamin Bs that are depleted.
[02:02:17.980 --> 02:02:23.760]   It also affects the microbiome.
[02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:25.340]   That data is not as strong,
[02:02:25.340 --> 02:02:26.720]   but there seems to be some effect,
[02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:28.340]   and there's also an increased risk
[02:02:28.340 --> 02:02:31.800]   of inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmune condition.
[02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:34.480]   It increases inflammatory tone.
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:37.360]   So the studies that I've seen increase
[02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:40.680]   one of the markers of inflammatory tone,
[02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:43.960]   high sensitivity CRP, by about two to three X.
[02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:49.120]   It seems to make the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:54.000]   more rigid so that you can't kind of roll with the punches
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.520]   and wax and wane in terms of cortisol production
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:02:58.980]   the way that you can off the birth control pill.
[02:02:58.980 --> 02:03:02.560]   It can affect thyroid function.
[02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:05.580]   I'm thinking of the slide that I have
[02:03:05.580 --> 02:03:08.540]   that has like 10 problems associated
[02:03:08.540 --> 02:03:09.560]   with the oral contraceptive,
[02:03:09.560 --> 02:03:11.560]   but that's what I can remember right now.
[02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:12.620]   - That's very helpful,
[02:03:12.620 --> 02:03:14.860]   and it makes me wonder whether or not,
[02:03:14.860 --> 02:03:18.320]   if on the one hand oral contraceptives are protective
[02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:19.920]   in women against ovarian cancer,
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:21.300]   but then they have these other issues.
[02:03:21.300 --> 02:03:22.680]   - Yeah, there's one other I want to mention.
[02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:23.840]   - Please.
[02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:26.240]   - Anytime you take oral estrogen,
[02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:28.680]   it raises sex hormone binding globulin,
[02:03:28.680 --> 02:03:31.160]   and you've talked to other podcast guests about this,
[02:03:31.160 --> 02:03:32.600]   Kyle, I think.
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:36.020]   Sex hormone binding globulin, I think of it as a sponge
[02:03:36.020 --> 02:03:40.700]   that soaks up free estrogen and free testosterone.
[02:03:40.700 --> 02:03:42.500]   So when you go on the birth control pill,
[02:03:42.500 --> 02:03:44.800]   you raise your sex hormone binding globulin.
[02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:48.200]   It soaks up especially free testosterone,
[02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:51.560]   and for some women, it's not a big deal.
[02:03:51.560 --> 02:03:53.540]   They don't notice much of a difference,
[02:03:53.540 --> 02:03:55.320]   but then there's a phenotype,
[02:03:55.320 --> 02:03:59.840]   maybe related to CAG repeats on the androgen receptor,
[02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:01.960]   who are exquisitely sensitive
[02:04:01.960 --> 02:04:04.940]   to that decline in free testosterone.
[02:04:04.940 --> 02:04:07.720]   So this then opens the portal of talking a little bit
[02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:09.740]   about testosterone in women.
[02:04:09.740 --> 02:04:13.080]   So we've mentioned already that it's the most abundant,
[02:04:13.080 --> 02:04:16.680]   biologically the most abundant hormone in the female system.
[02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:19.180]   Even though men make almost 10 times as much,
[02:04:19.180 --> 02:04:23.060]   or even more than 10 times, it is so important for women.
[02:04:23.060 --> 02:04:25.080]   It is essential to so many things,
[02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:27.340]   not just sex drive and muscle mass
[02:04:27.340 --> 02:04:30.220]   and seeing a response to resistance training,
[02:04:30.220 --> 02:04:33.040]   but also confidence in agency.
[02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:36.000]   And so those women who are so sensitive
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:37.160]   to their testosterone level,
[02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:39.680]   they've got this high sex hormone binding globulin,
[02:04:39.680 --> 02:04:42.100]   their testosterone declines,
[02:04:42.100 --> 02:04:45.980]   what they describe is vaginal dryness,
[02:04:45.980 --> 02:04:48.320]   maybe a decline in sex drive,
[02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:50.540]   but there's also this bigger issue
[02:04:50.540 --> 02:04:53.600]   related to confidence in agency, even risk-taking
[02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:56.120]   from studies that we've done with MBA students
[02:04:56.120 --> 02:04:57.820]   that I think is a serious problem.
[02:04:57.820 --> 02:05:01.320]   Maybe the most important out of all of these things
[02:05:01.320 --> 02:05:06.320]   is that it can shrink the clitoris by up to 20%, 20%.
[02:05:06.320 --> 02:05:09.400]   - And that includes a regression of the nerves
[02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:12.160]   that innervate the clitoris, is that, I mean-
[02:05:12.160 --> 02:05:14.320]   - That's a very good question as a neuroscientist.
[02:05:14.320 --> 02:05:16.680]   - Yeah, I would think you used to teach
[02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:18.740]   the neural side of reproductive health.
[02:05:18.740 --> 02:05:20.180]   We need to do a series on sexual health.
[02:05:20.180 --> 02:05:21.520]   Maybe you would co-host that with me.
[02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:22.820]   - Sure.
[02:05:22.820 --> 02:05:24.920]   - We could certainly use your expertise.
[02:05:24.920 --> 02:05:28.960]   I think, yeah, that's a dramatic number.
[02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:31.440]   - Yeah, but then let's go back to the sacred marketing.
[02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:33.240]   If I've got a woman that I think
[02:05:33.240 --> 02:05:34.640]   should not be on the birth control bill,
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:35.960]   maybe she's taking it for acne
[02:05:35.960 --> 02:05:38.680]   or she's taking it 'cause her periods were a little painful.
[02:05:38.680 --> 02:05:40.820]   What I'm going to do is say,
[02:05:40.820 --> 02:05:42.920]   let's leverage these other ways
[02:05:42.920 --> 02:05:45.140]   of making your period less painful.
[02:05:45.140 --> 02:05:48.400]   Let's take the message of your painful periods
[02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:51.840]   and figure out, okay, is it your inflammatory tone?
[02:05:51.840 --> 02:05:53.740]   And we give you some fish oil and SPMs,
[02:05:53.740 --> 02:05:56.000]   maybe a little aspirin when you've got your period.
[02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:57.980]   Let's find some other ways to deal with it
[02:05:57.980 --> 02:06:00.060]   than to take the oral contraceptive,
[02:06:00.060 --> 02:06:03.200]   which you have not received informed consent about,
[02:06:03.200 --> 02:06:06.500]   because it can trick your clit by up to 20%.
[02:06:06.500 --> 02:06:08.720]   Now, that usually convinces most people to come off of it.
[02:06:08.720 --> 02:06:09.720]   - Is that reversible?
[02:06:09.720 --> 02:06:14.420]   - The elevation in sex hormone-abiding globulin
[02:06:14.420 --> 02:06:16.520]   does not seem to go away
[02:06:16.520 --> 02:06:19.200]   when you come off the birth control pill.
[02:06:19.200 --> 02:06:22.240]   To me, that is the biggest problem
[02:06:22.240 --> 02:06:24.660]   with prescribing oral contraceptives.
[02:06:24.660 --> 02:06:26.680]   Now, the data that we have is limited.
[02:06:26.680 --> 02:06:30.360]   There's one woman who, Claudia something something,
[02:06:30.360 --> 02:06:33.360]   who looked at sex hormone-binding globulin
[02:06:33.360 --> 02:06:36.040]   a year out from stopping the birth control pill,
[02:06:36.040 --> 02:06:37.280]   and it was still elevated.
[02:06:37.280 --> 02:06:39.880]   It wasn't as high as it was when they were on the pill,
[02:06:39.880 --> 02:06:41.520]   but it was still elevated.
[02:06:41.520 --> 02:06:43.800]   So your question about reversibility,
[02:06:43.800 --> 02:06:46.440]   I don't know if we know the answer to that.
[02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:47.540]   - Wow, okay.
[02:06:47.540 --> 02:06:52.200]   That's, yeah, that's a significant statement
[02:06:52.200 --> 02:06:54.280]   and something that for consideration.
[02:06:54.280 --> 02:06:58.160]   Related to this, although this might seem not related,
[02:06:58.160 --> 02:07:02.160]   it is, how early do you recommend
[02:07:02.160 --> 02:07:07.160]   that women go get their follicle number assessed?
[02:07:07.160 --> 02:07:09.740]   In other words, to get a sense of the size
[02:07:09.740 --> 02:07:13.540]   of the ovarian reserve and their AMH levels measured?
[02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:17.080]   I'm an amateur outsider as I say this,
[02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:19.080]   but we have an episode on fertility
[02:07:19.080 --> 02:07:22.120]   where I just described the ovulatory menstrual cycle.
[02:07:22.120 --> 02:07:25.320]   - I'm not the best person to answer that.
[02:07:25.320 --> 02:07:27.200]   - Yeah, well, we can- - I'm too far out from it.
[02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:30.420]   - Okay, well, I suppose then from taking the perspective
[02:07:30.420 --> 02:07:33.280]   of somebody who thinks about fertility
[02:07:33.280 --> 02:07:37.300]   in terms of at least congruent with vitality and longevity,
[02:07:37.300 --> 02:07:40.240]   given that it's fairly noninvasive,
[02:07:40.240 --> 02:07:43.940]   it's an ultrasound or a blood draw for AMH or both,
[02:07:43.940 --> 02:07:46.320]   is there any reason why a woman would not want
[02:07:46.320 --> 02:07:47.860]   to get her follicle number assessed
[02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:50.040]   or her AMH levels assessed?
[02:07:50.040 --> 02:07:52.240]   Is there any reason why?
[02:07:52.240 --> 02:07:54.860]   Because I was shocked to learn that most women don't do this
[02:07:54.860 --> 02:07:58.120]   until they're hitting their late 30s or early 40s
[02:07:58.120 --> 02:08:00.180]   and they either haven't conceived
[02:08:00.180 --> 02:08:02.240]   or they suddenly decide that they want to conceive.
[02:08:02.240 --> 02:08:05.540]   And I thought, why doesn't every doctor insist
[02:08:05.540 --> 02:08:09.800]   that their female patients have their AMH level addressed
[02:08:09.800 --> 02:08:13.380]   so that if they need to freeze eggs, they can?
[02:08:13.380 --> 02:08:14.220]   - It's cost?
[02:08:14.220 --> 02:08:16.180]   - Yeah, so I think if you've got the disposable income
[02:08:16.180 --> 02:08:17.880]   to do it, go for it.
[02:08:17.880 --> 02:08:19.620]   - It's not included in a standard blood panel?
[02:08:19.620 --> 02:08:21.060]   - No. - Wow.
[02:08:21.060 --> 02:08:24.580]   - The only women in my practice who've had AMHs done
[02:08:24.580 --> 02:08:26.740]   and have looked at their follicle count
[02:08:26.740 --> 02:08:29.640]   are women who want to freeze their eggs
[02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:33.440]   and that requires disposable income,
[02:08:33.440 --> 02:08:37.740]   or they are having trouble getting pregnant,
[02:08:37.740 --> 02:08:41.380]   so they are in the reproductive endocrinology system
[02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:43.840]   and they're getting an evaluation.
[02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:48.040]   And then there are also the women who have symptoms
[02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:51.780]   of early menopause, so premature ovarian insufficiency,
[02:08:51.780 --> 02:08:53.360]   which is before age 40.
[02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:56.940]   Those are the women that I see getting attested
[02:08:56.940 --> 02:08:58.380]   and I think you're right
[02:08:58.380 --> 02:09:01.020]   that it should be offered more broadly.
[02:09:01.020 --> 02:09:04.220]   It speaks to the democratization of data again
[02:09:04.220 --> 02:09:06.500]   and I think most women don't know that.
[02:09:06.500 --> 02:09:08.080]   So you're doing a huge service, I think,
[02:09:08.080 --> 02:09:10.500]   to be speaking into this.
[02:09:10.500 --> 02:09:14.820]   One other point related to that
[02:09:14.820 --> 02:09:19.820]   is that what I see in conventional medicine
[02:09:19.820 --> 02:09:22.820]   is that when a woman asks for a hormone panel
[02:09:22.820 --> 02:09:26.020]   and she's not trying to get pregnant,
[02:09:26.020 --> 02:09:31.020]   she usually gets told that hormones vary too much,
[02:09:31.020 --> 02:09:33.420]   it's a waste of money, you don't need it.
[02:09:33.420 --> 02:09:36.740]   Or if you're feeling hormonal,
[02:09:36.740 --> 02:09:39.540]   why don't you go on a birth control bill?
[02:09:39.540 --> 02:09:42.420]   Unless she's trying to get pregnant.
[02:09:42.420 --> 02:09:43.900]   If she's trying to get pregnant,
[02:09:43.900 --> 02:09:46.700]   suddenly those same tests are very reliable
[02:09:46.700 --> 02:09:50.660]   and they get their free testosterone,
[02:09:50.660 --> 02:09:54.260]   their thyroid panel, they get their estrogen and progesterone,
[02:09:54.260 --> 02:09:57.780]   maybe they get their cortisol, they get their AMH.
[02:09:57.780 --> 02:10:00.300]   So there's a double standard
[02:10:00.300 --> 02:10:02.820]   between those who want to get pregnant and those who don't
[02:10:02.820 --> 02:10:04.260]   and that needs to end.
[02:10:04.260 --> 02:10:05.420]   - Yeah, I totally agree.
[02:10:05.420 --> 02:10:08.660]   As I've learned more about ovulatory cycle
[02:10:08.660 --> 02:10:12.380]   and AMH and the antral population of follicles,
[02:10:12.380 --> 02:10:14.740]   it's fascinating, it just seems to me, wow,
[02:10:14.740 --> 02:10:16.220]   a relatively straightforward test,
[02:10:16.220 --> 02:10:20.100]   one definitely invasive ultrasound, but-
[02:10:20.100 --> 02:10:21.020]   - I don't consider that.
[02:10:21.020 --> 02:10:22.940]   That's not invasive. - Yeah, not terribly invasive,
[02:10:22.940 --> 02:10:24.820]   but invasive, at least,
[02:10:24.820 --> 02:10:26.840]   but the other one, just pure blood test,
[02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:29.100]   just seems like why wouldn't this be offered
[02:10:29.100 --> 02:10:31.600]   or covered by insurance or that anyone that wanted it?
[02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:34.140]   But now I understand why.
[02:10:34.140 --> 02:10:37.940]   You mentioned menopause, huge topic,
[02:10:37.940 --> 02:10:39.460]   enormous topic.
[02:10:39.460 --> 02:10:43.300]   We had a guest on the podcast who's not a clinician
[02:10:43.300 --> 02:10:45.860]   who said something in passing,
[02:10:45.860 --> 02:10:48.100]   so I'm likely to get this wrong,
[02:10:48.100 --> 02:10:51.100]   but what they said was that the results
[02:10:51.100 --> 02:10:54.920]   of the large-scale trials on hormone replacement therapy
[02:10:54.920 --> 02:10:58.140]   for women for menopause said something to the effect of,
[02:10:58.140 --> 02:11:00.900]   if the hormone therapy was started early enough,
[02:11:00.900 --> 02:11:04.340]   it was very beneficial for vitality and health outcomes.
[02:11:04.340 --> 02:11:06.940]   Whereas if women went through menopause
[02:11:06.940 --> 02:11:08.860]   and then initiated the hormone therapy,
[02:11:08.860 --> 02:11:11.500]   hormone replacement therapy,
[02:11:11.500 --> 02:11:14.980]   that it could be detrimental to their health.
[02:11:14.980 --> 02:11:18.580]   So first of all, do I recall that statement correctly?
[02:11:18.580 --> 02:11:20.100]   And then second of all,
[02:11:20.100 --> 02:11:22.220]   what sorts of hormones are being replaced?
[02:11:22.220 --> 02:11:23.580]   Is it just estrogen?
[02:11:23.580 --> 02:11:24.720]   And how is that done?
[02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:26.380]   Is it done through birth control?
[02:11:26.380 --> 02:11:28.980]   So oral contraceptives, NuvaRings,
[02:11:28.980 --> 02:11:30.520]   what are your thoughts on menopause?
[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:32.820]   When should people start thinking about it?
[02:11:32.820 --> 02:11:36.320]   And what is the palette of things available
[02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:38.260]   so that we can do an entire episode with you
[02:11:38.260 --> 02:11:40.420]   on this topic in the future?
[02:11:40.420 --> 02:11:42.760]   But just to, I get a lot of questions about this
[02:11:42.760 --> 02:11:45.820]   and I'm guessing based on everything you've told me today
[02:11:45.820 --> 02:11:47.940]   that there are women in their 30s
[02:11:47.940 --> 02:11:51.600]   that while they may be 20 years out from menopause,
[02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:52.880]   probably should be doing things now
[02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:54.140]   in anticipation of that.
[02:11:54.140 --> 02:11:56.400]   - Yes, so we haven't talked about the 30 something,
[02:11:56.400 --> 02:11:58.140]   but I totally agree with you.
[02:11:58.140 --> 02:12:00.480]   The more you know about your phenotype,
[02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:03.320]   your hormonal phenotype when you're in your 30s,
[02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:07.420]   you're set up in terms of what to do in the future,
[02:12:07.420 --> 02:12:09.260]   especially things like your thyroid,
[02:12:09.260 --> 02:12:10.820]   your estrogen and progesterone levels,
[02:12:10.820 --> 02:12:15.820]   'cause you can replace to a state of you thyroid,
[02:12:15.820 --> 02:12:18.600]   whatever that is for you.
[02:12:18.600 --> 02:12:21.460]   You can replace, I don't usually go exactly back
[02:12:21.460 --> 02:12:23.940]   to where the estrogen and progesterone levels were,
[02:12:23.940 --> 02:12:25.920]   but we can get pretty close.
[02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:27.920]   So in your 30s, having a base case,
[02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:29.740]   I think is really essential.
[02:12:29.740 --> 02:12:32.660]   So you spoke to the Women's Health Initiative,
[02:12:32.660 --> 02:12:35.140]   which was published in 2002.
[02:12:35.140 --> 02:12:37.300]   And we went from a huge number of women
[02:12:37.300 --> 02:12:40.600]   taking hormone therapy to a very small percentage,
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:42.780]   like in the range of 5%.
[02:12:42.780 --> 02:12:45.960]   And that means we've got millions and millions of women
[02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:50.820]   who are suffering needlessly with things like insomnia,
[02:12:50.820 --> 02:12:55.740]   difficulty with their mood, difficulty with sex drive,
[02:12:55.740 --> 02:12:59.900]   feeling like they are closing the store in terms of sex,
[02:12:59.900 --> 02:13:02.660]   because they're not on hormone therapy.
[02:13:02.660 --> 02:13:04.580]   I would agree with the statement that you made
[02:13:04.580 --> 02:13:06.180]   that hormone therapy,
[02:13:06.180 --> 02:13:08.020]   particular forms that are similar
[02:13:08.020 --> 02:13:09.660]   to what your body always made,
[02:13:09.660 --> 02:13:13.320]   when it's given judiciously at the right time,
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:16.220]   typically within five to 10 years of menopause,
[02:13:16.220 --> 02:13:20.820]   which is 51 to 52, that it is incredibly safe.
[02:13:20.820 --> 02:13:24.980]   So it's a complicated study, the Women's Health Initiative,
[02:13:24.980 --> 02:13:29.280]   but it was the wrong study in the wrong patients
[02:13:29.280 --> 02:13:31.880]   with the wrong medications
[02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:35.420]   and with some of the wrong outcomes.
[02:13:35.420 --> 02:13:38.500]   So it was powered to look at cardiovascular outcomes.
[02:13:38.500 --> 02:13:40.740]   It was not powered to look at breast cancer.
[02:13:40.740 --> 02:13:43.700]   It was stopped because of breast cancer risk.
[02:13:43.700 --> 02:13:46.740]   But what happened in the control arm of the study
[02:13:46.740 --> 02:13:51.060]   was that they had an incredibly low rate of breast cancer.
[02:13:51.060 --> 02:13:53.420]   And so as a result, they ended up having
[02:13:53.420 --> 02:13:58.000]   this increased risk of breast cancer at five years,
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.100]   and they stopped the study.
[02:14:00.100 --> 02:14:01.980]   Now, the study was done with synthetics.
[02:14:01.980 --> 02:14:04.580]   It was done with conjugated equine estrogen,
[02:14:04.580 --> 02:14:07.900]   known as Premarin, and midroxyprogesterone acetate.
[02:14:07.900 --> 02:14:11.520]   Those were the so-called estrogen and progesterone.
[02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:14.100]   Those are synthetic hormones.
[02:14:14.100 --> 02:14:16.540]   We think especially the progesterone is associated
[02:14:16.540 --> 02:14:18.620]   with the greater risk of breast cancer,
[02:14:18.620 --> 02:14:23.520]   although the subsequent re-evaluations of the data,
[02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:26.760]   now 18 years out, have shown that
[02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:30.220]   this problem with the control group
[02:14:30.220 --> 02:14:32.920]   and no increased risk of breast cancer.
[02:14:32.920 --> 02:14:36.720]   And for the women who got estrogen only,
[02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:39.680]   those who had a hysterectomy, the Premarin,
[02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:43.040]   they actually had a decreased breast cancer risk
[02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:45.360]   and decreased breast cancer mortality.
[02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:49.000]   So there's a lot to be said about this.
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:52.080]   I'm trying to keep it really brief.
[02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:56.040]   But if you look at the women 50 to 60,
[02:14:56.040 --> 02:14:58.320]   so within 10 years of menopause,
[02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:01.120]   they're the ones who seem to have the greatest benefit.
[02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:05.080]   So they had decreased subclinical atherosclerosis,
[02:15:05.080 --> 02:15:07.360]   so less cardiovascular disease.
[02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:11.640]   They had an improvement in terms of bone health,
[02:15:11.640 --> 02:15:16.680]   less progression to diabetes.
[02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:19.040]   And then over the age of 60,
[02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:22.300]   they started to have greater risk of certain outcomes,
[02:15:22.300 --> 02:15:23.680]   such as cardiovascular disease,
[02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:26.120]   myocardial infarction, and so on.
[02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:32.700]   You asked about what do I do?
[02:15:32.700 --> 02:15:38.560]   And to me, this problem is not just menopause.
[02:15:38.560 --> 02:15:42.600]   What's more interesting is to talk about perimenopause.
[02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:45.660]   So perimenopause is the period of time
[02:15:45.660 --> 02:15:48.320]   before your final menstrual cycle.
[02:15:48.320 --> 02:15:49.600]   And for most women,
[02:15:49.600 --> 02:15:52.520]   depending on how attuned you are to the symptoms,
[02:15:52.520 --> 02:15:55.360]   it can last for 10 years.
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:56.640]   So I'm still in perimenopause.
[02:15:56.640 --> 02:15:58.640]   It's been like 20 years
[02:15:58.640 --> 02:16:00.800]   because I've been tracking it so carefully.
[02:16:00.800 --> 02:16:03.020]   It usually gets kicked off
[02:16:03.020 --> 02:16:04.980]   by having your cycle get closer together.
[02:16:04.980 --> 02:16:08.000]   So that could happen in your 30s or your 40s.
[02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:11.560]   You go from 28 days to 25 days, that sort of thing.
[02:16:11.560 --> 02:16:13.660]   You may notice that you start sleeping more poorly
[02:16:13.660 --> 02:16:15.200]   because progesterone is so important.
[02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:17.520]   You talked about that with Kyle.
[02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:20.720]   You may notice it as more anxiety, difficulty sleeping,
[02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:24.480]   and that probably is related to the estrogen receptor.
[02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:27.620]   So ER alpha is estrogen receptor.
[02:16:27.620 --> 02:16:32.360]   Alpha is angio, it increases anxiety.
[02:16:32.360 --> 02:16:36.960]   ER beta is associated with an anxiolytic activity.
[02:16:36.960 --> 02:16:38.080]   And then there's a total
[02:16:38.080 --> 02:16:40.360]   of about six estrogen receptors now.
[02:16:40.360 --> 02:16:44.000]   There's the G protein coupled estrogen receptors,
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:47.680]   and those are mixed, anxiolytic, anxiogenic.
[02:16:47.680 --> 02:16:51.040]   So there's this whole period of perimenopause.
[02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:53.400]   And what's most fascinating to me,
[02:16:53.400 --> 02:16:54.960]   and we've got to talk about this
[02:16:54.960 --> 02:16:57.000]   either today or another time,
[02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:00.020]   is that there is this massive, massive change
[02:17:00.020 --> 02:17:01.720]   that happens in the female brain
[02:17:01.720 --> 02:17:05.200]   that people are not talking about enough.
[02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:09.400]   And so looking at the work of Lisa Moscone at Cornell,
[02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:13.560]   from starting around age 40,
[02:17:13.560 --> 02:17:17.000]   there is this massive change in cerebral metabolism.
[02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000]   So you can do FDG PET scans,
[02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:20.920]   you can look at glucose uptake,
[02:17:20.920 --> 02:17:25.240]   and there's about, on average, a 20% decline
[02:17:25.240 --> 02:17:30.200]   from premenopause, up to like age 35,
[02:17:30.200 --> 02:17:34.080]   to perimenopause, to postmenopause.
[02:17:34.080 --> 02:17:36.600]   The women who are having the most symptoms
[02:17:36.600 --> 02:17:37.920]   in perimenopause to menopause,
[02:17:37.920 --> 02:17:39.320]   the hot flashes, the night sweats,
[02:17:39.320 --> 02:17:40.720]   the difficulty of sleeping,
[02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:43.280]   those are the ones who have the most significant
[02:17:43.280 --> 02:17:45.720]   cerebral hypometabolism.
[02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:47.920]   So it's almost like a,
[02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:50.880]   I don't want to scare people with this language,
[02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:53.760]   but it's a low level,
[02:17:53.760 --> 02:17:56.640]   or let's call it pseudo dementia of sorts.
[02:17:56.640 --> 02:17:59.840]   - Yes, it seems to be a phenotype
[02:17:59.840 --> 02:18:03.160]   that you can then map to Alzheimer's disease,
[02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:04.960]   because that's Lisa Moscone's work.
[02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:07.440]   She's looking at, okay,
[02:18:07.440 --> 02:18:09.580]   Alzheimer's disease is not a disease of old age,
[02:18:09.580 --> 02:18:11.180]   it is disease of middle age.
[02:18:11.180 --> 02:18:14.240]   What are some of the biomarkers that we can define
[02:18:14.240 --> 02:18:16.880]   that can tell you what your risk is?
[02:18:16.880 --> 02:18:18.580]   I've got a mother and a grandmother
[02:18:18.580 --> 02:18:19.540]   with Alzheimer's disease,
[02:18:19.540 --> 02:18:21.840]   you can believe I am all over this data.
[02:18:21.840 --> 02:18:23.800]   - And insulin resistance.
[02:18:23.800 --> 02:18:24.920]   - Huge part of it. - Insensitivity,
[02:18:24.920 --> 02:18:26.760]   as we talked about it before,
[02:18:26.760 --> 02:18:28.520]   seems to be somewhere in there,
[02:18:28.520 --> 02:18:32.080]   which I think when that idea first surfaced,
[02:18:32.080 --> 02:18:33.100]   a few people were like, "Really?"
[02:18:33.100 --> 02:18:34.080]   But then of course, right?
[02:18:34.080 --> 02:18:35.480]   I mean, the brain is this incredibly
[02:18:35.480 --> 02:18:37.720]   metabolically demanding organ.
[02:18:37.720 --> 02:18:41.040]   You deprive neurons of fuel sources,
[02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:43.680]   or you make them less sensitive to fuel sources.
[02:18:43.680 --> 02:18:45.880]   They start dying, they certainly start firing less.
[02:18:45.880 --> 02:18:46.980]   It makes perfect sense.
[02:18:46.980 --> 02:18:49.420]   And I think now it's, thanks to Lisa's work,
[02:18:49.420 --> 02:18:52.500]   work that you've done and talked about quite a lot
[02:18:52.500 --> 02:18:54.280]   is in your books and elsewhere,
[02:18:54.280 --> 02:18:56.960]   I think has really highlighted for people
[02:18:56.960 --> 02:19:00.840]   that metabolism and metabolomics
[02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:03.960]   is going to be as important as genes and genomics
[02:19:03.960 --> 02:19:06.320]   when it comes to dementia. - That's right.
[02:19:06.320 --> 02:19:09.360]   - Perhaps, especially in women, is it safe to say that?
[02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:11.880]   - I think so, because,
[02:19:11.880 --> 02:19:16.880]   we believe that the system is regulated by estrogen.
[02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:22.440]   So the decline in estrogen, starting around age 40,
[02:19:22.440 --> 02:19:24.540]   43 is kind of the average,
[02:19:24.540 --> 02:19:28.080]   seems to be the driver behind cerebral hypometabolism.
[02:19:28.080 --> 02:19:30.800]   The way I describe it to my patients is,
[02:19:30.800 --> 02:19:33.160]   it's like slow brain energy.
[02:19:33.160 --> 02:19:35.360]   So you walk into a room, you can't remember why,
[02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:38.400]   like you just notice that you can't manage all the tasks
[02:19:38.400 --> 02:19:39.720]   the way that you once could.
[02:19:39.720 --> 02:19:41.960]   Like things are just a little slower.
[02:19:41.960 --> 02:19:44.360]   And I say that to women and they're like,
[02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:47.520]   "I have that, like help me."
[02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:50.980]   So this is then circling back to WHI,
[02:19:50.980 --> 02:19:55.040]   where women are scared to death of taking hormone therapy.
[02:19:55.040 --> 02:19:56.600]   And we've got all of these women
[02:19:56.600 --> 02:19:59.680]   that are marching toward potentially a greater risk
[02:19:59.680 --> 02:20:01.600]   of Alzheimer's disease.
[02:20:01.600 --> 02:20:04.720]   And they have this opportunity in their 40s and their 50s
[02:20:04.720 --> 02:20:08.440]   to take hormone therapy and they may not be offered it.
[02:20:08.440 --> 02:20:11.880]   Because the typical conventional approach based on WHI
[02:20:11.880 --> 02:20:15.480]   is to say, unless you're having hot flashes and night sweats
[02:20:15.480 --> 02:20:18.100]   that are severe, I'm not gonna give you hormone therapy.
[02:20:18.100 --> 02:20:19.600]   And I just wanna call that out.
[02:20:19.600 --> 02:20:22.360]   I would say, no, that is not the way to approach it.
[02:20:22.360 --> 02:20:28.440]   Further, the concept right now in conventional medicine
[02:20:28.440 --> 02:20:30.840]   is that hot flashes and night sweats
[02:20:30.840 --> 02:20:32.180]   are these nuisance symptoms
[02:20:32.180 --> 02:20:34.760]   that we will take care of temporarily,
[02:20:34.760 --> 02:20:37.200]   maybe with a little bit of estrogen progesterone
[02:20:37.200 --> 02:20:39.440]   or a birth control pill, 'cause it's given a lot.
[02:20:39.440 --> 02:20:40.640]   - Or that they pass.
[02:20:40.640 --> 02:20:44.180]   - Or that you just suck it up, suck it up.
[02:20:44.180 --> 02:20:47.080]   Doesn't matter that you're not sleeping anymore.
[02:20:47.080 --> 02:20:49.580]   Turn down the temperature in your room.
[02:20:49.580 --> 02:20:53.720]   And that's not right because hot flashes and night sweats
[02:20:53.720 --> 02:20:57.320]   are a biomarker of cardiometabolic disease.
[02:20:57.320 --> 02:21:00.380]   They are a biomarker of increased bone loss.
[02:21:00.380 --> 02:21:04.180]   They are a biomarker of changes in the brain.
[02:21:05.200 --> 02:21:07.920]   So many of these symptoms that occur in perimenopause
[02:21:07.920 --> 02:21:09.680]   are not driven by the ovaries.
[02:21:09.680 --> 02:21:11.660]   They are driven by the brain.
[02:21:11.660 --> 02:21:14.400]   - Yeah, it's the bi-directional crosstalk
[02:21:14.400 --> 02:21:16.720]   between the body and the brain keeps,
[02:21:16.720 --> 02:21:18.880]   I think is this resounding theme.
[02:21:18.880 --> 02:21:20.760]   We had Chris Palmer on here, a psychiatrist,
[02:21:20.760 --> 02:21:22.200]   who's talking about ketogenic diet
[02:21:22.200 --> 02:21:23.240]   for treatment and mental health.
[02:21:23.240 --> 02:21:26.320]   I know we could have a whole other discussion,
[02:21:26.320 --> 02:21:29.520]   and we will, I hope, if you'll agree to it about nutrition
[02:21:29.520 --> 02:21:34.240]   and as it relates to hormones, specific diets and so forth.
[02:21:34.240 --> 02:21:36.480]   But the- - And that's a question too,
[02:21:36.480 --> 02:21:41.480]   whether this problem of cerebral hypometabolism,
[02:21:41.480 --> 02:21:44.520]   could we solve it with estrogen
[02:21:44.520 --> 02:21:47.480]   and/or increase metabolic flexibility?
[02:21:47.480 --> 02:21:49.280]   So I just wanted to footnote that.
[02:21:49.280 --> 02:21:51.980]   Sorry to interrupt you. - No, please, please interrupt.
[02:21:51.980 --> 02:21:54.840]   I know you're, as long as we're there,
[02:21:54.840 --> 02:21:57.240]   I know you are a fan in some instances
[02:21:57.240 --> 02:21:59.880]   of intermittent fasting, time-restricted feeding,
[02:21:59.880 --> 02:22:02.600]   and/or ketogenic diet. - Yes.
[02:22:02.600 --> 02:22:06.200]   - To get cells sensitive to insulin,
[02:22:06.200 --> 02:22:08.200]   which is not to say, if I understand correctly,
[02:22:08.200 --> 02:22:11.160]   which is not to say that women need to stay
[02:22:11.160 --> 02:22:14.700]   on the ketogenic diet for long periods of time
[02:22:14.700 --> 02:22:16.940]   or intermittent fast for my only time-restricted feeding
[02:22:16.940 --> 02:22:18.320]   for eight hours or six hours a day,
[02:22:18.320 --> 02:22:21.520]   but that by increasing, you said metabolic flexibility,
[02:22:21.520 --> 02:22:27.460]   excuse me, but by increasing cells' sensitivity to insulin
[02:22:27.460 --> 02:22:30.800]   and then maybe returning to a more typical eating pattern
[02:22:30.800 --> 02:22:32.260]   and periodically switching back and forth,
[02:22:32.260 --> 02:22:34.180]   that might actually be beneficial.
[02:22:34.180 --> 02:22:35.480]   Do I have that right?
[02:22:35.480 --> 02:22:37.000]   - Yeah, I love the pulse.
[02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.320]   So I feel like it's much more physiologic
[02:22:39.320 --> 02:22:41.420]   than, say, going on a ketogenic diet
[02:22:41.420 --> 02:22:43.220]   and staying there for years.
[02:22:43.220 --> 02:22:46.340]   All of the data that we have on the ketogenic diet,
[02:22:46.340 --> 02:22:49.300]   it's pretty limited in terms of duration.
[02:22:49.300 --> 02:22:52.320]   The longest players that we have in terms of the data
[02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:54.660]   are the folks with epilepsy,
[02:22:54.660 --> 02:22:56.860]   and that's just a different phenotype.
[02:22:56.860 --> 02:23:00.100]   So I think in terms of microbiome effects,
[02:23:00.100 --> 02:23:02.960]   diversity, dysbiosis, some of those issues,
[02:23:02.960 --> 02:23:06.240]   we really don't know in terms of long-term effects.
[02:23:06.240 --> 02:23:08.560]   So I prefer with a ketogenic diet
[02:23:08.560 --> 02:23:11.160]   that it's used as an end-of-one experiment
[02:23:11.160 --> 02:23:12.980]   and that you do it for four weeks.
[02:23:12.980 --> 02:23:15.800]   Maybe you measure biomarkers before and afterwards.
[02:23:15.800 --> 02:23:17.740]   Maybe you look at your stool before and afterwards,
[02:23:17.740 --> 02:23:19.900]   and we still haven't talked about stool tests yet,
[02:23:19.900 --> 02:23:23.660]   but you could measure your fasting insulin and your glucose.
[02:23:23.660 --> 02:23:26.700]   You could just start there, do four weeks of keto,
[02:23:26.700 --> 02:23:28.980]   clean keto, including vegetables.
[02:23:28.980 --> 02:23:31.020]   It doesn't have to be 57 a day,
[02:23:31.020 --> 02:23:33.580]   and then measure it again afterwards.
[02:23:33.580 --> 02:23:36.140]   - Since you mentioned stool testing,
[02:23:36.140 --> 02:23:40.720]   what is your recommendation about stool testing?
[02:23:40.720 --> 02:23:46.180]   - So my recommendation, this is again in the field
[02:23:46.180 --> 02:23:48.460]   of if you have the disposable income.
[02:23:48.460 --> 02:23:49.900]   So I usually start with Genova
[02:23:49.900 --> 02:23:53.500]   because they've got a good copay system with insurance.
[02:23:53.500 --> 02:23:54.980]   That's what I typically use.
[02:23:54.980 --> 02:23:57.500]   So I usually do their one-day stool test
[02:23:57.500 --> 02:24:00.740]   where you have to go digging through your stool
[02:24:00.740 --> 02:24:04.580]   and send it off to this lab that's in North Carolina.
[02:24:04.580 --> 02:24:05.660]   I usually do the one-day
[02:24:05.660 --> 02:24:07.660]   unless I'm concerned about parasites.
[02:24:07.660 --> 02:24:09.360]   In that case, I tend to do three days.
[02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:11.580]   I do that for people who travel a fair amount
[02:24:11.580 --> 02:24:13.520]   and go to places where there's greater risk
[02:24:13.520 --> 02:24:15.820]   or they just have gut symptoms.
[02:24:15.820 --> 02:24:19.860]   Another test that I do a lot is,
[02:24:19.860 --> 02:24:22.200]   'cause I always like to mention two labs,
[02:24:22.200 --> 02:24:23.740]   is a test by Wangeviti.
[02:24:24.740 --> 02:24:29.680]   And this is much more of a data wonk type of test
[02:24:29.680 --> 02:24:30.860]   'cause it's powered by AI.
[02:24:30.860 --> 02:24:35.860]   It was designed by a guy who's got inflammatory bowel disease
[02:24:35.860 --> 02:24:41.700]   and he's a PhD deep phenotyping bioinformatics guy
[02:24:41.700 --> 02:24:48.140]   who wanted to make this really easy.
[02:24:48.140 --> 02:24:51.500]   So the test is under the umbrella of Thorne
[02:24:52.360 --> 02:24:54.660]   and they used to call it gut bio.
[02:24:54.660 --> 02:24:55.840]   They might have another name for it.
[02:24:55.840 --> 02:24:59.040]   And they just improved it so that it's a wipe
[02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:01.100]   instead of digging through your stool.
[02:25:01.100 --> 02:25:02.820]   And so my athletes will do it now.
[02:25:02.820 --> 02:25:05.540]   They were not so into digging through their stool before.
[02:25:05.540 --> 02:25:07.220]   - Is anybody?
[02:25:07.220 --> 02:25:08.100]   - Really, no one is.
[02:25:08.100 --> 02:25:10.420]   - I don't want the answer to that.
[02:25:10.420 --> 02:25:12.540]   I know the answer, I prefer to that.
[02:25:12.540 --> 02:25:14.240]   - But that's a super interesting test
[02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:19.140]   because you get much more dense data.
[02:25:19.140 --> 02:25:23.660]   The issue is, with apologies to my friends at Thorne,
[02:25:23.660 --> 02:25:25.980]   the issue is that their recommendations
[02:25:25.980 --> 02:25:28.300]   end up being Thorne supplements.
[02:25:28.300 --> 02:25:30.280]   So that can be very easy for people
[02:25:30.280 --> 02:25:33.100]   who want to connect the dots.
[02:25:33.100 --> 02:25:37.480]   That's not always the way that I like to do it.
[02:25:37.480 --> 02:25:40.200]   - First of all, three things.
[02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:45.860]   You've shared with us an immense amount of knowledge.
[02:25:45.860 --> 02:25:49.780]   And in that first statement, I also want to apologize
[02:25:49.780 --> 02:25:52.900]   because I threw at you the entire lifespan of,
[02:25:52.900 --> 02:25:56.300]   female lifespan, reproductive health, contraception,
[02:25:56.300 --> 02:25:58.980]   diet, microbiome, so many things.
[02:25:58.980 --> 02:26:02.260]   But I first, I just want to say,
[02:26:02.260 --> 02:26:04.060]   you've taught me a tremendous amount,
[02:26:04.060 --> 02:26:08.980]   including I think something that most people,
[02:26:08.980 --> 02:26:11.240]   including myself, have not thought about enough,
[02:26:11.240 --> 02:26:14.140]   which is the psychosocial impact
[02:26:14.140 --> 02:26:17.200]   on things that we're all familiar with.
[02:26:17.200 --> 02:26:21.380]   Constipation, bowel movements, what we eat, what we avoid.
[02:26:21.380 --> 02:26:25.580]   I have to say really a huge thank you for that
[02:26:25.580 --> 02:26:28.180]   because it's not something that's been discussed
[02:26:28.180 --> 02:26:29.660]   on this podcast before.
[02:26:29.660 --> 02:26:32.220]   Sort of know that brain communicates with body,
[02:26:32.220 --> 02:26:33.880]   psychology and biology are linked.
[02:26:33.880 --> 02:26:35.020]   But I think this is the first time
[02:26:35.020 --> 02:26:39.520]   that anyone's ever directly linked circumstances
[02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:42.620]   and biology and psychology in such a concrete way.
[02:26:42.620 --> 02:26:44.300]   So that's the first thing.
[02:26:44.300 --> 02:26:46.540]   And I know I speak for many people on that.
[02:26:46.540 --> 02:26:49.780]   Second of all, we barely scratched the surface
[02:26:49.780 --> 02:26:54.040]   of your knowledge, which is both frustrating for me
[02:26:54.040 --> 02:26:56.900]   because I always want to learn more
[02:26:56.900 --> 02:26:58.620]   and I know many other people do as well,
[02:26:58.620 --> 02:27:01.500]   but also very, very exciting because hopefully
[02:27:01.500 --> 02:27:03.380]   without much persuasion, we can have you back
[02:27:03.380 --> 02:27:06.620]   on to talk about things. - No persuasion at all.
[02:27:06.620 --> 02:27:07.700]   - I know you're working with men now.
[02:27:07.700 --> 02:27:11.060]   Men's health, some particulars around,
[02:27:11.060 --> 02:27:13.360]   I think there's more for us to explore
[02:27:13.360 --> 02:27:15.660]   in terms of PCOS, menopause, contraception
[02:27:15.660 --> 02:27:17.900]   and all of the above, but then something that you and I
[02:27:17.900 --> 02:27:20.960]   were talking about off camera before we started,
[02:27:20.960 --> 02:27:23.460]   which I think is a really important factor
[02:27:23.460 --> 02:27:27.700]   that ties back to this issue of trauma and stress
[02:27:27.700 --> 02:27:29.960]   and the bi-directional relationship
[02:27:29.960 --> 02:27:31.620]   between biology and psychology.
[02:27:31.620 --> 02:27:34.780]   Hopefully someday we won't even separate those two,
[02:27:34.780 --> 02:27:37.460]   which is the use of specific medicines,
[02:27:37.460 --> 02:27:40.620]   including plant medicines and how that can influence
[02:27:40.620 --> 02:27:43.820]   overall health, which no doubt will include hormone health.
[02:27:43.820 --> 02:27:46.360]   So I say all of that for two reasons.
[02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:48.420]   First of all, to queue up the,
[02:27:48.420 --> 02:27:51.580]   we won't even call it a part two, but a sequel to this,
[02:27:51.580 --> 02:27:55.260]   which I'm gratified to hear that you'll join us for that.
[02:27:55.260 --> 02:27:57.900]   And then also to just really extend a huge thank you,
[02:27:57.900 --> 02:28:01.260]   the amount of knowledge that you shared is immense
[02:28:01.260 --> 02:28:05.420]   and is going to be very, very useful and actionable
[02:28:05.420 --> 02:28:08.940]   for men in terms of their thinking and their actions
[02:28:08.940 --> 02:28:13.100]   and for women in particular, today's discussion
[02:28:13.100 --> 02:28:15.300]   in particular for women in terms of how to think
[02:28:15.300 --> 02:28:16.660]   about their health and biology,
[02:28:16.660 --> 02:28:18.600]   how to think about their psychology and the environment
[02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:20.180]   that all of that is embedded in.
[02:28:20.180 --> 02:28:23.020]   So I just want to say an enormous thank you.
[02:28:23.020 --> 02:28:23.940]   - Thank you, Andrew.
[02:28:23.940 --> 02:28:25.180]   I so appreciate that.
[02:28:25.180 --> 02:28:28.560]   And I so appreciate what you offer to the world
[02:28:28.560 --> 02:28:32.760]   in terms of a way in, a way to understand physiology
[02:28:32.760 --> 02:28:35.980]   and how to craft a architect, a better life.
[02:28:37.700 --> 02:28:39.620]   - Can I just add one last thing?
[02:28:39.620 --> 02:28:41.700]   'Cause I didn't talk about it since we didn't get
[02:28:41.700 --> 02:28:45.560]   to the forties and the fifties in this list of biomarkers.
[02:28:45.560 --> 02:28:48.740]   So I feel like if people, if women went away
[02:28:48.740 --> 02:28:50.620]   with one thing today,
[02:28:50.620 --> 02:28:54.260]   it would be to do a coronary artery calcium score
[02:28:54.260 --> 02:28:57.820]   by age 45 and sooner if you've got premature heart disease.
[02:28:57.820 --> 02:28:59.060]   - How is that taken?
[02:28:59.060 --> 02:29:02.140]   - So it's a CT scan of the chest.
[02:29:02.140 --> 02:29:03.340]   You can self order it.
[02:29:03.340 --> 02:29:05.860]   Like I think at Stanford hospital, you can self order it.
[02:29:05.860 --> 02:29:08.380]   Last time a patient checked, it was $250.
[02:29:08.380 --> 02:29:10.900]   So again, disposable income.
[02:29:10.900 --> 02:29:15.100]   But it tells you, it almost gives you this fork in the road
[02:29:15.100 --> 02:29:17.020]   in terms of how much you need to pay attention
[02:29:17.020 --> 02:29:19.280]   to cardiometabolic health as a woman.
[02:29:19.280 --> 02:29:21.860]   And it's a 45 for men too.
[02:29:21.860 --> 02:29:23.980]   So if you haven't had one, have you had one?
[02:29:23.980 --> 02:29:25.740]   - No. - You need one.
[02:29:25.740 --> 02:29:28.180]   Insulin, cortisol, CAC.
[02:29:28.180 --> 02:29:30.260]   - Great, I'll run all that by you.
[02:29:30.260 --> 02:29:32.660]   - It's really essential and it's,
[02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:39.380]   yeah, it's so fascinating because there's some women
[02:29:39.380 --> 02:29:42.280]   who have a zero, so my score is zero and that's great.
[02:29:42.280 --> 02:29:44.960]   So often you can just keep doing what you're doing.
[02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:48.520]   But if you're 45 and you're starting to be elevated
[02:29:48.520 --> 02:29:51.620]   or you've got, maybe you've got PCOS
[02:29:51.620 --> 02:29:54.240]   or you've got some other biomarkers tending you
[02:29:54.240 --> 02:29:56.760]   in this direction toward the number one killer,
[02:29:56.760 --> 02:30:01.360]   really eight to nine out of the top 10 killers in the US,
[02:30:02.580 --> 02:30:05.220]   that allows you to really start to make changes.
[02:30:05.220 --> 02:30:08.340]   And I think it's essential to know that data.
[02:30:08.340 --> 02:30:11.500]   It's probably not going to be offered by your doctor.
[02:30:11.500 --> 02:30:13.360]   Certainly Peter Attia is going to offer it,
[02:30:13.360 --> 02:30:15.980]   but most conventional doctors are not going to do it.
[02:30:15.980 --> 02:30:17.700]   And then the last thing I want to say.
[02:30:17.700 --> 02:30:19.820]   - Before you mentioned, so if I were to go to my doctor
[02:30:19.820 --> 02:30:22.360]   and I just say, I want a cardiac calcium score,
[02:30:22.360 --> 02:30:23.200]   that's what people should ask.
[02:30:23.200 --> 02:30:26.220]   - Coronary artery calcium score, CAC.
[02:30:26.220 --> 02:30:29.260]   - Okay, so everyone hear that and know that.
[02:30:29.260 --> 02:30:30.940]   If you're 40 or older and maybe if you're-
[02:30:30.940 --> 02:30:33.640]   - 45. - 45 or older, get it.
[02:30:33.640 --> 02:30:37.380]   - So the last thing is, and this is for men and women,
[02:30:37.380 --> 02:30:39.380]   is your ACE score.
[02:30:39.380 --> 02:30:42.380]   So adverse childhood experiences.
[02:30:42.380 --> 02:30:44.980]   Knowing your ACE score is so essential
[02:30:44.980 --> 02:30:49.100]   in terms of a baseline for how much trauma your system,
[02:30:49.100 --> 02:30:52.140]   your PIND system endured when you were a kid.
[02:30:52.140 --> 02:30:55.040]   And we know that childhood trauma,
[02:30:55.040 --> 02:31:00.040]   whether it's abuse or neglect or having an alcoholic parent,
[02:31:00.080 --> 02:31:02.860]   that maps to disease and middle age.
[02:31:02.860 --> 02:31:04.540]   And it can give you so much insight.
[02:31:04.540 --> 02:31:05.380]   I'll give you an example.
[02:31:05.380 --> 02:31:06.880]   I've got a patient who had
[02:31:06.880 --> 02:31:08.960]   an elevated coronary artery calcium score
[02:31:08.960 --> 02:31:11.300]   who does everything right with her food.
[02:31:11.300 --> 02:31:14.700]   I think it was her trauma that elevated her CAC
[02:31:14.700 --> 02:31:16.480]   when she was 45.
[02:31:16.480 --> 02:31:19.980]   So I think an ACE score, knowing your ACE score,
[02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:23.760]   starting as a teenager, like knowing it
[02:31:23.760 --> 02:31:26.720]   and knowing how to work with that is really essential.
[02:31:26.720 --> 02:31:29.220]   - There are certain people, they are exceedingly rare,
[02:31:29.220 --> 02:31:31.480]   but you are one such person that when they speak,
[02:31:31.480 --> 02:31:34.240]   knowledge just comes out of them
[02:31:34.240 --> 02:31:36.760]   and it's incredibly useful and helpful knowledge.
[02:31:36.760 --> 02:31:38.880]   So thank you, I'm going to get both of those things.
[02:31:38.880 --> 02:31:39.720]   - Good.
[02:31:39.720 --> 02:31:41.880]   - And I highly recommend that everyone else
[02:31:41.880 --> 02:31:43.480]   pursue ways that they can get those,
[02:31:43.480 --> 02:31:47.040]   or if they can't get them, that they, you know,
[02:31:47.040 --> 02:31:49.160]   earmark those as things to get at the point
[02:31:49.160 --> 02:31:53.240]   where they can obtain sufficient disposable income.
[02:31:53.240 --> 02:31:57.180]   Sounds like the health, the detriments to health
[02:31:57.180 --> 02:32:00.020]   that those can offset would be well worth the cost.
[02:32:00.020 --> 02:32:02.500]   - Totally, thank you.
[02:32:02.500 --> 02:32:04.600]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion,
[02:32:04.600 --> 02:32:07.800]   all about female hormone health, vitality, and longevity
[02:32:07.800 --> 02:32:09.480]   with Dr. Sarah Gottfried.

[02:33:10.540 --> 02:33:13.920]   And I should mention that on both Instagram and Twitter,
[02:33:13.920 --> 02:33:16.020]   I cover science and science-related tools
[02:33:16.020 --> 02:33:17.940]   for mental health, physical health, and performance,
[02:33:17.940 --> 02:33:19.620]   some of which overlap with the contents
[02:33:19.620 --> 02:33:21.020]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:33:21.020 --> 02:33:22.300]   but much of which is distinct
[02:33:22.300 --> 02:33:24.280]   from the contents of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:33:24.280 --> 02:33:26.940]   Again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media channels.

[02:33:29.640 --> 02:33:31.300]   so-called neural network newsletter,
[02:33:31.300 --> 02:33:32.500]   that's a monthly newsletter.
[02:33:32.500 --> 02:33:34.300]   It's completely zero cost.
[02:33:34.300 --> 02:33:36.540]   And we provide summaries of podcast episodes,
[02:33:36.540 --> 02:33:38.200]   as well as summaries of tools
[02:33:38.200 --> 02:33:40.660]   for everything from optimizing sleep to hormone health,
[02:33:40.660 --> 02:33:42.680]   deliberate cold exposure, deliberate heat exposure,
[02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:44.040]   fitness, and so on.
[02:33:44.040 --> 02:33:45.180]   It's very easy to sign up for.
[02:33:45.180 --> 02:33:46.600]   You go to HubermanLab.com,
[02:33:46.600 --> 02:33:49.300]   go to the menu and scroll to newsletter.
[02:33:49.300 --> 02:33:50.540]   You simply provide your email.
[02:33:50.540 --> 02:33:52.300]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[02:33:52.300 --> 02:33:54.240]   As I mentioned before, it is completely zero cost.
[02:33:54.240 --> 02:33:55.740]   Again, that's the neural network newsletter,
[02:33:55.740 --> 02:33:58.420]   and you can find it at HubermanLab.com.
[02:33:58.420 --> 02:33:59.420]   During today's episode,
[02:33:59.420 --> 02:34:01.860]   and on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:34:01.860 --> 02:34:03.180]   we discuss supplements.
[02:34:03.180 --> 02:34:05.180]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:34:05.180 --> 02:34:07.120]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:34:07.120 --> 02:34:10.740]   for everything from sleep to focus to hormone regulation.
[02:34:10.740 --> 02:34:12.740]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is happy to announce
[02:34:12.740 --> 02:34:14.560]   that we partnered with Momentous Supplements,
[02:34:14.560 --> 02:34:15.660]   because Momentous Supplements
[02:34:15.660 --> 02:34:17.580]   are of the absolute highest quality.
[02:34:17.580 --> 02:34:20.700]   Also, they include many single ingredient formulations,
[02:34:20.700 --> 02:34:22.300]   which is essential if you wanted to design
[02:34:22.300 --> 02:34:24.780]   a supplement regimen that is both cost-effective
[02:34:24.780 --> 02:34:27.860]   and the most biologically effective supplement regimen.
[02:34:27.860 --> 02:34:30.180]   That's very hard to do with blends of supplements.
[02:34:30.180 --> 02:34:31.240]   It's very straightforward to do
[02:34:31.240 --> 02:34:33.280]   with single ingredient formulations.
[02:34:33.280 --> 02:34:35.780]   Also, Momentous Supplements ship internationally,
[02:34:35.780 --> 02:34:37.660]   which is important because we realize that many of you
[02:34:37.660 --> 02:34:39.540]   reside outside of the United States.
[02:34:39.540 --> 02:34:41.100]   If you'd like to see the supplements discussed
[02:34:41.100 --> 02:34:42.700]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:34:42.700 --> 02:34:45.280]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S.
[02:34:45.280 --> 02:34:48.520]   So that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:34:48.520 --> 02:34:51.000]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion,
[02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:54.320]   all about female hormone health, vitality, and longevity
[02:34:54.320 --> 02:34:56.260]   with Dr. Sarah Gottfried.
[02:34:56.260 --> 02:34:58.360]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:34:58.360 --> 02:35:00.160]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:02.740]   [upbeat music]
[02:35:02.740 --> 02:35:05.320]   (upbeat music)
