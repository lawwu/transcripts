[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.220]   Caleb, a listener from Fremont, California, writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, in an
[00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.400]   earlier episode you answered the question, 'How do you process public tragedy?' to which
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.760]   your response was very to the point, as far as God ordaining these things in order to
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.000]   bring a response of glorifying himself through the people being outraged at sin and responding
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.080]   to victims with compassion.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.040]   A question I'm now wrestling with is this, 'How does God ordain evil acts without himself
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.440]   being evil?'"
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:43.560]   We need a category in our minds that goes something like this, "God can will that sin
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.520]   be without sinning."
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:57.240]   It's not a sin for God to choose that sin should be, should exist.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:07.280]   And I say that because the Bible pictures God giving us grace in Christ Jesus before
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:17.040]   the ages began, which means that he was planning for the fall, which would then need to be
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.160]   redeemed by the crucified Christ through grace.
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.880]   And that was all being planned before anything had happened.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.120]   So he's planning for the downfall of man.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:34.000]   Same thing in Revelation 13, 8, where there's this book that God's writing before the foundation
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.040]   of the world, and the name of the book is the book of the life of the Lamb who was slain.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.400]   So you have Jesus in the mind of God slain for sinners before there is even a world,
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:54.440]   which means that we need a category that God is planning that sin be without himself being
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.760]   a sinner.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.240]   And we know from other passages that's in fact what God does.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.960]   Genesis 50, verse 20, "As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it."
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.800]   That is, he meant the evil for good.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:19.200]   So God can oversee and ordain and plan that evil happen without himself committing evil
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.720]   or loving evil or doing evil himself.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.680]   So the question, as I understand it, is can we know anything about how God does that?
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.160]   And here's—this is really tough, Tony—and here's just my best shot.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.520]   I thought of three things.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:44.480]   One, God has infinite wisdom, and we don't have that, and so God is in a position to
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.560]   see how evil events can be woven together to bring about a greater good, and we dare
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.880]   not follow him in this and try to do evil that good may come.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.360]   But God is infinitely wise and can see how it all fits together.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:08.480]   A second thing is to say that when we sin, we sin sinfully.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.960]   That is, we love sin.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.240]   We do sin because it pleases us.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.800]   When God ordains that sin be, he doesn't do it because he loves sin.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.840]   He hates sin.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.560]   We love what we're doing.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.560]   We wouldn't do it.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.520]   Nobody gets up in the morning and says, "I've got to sin some today out of duty.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.920]   I don't feel like sinning, but I really should sin some today."
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.960]   We don't ever do that.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.000]   We embrace sin because it pleases us.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.520]   God never, never ordains that sin happen because it pleases him.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:47.440]   He is managing something to a much higher end, so his motives and his heart are pure
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.960]   through and through.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:56.240]   And the last thing comes from James 1, where it says, "Let no one say when he's tempted,
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:02.960]   'I am being tempted by God,' for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.520]   no one.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.600]   But each person is tempted when he's lured and enticed by his own desire."
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:15.440]   And a lot of people quote that and say, "God tempts no one with evil, so he can't be ordaining
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.820]   that someone sin."
[00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.760]   But that's not quite what it says.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:29.240]   It says that temptation is being lured and enticed by his own desire.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.800]   God cannot experience that.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.480]   He's never lured and enticed towards evil by his own desire, and therefore he doesn't
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.040]   do that to people, which means he does not commend sin to people, he does not approve
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.440]   sin in people, and he does not directly awaken sin in anybody.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:54.280]   He hasn't directly awakened those lurings and those yearnings toward sin.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:04.480]   However, he knows, as God, all the circumstances that a corrupt heart will respond to that
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.480]   way.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:11.760]   He knows exactly how Satan functions and what Satan does in response to those kinds of things,
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:18.320]   and he may ordain that those circumstances and that Satan be in such a position that
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.400]   a corrupt heart will respond that way.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:30.620]   And so I think those three things at least distinguish God from us.
[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:39.160]   And I should say one other thing about the comfort that God's sovereignty is to us.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:45.840]   A lot of people stumble over the sovereignty of God in the control that he has ultimately
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:53.360]   over all things, including our lives, but according to Paul, there's a huge assurance
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:06:02.680]   in that as well, because he says, "God does not let us be tempted beyond what we are able,
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:09.800]   but with the temptation makes a way of escape that we may be able to endure it," which means
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:16.880]   that his sovereignty over what he allows into our lives is perfectly calculated so that
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.360]   none of his children is ever brought to destruction through temptation.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.360]   Yeah.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.720]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.480]   And for more on this topic, see Pastor John's book Desiring God and Appendix 5, which is
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.240]   titled "Is God Less Glorious Because He Ordained That Evil Be?"
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.640]   It can be found on pages 352 to 368 of the 25th Anniversary Edition of the book Desiring
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.640]   God.
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.640]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
