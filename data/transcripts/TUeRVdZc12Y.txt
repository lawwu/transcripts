[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.440]   In episodes 123 and 124, we talked about prayer, and in 124 especially, we talked
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.060]   about mealtime prayers. Pastor John, in your opinion, what's more valuable?
[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.000]   Impromptu prayers before a meal or memorized prayers?
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.400]   I think the wise thing to do would be to mix it up.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:35.500]   If the only prayers that children hear their parents pray are memorized prayers,
[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:42.800]   it will probably communicate to them that's the only way you can pray to God,
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:55.400]   at least at mealtime. And yet, I don't want to discount memorized and well-thought-through prayers
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.200]   because they too have a blessing, and the blessing they have is because they say things often
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:10.200]   that we need to say and might forget to say if we hadn't thought them through.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:19.500]   They're also easy to memorize for little children, and they have a kind of family identification
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:27.500]   and bonding effect. So, if I think of our family, Tony, years and years ago,
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:37.500]   I wrote three prayers, one for the morning, one for lunch, and one for supper.
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.500]   And if our family gets together now, and these boys, my four sons, Taltha's still at home,
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.500]   my guess is, well, I'll give you an example. We went to Brazil for Benjamin's wedding.
[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.500]   That's been some time now, but that's how old he was, and Carson was already married.
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:04.500]   And this Brazilian family turned to me and said, "Would you say grace over the meal?"
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.500]   And some of them were believers probably, and some weren't. And I took a risk, and I said,
[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.500]   "Well, I'll tell you what. I'd like my whole family to say the grace for you."
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:26.500]   And then I began the prayer. Let me see if I can put my finger on it right now.
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.500]   Here's the morning one. "Our Father, every day you give the food by which our bodies live.
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.500]   For this we thank you from our heart and pray that as we this day start,
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.500]   we may allow our eyes to see your endless generosity."
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:49.500]   So I wrote that. I wrote one for noon, and I wrote one for supper, and we said them.
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.500]   There in Brazil, we got all the way through our prayer together as a family.
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:03.500]   And so I'm just illustrating that I believe in prepared, memorized prayers.
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:10.500]   And I want to say, to hear a dad or a mom pray, and to let the children pray spontaneous prayers,
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.500]   has something also very important to communicate.
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.500]   Thank you, Pastor John. You can find the other mealtime prayers he's written
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.500]   by searching for his article titled "Piper's Mealtime Prayers."
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.500]   There's an article at Zaringod.org.
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.500]   There you will find thousands of other free books and articles and sermons and other resources from John Piper.
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.500]   I'm your host Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening.
