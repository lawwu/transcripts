[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320]   most of what we eat is not food and the definition of food is quite different than what we're eating.
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.800]   The food is basically any nutritious substance that people or animals eat or drink or that
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.400]   plants absorb in order to maintain life and growth. Now if you go by that definition of food,
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.320]   what most of us are eating does not maintain life or growth. It actually harms us. When you look at
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.480]   fast food, when you look at most of the ingredients that are in food, they're not actually food. In
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.000]   fact, 60% of our calories are ultra-processed food, which is deconstructed science projects
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.040]   from corn, wheat, and soy that are industrially grown, that are deconstructed into their chemical
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.360]   elements, that are reassembled into all sizes, colors, and shapes of chemically extruded food-
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.960]   like substances that have nothing to do with nutrition. That is what Americans are eating
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.440]   and that, my friend, is why we are a sick nation. And so when I think of food and nutrition,
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.680]   food as medicine, food as information that can literally upgrade or downgrade your biological
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.560]   software with every single byte.
