[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.600]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.920]   knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.640]   life now while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.400]   My name is Joshua and I am your host.
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.440]   Today we tackle the subject of investing.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.920]   There's many versions of this question that I receive on a continual basis in my email.
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.960]   Today we're going to go with Joe's version.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.160]   Joe writes in and writes this, Joshua, I'm currently an active duty Navy member living
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.440]   in Japan, and I'll be here for the next two years.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.240]   I'm 20 years old and I've been consumed by your podcasts and other podcasts on
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.640]   investing and personal finances and how to be fruitful.
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.640]   This year I went from making less than $10,000 a year to now almost $30,000 and
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.840]   was spending recklessly as soon as this increase in income occurred.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.640]   I have no bills I have to pay beside my phone bill and groceries every month.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.440]   And it seemed like I was always sitting on an excess of cash.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.280]   Every check that I didn't know what to do with, except blow away before the next time
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.640]   I got paid, whether it was buying electronics, eating out, buying clothes,
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.080]   et cetera, I spent every penny I had.
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.360]   And I also stacked up around $3,000 in credit card debt.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.520]   So also instead of you responsibly using a chunk of the money I was expecting to
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.600]   receive to pay that debt off, I instead use it to go on a European vacation to
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.560]   London and Italy for 16 days.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.960]   Probably wasn't the best move financially.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.480]   The reason I'm emailing you is because I have paid off this debt and have halted any
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.600]   and all of my unnecessary spending.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.040]   And I'm now seeking some sort of positive outlet to plug this money into through
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.640]   investing.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.280]   I plan to save a significant amount of it for an emergency fund, but just saving my
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.440]   money doesn't appeal to me.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.120]   And it seems like a waste of my time.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.680]   If I could also somehow create another source of income through investing my money,
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.880]   or at least test the waters of investing as a way of spending it in a more productive
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.600]   way, what aspect of investing could provide a secondary source of income?
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.040]   Any advice or tips on where to start learning how to do this or where I should look for
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.920]   some solid information on what the best option would be for a young person without
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.960]   knowledge on the subject?
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.160]   Regards, Joe.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.120]   Joe's question may seem simple.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.280]   And in some way it is.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.040]   But there are, of course, many different layers and ways in which you could answer
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:40.080]   it. Today, I want to tell you how I think Joe and you should approach the subject of
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.000]   investing and figuring out what to invest in.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.840]   But we need to start with just a little bit of my background so I can tell you why I
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.520]   don't just recommend that Joe go and open a Roth IRA, buy a Vanguard total stock market
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.720]   index fund and go on with his life.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.600]   It's not that I don't think that such a plan, as you would commonly hear from many
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:11.480]   personal finance pundits, is necessarily wrong or even necessarily ineffective.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.840]   I just don't think it's optimal.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.720]   I have a somewhat difficult relationship personally with the world of mainstream
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.800]   personal finance.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.040]   I come from the world of mainstream personal finance.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.720]   When I was growing up, I enjoyed reading books on personal finance and investing,
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.120]   but I didn't get particularly involved in the books or theories of those who were on
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.880]   the fringes.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.880]   I was involved in relatively mainstream advice.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.400]   I remember one of the books that when I was in high school, I read that really
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.800]   impacted me was David Bach and his book, original book, The Automatic Millionaire.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:01.760]   In said book, David recommends that you minimize your expenses by removing various
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.040]   small but regular expenditures from your budget.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.560]   An example would be a daily latte at the fancy coffee shop.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.400]   If you can remove that and invest the money instead, you can accumulate quite a
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.920]   bit of money.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.000]   That's where he coined the term and trademarked the term the latte factor.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.520]   Additionally, David recommends that you set up your plan so that it functions
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.200]   automatically.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.480]   Make an automatic transfer from your checking account into your investment plan,
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:39.040]   or perhaps do an automatic distribution from your paycheck, from your employer,
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.040]   into an investment plan.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.800]   He also recommends that you purchase mutual funds and perhaps consider paying off
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.760]   your current house and buying a rental house.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:57.760]   In the book, he gives various resources such as a company like Fidelity or a company
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.080]   like Vanguard that you could call up and use and set up a tax favored investment
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.560]   account.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.760]   Is there anything wrong with that plan?
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.080]   I think it would be wrong to say that there's something wrong with it.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.280]   But is it really right?
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.120]   See, a frustration that I had in working in the world of professional financial
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.880]   advice was it really didn't seem like that plan worked for many people.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:34.360]   Oh, sure, it would work for some, but it didn't seem like it would work for very
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.840]   many.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.520]   The data proves me out.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.280]   Most people in the United States of America can't scrape together a few thousand
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.520]   dollars if they need it.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.360]   Most people in the United States of America, richest country in the history of
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.960]   the world, richest time in the history of the world, most people will never be able
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.520]   to afford to retire.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:06.720]   Now is the problem that they didn't have access to a 401k account, that they didn't
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.280]   fund it?
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:14.120]   You can make an argument, at least to the funding question, that yes, if they'd
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.000]   funded an investment account, it could have worked.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.480]   But I've just not seen that plan as super effective.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.880]   Now, when I was involved in the world of mainstream personal finance, I looked
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:33.280]   around and realized that there were all kinds of people doing other things that
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.760]   didn't fit well in 180 page book that would sell well on the Barnes and Noble
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.360]   bookshelf.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.160]   But yet these other approaches to finance also worked.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.360]   Over the last few years, I've really considered these questions.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:54.080]   And I had a number of misgivings and questions about mainstream personal
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.920]   finance world that I was things I wasn't sure of.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:03.080]   And I resolved not to try to make any quick decisions, not to try to come up
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.520]   and make a strong decision one way or the other, but just to let some time go, to
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.680]   let my thoughts percolate.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:17.280]   There's a very powerful statement that says, "It's hard for you to expect a man
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:24.200]   to see your point if his paycheck depends on his not seeing it." I've always been
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.400]   pretty sensitive to that.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.680]   And there are a number of controversial areas in the personal finance world where
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:37.120]   I've wondered, are my thoughts and opinions colored by my paycheck?
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.400]   In some cases, I think they were.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.720]   In some cases, I think they weren't.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.960]   I've sorted through some of those things and done my best to try to make fresh
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:46.800]   decisions.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:54.480]   But on the topic of investing, I'll tell you what, knowing what I know now about
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:02.240]   the world of mainstream investing, I wouldn't participate again.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:09.280]   If I were Joe starting over 20 years old, or if I were coaching Joe as a client or
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:17.640]   perhaps as my nephew or a son, I wouldn't coach him to say that his primary tool
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:24.480]   or his primary approach to the question of investing is to go and open a Roth
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.000]   IRA.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.560]   Nor would I necessarily say that he shouldn't do it.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:36.480]   I would seek to start to teach the deeper things.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.640]   So let me give you just some ideas.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:45.480]   I've got a list of eight, eight ideas that I think are useful and worth considering
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.680]   when it comes to investing.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:52.480]   And here are some of the factors that you should choose to look at.
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:57.280]   I do not know what Joe or what you should invest in.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:03.600]   I don't even know where to tell you or Joe to go to look for knowledge.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.640]   I've never seen any of what I'm about to give you written formally, but it's some
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.120]   of what I've put together just in my thinking as far as some of the appropriate
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:12.840]   factors.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:19.280]   Factor number one is you should consider the amount of time that you have available
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:28.080]   for an investment activity and recognize that the more time that you have available
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:36.560]   for an investment activity, the more money you can put into the investment activity.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:44.720]   People with a lot of time on their hands should aim their investing activities into
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.640]   a world where time can be used constructively.
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:54.280]   As I work through today's show, I'm going to try to use very simple examples.
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:10:01.720]   Take these examples as illustrations, not as specifics, and think about each of my
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:08.640]   examples and consider its applicability in your local area.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.960]   Start with something most of us can relate to, and that's real estate.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:19.520]   If you desire to invest in real estate and you have a lot of time available to you,
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:29.160]   one thing you can do is use that time to try to find properties, properties that are
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.960]   undervalued or devalued.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:36.040]   And this is a very valuable but also time-consuming activity.
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:41.480]   For example, many real estate teachers will teach you to go out and drive around
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.360]   looking for houses that seem abandoned.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:50.920]   Or some will teach you to walk up and down the streets and knock on doors and seek to
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:55.560]   find out what the story is on the property and see if there might be a potential
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.080]   opportunity.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:02.960]   If you're an investor who has time, these activities are well-suited for you.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:08.800]   You don't have to have any money to do that, but you do need time to do that.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:15.360]   If I had a lot of time, I'm quite confident I could build a career going and finding
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.960]   deals in the real estate world, and you just simply bring that deal to somebody who
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.360]   has money and they pay you for your work.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.160]   This is normal.
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.480]   This is common in the world of real estate investment.
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.280]   So if you wanted to pursue real estate investment and you had a lot of time, you
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.760]   would choose a strategy like that.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.240]   But what if you don't have a lot of time?
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.200]   What if you want to invest in real estate, but you're a busy corporate executive?
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:48.200]   A strategy of investment that requires you to go out and spend your time driving
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:53.680]   around looking for abandoned properties or knocking on doors is probably not a good
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.440]   fit for you.
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:59.960]   So how much time do you have available for your investment opportunity?
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.120]   You should analyze that.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:09.160]   And you should analyze that and look for investment opportunities that will fit what
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.840]   you've got.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.360]   Our friend Joe is in the military.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.160]   That means in some ways that he doesn't have a lot of time.
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:22.440]   After all, all of his time is owned and directed by the US government.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:26.040]   But in other ways, he probably does have a lot of time.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:30.800]   After his work week, he's got time where he's hanging out in the barracks and he's
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.360]   got his leave time, etc.
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.920]   And given the fact that he has minimal responsibility, I don't read anything
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:42.160]   about a wife or children, he doesn't really own any property to consume his
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:42.520]   time.
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:49.440]   Joe's got time available to invest in his investment activities.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:55.280]   So we've got to figure out how do we use that time appropriately.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.280]   Second factor you should consider is money.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:04.720]   Money can be a real problem for an investor.
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:12.160]   The lack of money can be a problem and an excess amount of money can be a problem.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:19.600]   If you don't have any money, you'd better pick an opportunity for investment that
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.880]   doesn't take much money.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:27.200]   I described in the last few weeks how my son has made his first successful
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.720]   investment and we did it in the honey business.
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.920]   He had saved and accumulated from his weekly 75 cent allowance.
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:40.600]   He gets a weekly 73 quarters every week on Friday and then we put a quarter into
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.280]   his giving bag.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.200]   We put a quarter into his spending bag and we put a quarter into his investing
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:45.480]   bag.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:50.400]   And so he had accumulated week by week in his investing bag about $5.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.800]   And we were trying to figure out a way where he could invest that money.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.040]   It's five or six dollars, I think, by the time we got this done.
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.480]   And we're looking around and saying, how can we invest six dollars?
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.560]   Interesting problem.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.960]   Had a couple of ideas.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.640]   I broached this question in the Radical Personal Finance Facebook group and
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:12.640]   somebody suggested that we go out and buy a case of water and then we chill that
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.640]   water and go and sell it for a dollar a bottle.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.760]   That's actually my favorite idea.
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.480]   We haven't done it yet, but we're planning to.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:24.200]   And I want to show that to you as an example to say, if you've got five dollars
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:28.200]   accumulated, you can take that five dollars and you can invest it profitably.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:34.400]   Right now at Costco, they sell a tray of about 30 bottles of water for under four
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:34.960]   dollars.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:40.600]   You can take that tray, find a way to chill those bottles down, get yourself a
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:45.240]   cooler and ice and take those bottles of water to a place where people would be
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:49.920]   happy to buy cold bottles of water and sell them for a buck a bottle, 50 cents a
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:50.240]   bottle.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.840]   Assume you sell all 30 bottles out.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:57.800]   You've now made a profit on your investment of $26, turned $4 into 30.
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.720]   That's a pretty good investment.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.080]   Doesn't require a lot of money.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.040]   We're going to do this with my son.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:08.120]   Got to figure out where to do it and I got to dedicate the Saturday to doing it,
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.600]   but that's part of our plan.
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:13.600]   I want him to see that you can always invest just a little bit of money.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.600]   Now in his case, his investment was he's a family member who's in the honey
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.160]   business.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.800]   He bought five little honey bears, very small ones, bought five little small
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.240]   honey bears for a dollar each and then sold them to friends and family who were
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.560]   coming to our house to visit the new baby for $2 each.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:35.920]   Well, he invested his money, but he only had a little bit of money and so there
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.040]   was only a certain scale.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.520]   He could only buy five honey bears.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.880]   He couldn't buy a truckload of honey.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:45.800]   On the flip side, sometimes having too much money is a real problem as well.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:52.680]   Warren Buffett famously has right now approaching $100 billion, over $90
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:16:01.000]   billion, approaching $100 billion of excess cash just sitting in what we'll
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.880]   call a bank account that he's got to figure out how to invest.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:16.160]   Investing $100 billion profitably is a real problem because to torture the
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:20.600]   comparison, it would make no difference in Warren Buffett's $100 billion
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.400]   investment for him to spend $4 on a tray of water and turn it into 26.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.400]   It has no impact.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.440]   So he's got to find huge deals.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:35.600]   Now the key is to invest at a level that's appropriate to you.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:44.640]   Continuing on with real estate, it may be very possible to create a big profit
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:51.720]   from buying a $15,000 mobile home and working on it for a little bit and
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:55.360]   flipping it for $30,000 if you don't have a lot of money.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.480]   You could do that profitably.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:03.880]   But if you're that busy corporate executive and you have a couple hundred
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.040]   thousand dollars extra per year that you're trying to figure out how to
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:13.520]   invest, it's hard to conceive of doing deals on a scale of $15,000.
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:20.240]   So when you are trying to figure out what to invest in, you've got to look at how
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.680]   much money you have available to you and choose something that's going to be
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:28.240]   appropriate for the amount of money that you want to invest.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:33.160]   During the course of your investing lifetime, this will probably change.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.360]   So you should be prepared for it to change.
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:43.400]   These two factors I'm convinced are the two most important places to start.
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.240]   Time and money.
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.680]   And you got to try to match your investments to your time and your money.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.200]   Now you'll notice that I'm using the word investment very loosely.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.520]   I don't know how to escape that in the context of today's show.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:03.360]   Investment and business are very much mixed up here in my discussion.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:08.720]   But that's okay because investment is also mixed up with job.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:14.240]   What do you do when you have a huge amount of time and no money?
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:18.000]   Most likely you'll get a job.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.560]   And what's the best use for that money that you earn?
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:27.280]   Most likely is to invest it back in your job skills, in your
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.160]   job qualifications, et cetera.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:36.040]   If you think about the person starting completely over, Joe got out of the
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:41.000]   military, he's 20 years old, his tour of duty is done, he comes back, he's got no
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.560]   money, he blew it all, what does he do?
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:46.240]   He goes gets a job, then he gets an apartment, and he gets some clothes to
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:50.200]   wear, then he gets transportation, then he works on improving his training.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.800]   Maybe he'll go to school, get some certifications or get a
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.280]   diploma or something else.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.560]   Those are all reasonable, reliable investments.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:06.040]   But let's say our friend who is a successful advanced physician with a
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:11.760]   major specialty, earning a lot of money, has advanced training, has all the
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.640]   clothes he needs to perform neurosurgery.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:19.920]   Does our physician benefit from going and buying another medical degree?
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:24.120]   You reach a point which you can't invest anymore in your education.
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.920]   You got to look at something else.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:33.160]   So it's valuable for you to invest your time, invest in a way that's appropriate
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.480]   to your time and to your money.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:41.800]   And you want to choose something that will help, that will profile your
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:42.560]   strengths.
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:46.080]   In investing, you always want to play to your strengths.
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:55.600]   One of my frustrations with mainstream investing is in the example I painted
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:01.040]   earlier, opening a Roth IRA, buying an index fund, you have no strength.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.240]   You are one in hundreds of millions.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:08.640]   You bring nothing to the table except a few thousand dollars.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:14.880]   Doesn't mean you can't profit, just means you're not going to profit very much.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:21.480]   There still are valid reasons to do that, but recognize you're not going to profit
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:24.120]   very much because you are one in hundreds of millions.
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:29.880]   Your $5,000 in a Roth IRA is not going to move the needle, and it's also not going
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.320]   to move the needle in your life.
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.160]   So you got 5,000 bucks.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:34.920]   Great.
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.400]   How much can you earn on it?
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.560]   Let's say you weren't 10%.
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.240]   Wow, that's $500.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:48.680]   Is your life going to be magically changed between $5,000 and $500?
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:52.480]   Sorry, $5,500 because you earned a 10% growth?
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.600]   It's not going to make a difference in the short term.
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.120]   Long term it will, but it's not going to make a difference in the short term.
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:04.400]   Now compare that $5,000 and let's say that you just use it going and trying to find
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:09.160]   and spend that on finding properties that you can flip to an investor for a bird dog
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:09.520]   fee.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.240]   Let's say you get your fee of $5,000 per property.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.960]   Oh, could you find five properties?
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:15.920]   You could.
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:20.000]   Now that you've got five properties, could you go ahead and invest in one mobile
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:20.960]   home that you double up?
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:21.840]   Yes.
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:29.320]   Those things take a lot of work, a lot of time, but because you're investing the
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.240]   time and the work, they can also be far more profitable.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:36.440]   So the first two factors are time and money.
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.400]   How much time do you have to invest and how much money do you have to invest?
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:47.240]   If you've got a lot of money to invest, don't waste the opportunity by going and
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.160]   competing with people who don't have money.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:55.480]   If you've got a million dollars of investable assets, that puts you in a much
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:22:01.520]   rarer class than the people who have 40 hours a week they can spend learning about
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.120]   something or studying something, et cetera.
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.720]   Factor number three is knowledge.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:12.800]   You should consider your knowledge as it's applied to an investment opportunity.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:19.880]   Do you have a unique knowledge of a market?
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.400]   Yes.
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:28.000]   Years ago, I knew a guy here in Palm Beach who I used to teach, or I used to drive a
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.240]   boat, teach as, I did teach, but I taught kids.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.080]   I used to teach wakeboarding and water skiing.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.080]   I'd drive a boat sometimes for some of our clients.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.840]   And there was a guy who used to come out and ski with us.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.960]   And he was just a real, really a great guy.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.280]   His first name was Dick.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:48.360]   And he would come out and trick ski when he was in town in Palm Beach for the
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:48.680]   summer.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.560]   He'd come out and trick ski with us every day.
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.600]   Trick skiing is a really interesting form of skiing.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:58.040]   Unlike their three major disciplines in skiing, there's slalom, trick skiing, and
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:02.840]   jumping in the kind of the traditional water ski world.
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.200]   And Dick used to really enjoy trick skiing.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.040]   So he'd come out.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.640]   And one of the things just so funny in trick skiing, you don't wear a life jacket
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.840]   usually, unlike all the other forms of skiing.
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.360]   He'd come out in his Speedo and his trick skis.
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.240]   And he was in his mid to late 80s.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.440]   And he was in good shape.
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.520]   He would trick ski every day.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.600]   He used to do this one trick in his late 80s, which I always admired him for.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:29.640]   His closing trick was he would put the, take the ski rope, put it over around his
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:33.600]   head, around his neck, and then lean back on his skis, cross his arms across his
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.040]   chest and ski across the water.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:39.720]   The way that you do this safely on a ski boat is you have an emergency release.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.200]   And so you make sure the rope is on this emergency release.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:46.200]   So you got to watch them like a hawk when they've got this, because if they fall,
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.000]   you got to release it.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.880]   Otherwise they could be seriously, seriously hurt.
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.680]   So Dick was a great guy.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.000]   He lives on Palm beach and pretty wealthy.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.800]   And he wrote his autobiography and it just wasn't published or anything.
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.280]   He wrote it out for his family and friends.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.640]   And he gave me a copy and I read it.
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:06.560]   And one thing that was so interesting was learning how he made his money.
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:09.560]   It was a Texas in the oil business.
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:13.920]   And he would go out and in the early years he was trying to find oil.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:19.160]   So he was all over the Texas oil industry back and forth, searching for wells, et
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:23.880]   cetera, but he acquired a great deal of knowledge about the Texas oil business.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:28.680]   This allowed him to effectively employ that knowledge into making good investments.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:33.600]   He had no money when he started off, but he acquired knowledge by working in the
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:38.400]   industry and knowledge from traveling extensively, knowledge from inside
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.680]   connections in the industry.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:45.000]   Then he started to borrow money from people who had money and invest that money for
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:45.280]   them.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:49.880]   They were happy because they had the money, but no time and no knowledge.
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:53.600]   Dick on the other hand, didn't have any time, sorry, didn't have any money, but he
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:54.840]   had the time and the knowledge.
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:59.600]   And so he could invest other people's money profitably and it made him his
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.280]   fortune, the basis of his fortune.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.840]   Knowledge is important.
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:11.160]   One of the most valuable things you can do is acquire specialized knowledge.
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:17.960]   And you often will find that this is in the context of your job or in the context
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:18.680]   of a business.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:23.920]   The last three years doing podcasting, I've acquired and built a tremendous
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:28.200]   amount of knowledge around multiple new fields that I didn't have a few years
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:34.240]   ago, which means that I could now invest profitably in new fields.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:38.400]   Now, some of those things I could have to do the work myself or work as a
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.600]   consultant, which are limited, but I've also acquired skills and knowledge,
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:46.000]   sorry, knowledge that can be applied and you can do the same thing.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:55.600]   So back to Joe, Joe has a lot of time, not a lot of money and based upon the email,
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.000]   not much knowledge.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.640]   So the best place to focus at this point is to buy knowledge.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.040]   That's the best place to, sorry, that's a, that's a YouTube culture joke there.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:13.600]   That's the best place to focus right now is to buy knowledge.
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:14.800]   How do you do that?
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.000]   You choose an area of interest and you become an expert.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.800]   It takes time, not much money.
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:24.440]   You start reading, you start learning, you start exploring, you start talking and
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.480]   you build knowledge in a particular area.
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:31.440]   That brings me to point number four, skill.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:36.320]   Again, one was time, two is money, three is knowledge, four is skill.
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:44.320]   You should consider your skill when it comes to your investment activities.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:53.520]   This last weekend, I sold a dog crate that I found on Amazon.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:59.280]   I sold a dog crate that I found on the side of the road.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:03.000]   My wife and I like to go trash picking, curb diving on the side of the road.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.760]   And I found this dog crate in a neighbor's trash pile and I hauled it home and I sold
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:12.080]   it on Craigslist for a hundred bucks.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.440]   That's a pretty sweet profit.
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:17.880]   Got it for free, sold it on Craigslist for a hundred bucks.
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:24.200]   I'm convinced that I could make a full-time business, finding stuff in dumpsters and on
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:29.360]   the side of the road and flipping it on Craigslist and eBay, et cetera, for money.
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.640]   I could develop that skill.
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:36.560]   I haven't proven it, but I could develop it.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:39.360]   I could dedicate the time.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.040]   It doesn't take much money.
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.960]   I have all the basic tools of money.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:46.120]   I have the knowledge of how it's done and I have the knowledge of some of the
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.920]   markets. I immediately knew when I saw this dog crate that it was worth a few
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.640]   hundred bucks and I could probably make a quick and easy hundred bucks.
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.480]   And I could build and acquire the skill.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.400]   I know people who do this to great effect.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:06.160]   But usually they have a real skill in working with their hands and fixing things up.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:12.080]   It's one of the big benefits, whether it's fixing up washing machines and dryers, like
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.480]   I previously interviewed people here on Radical Personal Finance about.
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.480]   I know somebody who does this with lawnmowers.
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:21.000]   They'll go and they'll find weed eaters that don't run and lawnmowers that don't
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:27.160]   run and just a few little bits of work here and they'll fix them up and get them
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.320]   running and flip them for a couple hundred bucks.
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:35.040]   I know people that do this with cars, find old cars, can fix them up, flip them and
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.880]   make some money on them because they just find them, fix the things that are wrong,
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.560]   motorcycles, et cetera.
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:40.520]   These are skills.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.360]   They have those physical skills.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.520]   I'm quite confident I could have developed those skills.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.560]   But those are not my skills that I want to develop.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.400]   My skills that I want to develop are in a different area.
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:55.080]   The ability to communicate with you verbally right now is a skill.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.320]   The ability to write is a skill.
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.400]   The ability to analyze something is a skill.
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:06.160]   My ability to create a taxonomy of investing here in the context of this show is a
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:06.880]   skill set.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.440]   Not many people have that skill set.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:18.360]   So you want to focus in an area where your unique skills are allowed to shine.
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:23.520]   The number of people who can make a business, finding things on the side of the
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:28.920]   road or fixing up old lawnmowers and flipping them is very large.
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:33.720]   The number of people who can do what I do is much smaller.
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:37.560]   So I always try to focus on the areas where I have skill.
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:44.120]   Skills have to be acquired and honed.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.920]   Some of them, I believe, are late.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.280]   You know, they may be latent.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:52.520]   Some of them are kind of built in, but a lot of them are developed and honed with
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:53.240]   practice.
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:57.440]   But you can develop skills.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:03.000]   There's a lot of money to be made in flipping computers that you find.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   Find or build cheap ones or build custom ones, et cetera.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:13.760]   Takes some time, probably not much money, a lot of knowledge, a lot of skill.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:19.800]   So if Joe came out of the Navy and had a lot of time, a little bit of money,
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:23.360]   knowledge and skill in computers, he could make a business on this.
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:26.280]   And it's a legitimate investment.
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:34.560]   But as time were to go on, as investment activities were to change and he were to
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:38.960]   mature as an investor, he would probably find it necessary to change his
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:39.960]   investment strategy.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:44.840]   It may be possible to invest a few thousand dollars into computers and to flip
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:45.760]   them profitably.
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:51.920]   I don't know how to invest a hundred thousand dollars in computers and flip
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.760]   them profitably.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:58.120]   So these four variables, I'm convinced, are very, very important.
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:02.960]   And if you start thinking about them and looking at opportunities around you, use
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.400]   these four variables as a matrix.
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.200]   Time, money, knowledge and skill.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:19.440]   And try to find opportunities near you that are close by that lead to, well, give
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.760]   you options and that would give you a good investment opportunity.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:27.040]   I do have four more, and I don't claim that this list of eight is exhaustive.
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:31.320]   In fact, if you've got additional factors, I ask you to give them to me.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:34.800]   I think those first four are the most important, but these additional four are
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:35.680]   also important.
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.440]   Number five is temperament.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:41.400]   Am I well suited for this particular activity?
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:48.560]   I, Joshua, I am not well suited for an activity of fixing up lawnmowers.
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.240]   I don't enjoy the work.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.520]   I would be bored stilly.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.120]   I don't see the challenge in it.
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.360]   It doesn't appeal to me.
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:55.960]   It doesn't match my temperament.
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:32:00.960]   I can't think of how, like you would max me out on that money and on the
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:04.960]   investment opportunity, and I'd rather just go take a job that interests me and
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.240]   put all my money in the stock market.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.360]   It doesn't fit my temperament.
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.760]   That's different than other people.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.360]   Some people, it really does fit their temperament.
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:17.360]   Some people have the temperament where they like excitement or they like a
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.120]   challenge.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:24.160]   Some people's version of real estate investing involves them traveling the
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:28.920]   world, putting together global deals with financing from here and permissions from
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:29.880]   there, et cetera.
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:31.760]   That's their temperament.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:36.600]   Some people's temperament with real estate investing involves them buying the
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:40.640]   house next door, fixing it up and renting it out to a young family.
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.240]   That's their temperament.
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:46.000]   Time, money, knowledge, and skill play a factor, but you know what?
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.200]   If you're real focus, if you don't have any money, you have time and you have
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:55.480]   knowledge and skill and real estate, but your temperament is well suited to going
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:33:01.360]   and doing that multinational deal-making, don't buy the house next door.
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:03.400]   Go do the multinational deal-making.
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:10.080]   You find somebody to work for, you work for them for possibly a base salary, or
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:13.400]   you work for them for a cut or for a commission, and you can go and develop
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:17.120]   that skill using your temperament of putting the deal together, and you just
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:17.880]   work on commission.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.000]   You don't have to have the money.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.320]   Is that a good investment?
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.080]   Absolutely.
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.000]   It's a good investment.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.760]   It's a great investment.
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:30.520]   Some people's temperament suits them to reading annual reports for publicly
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.560]   traded companies.
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:33.480]   They love to do that.
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:39.920]   In that case, there may be opportunities in the broad-based publicly traded
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.080]   capital markets for them to invest in.
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:47.800]   Some people really enjoy watching stock indicators and following the markets on
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:51.560]   a regular basis and following prices and movements and things like that.
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:57.080]   If you wonder why I don't dig into more of that on radical personal finance is
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.080]   because it doesn't match my temperament.
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.760]   I'm not interested in it particularly.
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.360]   I don't want to trade stocks.
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.000]   I don't want to sit there in front of my computer.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.400]   I don't even want to read annual reports, at least not on publicly traded
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:13.600]   companies, many, many of them to really understand and follow these companies
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.320]   over time to work as a value investor.
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:17.920]   I don't want to, that doesn't fit my temperament.
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.400]   My temperament is very different.
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:24.960]   So I know what I would do, what I do with my temperament,
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.440]   but you've got to study yours.
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.880]   Some people say, I don't want to be a landlord.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:34.040]   Well, the fact that you do or don't want to be a landlord isn't necessarily an
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.960]   indication of whether you should or shouldn't invest in real estate.
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.120]   I've been giving you lots of real estate examples.
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.680]   I like to use real estate because we, most of us get it.
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:45.040]   We see it, we live in it, we rent it, we own it.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.840]   We dad and mom owns it.
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:49.240]   Our brother and sister-in-law have been foreclosed on.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.680]   Like we've, we've known real estate investors.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:53.720]   So I like to use real estate examples.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:55.560]   That's why I use so many for you.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:59.440]   Don't, don't think that there aren't about a gazillion other opportunities.
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:03.040]   But some people's temperament is not well suited to being a landlord.
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.600]   That's fine.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:08.520]   There are lots of ways that you can invest in real estate that aren't
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.920]   related to being a landlord.
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:14.160]   Some people's temperament doesn't fit big risk.
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:18.680]   Well, you got to find a way that allows you to invest that
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:20.840]   doesn't ruffle your risk feathers.
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:23.640]   Next factor is timing.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.320]   Timing matters.
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:33.240]   If you have the wrong idea, sorry, if you have the right investment idea, but
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:38.280]   you employ it at the wrong time, your investment idea won't work.
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:44.360]   Now the right time will depend on the market.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:45.960]   The right time will depend on the product.
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:50.160]   The right time will depend on, on a bazillion factors, but you've got to be
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:53.360]   investing at the right time and you've got to look around and sometimes you may
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:56.360]   have a great idea, it's just the wrong time.
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:02.000]   But you might also look and say, ah, I see an opportunity that
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.760]   will work now at this time.
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.280]   We'll go after those.
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:09.000]   Try to match those things up.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.800]   I have a love hate relationship with the phrase, you can't time the market.
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:18.000]   That's a phrase that comes out of the broad-based larger stock market.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.920]   And we say, you can't time the market.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.120]   You can't time the market.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:25.040]   Well, I have no problem with that statement for most of us when it comes to
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:32.320]   stocks and to the broad-based large US stock market, I do have a problem with
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:39.640]   that when it comes to the markets that you know, because you can time your market.
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:48.320]   What happens in many market changes is the information is there.
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:56.800]   The evidence is available, but most people don't proactively change anything.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:02.080]   Most people don't change until circumstances force them to change.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:06.360]   It just seems to be a common trait of human beings.
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:09.320]   We don't change until circumstances force us to change.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:17.040]   So you can see something that's going to provoke change and you can time your
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:23.560]   market, just because you see something doesn't mean that everybody else does.
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:28.160]   A lot of times people are just unwilling to make a change.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:32.440]   They're unwilling to change their routine in order to take advantage of something.
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:38.240]   Many people who get laid off from their job knew that there were
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:39.720]   problems for their industry.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:43.920]   You think, well, if you knew there were problems coming for your industry, why
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.240]   didn't you leave the industry?
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.720]   Why didn't you get out a year ago or two years ago?
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:51.000]   Most people don't want to change.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.960]   So you can time your investment opportunities and timing is going
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.800]   to make a big, big difference.
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:01.960]   If you're looking at a market, you're looking at a sector, you've done your
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:07.640]   homework and you see you have an opportunity with timing, go after it.
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:13.440]   On the flip side, if you have a great idea, but you don't see the time, that
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:14.960]   investment is not going to work out.
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:18.840]   You need to figure out a way to wait for an appropriate time.
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:25.880]   Sometimes you take all your money out and you pour it into building a big
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:27.720]   commercial building because you're going to sell it.
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:32.520]   Sometimes you look around and say, I'm just going to pay some option.
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:36.440]   I'm going to lease option this land and I'm just going to pay my option fees and
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:40.320]   wait for the next business cycle, wait five years, wait for that road over there
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.800]   to get built, wait for this neighborhood to come up.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.480]   Sometimes you bide your time and you don't put any money into it except for
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.440]   the option price.
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:49.640]   Factor number seven, opportunity.
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:55.240]   What opportunities do you actually have?
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:39:02.320]   I have family that's in the farming business and one of my family members,
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:09.080]   young person, had tremendous opportunity at an early age to start investing their
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.960]   money into agriculture.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:15.000]   The way this starts is in your late teens, if you grow up in a farming community,
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.920]   then you can go and you can lease some land, whether you lease or rent a section
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.640]   of land and you start growing your own crops.
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:25.120]   Well, you need some money to put up, but you have the ability to invest a few
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.800]   thousand dollars that you've saved by working for somebody else.
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:33.160]   And you have the ability to rent your dad's tractors, use the farm equipment,
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:36.440]   et cetera, and to profit from your own farming activities.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:37.920]   This is common in agriculture.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:40.040]   So my family member did that.
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:42.520]   That's an opportunity that I don't have.
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:47.280]   I don't have around me thousands of acres of farmland where I can just go and rent
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.120]   a section to plant corn on.
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:54.880]   My dad doesn't have a barn full of tractors that I can borrow and rent from
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.320]   him in order to work with.
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:02.440]   I don't have the opportunity for that knowledge to be able to apply.
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.040]   I don't have the opportunity.
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.360]   It just doesn't exist for me.
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:13.560]   So I'm not approaching that and calculating how much money I can earn from
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:18.200]   growing corn because that opportunity just does not exist for me.
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:24.040]   But for my family member, for whom it does exist, that is a great investment.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.040]   And it's far better for them to take $5,000 and buy seed and put gasoline in
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:37.120]   the tractor and diesel in the tractor, sorry, put fuel in the tractor and pay the
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:39.480]   rental fees and buy the crop insurance and everything.
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:43.240]   That's going to have a much better opportunity and be a much better
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:49.360]   investment than is putting money in the stock market just like everyone else.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.200]   There's no point of differentiation.
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.040]   There's no unique opportunity.
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.800]   So look around and see the opportunity that you have.
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:00.080]   When I was a financial advisor, I met with a person who was a college
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:06.200]   professor and this college professor was a computer science professor.
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:10.560]   And I was talking to him about investments, trying to get him interested
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:18.000]   in my investment opportunities and my mutual funds and things that I had for sale.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.920]   And so we were talking about what he invested his money in.
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:21.720]   He said, "I'm sorry.
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.480]   I invest all of my money back home."
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:27.880]   Well, he was from, I forget which specific, it may have been the Congo,
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:34.000]   but from a small country in Africa, not one of the more prominent ones like
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:40.800]   South Africa, but one of the Central African countries, and he was investing
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:45.440]   all of his investment dollars into internet cafes back home.
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:49.040]   And he had the opportunity to invest there.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:53.040]   He had the local network of people where he had people who could keep an eye on
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:57.400]   his investment. He had the technical knowledge to put together an internet
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:01.680]   cafe and make the connections to be able to purchase the computers and get them
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:02.680]   set up, et cetera.
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:08.120]   And he had the money to do it, the knowledge, the skill, the temperament
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:13.000]   worked for him because he's working in a cultural context that he understood.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.360]   The timing was good.
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:17.400]   Cafes were a good business at that opportunity and he had the opportunity.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.080]   I don't have that same opportunity.
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:23.360]   It would take years to build the connections of people that I could trust to
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:24.720]   work around a business like that.
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.680]   But he had that opportunity.
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:29.760]   You might have an opportunity like that as well.
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:34.840]   So don't neglect the opportunities that are right in front of you.
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:38.280]   Subway shops are a great business.
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:41.280]   They don't cost that much to open.
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:46.160]   You can build a fortune on the back of a sandwich shop.
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:51.040]   If you have an opportunity like that and it fits your temperament and you see an
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:56.000]   opportunity, you see an investment idea, then it fits the timing and you can build
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   the knowledge and the skills and you've got the time and the money, et cetera,
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.760]   that may fit you and you're going to have a unique and competitive advantage there
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.880]   that other people don't have.
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:13.080]   I enjoy watching the empires that certain savvy business people, certain athletes
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:17.680]   put together when they change from athlete to business owner.
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:20.640]   Shaquille O'Neal is fascinating to me.
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:22.280]   Very, very smart man.
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:27.720]   Well, he has had an opportunity to leverage his brand and this is the way it
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:28.400]   works in athletes.
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:33.320]   If you're an athlete and a well-known athlete, you have the opportunity to
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:34.440]   leverage your brand.
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:39.240]   So you leverage that brand for publicity that brings money in and then you leverage
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:41.400]   that publicity for all of your other businesses.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.280]   I don't have Shaquille O'Neal's investment opportunities.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:48.960]   Mine are different and yours are different.
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.520]   Finally, factor number eight is tools.
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:52.520]   And with this, we're done.
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:59.560]   What tools are necessary for your potential investment opportunity?
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:04.520]   If I were a high school student, I'd probably have a side business fixing
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:07.360]   people's broken iPhone and Android screens.
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:09.760]   I do it on the cheap and do it on the side.
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:13.240]   Well, you got to have a little screen tool and little screwdriver, et cetera.
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:16.000]   And you got to have the ability to get online and buy a fresh screen and
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.040]   swap it out for people.
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:19.440]   But I can start a little business like that.
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:22.600]   Just got to get the tools, a little bit of knowledge, a little bit of skills,
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:26.800]   not much money, not much time might fit the temperament of certain people.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.400]   Timing is good.
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.400]   Opportunity exists.
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.680]   I have a broad stream of potential clients.
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:34.840]   I just need a few tools.
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:38.320]   What tools do you have that other people don't have?
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:40.000]   I'm a physically large man.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:48.840]   It's smarter for me to move in the direction of personal security and use
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:53.000]   my size as an advantage than it is for me to move in the direction of horse
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   jockeying, kind of crossing the barrier here with opportunity and tools.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.560]   But what tools do you have?
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:05.400]   You will have unique tools that you have or that you can acquire that other
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.880]   people don't have or can't acquire.
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:11.160]   So recognize those things and search them through.
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:15.360]   Having a great internet connection is a valuable tool.
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:18.400]   It sets things apart.
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:23.360]   Not having an internet connection on the other hand, you might also be able to
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.480]   figure out a way to turn that into a valuable tool.
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:31.440]   I think these factors, number one, time, two, money, three, knowledge, four,
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:36.400]   skill, five, temperament, six, timing, seven, opportunity, and eight tools.
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:40.880]   These factors are important in your investment activities.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:45.360]   And I think that if you'll pursue them and consider them and filter your
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:50.040]   investment, desired investments through them, you'll have an opportunity for
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:52.800]   success, but you got to recognize this.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:46:00.520]   Nobody else can do this for you and nobody else can answer the question
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:06.280]   of what you should invest in because they don't have the information about how
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:10.160]   much time you have available, about your money, about your knowledge and skill
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:13.080]   and temperament and timing and the timing of the market and the opportunities
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:14.560]   that you actually have in the tools.
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:18.080]   You can't answer that question.
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:21.360]   I find this to be frustrating all the time.
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:24.480]   I recommend investment ideas to other people all the time.
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:26.800]   Nobody takes me up on them.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:31.360]   Now, most of the time, I think people don't take me up on them
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.520]   because people don't really care.
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:33.760]   Most people don't want to be rich.
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.600]   Most people won't want to do any hard work.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:38.080]   Most people don't want to actually pursue it.
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:39.400]   It's hard to get rich.
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:44.800]   It takes a lot of work, but sometimes they just don't want to pursue them because
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:47.240]   my suggestion wasn't right for them.
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:49.720]   It doesn't fit something.
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:55.480]   I don't know any way that you can outsource this, but I do know if you'll
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:47:01.280]   start looking around you, start thinking, take an interest in the things that you
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:05.440]   see, take an interest in the people that you see, things will start to
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:07.680]   shake out and you'll see them.
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:12.720]   It's important to remember when it comes to investing, saving
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.680]   money is not a waste of time.
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:23.240]   Don't ever fall prey to the idea that you're losing money just because you
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:25.400]   don't have a savings account.
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:27.360]   Just because it's sitting on a savings account.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:32.440]   Yes, you do need to consider the corrosive effect of inflation.
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:33.280]   I hate it.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.760]   I hate inflation.
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:46.640]   I think it's, but in the short term, even a few years, it's not going to be that big a deal.
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:53.120]   Over the course of a few years, you can look around, you can study, you
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.320]   can find the things that will work for you.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:48:02.960]   In that context, it'll be helpful to you to have more money.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.440]   More money is almost always a benefit.
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:08.800]   I don't know how to solve Warren Buffett's problem, what to do with his
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:11.120]   hundred billion dollars, but I do know this.
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:12.680]   You'll figure it out.
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.760]   And it's not such a bad problem to have.
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:16.000]   It's one of the worst problems.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.240]   I'm sorry, one of the better problems on the scale of problems to have.
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:31.280]   The perfect investment for you is going to be one that uniquely fits your unique
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:32.240]   variables.
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:38.760]   When you're playing in the space that you're uniquely qualified, you're not
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:41.360]   going to have a ton of competition and you're going to do fine.
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:44.000]   I just closed with just a final example.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.640]   You're listening to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:51.000]   I'll just point out how in some of my decisions, this is what I have applied to
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:51.360]   me.
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:56.040]   Now, in the context of Radical Personal Finance, I like to use it as an example
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:59.720]   because some of my approach has been haphazard.
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:01.360]   Some of it has been very calculated.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:06.120]   But let me show you how these eight things lead to Radical Personal Finance
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:10.200]   having been and being a unique opportunity for me, a unique investment.
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:14.920]   I have other business opportunities as well, but Radical Personal Finance is the
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:16.120]   core of what I'm doing right now.
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:17.560]   Number one, time.
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:25.160]   I have the benefit being and I figured out a way to set things up that I could use
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:29.560]   the time available to me to create something like Radical Personal Finance.
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:33.960]   And due to some of the decisions that I've made and the things that I have
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:38.360]   planned, I have been able to devote a lot of time to this endeavor.
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:42.200]   Other people who are in this space don't have as much time.
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:44.520]   I did.
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:49.640]   I had a lot of time, didn't have a lot of money available to invest when I
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:50.160]   started.
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:55.120]   So I chose something that didn't require a significant investment of money.
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:50:00.360]   I chose something that had a low financial cost of entry because all my money was
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:02.520]   tied up in dumb things I'd done in the past.
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:06.640]   I was changed, but that was the situation I was facing.
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:10.480]   So I chose an opportunity that fit more time, less money.
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:12.320]   Number three, knowledge.
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:19.720]   I had a tremendous head start on other people with my knowledge specific to the
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:22.160]   topics of finance, financial planning, et cetera.
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:28.440]   So my moat of safety in this particular business investment is significant.
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:34.000]   Other people know more than me, certainly, but it would take somebody who's brand
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:40.080]   new quite a long time to study enough to beat me in terms of knowledge.
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:43.040]   So now I've lined up time, money, and knowledge.
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:44.120]   Well, what about skill?
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:47.200]   Well, again, I had a good head start in terms of skill.
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:54.360]   I had unique skills and unique personal attributes that fit what I was doing.
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:57.560]   Number five, temperament.
[00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:59.720]   Doing this fits my temperament.
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:03.000]   Now there are a couple of mistakes I've made, I've realized, and I'll be changing
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:07.040]   even the format of the show again going forward in the future because I got to fit
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:07.720]   my temperament.
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:10.280]   I got to fit what's going to work for me.
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:13.480]   But this fits my temperament.
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:17.640]   It deals in the world of ideas, deals in the world of classification, deals in the
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:19.400]   world of analytics and analysis.
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:24.600]   But it doesn't cause me problems of trying to do stock analysis every day, which
[00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:25.440]   would drive me nuts.
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:26.800]   Timing.
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:31.360]   There was a timing in the marketplace that I was seeing, still see, and have
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:35.560]   watched very carefully to try to strike at the right time when the concepts were
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:39.000]   proven out, and yet the market was not saturated.
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:42.840]   It would be much more difficult for me to do today what I did three years ago.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:46.440]   I watched the timing and I made the decisions based upon the timing.
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:48.320]   Number seven, opportunity.
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:50.440]   I had the opportunity available to me.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.480]   I could see it.
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:53.240]   Other people couldn't see it.
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:55.240]   Almost nobody could see it.
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:56.080]   I could see it.
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:52:01.600]   And the tools, not a huge factor on the tools, but something as simple as having
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:04.760]   a stable internet connection was important for me and I had that ability.
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:10.240]   Something as simple as having the ability to sit at a desk for extended periods of
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:16.160]   time and work and not traveling constantly, or all of these are valuable tools.
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:21.320]   So when you start to apply these, you may not see them in advance.
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:23.040]   I didn't see all that three years ago.
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:25.520]   I saw some of it, but I didn't see all of it.
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:30.680]   But today I can analyze what I'm doing, why I'm doing it, and I can see the
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:32.520]   tight fitting connection to me.
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:37.360]   And now this is the framework that I use to apply to other opportunities.
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:41.640]   I have other investment opportunities that come along or other business ideas, etc.
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:45.120]   I'm looking at them and saying, how does this work with regard to the time, the
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:49.080]   money, the knowledge, the skill, my temperament, the timing in the marketplace,
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:55.080]   the opportunities that I actually have, and the tools that I have available.
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:53:02.000]   So Joe, I can't do it for you, but I can promise you saving money is a good idea.
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:04.200]   Paying out of debt is a great idea.
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:07.120]   Not having any fixed obligations is a great idea.
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:16.040]   Now, get busy studying, learning, talking, reading, listening,
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:19.400]   searching for opportunities.
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:21.400]   Don't be in a hurry.
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:24.880]   There are plenty of investment opportunities out there.
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:28.520]   No matter where you live, no matter when you live, there are plenty
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:29.920]   of investment opportunities.
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:33.360]   But don't let the fear of action keep you out.
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:39.440]   Don't know what it is for you, but I do know that that is how I
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:41.000]   would tell you to invest your money.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:47.920]   This show is part of the Radical Life Media network of podcasts and resources.
