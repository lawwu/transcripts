[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.040]   And then number three is practical preparedness.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.020]   Having a flashlight with a charged battery.

[00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:21.800]   Very simple.

[00:12:52.200 --> 00:13:22.180]   Pretty likely that at some point in time your city will face a severe ice storm or a drought or a flood of some kind. Pretty likely. Pretty unlikely that your nation would face something like that, especially if you're from a very large country, the United States, Russia, Canada, Argentina, some of these very physically Brazil physically large countries very unlikely that your entire nation would be affected by something like that. But there are a handful of disasters and potential disasters that really do have a lot of potential disasters that really do have a lot of potential to do.
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:22.180]  , but there are a handful of disasters that really do have a lot of potential disasters that really do have a lot of potential disasters that are not only in the future.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.220]   have those huge potential impacts.
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:26.220]   have those huge potential impacts.
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:32.220]   have those huge potential impacts. There are disasters that are so massive in their impact that I don't consider them to be worth thinking about things like an asteroid.
[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:33.240]   there are disasters that are so massive in their impact that I don't consider them to be worth thinking about things like an asteroid.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:33.240]   there are disasters that are so massive in their impact that I don't consider them to be worth thinking about things like an asteroid.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:37.240]   there are disasters that are so massive in their impact that I don't consider them to be worth thinking about things like an asteroid. If an asteroid hits the United States, what do you do to prepare for that?
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:37.240]   if an asteroid hits the United States, what do you do to prepare for that?
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.240]   if an asteroid hits the United States, what do you do to prepare for that? I don't think you do.
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:56.300]   I don't think you do. I think you just deal with it if you're still alive and if not, then you make sure that your soul is with God, not in the other place.
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:00.300]   I don't think you do. I think you just deal with it if you're still alive and if not, then you make sure that your soul is with God, not in the other place.

But when I think about those big disasters that are short of an asteroid, and I consider the likelihood of those things happening, I always come up with three specific scenarios.
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.340]   Number one, a global flu pandemic.
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.340]   Number one, a global flu pandemic.
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:06.340]   Number two, global nuclear war.
[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.340]   Number two, global nuclear war.
[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:08.340]   Number three, broad-scale electromagnetic pulse attack.
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:09.340]   Number three, broad-scale electromagnetic pulse attack.
[00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:10.340]   Number three, broad-scale electromagnetic pulse attack.
[00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:11.340]   I think that those three things are probably the most realistic of those really big scenarios.

[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:28.900]   But I will tell you, I've studied the topic and it's very feasible to prepare for something like a global nuclear war.
[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:36.700]   May sound funny to talk about having a bunker, a fallout shelter, but it's very feasible to have a fallout shelter.

[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:09.480]   I think there's good reason to be optimistic that in the modern world with an improved understanding of germ theory etc maybe that kind of scenario is less likely to happen but then you also flip on the flip side when you say that we haven't even talked about intentionality the release of some sort of of of toxin or some sort of disease that was intentionally designed to be destructive who knows
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:09.480]   I think there's good reason to be optimistic that in the modern world with an improved understanding of germ theory etc maybe that kind of scenario is less likely to happen but then you also flip on the flip side when you say that we haven't even talked about intentionality the release of some sort of of toxin or some sort of disease that was intentionally designed to be destructive who knows
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:38.980]  , but these are scenarios that have happened again and again throughout history so a flu pandemic could come with the risk of getting sick and dying yes that is the risk but it also comes with economic risk the risk of having your business collapse having your restaurant sit empty because people aren't going out to eat having your event that you've invested tons of money into producing the big concert or the big festival lightly attended because nobody wants to come having your airline service and you're not going to go out to eat because you're not going to go out to eat
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:24:08.480]   airline seats sit empty because people don't want to fly those are the things that start to stack up in the short term and then potentially if you had a truly widespread and truly destructive virus then the long-term impacts could be massive what would it do one of the unique things about the Spanish flu it's my understanding that it affected the young and the healthy much more than the elderly and the sick which is the normal case usually it's the elderly and the sick who died from the flu
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:37.980]  , but to find out in the Spanish flu impacted the young and the healthy more what would happen to something like an already sick social security system if there were some disease that came through and wiped out a huge number of young healthy workers all of a sudden it collapses even faster those are the kinds of things that are very feasible now are they likely I don't know how you would even guess something like that I just say feasible everything that I've just said is certainly within the understanding of medical science
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:37.980]   everything that I've just said is certainly within the understanding of medical science
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:37.980]   everything that I've just said is certainly within the understanding of medical science

[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.400]   it's it's been happened again and again throughout history and and it's
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:42.400]   it's it's been happened again and again throughout history and and it's
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.580]   it's it's it's been happened again and again throughout history and and it's certainly feasible so what do you do first thing you
[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:45.580]   certainly feasible so what do you do first thing you do is
[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:48.220]   certainly feasible so what do you do first thing you do is you stop and you think you think what
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:48.220]   you stop and you think you think what
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:51.100]   you stop and you think you think what would I do if that kind of situation were
[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:51.100]   would I do if that kind of situation were
[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:54.420]   would I do if that kind of situation were happening what would I do if I had 50%
[00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:54.440]   happening what would I do if I had 50%
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.640]   happening what would I do if I had 50% fewer customers in my store because people
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:56.640]   fewer customers in my store because people
[00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:19.300]   didn't want to go out to public places what would I do if my business
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.300]   didn't want to go out to public places what would I do if my business got shut down because of a quarantine that were
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.400]   got shut down because of a quarantine that were imposed on my town it's happened go and

[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.300]   imposed on my town it's happened go and look at the videos from China right now most of

[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:26.480]   look at the videos from China right now most of us don't live in China that's a very
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:26.480]   us don't live in China that's a very
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:26.640]   us don't live in China that's a very different system of social control than the more free
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.680]   on
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:55.280]   go. I say,ëŠ”,
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:26.700]  berger,I'm going to impose a curfew and to get people out and it's about it. And so during severe times of distress, that's the standard operating procedure. Impose martial law, impose onerous restrictions, regardless of whether they're truly effective or not, regardless of whether they should be done or not. All that stuff that the government officials are happy to say, all this stuff can be argued out in the courts later. We're just going to do what we think we got to do to help people to survive. So stop and think, what would you do? Now, what you'll see is quickly,
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:56.740]   that everything we talk about in day-to-day financial planning comes into play. Why do I encourage you to have money saved? Well, because if you have money saved, then you have resources that you can draw on in order for you to be able to have the things you need to get through. If you have money saved and your business takes a 50% decline due to something happening, then you're going to be okay. Why do I encourage you not to have debt or not to have significant amounts of money?
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:26.800]  , because that puts more resiliency in your life. If you have a paid off house and you can sit at home and all you got to do is come up with enough money to pay the taxes so that the government doesn't take it from you, then you are in a safer position. And so having money saved and having low debt, having low financial commitments is really good. It increases your personal resiliency. In addition, it allows you to make intelligent actions that could protect you. For example, one of the things that's really hard for people is to have a personal resilience.
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.160]   but

[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:20.960]   I don't know what you're doing but I think the percentage of people in the world at large that could do that is pretty low most of us are so dependent on the economic systems around us that we're not going to be able to do that.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:20.960]   I don't know the percentage of the radical personal finance audience that could do that but I think the percentage of people in the world at large that could do that is pretty low most of us are so dependent on the economic systems around us that we're not going to be able to do that.

[00:29:49.500 --> 00:30:19.040]  , could you go home and stay at home for three months without going out and interacting outside?
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:19.520]   Now it starts to get a little bit harder here to do that because as the time increases your supplies may start to run run dry but I think that that should be a goal that your goal for family preparedness should be that if I said go home and be home for three months without leaving your property that you should have the basic things that you need to do that.
