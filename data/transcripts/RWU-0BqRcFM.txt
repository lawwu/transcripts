[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.040]   Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue. Remember, if you have a question for us, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.040]   Questions have been heating up, Duncan. I want to get into that in a minute, but first,
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.720]   our sponsor today. Portfolio Rescue is brought to you by Innovator ETFs. Now, there's a lot
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.880]   of uncertainty today. At least, it feels that way. There's always uncertainty, because no
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.880]   one ever knows what's going to happen in the future, but it feels like it's more uncertainty
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.280]   right now. Well, Innovator ETFs is here to help. They have their defined outcome ETF
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.840]   strategy. You can see, they have different ways of defining their outcomes. So, you can
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.080]   have a cap on the upside, so you know exactly how much you can make, with also having an
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.240]   enhanced cap, where you could earn two to three times as much of that cap. They also
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.900]   have their buffer ETFs, where you can have a downside range, where you lose the first
[00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.700]   bit of it. So, it could be 9%, 15%, 30%. Or, they have a floor, where you can't lose any
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.480]   more of that. So, you can go through all their different ETFs and their education tools and
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.680]   figure out whether you want to have a cap of a certain amount, you want to have a loss
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.180]   protection to a certain amount. Because, again, we see a wide range of outcomes in bear markets,
[00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.680]   where you could have these huge snapback rallies, or you could have further pain ahead. We don't
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.240]   know. Again, if you want to learn more, go to InnovatorETFs.com.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.620]   Duncan, we went through a little bit of a lull there in questions. Now, they're coming
[00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.620]   in hot.
[00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.680]   A little bit of a lull. It was bad.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.880]   Yeah. We put out the bad signal when people came through. It's interesting to see the
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.680]   tone shift. Credit to our audience. We have people who are very smart, and they're not
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.320]   panicking, they're not freaking out. But, the tone is certainly different than it was
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.320]   in the past. Because, in the past, it was, "Listen, I have these huge gains. I don't
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.400]   want to lose them. But, if I get another 10X from here, I don't want to kick myself if
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.660]   I don't take part in that. So, what do I do? Or, should I invest in this one specific area?
[00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.740]   Because this is the area that's doing the best." Now, it goes to, "What about my losses?
[00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.040]   How do I handle these huge losses? What do I do with them? How do I make my money back?"
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.980]   This difference between bull markets and bear markets is interesting for me. So, I went
[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.560]   through, and I put some things of the difference between bull markets and bear markets. So,
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.320]   bear with me here. I'm going to start going from bull to bear.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.720]   Bull markets, you have the fear of missing out. Bear markets, you have the fear of being
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.840]   beaten. Bull markets is, "Everything I buy is going up. I'm a genius." Bear markets is,
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.940]   "Everything is going down. I'm an idiot." Bull markets, you say, "See, fundamentals went
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.880]   out." Bear markets, you say, "No, no, no. Technicals and sentiment. That's the real
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.800]   winner right here." In a bull market, you say, "Geez, I wish I had more money in stocks.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.000]   Why didn't I take more risk?" Bear markets, you say, "Man, I wish I had cash, give me
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.600]   more optionality." Bull markets, buy and hold always wins. It always wins. In bear markets,
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.160]   buy and hold is dead. Bull markets, Warren Buffett is always washed up. Bear markets,
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.560]   "Wait, is Buffett buying here?" It's all these things. Bull markets, "I'll be greedy. We
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.080]   know those are fearful, I promise." And then, bear markets, "I lied. I'm fearful, and others
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.240]   are fearful." Bull markets are, "Buy the dip." Bear markets are, "Sell the rip." You have
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.280]   all this stuff. Bull markets, "Why didn't I invest earlier in my life? I should have
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.360]   put more in." Bear markets are, "I'll never invest again." Bull markets, "Diversification
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.200]   is for losers." Bear markets, "Geez, why was I so concentrated?" All these things. You
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.240]   feel, and bull markets are, "Markets will never fall again." Bear markets are, "Markets
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.720]   will never rise again." It's all this stuff. It's this dichotomy, and it just switches
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.440]   back and forth between the human emotions, and that's kind of how it works. It's unfortunate
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.600]   the markets are tugging at our heartstrings with this kind of stuff, but this is kind
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.600]   of the way it works, right? Unfortunately.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.840]   Yeah. And the one that I'd never heard before for people my age in the market is, "I'm out
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.240]   of money." It's like buying the dip, people buying the dip, buying the dip, and then it's
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.360]   out. It keeps going down, and you're out of money. That's a bad thing.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.400]   That's one of the biggest pros of just having a dollar-cost averaging strategy, where you
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.760]   take a little bit of every paycheck. It would be nice to have this cash hoard that you could
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.040]   put to work, and I'm going to wait for the fat pitch, and I'm going to swing at it. But
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.600]   most people probably can't do that or won't do that, so just putting your money in on
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.240]   a regular basis from your paycheck is probably the best way to go anyway, and it's the easiest
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.440]   one, and frankly, it's the simplest strategy, too.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.120]   Alright, we've got some good questions today. Let's do it.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.860]   Okay. Up first, we have a question from Australia, actually, which is pretty cool. I don't think
[00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.640]   it's a first, but we don't give those a whole lot. I believe it's Michael in Australia.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.040]   They write, "As a long-term investor in my late 20s, the general advice seems to be that
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.120]   I should buy in this environment because it's cheap, and in the long-term, it should return
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.720]   the most. However, at the same time, we consistently talk about the fact that the majority of stocks
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.040]   won't return to bear highs. Isn't it possible that I could buy the wrong stocks and miss
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.080]   out on the returns I'm supposed to see in the long run because the stocks never return
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.300]   to their previous levels?"
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.360]   Those Aussies are pretty smart. This is a very astute observation. And as someone in
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.720]   their 20s, it's hard to consider yourself a long-term investor yet, because you still
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.200]   have a much longer time to go, but I hope you stick with that. And yes, if you're a
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.920]   young person, you should get on your hands and knees and pray for bear markets. This
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.240]   is a good thing. You're buying at lower prices, lower valuations, higher dividend yields.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.400]   It doesn't feel like that because you see your portfolio value sinking, but if you're
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.040]   a young person and you have years or decades ahead of you, yes, you should be hoping for
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.360]   this. This is a good thing.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.400]   Now, this observation about stocks versus the stock market is a good one, because I
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.320]   have a lot of faith that the stock market is going to come back from mean reversion.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.800]   If the stock market doesn't come back, then we have probably bigger problems on our hands.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.560]   But I can be sure that a lot of stocks themselves won't come back. This is from a McKinsey report
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.920]   from a few years ago. "In 1958, a company could expect to stay in the S&P 500 for about
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.400]   61 years. Today, it's more like 18 years." And I'm guessing that number is just going
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.380]   to continue to go down. "Of the Fortune 500 companies in 1955, only 61 were still on the
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:51.720]   list in 2014." That's a 12% survival rate. The other 88% went bankrupt, merged, or basically
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.340]   just fell from the list because of underperformance.
[00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.400]   It's hard for a company to -- I've looked at the top 10 stocks every five years, going
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.720]   back to 1980. And there's some in 1980 that you just never heard of before, like Atlantic
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.760]   Richfield and some of these oil companies that have either gotten taken over or merged
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.660]   that you've just never heard of before. John threw up the first chart of GE here. GE was
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.880]   the biggest stock in the S&P 500 in 1995, 2000, and 2005. This company peaked in 1999
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.360]   or 2000. It hasn't come close to getting back there since. I remember I had a buddy after
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:26.880]   2008 say, "I'm going to buy this stock. It's down so much, because it has to come back."
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.720]   It hasn't quite worked out. I think the stock is down 85%, and dividends have been cut along
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:36.000]   the way. Cisco Systems. Cisco was the biggest stock by market capitalization on the planet
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.840]   in 1999 and 2000. Still well below those levels. Probably 50% down from 1999-2000 levels.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.960]   How about a more recent example? Bed, Bath & Beyond. Peaked in 2013. It's down 94% ever
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:55.280]   since. That's like a lot of 20% coupons. Right, Duncan? Citigroup. Top five biggest stock
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:02.760]   in the S&P 500 in 2000 and 2005. Peaked in '99, 2000. Almost made it back by 2006. It's
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.040]   now a shell of its former self. How about Bank of America? Made it back to its 2006
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:12.800]   highs, but still well below those levels. AT&T is another big name. Peaked in 2000.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.240]   Still well below those levels. Some of these stocks have paid out dividends, so you've
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.560]   probably done okay, paid to wait. These are huge brand name stocks that have never come
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:25.520]   back in decade-long periods. It can happen. How about a success story? Microsoft. Easily
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:31.280]   one of the most successful companies of all time. Peaked in 2000. Took 16 years to reach
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:37.800]   that level, following the dot-com bubble bursting. It can take a long, long time, even the success
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.280]   story. So, you can be waiting a long time, a lot longer than the stock market itself,
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.280]   if we have a comeback.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.840]   Let's look at current Russell 3000 levels. So, I looked at, put this into Y charts, all-time
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.960]   high levels, and then their drawdown from there. 30% of stocks in the Russell 3000,
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.760]   this is like 2,800 stocks. It's called the Russell 3000, but there's not that many stocks
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:58.640]   anymore. 30% of them are down 70% from all-time highs. And a lot of those all-time highs did
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:04.820]   not come in 2020 or 2021. They came way before that. 20%, one in five, is down 80% from all-time
[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:09.160]   highs. And then 11% or one in ten is down 90% from all-time highs. And again, a lot
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:14.960]   of these all-time highs took place a long time ago. You could see a long time for this
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:20.440]   to happen. It's not out of the realm of possibility. So, the index itself right now is down 20%.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.840]   I have faith that a broad index of U.S. stocks is going to come back at some point. I don't
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.520]   know when. I don't know how much further it could have to fall. I don't know how long
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.360]   it's going to take to break even. But I'm pretty certain that U.S. stocks, a broad basket
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:35.080]   of them, are going to come back at some point. Again, if it doesn't happen, we have bigger
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:39.880]   problems. But, that's just, betting against U.S. corporations is a bet against innovation.
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:44.320]   It's a bet against human profits. It's a bet against human desire. I just, this desire
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.000]   to get better, I just have no idea which stocks will lead the way. I don't know which ones
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.540]   are glorious buying opportunities right now, and I don't know which ones will never recover
[00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.360]   from their losses, because it's really hard to tell. So, you could get much higher rewards
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.440]   if you pick the right stocks right now. But you could also have much higher risk and see
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.680]   much bigger losses, or just never make your money back if you pick the wrong ones. Stocks
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.120]   can and will go out of business. An index fund, I'm pretty sure, is not going to go
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.800]   out of business. That's the way I look at it. It's much safer to buy an index fund right
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.760]   now if you want to earn your money back. You can see much higher reward if you buy the
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.760]   right stocks. That's the way to look at it. Yeah, I know. That makes sense, yeah. Diversification
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.920]   for the win. Not to brag, but you know, the first stock I ever bought was, I was in college
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.640]   back in 2008. I bought Microsoft, and I still have it in that account.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.640]   Seriously? Yeah.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.720]   That's pretty good. Okay, so you bought it, because it came back a little bit, and then
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.320]   2008 crashed again. So, you're probably making some stupid names on it, too.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.160]   I hope that I literally forgot about the account for years. But, yeah, it's still there.
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.740]   That's the key. See? Not bad. And, you have to live through a lot of those losses along
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:42.760]   the way, right? Not bad.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:43.760]   It's true.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.760]   Not to brag. Alright, next question.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:51.680]   Okay. Up next, we have, "Hey, Ben and Duncan. I'm 32 years old and have a stable career
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.440]   making $70,000 a year. First of all, I should preface this. They go into a lot of detail
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:01.120]   that might not be necessary, but I think it's kind of interesting. I own a six-bedroom home
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:06.280]   and house hack it. I live in one bedroom but rent out the other five bedrooms. I've owned
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:12.000]   it for three years and I average $3,500 a month in gross rent. After everything is paid
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.340]   and I set some money aside for CapEx and vacancies, I cash flow $750 a month. The only debt I
[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:24.420]   have is a stupid 401(k) loan that I took out two summers ago to complete a basement renovation.
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:28.500]   The balance on the 401(k) loan is $10,000, which is the only debt I have outside of my
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:35.460]   mortgage. I have a solid emergency fund, contribute 10% to my 401(k), max out a Roth IRA, and
[00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.840]   have a brokerage account for individual stock and index fund investing. My question is,
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:44.340]   should I invest the $12,000 cash I currently have or pay off my 401(k) loan?"
[00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:48.260]   First of all, six bedrooms. How much would a six-bedroom place be in New York, Duncan?
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:49.900]   About $13 million?
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.020]   Probably.
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:57.860]   Personally, you could not pay me to live with five unknown roommates in a house, but if
[00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.100]   you're willing to do that, that's not a bad way to build equity and some cash flow. So,
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.340]   nicely done. I give you credit for that, even though I personally would not be able to do
[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:10.580]   it. I guess I do have three little roommates and my wife, so I'm close.
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.980]   Retirement plan sounds good to me, too. I have my one rule of thumb. I wrote about it
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:17.380]   in my retirement book. The only thing I care about, I want people to have for their goal,
[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:22.220]   double-digit savings rate percentage of your income. Double-digit, that's the goal. And
[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:27.860]   this person says they do 10% of their 401(k) plus their Roth IRA. So, I think if you calculate
[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:31.980]   it out, if my math is right here, we're talking like an 18% to 20% savings rate for this person,
[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:35.060]   and that's not even getting into what they put into their taxable account. So, kudos
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:39.300]   on the retirement plan. Right? I really like this. This is good. I sign off on that.
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:43.100]   Listen, the 401(k) loan, we've all made stupid decisions in the past. There's nothing wrong
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:47.280]   with that. And a 401(k) loan is not the end of the world. We talked about this with Taylor
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:51.220]   Hollis a couple weeks ago on this show. 401(k) loans, like, the biggest risk is your job
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.300]   safety. If you lose your job, then you don't want to hold that loan and have to get in
[00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.380]   a situation where you have to pay it off really quickly. But the fact that you have the cash
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:01.900]   right now, I think this one is fairly easy. So, you gave us two options. I want to put
[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:05.260]   the money to work in the markets or I want to pay off the 401(k) loan. Why don't we do
[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:11.420]   both? Okay? So, borrowing from your 401(k) enacts an opportunity cost where you're missing
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:17.420]   out on those gains from what you're borrowing from. Right? So, you could do some tax stuff
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:21.340]   on the spreadsheet and probably calculate it down to the last penny. But you have the
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.740]   money and you already have realized you're kicking yourself because it's a mistake and
[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.660]   you didn't want to do it, even though, you know, whatever, you made your basement renovations
[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:32.100]   and probably helped out your tenants a little bit. You pay it off and you're not only paying
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.380]   yourself back the interest on the loan, but now those investments can be put to work again
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:39.580]   and you're right back in the market. Right? This is one of those, I think, don't overthink
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.460]   it. Don't try to calculate it down to the last penny and what my hurdle rate's going
[00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:46.140]   to be. This is a win-win. You pay off your 401(k) loan and now you get to start growing
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:50.900]   your retirement savings for that amount again. Do it. You have the money, you have the cash.
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:55.220]   Pay it off. You're putting money to work back in your tax-deferred retirement account. Let's
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:13:02.580]   do it. Right? That's easy. Yeah. That makes sense to me. All right. And so just to elaborate
[00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:09.380]   a little bit, the reason that a 401(k) loan is, in general, a bad idea is, what did you
[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:13.340]   mean by if you lose your job, you have to pay it off right away or something? If you
[00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:16.300]   lose your job, you have to pay it off right away, yeah, because you're not part of that
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:19.860]   work, your retirement plan anymore. So you technically have to pay it off right away.
[00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:23.140]   So there's some risks there, especially if, you know, the economy is slowing down and,
[00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:27.700]   you know, it depends on how safe your job is. But, yeah. By the way, that person with
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:31.740]   a six-bedroom house had to be in the Midwest, right? This is a flyover state person. Yeah.
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:35.420]   I mean, yeah. When I read that, I had to do a double-take. And I was thinking the same
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:39.780]   thing as you. Like, man, you don't even have a majority in your own house then, right?
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:45.100]   They can, like, you know, vote you out, essentially, on decisions in the house, right? I mean,
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:50.340]   yeah. Yeah. Hopefully it's not a Dow because that person's out of luck. All right. Let's
[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:56.540]   do the next one. Okay. Up next, we have a question from William, who writes, and this
[00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:01.220]   is one I think a lot of people can probably relate to in the world, over the last year.
[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:05.580]   I'm a millennial who got lucky in 2021 and realized large gains that I paid taxes on
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:11.900]   back in April. I used leverage, and it bit me in 2022. I'm down $200,000 a year today,
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:18.020]   and I have $50,000 left. It doesn't seem reasonable for me to take a $3,000 capital loss deduction
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:23.380]   in a year, so I feel like I need to continue to bet until I make it back. What are your
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:28.180]   thoughts? This is giving me flashbacks to my FanDuel account, before I basically ran
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.460]   it down to zero. You know, I kept trying to make it back.
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:34.180]   Well, talking about betting until you make it back, that's my first problem with this
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:37.940]   question, is that I don't want people to look at the stock market investing as betting,
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:41.380]   right? There's a difference between speculating and investing. And I think if you look at
[00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:44.980]   it from a speculation standpoint, you're probably not going to come out ahead. Because if you
[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:49.060]   look at that high number, your high watermark in 2021 or whenever it was, and you say, "I'm
[00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.480]   going to get back to that, and I'm going to do whatever I can," just because you want
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.980]   to get back to that level and you decide, "I'm going to take a lot of risk to get there,"
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:59.500]   doesn't necessarily mean it's going to happen, right? These returns aren't promised to you
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:04.140]   just because you want or need them. So, I think maybe take a step back first and reassess
[00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:08.780]   your plan, because using leverage sounds great. There's all these academic studies that say,
[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.980]   "Young people probably should use leverage for their retirement because they have so
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:15.540]   much human capital and time ahead of them in savings." But, I don't know, 0.5% of the
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:20.660]   population could maybe handle that as a strategy. So, that's what I want to talk about first.
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:26.140]   But for the tax side of things, we'll bring in an expert here. Bill Sweet. Probably our
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:27.340]   most recurring guest here.
[00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:31.700]   Bill, I just want to say, I quoted you to my wife this week.
[00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:32.700]   Wow.
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:36.540]   Okay? So, we recently had talked about, we sold an investment property. You helped me
[00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.980]   figure out what the capital gains taxes were going to be on that. I shared that amount
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:45.240]   with my wife. She was taken aback by the fact that we were going to have to hand over such
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:50.340]   a large amount to Uncle Sam. What do you always say about paying capital gains taxes? It means
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:54.140]   you won, right? Isn't that what you tell people? It stinks, but it means you won.
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:59.380]   Yeah. People hate paying taxes more than they like making money. That's my general observation
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:04.140]   here. I guess first off, really strong name from William. Really the best name if you
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:08.820]   sit down and think about it. Get out of here with these Liamson bills. That's very strong.
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:13.740]   His question was, is the $3,000 capital gains limit against ordinary income reasonable?
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:19.200]   I mean, no, it doesn't seem reasonable. Just like me, that's a relic of the 1970s. That's
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:24.580]   been set since 1978. Ben experienced inflation when he sold his property and had to write
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:29.480]   that tax check, which that was the subject of many tears last week. But the price of
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:34.260]   gasoline was 65 cents in 1978, and that hasn't been adjusted. Adjusted for inflation would
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:39.660]   be $16,000 today. But what I want to highlight, Ben, is exactly the point that you made. William
[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:44.780]   is letting a tax benefit, a minor one at that, drive his decision to potentially invest for
[00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:48.860]   the short term in a way that I would agree, he phrased as gambling. But secondly, with
[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:54.500]   leverage, which only exacerbates the ups and the downs, which he just experienced. He's
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:59.140]   down $200,000 here to date. I don't think it makes any sense. You cannot control the
[00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:04.180]   $3,000 capital gains limit. Any amounts that you don't use in 2022 will be carried forward
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:09.220]   indefinitely. God bless you. I hope you have some capital gains at some point in the future.
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:14.140]   I would focus on what you can control here. Don't let the tax tail wax the tax dog. Be
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:18.220]   like Ben. Love paying taxes, just like you like making money.
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:23.280]   Lewis: The other thing is, let's say he looked out and had some -- let's say in another world,
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:26.660]   he's the one who sold the investment property. I'm not trying to rub it in his face or that
[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:31.580]   I did this. So, let's say he had some gains. If he takes these losses, he could use them
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:35.260]   to offset some of that gain, if he had gains elsewhere. He could use some of those losses
[00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:36.340]   to net out, correct?
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:40.380]   Brokamp: Yep. And there's that Midwest bias, just looking down on us, on us humble people
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:45.100]   who can't time the market. But yes, you're exactly right. I couldn't have phrased it
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.100]   better. Exactly.
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.300]   Lewis: All right. Let's do another one, Duncan.
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:53.460]   O'Reilly: Okay. By the way, Bill, people like your backyard setup there.
[00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:58.140]   Brokamp: Ah! It's hotter than a blowtorch out here. You see the sun baking down on me?
[00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:02.740]   I refuse to drive into New York City until $5 gasoline is a thing of the past. So, let's
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:04.180]   get working on that.
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:09.620]   Lewis: Okay. Up next, we have a question from Jack. "I'm hoping you can explain the difference
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:13.580]   between a robo-advisor and automated monthly purchases of something like a target date
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:19.180]   fund. I'm 30 years old, and the sample portfolios for robo-advisors don't seem very different
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:24.140]   than the holdings of a target date fund. I see tax-loss harvesting and automated rebalancing
[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:29.260]   listed as benefits of a robo, but doesn't the target date fund also rebalance? And if
[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:34.020]   I'm selling losing investments to offset capital gains whenever I realize them in the future,
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.660]   doesn't that handle the tax-loss harvesting?"
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.660]   Brokamp, this is a good question.
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:40.420]   Lewis: Yeah, it is. I'm a noted target date fund guy.
[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.340]   Brokamp: Yeah, I figured you lit up when you heard this.
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:46.580]   Lewis: Well, you said your first purchase was a Microsoft shares. My first purchase
[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:50.620]   ever was a target date fund. I think a 20 to 55 fund. My dad helped me set up my first
[00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:56.900]   IRA out of school. I think setting up target date funds as a default option for corporate
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.180]   retirement plans was one of the best innovations we've seen in retirement for the past two
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:04.380]   to three decades. The fact that people are easily able to do it with one fund in a simple
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.940]   diversified manner and not have to make those choices themselves, I think it's huge.
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:12.780]   Now, there is a little more customization you can get in a robo-advisor. As a shameless
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:16.260]   plug here, if you use our Liftoff service, we use Betterment, but we also have advisors
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.220]   you can talk to, so that's a little bolt-on there. You can actually talk to someone, and
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.380]   maybe that's a little help. But, Bill, what are the pros and cons from a tax perspective
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:27.900]   of having this one-stop retirement fund in a target date fund versus having 8 to 10 funds
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.540]   in a robo-advisor?
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:33.140]   Lewis: Yeah, I really like this question. It's in the weeds. It's nuanced. It's kind
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:37.900]   of nasty. I like to get down here and talk about this stuff. The first thing, a target
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.820]   date fund, you get low cost, broad exposure. You can choose a fund to match your timeline.
[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:46.900]   For Ben, that's 2055. If I'm retiring next year, it might be 2023, 2025. That's great.
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:52.020]   That's awesome. A robo-advisor allows you, in contrast, to custom. You get the same low
[00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:56.260]   cost, broad exposure. You're probably going to pay a little bit more in fees, but you
[00:19:56.260 --> 00:20:01.340]   can customize a strategy to match your timeline. The key difference from a tax standpoint,
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:05.340]   which is why you guys call me here, that's why I keep coming on this show, is what happens
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:10.460]   when you have gains or losses. When there's a gain or loss in a target date fund, the
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:14.220]   fund realizes that gain or loss, with an exception I'm going to talk about in a second. When
[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:18.380]   that happens in a robo-advisor account, that gain or loss gets realized on you, on your
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:23.020]   personal balance sheet. For a 401k, there's no difference. Everything just gets deferred.
[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:27.380]   Let's just focus on non-qualified accounts. The key difference is the tax effects you
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:31.020]   get. You get in the present with a robo. For a target date fund, you get to push them out
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:35.900]   in the future. The other key thing, in addition to this internal/external difference between
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:41.340]   where the gains get realized or losses, is that a target date fund does need to distribute
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:45.220]   gains, but they usually do it at the end of the year. Ben, Duncan, have you seen those
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:49.180]   notorious capital gains distributions that happen towards the end of the year? Vanguard
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:53.440]   has a lot of them last year, really nasty due to some things that they did internally
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:57.140]   in the company, some decisions they made. With a robo-advisor, that's all happening
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:02.020]   in the current year. With a TDF, it's happening once a year when you see that gain. That's
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:06.100]   the key difference. You don't have a lot of control over what happens with that target
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:11.060]   date fund. It's much more about when the other investors in that fund decide to move or get
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:14.420]   out. That's what nuked a lot of Vanguard investors last year.
[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:19.540]   Lewis: Then, obviously, with a robo-advisor, some of that tax-loss harvesting can hopefully
[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:22.940]   offset some of those gains if you have some, and dividends and that sort of thing, right?
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:27.220]   Rubin: Precisely. Yeah. I think they accomplish the same thing, but the path that they take
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:32.300]   is a little bit different. If you have other active trading activity, the tax-loss harvesting
[00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:38.020]   feature of robo-advisor is very, very attractive. I would look at that if you have some other
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:42.260]   activity going on elsewhere in your portfolio. But if you're looking for simple, set it,
[00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:47.300]   forget it, the fee difference is real and meaningful. A target date fund offers a lot
[00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:51.580]   of great solutions. But I think for a non-qualified account, if all we're looking at is taxes,
[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:55.660]   I would look at the robo assuming everything else is equal. Then, Ben, I'm a company man
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:22:00.380]   just like you. With Liftoff, you get to talk to an advisor at least once a year. I think
[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:03.580]   there's an advantage there that you're probably not going to get choosing a TDF.
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:09.300]   This is how you know we're in a bear market. We're debating target date funds and robo-advisors.
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:12.180]   No one cares about this stuff in a bull market. In a bear market, "Oh, I'm going to lean on
[00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:14.060]   my target date fund a little bit," right?
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:19.900]   Yeah. One other thing I was going to add that I thought was cool with robo-accounts, I have
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.180]   a Liftoff for Aubrey that I've looked at.
[00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:24.500]   Duncan, a company man. I love it.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:28.420]   Yeah, exactly. It shows you, you link all your other outside accounts and stuff. Just
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.980]   the organization like that can be nice for some people, just being able to see all of
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:35.260]   your accounts and have everything linked together in one place is kind of a nice thing.
[00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:40.340]   They have a better user experience, for sure. I'd say a place like Spiderman or Wealthhunt.
[00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:44.940]   That's kind of a nice thing about it. One other question on that, Bill, that is important,
[00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:48.980]   to make sure that you're not doing something that messes up your tax-loss harvesting, right?
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:53.060]   You want to make sure it's all kind of integrated so you're not selling something in one account
[00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:56.620]   and buying in another account and ruining your tax advantage.
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:01.540]   That's exactly it, Duncan. The better robo-platforms, they allow you to do that. If you happen to
[00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:05.180]   have a stock, let's say Duncan's got his big Microsoft gains he's walking around town
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:09.300]   with in New York City this week, what you wouldn't want to do is sell Microsoft at a
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.660]   loss somewhere else, right? Because that loss is going to get stopped on a gain somewhere
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:17.940]   else. That coordination is very, very important. I would agree with that premise, Duncan, that
[00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:21.940]   the technology that you're going to get from a typical robo-advisor is going to be better.
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.940]   If you live your life on your phone, that's a great thing to look at.
[00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:32.940]   Last but not least, we have a question from Matt. "I'm 35 years old and married with
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:38.760]   two kids. We have a decent amount saved in pre-tax 401ks, approximately $400,000 between
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:46.540]   my wife's account and mine. We file MFS due to student loans. I'm in the 24% tax bracket
[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:51.900]   and my wife is in the 32% bracket. What are your thoughts on converting these to Roths
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:55.900]   during this market downturn?" Also, what is MFS?
[00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.900]   I actually know what this means. Married Filing Separately, right, Bill?
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:23:59.900]   True. Yep.
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:02.540]   We've got another academic for you, Duncan.
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:06.340]   I got in a giant fight with my wife this weekend. That's the first step to divorce when you
[00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:11.540]   put that on your tax form, actually. An attorney calls you a week later.
[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:15.740]   So before we get into this Roth conversion, which I know you're a big Roth guy, what are
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:19.140]   the best reasons for filing this way in the first place? Because I've always heard getting
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:22.700]   married, the whole thing about it is having tax breaks and filing together. What would
[00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.900]   be the reason for filing separately when you're married?
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.580]   Yeah, I think he gets at it. There's something weird going on here that I do want to comment
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:35.140]   on at the end. He's getting at the tax differential. If he's at 32, his wife's at 24, potentially
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:40.100]   they could pay a lower overall income tax with the two separate returns versus adding
[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.980]   them together on the joint side, where I'm guessing --
[00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:43.500]   Oh, maybe doing a weighted average or something?
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:47.260]   Yep, more of your income is going to be subject to the higher rate. That's one big reason.
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.720]   Another reason might be healthcare, health insurance. Another reason, which somewhat
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:55.060]   times is common, is if one spouse has a debt or something like that. Let's say somebody's
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.340]   chasing them on a credit line. You wouldn't want to file a joint return. A joint return
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:02.400]   can never be separate. Once you file jointly, if me and Duncan get married, which has been
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:06.860]   discussed in the past, and we file a joint return, we cannot undo that in the future.
[00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:11.180]   Meanwhile, two married filing separate returns can be combined if there's reasons to do so.
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:12.780]   Credit is the other common reason.
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:18.580]   Okay. Yeah, I'd never heard that before. I know you're a big Roth guy. Is it true that
[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:23.980]   -- I never realized this -- the Senator who the Roth IRA is named after is Senator William
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:25.340]   Roth? Is that your namesake?
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:32.180]   Very, very strong name. I'm afraid not. No, I'm named after my dad. Also, William the
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:36.340]   Conqueror, 1066. Very strong gentleman. I don't know if you've ever heard of him.
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:40.780]   Alright, so does the fact that the market's in a downturn make more or less sense to do
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:43.220]   a Roth conversion, or should that never come into play?
[00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:47.180]   No. I mean, what's the back tattoo, Ben? What's the back tattoo right here? The very first
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.220]   show I was on, I think it was the very first Portfolio Rescue, you were like, "Take your
[00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:51.500]   shirt off. The people have to see the tattoo."
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:52.500]   Roth for life.
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:57.540]   It's a Roth IRA conversion. Yeah, the listeners got it spot on. Everything's on sale this
[00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:02.460]   year. If you do a Roth conversion, you're going to pay 20% less in income tax than you
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:06.340]   would have if you'd done it in December of 2021, depending on your allocation. There's
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:10.380]   no reason if you're a long-term investor not to do that. If you have the cash to pay it,
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:13.740]   not from the IRA or 401(k) itself, the money's got to come from somewhere else for it to
[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:18.220]   make sense. But absolutely, because then when the market rebounds, and it will this year,
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:21.900]   next year, five years, 10 years from now, when the market continues to compound at 7%,
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:26.300]   8% a year as it has forever, you will get the benefit of that tax free. So I think it's
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.300]   a great opportunity.
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:31.440]   Yeah, that makes sense. You're paying less in taxes because the market is down.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:35.180]   Yep, exactly. Can we go back to the MFS thing really quickly? Because there is something
[00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:39.980]   funky going on here. At that tax rate, given the amount of kids, like the child tax credit
[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:45.140]   last year was like $3,600 for a child under five. And when you file marriage filing separate,
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:50.080]   you're not allowed to claim that credit. At that tax range, if they were at the 37% bracket,
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:54.140]   they wouldn't qualify for that. I would take a look at that, listener. I might email you
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:57.900]   after this show to be like, "Hey, let's take a look at this, bro." Because one of the things
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:58.900]   you might be missing out-
[00:26:58.900 --> 00:26:59.900]   So they should be filing together.
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.380]   Yeah, on like $10,000 of tax credits that weren't available. So you might be winning
[00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:08.740]   the tax bracket game. But if you're losing out on $3,600 of tax credits per kid, that
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:12.360]   seems like a big, big problem. But I might talk with your tax professional. There might
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:12.860]   be other things going on.
[00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:16.020]   I mean, that's the one reason I had three kids, so we can get all those tax breaks.
[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:16.980]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.420]   Because they're not expensive otherwise.
[00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:20.820]   I think that's why most people have kids, right?
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:25.740]   Yeah, $5 gasoline isn't what's pushed me outside. It's the romper room going on downstairs because
[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:31.260]   it's July, and they're both running roughshod all over the house, breaking all of my stuff.
[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:33.060]   Alright, turn on a sprinkler, they'll be fine.
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:34.700]   I love my kids.

[00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:57.420]   consultant, so I just wanted to share him with the world.
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:03.380]   I think our most common guest, right? I think he's been on now like five shows or something.
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:04.380]   Let's keep it that way.
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:07.580]   Yeah, it's like Steve Martin and Tom Hanks on SNL. He's our Steve Martin.
