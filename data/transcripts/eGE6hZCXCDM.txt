[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.340]   - Pastor John recently led a Q&A session
[00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.300]   with the students of Westminster Seminary in Philadelphia.
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.380]   Here's a question from one of the students.
[00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.020]   - Pastor John, I just wanna say that it's an honor
[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.980]   to speak with you today and thank you
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.820]   for your lecture earlier.
[00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.940]   I'm a product of the New Calvinism movement,
[00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.180]   but I wanted to ask you more of a Pastor John
[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.660]   type of question.
[00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.380]   As an MDiv student and with the training,
[00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.940]   the exceptional training that I'm getting here at WTS,
[00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.020]   I struggle when I listen to sermons.
[00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.660]   I take out that MDiv red pen.
[00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.980]   And it's not that I'm looking for any sort of error,
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.260]   but it's like, I don't know,
[00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.920]   did you faithfully preach that text?
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.380]   I find that as a temptation for me.
[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.460]   I don't think I'm the only one,
[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.260]   but how do I control that?
[00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.380]   I'm naturally a Berean, but I think sometimes
[00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.980]   I'm like a Berean on steroids.
[00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.660]   So I just wanna see how can I control this?
[00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.020]   I don't wanna be overly critical,
[00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.740]   but I think it's important to discern
[00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.780]   what I'm hearing too.
[00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.900]   - That's a good question.
[00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.580]   I mean, I'm 68 and I tend that way.
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.020]   I mean, I listen that way to sermons.
[00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.300]   So I have to preach to myself.
[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.860]   Here's my answer for me.
[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.180]   And it is only an answer by grace at any given moment.
[00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.860]   That is the answer works at any given moment
[00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.100]   because of grace arriving at that moment.
[00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.300]   So a theoretical answer to your question right now
[00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.060]   may have no effect on you whatsoever
[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.900]   because grace is applying it at that moment.
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.400]   So get that difference?
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.660]   Having answers here and having it work
[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.860]   in the moment of being excessively critical
[00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.020]   aren't the same thing.
[00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.460]   But it helps to have answers
[00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.220]   because the Holy Spirit then uses
[00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.640]   right theological thinking.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.380]   So my answer is, number one,
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.660]   it is a good thing to be discerning
[00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.100]   and to test all things and to hold fast what is good.
[00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.300]   You cannot not assess preaching.
[00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.980]   All right?
[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.460]   To be indifferent to error in preaching
[00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.460]   is to be a bad listener.
[00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.900]   To be indifferent to sloppiness in preaching
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.260]   is to be a bad listener.
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.460]   To be indifferent to lousy exegesis with true points,
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.220]   true points, false texts, is to be a bad listener.
[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.780]   So all that, I'm just affirming that.
[00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.540]   So I'm affirming that you have that bent
[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.500]   and seminary gives you that bent,
[00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.820]   or if you have it already, it makes it worse.
[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.660]   (audience laughs)
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.500]   Or better.
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.320]   - That's my problem.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.180]   - I don't know how you look at it.
[00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.700]   However, now that we've said that,
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.800]   can we benefit from imperfect sermons?
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.980]   Not if you're proud.
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.140]   Not if you're so consumed with needing
[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.420]   to show him he's wrong,
[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.620]   or even needing to whisper it to the person,
[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.540]   did you hear what he said?
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.540]   There's this impulse in you to identify the error
[00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.340]   and talk about the error
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.620]   and make sure everybody knows you saw the error.
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.640]   All that's pride.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.680]   That's pride.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.300]   What can replace it is,
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.300]   I am a broken, imperfect, corrupt, proud,
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.020]   marriage embattled, imperfect dad
[00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.660]   who needs God to talk to me
[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.740]   through any ass he wants.
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.380]   That's a biblical illusion.
[00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.220]   (audience laughs)
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.140]   Balaam's ass.
[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:39.060]   I need this animal to talk to me.
[00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.520]   And if an animal can talk to me,
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.740]   so can this God creature.
[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.260]   I think, in other words,
[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.740]   my sense of need and imperfection
[00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.900]   can override his imperfection.
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.260]   So that Jay Packer said,
[00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.380]   I asked him one time,
[00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.620]   how can you be so gracious to so many Arminian types?
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.020]   (audience laughs)
[00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.500]   And he said, I'm always looking for the needle
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.100]   in a haystack of error.
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.900]   In fact, he says in his book,
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.000]   "Keep in Step with the Spirit,"
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.340]   God loves to honor the needle of truth
[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.740]   in a haystack of error.
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.100]   Now, if that's true,
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.900]   and I think it probably is,
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.100]   then we can do that in a listening to a sermon.
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.100]   So it comes down to whether I am a broken-hearted,
[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.260]   humble person, aware of my need,
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.100]   aware of my sin, aware of my imperfection,
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.100]   so that I lay down the brazen, proud need
[00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.820]   to be known as a good listener who is so critical
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.700]   and can just listen for the truth.
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.580]   Let the fact that he always does this
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.540]   or always does this,
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.460]   or just ask the Lord to give you the grace
[00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.340]   to look right through the strange ticks
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.300]   and the incomplete grammar
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.180]   and the inadequate exegesis.
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.540]   The man probably has 10 true things to say this morning.
[00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.140]   Get 'em.
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.980]   And then ask the Lord to apply 'em like crazy
[00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.020]   in your needy life.
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.660]   Thank you.
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.900]   - That was Pastor John leading a Q&A session recently
[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.460]   at Westminster Seminary.
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.820]   And related to this topic is the essential point
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.500]   of understanding what's actually happening
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.720]   during the live experience
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.500]   as your pastor preaches the word.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.620]   Pastor John described this as, quote,
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.620]   "A supernatural encounter with the living God
[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.560]   "as the preacher worships over the word
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.300]   "and draws the people into an experience of God Almighty
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.180]   "through his proclamation," end quote.
[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.580]   He said that in episode number 118 in this podcast series
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.260]   and a podcast titled, "Is the 40-Minute Sermon PassÃ©?"
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.260]   That episode can be found
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.020]   in the Ask Pastor John podcast archive,
[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.780]   which is most easily found in the free iPhone and iPad app.
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.300]   Again, that's episode number 118.
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.020]   Tomorrow we return to talk about one bold way
[00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.900]   churches can intentionally pursue ethnic diversity.
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:04.740]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.860]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:21.020]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
