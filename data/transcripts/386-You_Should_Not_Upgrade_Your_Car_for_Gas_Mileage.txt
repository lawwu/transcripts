[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   I'm the youngest of my parents' seven children.
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.380]   If you ever have seven children in your family, you'll start to see that there are certain
[00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:16.240]   expenses and costs that many other families with fewer children don't get to enjoy.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.800]   Those costs would range from the cost of going out to eat.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.320]   Just about any restaurant visit automatically turns into a $100 meal if you have seven kids
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.620]   and you're trying to go out to eat.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.400]   One of the costs is transportation because you need to want a vehicle big enough to carry
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.400]   your family around.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.720]   If you have three, four, five kids, there are lots of options.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.560]   But when you get to seven, all of a sudden now you have nine people total that you've
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.800]   got to cart around.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.560]   And that requires a larger vehicle.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.320]   When I was growing up, all during my younger years, my parents had a 1985 Chevy 12-passenger
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.320]   van.
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.760]   We used that van for many, many years, drove it all over the United States, had a lot of
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.920]   great memories in that van.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.840]   My dad fixed it up and it was repainted a couple times and just was a great vehicle
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.960]   for us.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.740]   But sometime probably about the late '90s, we needed to upgrade.
[00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.140]   And so my parents were looking around and trying to figure out if they could switch
[00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.660]   to a different kind of vehicle.
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.660]   They were shopping.
[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.440]   They knew they probably needed a van.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.760]   At one point, I have a clear, vivid memory of going and looking at the Chevy Astro.
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.340]   The Chevy Astro had three rows, but at that point in time, they put me in the backseat
[00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.740]   and I probably wasn't as big then as I am now, but I'm about 6'5", 6'6" and I'm not
[00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.100]   skinny.
[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.460]   And they put me in the backseat and realized they needed something a little bit bigger.
[00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:43.900]   So after a while, they found a 1995 Chevy conversion van and bought that.
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.100]   I found it used and bought that.
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.140]   And we had a lot of great memories in that vehicle as well.
[00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.600]   It was very, very useful, very, very comfortable.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.420]   It was a great car.
[00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.580]   One of the problems though of driving a full-size van is it's not the most fuel-efficient vehicle.
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.900]   Well, my parents kept that vehicle for many years.
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.420]   And when I was in college, most of the needs of being able to carry the whole family together
[00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.980]   had been eliminated simply due to kids growing up, getting married, starting their own families.
[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.820]   And my dad just got kind of tired of this big van that he was driving to work every
[00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.820]   day.
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.860]   We lived out west of town, about 20 miles, and he would drive this thing in and out,
[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.860]   in and out, in and out.
[00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.340]   And looking at the gas tank, I mean, to fill the thing up is 80 bucks.
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.700]   And it gets hard to do that.
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.780]   So he was thinking, "Well, it might be time to get something a little bit more fuel-efficient
[00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.060]   for his commute."
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.340]   He was also getting tired of putting money into it and fixing a few things.
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.500]   And so he was talking to me about whether he should switch to a different car.
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.940]   Well, I didn't know the answer.
[00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:52.400]   So I sat down and built a calculator in Excel to try to figure out the answer.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:01.540]   And the results of that challenge that I had set for myself really, really shocked me.
[00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:08.060]   Because what I learned was that even though he was driving one of the worst vehicles in
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:18.580]   terms of fuel mileage, even so, and even though he was driving a lot, it still didn't make
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:30.660]   a lot of financial sense for him to move up to a newer car based solely on gas mileage
[00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.500]   improvements.
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.900]   Since that time, I've done this calculation many times.
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.540]   I sent my calculator out to all my friends and would email it out.
[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.220]   And anytime somebody was thinking about buying another car and they're trying to justify
[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.060]   it based upon gas mileage, I would send them my calculator, let them do the numbers.
[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.020]   And there are times at which this makes sense.
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.700]   And I'll go over those in today's show.
[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.940]   The answer, of course, is you need to calculate your own numbers, which is why in the show
[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.900]   notes for today's show, in the blog post, you'll just see a link right to it, which
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.900]   is to the Excel file.
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.660]   I haven't touched this thing since 2000.
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.300]   I think I built it in about 2008.
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.420]   But you can download it and run the numbers for your own situation.
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.780]   But today I'm going to run you through some numbers and give you some examples.
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.660]   Because I want you to get this very, very clearly in your head.
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:27.440]   Gas mileage matters, but it may not be the most important thing for you to focus on such
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.620]   that you sell your older car that's functional to buy a newer one because of gas mileage.
[00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.760]   Now let's start with the real numbers for my dad's vehicle.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.740]   And I'm going to punch these into my calculator.
[00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.140]   If you'd like to do them yourself, again, the Excel file is linked in the blog post
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.780]   or show notes for today's show.
[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.980]   You can pull it up.
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.020]   What you do is you just edit the cells in yellow and all this does is calculate what
[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.460]   the actual cost is.
[00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.540]   And this is a very, very simple calculation.
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.700]   I'll explain it as we do it.
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.940]   So the first thing we enter in is what the current MPGs are of that vehicle.
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:07.840]   Well, that big old Chevy van with a thirsty 350 V8 got about 14 miles per gallon.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.460]   We drove it smoothly enough.
[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.620]   Most of the highway miles were ... Most of the miles that we drove on it were highway
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.620]   miles.
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.780]   So my dad was looking at a car, just an average sedan.
[00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.900]   He actually wound up later on getting a Buick sedan.
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.860]   So that's what I'm going to use as my proxy here.
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:29.100]   And that Buick sedan was a perfectly functional, normal, mid-level consumer sedan that got
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.980]   probably about 23 or 24 miles per gallon.
[00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:37.660]   So I'm going to use 24 miles per gallon as my calculation.
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.840]   Now in my calculator, you have to put in the cost per gallon of gas.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.180]   And so for the sake of our analysis, let's leave it at just about what it is today right
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.540]   now, about $2.30 across the country.
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.420]   So we'll just plug in $2.30 worth of gas.
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:02.020]   Now the next two numbers that you've got to calculate is what is the current price that
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.660]   you're going to sell your car for?
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.660]   And you need to figure this out.
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.860]   Well, if you're going to sell your current car, as I remember that that van was worth
[00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:18.140]   about $2,500 at the time that he was looking to sell it, you want to put that number in
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.260]   as how much are you going to sell your current car for, and how much will you pay for your
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.600]   new car?
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:30.080]   And my dad, I think, was looking at cars that were going to be about $7,500.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.640]   Now I also want to make sure that you calculate what are some of the additional expenses or
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.680]   some of the additional savings that you're going to have.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.160]   We'll come back to that in a moment after I give you this example.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.200]   And then how many miles you drive every month.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:49.440]   And in this case, the miles that he would drive every month were about 1,000.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.440]   So we'll keep it at 1,000.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:07:01.760]   Well when you run the numbers on that, you wind up with 73 months, 73 months before you
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:11.800]   would finally make up the cost of the purchase of the newer car.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.080]   If that number doesn't shock you, it's simply because you're a human calculator and you've
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.320]   never worked with people.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.520]   Because when I've interacted with people, usually they say, "Oh, about a year or two
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.680]   I'll break even."
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:35.920]   Six years just to break even on a very, very sensible vehicle change.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:43.680]   Remember, I'm talking about moving from a $2,500 car up to a $7,500 car.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.760]   I'm not talking about going to a $30,000 new car.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:51.440]   Just moving up from a $2,500 car to a $7,500 car.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:59.000]   For somebody who drives 1,000 miles a month and gets a 10 mile per gallon improvement
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:07.200]   in their gas mileage from 14 miles per gallon to 24 miles per gallon.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:14.120]   And it takes six years to break even on the fuel cost.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:19.480]   I'm going to give you a couple other examples here just to drive this point home to you.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:26.120]   And then we'll talk about some of the factors that should influence your personal decision.
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.160]   So I'm going to give you two more scenarios.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.160]   Not real scenarios.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.160]   I'm just making these up.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.440]   I thought of friends that I knew and people that I am encountered with and I just thought
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.120]   this would be interesting.
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:41.120]   So scenario one is that you drive a 2,000, currently as I record this 2016, you drive
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:48.360]   a 2,000 Ford F-150, which gets you 16 miles per gallon of combined mileage according to
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.600]   fuel economy.gov.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.680]   And this vehicle is worth $1,500.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.320]   So that's the amount of money that you're going to sell it for.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.880]   Again, 2,000 Ford F-150, you get 16 miles per gallon.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.520]   It's worth $1,500.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:07.400]   And you're looking around and you're concerned about gas prices at $2.30 a gallon.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:12.800]   And you're looking around and by the way, I'm giving you this now.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.420]   Don't laugh at the $2.30 per gallon number.
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.920]   We were doing these numbers when they were up in the $3 and $4 numbers, but I'm doing
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.700]   it now because I want you to be thinking about gas mileage.
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.020]   We're going to keep today's numbers and then we'll show you all the variables that can
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.740]   affect your personal situation.
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.180]   Now back to the scenario.
[00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:34.900]   So 2,000 Ford F-150, get 16 miles per gallon according to fuel economy.gov.
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:39.320]   I just priced it on auto trader and I saw some of these listed that I think you could
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.940]   get these for about 1,500 bucks.
[00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.580]   So that's what you would sell it for.
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:46.400]   You're going to buy a 2016 Toyota Corolla.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:50.740]   So you're going to go and buy a new car, but it's a very sensible car, intelligent car
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:55.460]   choice, small, very fuel efficient, should have a very long lifespan.
[00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:59.880]   And I checked that out on trucar.com to see what the prices are in my area.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:05.420]   And I could get a 2016 Toyota Corolla for $21,510.
[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:09.040]   So that was what they said is the average price actually paid.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.100]   Doesn't include taxes, doesn't include title, but that's just the number that we're going
[00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:15.260]   to use, $21,510.
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:25.220]   Now that Toyota Corolla gets according to fuel economy.gov, 30 miles per gallon.
[00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:33.160]   So 30 miles per gallon, 2016, very reasonable situation and scenario here.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.540]   I think very reasonable.
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:40.260]   Now guess how long with no other savings or expenses every month to count in.
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:48.820]   Just exclusively based upon gas mileage, not depreciation, not any other expenses.
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:55.660]   How long do you think it takes to break even on that car purchase?
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:11:06.260]   The answer is 298 months, which comes out to 24.8 years.
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:13.420]   We'll round that to 25 years among friends.
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:21.980]   Going from an old 2004 F-150, 16 miles per gallon to a new 2016 Toyota Corolla takes
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:28.740]   25 years to break even based on gas mileage.
[00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:33.180]   You say, but I don't want to have a car that's that old and I don't want to buy a car that's
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:34.180]   not new.
[00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.940]   I planned out one other scenario to share with you.
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:44.460]   You're going to upgrade from an SUV, a 2006 Honda Pilot to a slightly newer but still
[00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:49.100]   used Prius that's very fuel efficient.
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:55.940]   So I pulled the numbers here from autotrader.com, a 2006 Honda Pilot would sell for about 5,000
[00:11:55.940 --> 00:12:01.380]   bucks and that currently, that car is rated for 18 miles per gallon according to fuel
[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.020]   economy.gov.
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:07.340]   So we're going to sell it for $5,000, 18 miles per gallon.
[00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:12.660]   Now your new miles per gallon that you get with a Toyota Prius, it's rated by fuel economy.gov
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:18.020]   to get you 48 miles per gallon, 48 miles per gallon.
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:23.980]   And you're going to pay $11,000 for it because it's in the used market.
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.340]   No additional savings, no additional expenses.
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:30.020]   And by the way, in all of these, I've kept constant that you're driving a thousand miles
[00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.820]   per month.
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.500]   Guess how many months to break even?
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:42.300]   Answer, 75 months.
[00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:52.660]   Seventy-five months to break even just based upon gas mileage.
[00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:56.860]   When I started running these scenarios using my calculator, I was stunned because there
[00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:02.220]   are other factors and other expenses and other things that you've got to consider as well.
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:06.220]   But I was stunned at how long it took to break even on gas.
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.460]   Now you say, "Well, what if gas is more expensive?"
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:12.860]   Because let's stick with this Honda Pilot to Toyota Prius example because this is the
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:13.940]   one where it's the closest.
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:18.460]   This is the most reasonable type of scenario where you should consider changing on gas
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:19.460]   mileage.
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:25.660]   2006 Honda Pilot worth five grand, upgrading just a few years, five years into a Prius
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:29.940]   and you go from 18 to 48 miles per gallon.
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.740]   You pick up 30 miles per gallon.
[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:37.260]   Let's just change that and let's just bump gas prices up to $3 a gallon and see what
[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.900]   the break even point is.
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:48.020]   Well, now it's 58 months, five years at $3 a gallon.
[00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:51.700]   At $4 a gallon, it's 43 months.
[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:56.420]   Just under four years.
[00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.460]   I'm not going to take it higher than $4 a gallon.
[00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.500]   Okay, let's double your mileage and here's where things matter.
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.420]   Let's take you up to 2,000 miles.
[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:18.180]   At $4 per gallon and 2,000 miles per month, it takes you 22 months to break even on that
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:26.700]   upgrade from a 2006 Pilot SUV to a 2011 Prius used.
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.380]   So what do we learn from this?
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.740]   A few things.
[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:40.860]   Gas cost and gas mileage is probably generally not your biggest expense and it will almost
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:50.860]   never make sense to upgrade your car in terms of cost exclusively based upon gas mileage.
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:59.540]   I emphasize again, it will almost never make sense to upgrade your car based on cost to
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:05.460]   a more expensive car exclusively based on gas mileage.
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:10.860]   The upgrade word is important because where can we save money?
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:19.340]   Well, first, if you could go from a similarly priced car to a similarly priced car that
[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:26.300]   gets better gas mileage, then you will experience some savings.
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.280]   So let's just do this.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:36.260]   Let's say that instead of going from a 2006 Pilot to a 2011 Prius, you went from a 2006
[00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:40.660]   Pilot to a 2006 Prius.
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:44.820]   Well here we start to get into cars that are worth about the same amount of money.
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:49.220]   Now you've got to look for the individual numbers for your deal in your area.
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:54.100]   I just again, am doing a web search for cars listed for sale and doing a quick average.
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:16:02.460]   But when I do that, I find that a 2006 Pilot would be worth about $5,000 and a 2006 Prius
[00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:06.540]   would be worth about $5,000 to $6,000.
[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:12.460]   Well in this situation here, if we drop this gas back to $2.30, you're going to pay, let's
[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:16.940]   just say you're going to pay $6,000 for your new car and you're going to sell your current
[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:23.940]   car for $5,000 and you drive 1,000 miles a month, 18 to 48 miles per gallon.
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:28.620]   Now all of a sudden at $2.30, you've got 13 months and you'll be in the clear.
[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:31.200]   You'll be in the black in 13 months.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:36.060]   And if we drop that to 5,500, you'd be there in six months.
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.700]   Maybe you can do an even swap.
[00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:45.420]   Well in this situation, if you drove 1,000 miles a month, you would wind up saving, switching
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:51.620]   from the Pilot of 2006 Pilot to the 2006 Prius, you would wind up saving about $80 per month
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.940]   in fuel.
[00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:56.500]   And that would add up pretty quickly.
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:02.000]   So if you want to change out your vehicle because you're concerned about gas mileage,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.880]   look for a vehicle that gets better gas mileage, but that's of a similar vintage to your current
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:12.380]   vehicle or that is cheaper than your current vehicle.
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:19.100]   Because when you look at that, you can definitely save money based on gas mileage.
[00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:20.100]   What else do you need to consider?
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:25.660]   Well, you've got to consider what you actually expect the cost of gas to be.
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.500]   And that's the reason why I'm doing the show right now.
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:30.460]   I know very few people who are complaining about the cost of gas.
[00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.740]   It's a little funny.
[00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.780]   There's a bumper sticker.
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:38.820]   It's a political bumper sticker, but it's funny.
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:41.180]   It says the cost of gas and has a picture of Barack Obama.
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:46.700]   It says the cost of gas when President Obama took office in January 2009 was, I think it
[00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.260]   was about $1.90 a gallon.
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:59.620]   And the idea here is that when gas was close to $4 a gallon, that was quite the damning
[00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.620]   political statement.
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:04.780]   Well, today with gas at $2.30, every time I see that bumper sticker, I just kind of
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.940]   chuckle and say, "Haven't you removed that yet?"
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:11.020]   That didn't really make a big argument for yourself.
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:15.600]   So $2.30, no one is complaining unless you work in the oil industry or unless you live
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.660]   on dividends from your oil shares.
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:22.660]   Then you're complaining about current gas prices being what they are.
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:30.460]   But if you expect gas prices to change in the future, then this can be something that
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.580]   you should pay attention to.
[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:39.140]   And you can use this calculator and you can use it to figure out what would be some significant
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:45.940]   changes that I can make in order to be prepared for changing gas prices.
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:53.220]   As an example, if I switch the cost of gallon per gas from $2.30 to $4 a gallon, now all
[00:18:53.220 --> 00:19:02.300]   of a sudden you're going to be saving $140 a month if you swap out your pilot for a Prius.
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.960]   And the time to do that is when prices are low.
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:10.480]   The time to shop for fuel-efficient cars is when the demand for them is low.
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.260]   Right now, the demand is low.
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.380]   People aren't thinking about that.
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:17.220]   People are very happily going out and buying bigger vehicles.
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:23.060]   They're not worried about it because at $2.30, it's easy to fill up the tank.
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.060]   That's not for you.
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.840]   You're smarter than that.
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:30.860]   So you should be shopping for your fuel-efficient vehicle now and my calculator can help you.
[00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:35.460]   One other fact, two other lines that are on my calculator that will make a big difference
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:36.460]   for you.
[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:38.780]   First is how many miles do you drive every month?
[00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:42.940]   If you drive a low number of miles per month, and this should be intuitive, but for many
[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:44.660]   people it's not.
[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:51.160]   If you only drive a few hundred miles a month, the actual MPGs of your vehicle is probably
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:58.020]   the least relevant number for you because you're only paying for gas when the vehicle's
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.860]   moving.
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:05.660]   If you have a full-size van or like me, I want my vehicle to have this big Dodge van
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.860]   RV.
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:13.320]   The thing gets about 15 miles per gallon, but I don't drive it all that much.
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.940]   It's not a commuting vehicle.
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:20.780]   So the cost of gas matters, but it doesn't matter all that much unless I'm on the road
[00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.460]   a ton, a ton, a ton, but it's an RV.
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.420]   They usually don't get driven all that much.
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:26.420]   So don't worry.
[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.260]   If you don't drive very much, don't worry about swapping out your vehicle because you're
[00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.180]   concerned about gas prices.
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:36.140]   The other number, however, on my calculator is one that you do need to pay attention to.
[00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.140]   And I have it listed here.
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:42.260]   It's called additional monthly expenses or savings from the change.
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:46.540]   And the idea is you want to make sure that when you're thinking about a purchase decision
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:50.980]   like a car, that you factor in all the costs.
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:56.380]   Now the way this process goes for most people is they run out and they start looking for
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:57.420]   cars.
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:02.820]   And unfortunately, they start by looking according to their budget.
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:07.700]   Then they start going to dealerships and looking at the newer cars because after all, I want
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:10.780]   to get an idea of what's out there and it's a lot easier to look at the newer cars at
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:11.780]   the dealership.
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:15.900]   Well, at the dealership, all of a sudden you find out how nice those newer cars are, how
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:21.760]   comfortable they are, how beautiful they are, and how inexpensive they are.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.300]   And so you start looking at the numbers and many people just calculate them based upon
[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:30.440]   the monthly number and they forget about the total cost of ownership.
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:33.300]   What you need to do is you need to calculate the actual number.
[00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:36.700]   If you're going to change from one car to another car, you need to calculate the cost
[00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:41.420]   of transferring the title, transferring the tag, paying the tax.
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:45.140]   In my state, we have a 6% sales tax.
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:48.620]   So if I were going to switch from one car to the next, I'm going to automatically incur
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:51.960]   a 6% sales tax from that.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:57.280]   You want to consider if there are any savings with insurance because this can help a lot.
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.740]   My calculator does make provision for that.
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:03.660]   You might drive an older vehicle that has a very high insurance cost, but you might
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:08.840]   be able to switch up to a newer vehicle that has a very low insurance cost.
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.620]   In that situation, you want to count that as savings.
[00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:19.140]   Or you want to factor in savings based upon you're not having to repair your older vehicle.
[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:27.180]   Older vehicles do tend to nickel and dime you on repairs and newer vehicles might have
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.240]   fewer repairs.
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:33.380]   Here you need to figure out, are we talking about actual repairs or are we talking about
[00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:34.780]   maintenance items?
[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:38.300]   All vehicles burn up batteries about once every two, three, four years.
[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:40.460]   All vehicles burn up tires.
[00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:43.700]   You got to replace your tires every five to six years, even if you're not putting a lot
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:46.020]   of miles on them just to keep them safe.
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:50.100]   So that six year, most people aren't going to run through an entire set of tires.
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:54.420]   You can buy a set of tires now at 90,000 with a 90 to 100,000 mile.
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:56.460]   I've seen them with 90,000 mile warranty.
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:00.020]   So figure 70 to 100,000 miles of useful lifespan.
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:04.460]   Most people are going to be replacing their tires, not because they're worn down, but
[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:08.180]   because they're old, which by the way, if you don't know that, you need to do that for
[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:10.700]   a safety consideration.
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:14.540]   Majority of significant, let me not say a majority because I don't know that to be the
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:22.720]   fact, a significant number of catastrophic blowouts of tires are caused due to the age
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.880]   of the tire, not due to another factor.
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:33.460]   So when your tires get to about five to six years old, you need to replace them proactively
[00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:37.060]   so that you don't wind up with a catastrophic blowout.
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:40.660]   Catastrophic blowout is the type of thing that you want to avoid.
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:44.780]   That's when it happens at 70 miles an hour and all of a sudden the tire shreds.
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:47.100]   You get a flat tire because you popped it with a nail.
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:48.100]   That's no big deal.
[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:49.660]   That's not a safety hazard.
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:51.780]   Catastrophic blowout on the interstate is a safety hazard.
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:56.180]   So replace your tires when you get them to about five to six years and don't take a chance
[00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:57.180]   on that.
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:58.420]   It's not worth it.
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:06.180]   Point of the tire issue though is all vehicles need tires.
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:07.860]   All vehicles need oil changes.
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:12.180]   So sometimes with an older vehicle, there aren't a lot of actual changes.
[00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:20.940]   I've had now a little 1998 Toyota Corolla that I bought for $500, a little more than
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:22.660]   a year ago.
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:28.180]   I have not repaired anything with it and I put 4,000 miles on it.
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:29.740]   There's not been a single problem.
[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:30.980]   I haven't had to repair anything.
[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:32.460]   The vehicle just works.
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:36.340]   It works largely due to its nature, meaning it's very, very simple.
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:37.340]   It's mechanically simple.
[00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:40.460]   I've got a manual transmission and roll up windows.
[00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:41.700]   I don't have anything.
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.300]   There's very few things on it that can break.
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:49.340]   Now, of course, things can break, but mechanically it's very simple.
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:54.020]   That's different than the TPMS, tire pressure monitoring system light on my other car that
[00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:58.740]   I can't seem to fix no matter how much money we throw at the thing because it's got more
[00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.940]   issues, more things to break.
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:06.340]   So do some actual true calculations for your situation.
[00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:09.180]   Figure out if there are additional monthly expenses.
[00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:12.700]   Do you have insurance costs that go up?
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.740]   Or if there are additional monthly savings, you need to factor those in.
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:20.340]   Obviously, of course, you also want to factor in the depreciation.
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:26.300]   Now my calculator does not factor in depreciation, but you need to do that mentally.
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:30.260]   What I mean is, and the reason it doesn't is because I built it real quick and I was
[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:33.620]   just trying to answer the question of fuel mileage.
[00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:40.340]   But remember that your car is going to be worth progressively less and less and less
[00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.620]   for each year that goes on.
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:45.380]   Now you can't always drive a 1922 vehicle.
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:51.460]   Of course, you've got to upgrade at some point in time, but that depreciation is a real cost.
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:57.540]   And if we were going to go back to my Toyota example, my Toyota Corolla example, let me
[00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:58.540]   run these numbers again.
[00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:02.860]   So we've got a 2000 Ford F-150, 16 miles per gallon.
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:05.820]   2016 Toyota Corolla gets 30 miles per gallon.
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:09.020]   Gas, let's put it at $2.50 now.
[00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:11.900]   We're going to pay $21,510 for it.
[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:17.300]   We could sell our current car for $1,500, drive a thousand miles a month.
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:24.220]   So in my situation here, under this example, what I find out is that the average, the current
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:31.420]   cost of fuel per mile is 16 cents per mile, just gas in that F-150.
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:35.900]   And the newer cost of fuel per mile to go up to the Toyota Corolla is 8 cents per mile
[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:38.260]   of gas.
[00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:40.100]   So I'm going to save some money in gas.
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:48.420]   I'm going to wind up saving a total of $73 per month of fuel.
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:57.940]   Now it's going to take me 412 months to break even on the fuel costs, but I'm saving $73.
[00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:02.500]   But now let's talk about depreciation on that $30,000 vehicle.
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:13.180]   $31,510 times 0.15 comes out to $4,726 of depreciation in the first year.
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:26.540]   Brought out monthly, divide that by 12, we wind up with $393 per month of depreciation,
[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:31.340]   meaning the car is just worth progressively less from sitting in my driveway and from
[00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:33.700]   driving me to work.
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:40.780]   That's $400 out the door gone before we even get to fuel savings.
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:44.940]   My calculator doesn't take this into account, but you need to take this into account.
[00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:49.700]   Now it won't always be $400 a month because in the future the car will be worth less and
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:50.700]   less.
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:53.940]   But let's say a couple of years from now it's now worth $15,000.
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:28:01.380]   Well a $15,000 car is losing $2,250 this year in depreciation costs.
[00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:06.560]   Divide that by 12, that's $187 gone.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:11.140]   Equal what I'm saving on fuel mileage savings.
[00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:16.360]   At that point in time, I guess the car would probably have to be what, $7,500.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:24.260]   So we'd have to get down to when the car is worth, in order to save money on fuel here,
[00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:30.440]   in order for the loss of depreciation to equal the loss of savings on fuel, we've got to
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:39.840]   get down to $5,000 times .15, 750 divided by 12, a little bit more.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:43.200]   Okay, $6,500 times .15 divided by 12.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.280]   Great, good enough.
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:57.160]   So when your 2016 Toyota Corolla is worth $6,500, now at this point in time you are
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:05.560]   finally going to only be losing $81.25 this month, every month this year, in depreciation
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:13.520]   costs where you're saving $73 per month of fuel.
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:16.920]   So you've got to drive, in that example, if you were going to think about trading in your
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:25.880]   2000 Ford F-150 and buying a 2016 Toyota Corolla, you would have to drive off $24,000 of value
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:41.400]   of the Corolla before you ever make up your fuel savings when we factor in depreciation.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:48.400]   Point of the story, don't buy a newer car because it saves you money on gas.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:53.440]   Buy a newer car because you want a newer car, because at this stage of your life it's appropriate
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.120]   for you to have a newer car.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:59.720]   Buy a newer car because your circumstances change.
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:04.760]   Buy a newer car because you have a reason to buy a newer car that's not financial.
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:10.680]   Now when you're buying a newer car for a reason that's not financial, make sure you factor
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:14.200]   in good financial decisions.
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:17.960]   There's no reason to buy something that gets bad gas mileage if you have an option to buy
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.640]   something that gets better gas mileage.
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:24.800]   I remain convinced in consumer reports and many other people agree with me that if you
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:30.640]   are interested in driving a car, a Toyota Prius is the best car for the vast majority
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.640]   of people to buy and to be driving.
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:33.640]   It's fantastic.
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:39.160]   I'm going to do a show, it might be tomorrow, on the Chevy Volt, the new 2017 Chevy Volt.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:44.560]   I think it's one that if I were buying a newer car today, I would seriously consider it.
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:47.240]   It's a great vehicle.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:50.720]   But I wouldn't be telling myself that I'm buying the newer car because I'm going to
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:54.320]   save on money by switching from gas to electric.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.080]   Although that will come eventually.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:01.440]   Yes, you can save on gas by switching to electric.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.080]   But it's going to take a really long time to make up those savings.
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:08.960]   I'm just saying if you're in that stage of life where you need to upgrade your car, make
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:12.840]   a sensible decision at that point in time.
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:18.960]   And don't fool yourself into thinking that you can buy the new car because you're going
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:23.320]   to save on gas.
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:27.160]   I'm the youngest of my parents' seven children.
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:31.340]   If you ever have seven children in your family, you'll start to see that there are certain
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:38.200]   expenses and costs that many other families with fewer children don't get to enjoy.
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:41.760]   Those costs would range from the cost of going out to eat.
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:47.280]   Just about any restaurant visit automatically turns into a $100 meal if you have seven kids
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.560]   and you're trying to go out to eat.
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:54.320]   One of the costs is transportation because you need to want a vehicle big enough to carry
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.320]   your family around.
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:58.640]   If you have three, four, five kids, there are lots of options.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:02.520]   But when you get to seven, all of a sudden now you have nine people total that you've
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:03.760]   got to cart around.
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.520]   And that requires a larger vehicle.
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:12.560]   When I was growing up, all during my younger years, my parents had a 1985 Chevy 12 passenger
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:13.560]   van.
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.760]   We used that van for many, many years.
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.440]   Drove it all over the United States.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.880]   Had a lot of great memories in that van.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:22.780]   My dad fixed it up and it was repainted a couple times and just was a great vehicle
[00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:23.920]   for us.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:29.680]   But sometime probably about the late '90s, we needed to upgrade.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:33.080]   And so my parents were looking around and trying to figure out if they could switch
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.600]   to a different kind of vehicle.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.600]   They were shopping.
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.360]   They knew they probably needed a van.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:43.700]   At one point I have a clear, vivid memory of going and looking at the Chevy Astro.
[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:48.280]   The Chevy Astro had three rows, but at that point in time, they put me in the backseat
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:53.480]   and I probably wasn't as big then as I am now, but I'm about 6'5", 6'6" and I'm not
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.040]   skinny.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.400]   And they put me in the backseat and realized they needed something a little bit bigger.
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:05.880]   So after a while, they found a 1995 Chevy conversion van and bought that.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:08.040]   I found it used and bought that.
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:11.080]   And we had a lot of great memories in that vehicle as well.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.560]   It was very, very useful, very, very comfortable.
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.360]   It was a great car.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:20.520]   One of the problems though of driving a full-size van is it's not the most fuel efficient vehicle.
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:24.860]   Well, my parents kept that vehicle for many years.
[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:29.380]   And when I was in college, most of the needs of being able to carry the whole family together
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:34.920]   had been eliminated simply due to kids growing up, getting married, starting their own families.
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:39.760]   And my dad just got kind of tired of this big van that he was driving to work every
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:40.760]   day.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:44.800]   We lived out west of town, about 20 miles, and he would drive this thing in and out,
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:45.800]   in and out, in and out.
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:50.280]   And looking at the gas tank, I mean, to fill the thing up is 80 bucks.
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:51.660]   And it gets hard to do that.
[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:54.720]   So he was thinking, "Well, it might be time to get something a little bit more fuel efficient
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.000]   for his commute."
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.280]   He was also getting tired of putting money into it and fixing a few things.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:04.440]   And so he was talking to me about whether he should switch to a different car.
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.900]   Well, I didn't know the answer.
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:14.360]   So I sat down and built a calculator in Excel to try to figure out the answer.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:23.480]   And the results of that challenge that I had set for myself really, really shocked me.
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:30.000]   Because what I learned was that even though he was driving one of the worst vehicles in
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:40.520]   terms of fuel mileage, even so, and even though he was driving a lot, it still didn't make
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:52.600]   a lot of financial sense for him to move up to a newer car based solely on gas mileage
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:55.440]   improvements.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.880]   Since that time, I've done this calculation many times.
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:00.440]   I sent my calculator out to all my friends and would email it out.
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:04.160]   And anytime somebody was thinking about buying another car and they're trying to justify
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:08.000]   it based upon gas mileage, I would send them my calculator, let them do the numbers.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.960]   And there are times at which this makes sense.
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.640]   And I'll go over those in today's show.
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:16.920]   The answer of course is you need to calculate your own numbers, which is why in the show
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:21.160]   notes for today's show, in the blog post, you'll just see a link right to it, just to
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:22.160]   the Excel file.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.600]   I haven't touched this thing since 2000.
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:27.260]   I think I built it in about 2008.
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:30.400]   But you can download it and run the numbers for your own situation.
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:35.760]   But today I'm going to run you through some numbers and give you some examples.
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:39.600]   Because I want you to get this very, very clearly in your head.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:49.380]   Gas mileage matters, but it may not be the most important thing for you to focus on such
[00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:54.560]   that you sell your older car that's functional to buy a newer one because of gas mileage.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:58.700]   Now let's start with the real numbers for my dad's vehicle.
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:00.680]   And I'm going to punch these into my calculator.
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:04.080]   If you'd like to do them yourself, again, the Excel file is linked in the blog post
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.720]   or show notes for today's show.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:06.920]   You can pull it up.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:11.960]   What you do is you just edit the cells in yellow and all this does is calculate what
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.360]   the actual cost is.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.440]   And this is a very, very simple calculation.
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.640]   I'll explain it as we do it.
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:22.880]   So the first thing we enter in is what the current MPGs are of that vehicle.
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:29.760]   Well, that big old Chevy van with a thirsty 350 V8 got about 14 miles per gallon.
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.360]   We drove it smoothly enough.
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:34.520]   Most of the highway miles were ... Most of the miles that we drove on it were highway
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:35.520]   miles.
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:38.720]   So my dad was looking at a car, just an average sedan.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:42.860]   He actually wound up later on getting a Buick sedan.
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:44.800]   So that's what I'm going to use as my proxy here.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:51.040]   And that Buick sedan was a perfectly functional, normal, mid-level consumer sedan that got
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.720]   probably about 23 or 24 miles per gallon.
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:59.600]   So I'm going to use 24 miles per gallon as my calculation.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:03.800]   Now in my calculator, you have to put in the cost per gallon of gas.
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:09.120]   And so for the sake of our analysis, let's leave it at just about what it is today, right
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:13.480]   now, about $2.30 across the country.
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:17.360]   So we'll just plug in $2.30 worth of gas.
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:24.080]   Now the next two numbers that you've got to calculate is what is the current price that
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:26.600]   you're going to sell your car for?
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:29.600]   And you need to figure this out.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:34.800]   Well, if you're going to sell your current car, as I remember that that van was worth
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:40.080]   about $2,500 at the time that he was looking to sell it, you want to put that number in
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:44.200]   as how much are you going to sell your current car for, and how much will you pay for your
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.520]   new car?
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:52.020]   And my dad, I think, was looking at cars that were going to be about $7,500.
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:57.600]   Now I also want to make sure that you calculate what are some of the additional expenses or
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.640]   some of the additional savings that you're going to have.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:03.120]   We'll come back to that in a moment after I give you this example.
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:06.160]   And then how many miles you drive every month.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:11.400]   And in this case, the miles that he would drive every month were about 1,000.
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.360]   So we'll keep it at 1,000.
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:23.720]   Well when you run the numbers on that, you wind up with 73 months, 73 months before you
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:33.760]   would finally make up the cost of the purchase of the newer car.
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:38.040]   If that number doesn't shock you, it's simply because you're a human calculator and you've
[00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:41.280]   never worked with people.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:44.480]   Because when I've interacted with people, usually they say, "Oh, about a year or two
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.640]   I'll break even."
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:57.880]   It takes years just to break even on a very, very sensible vehicle change.
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:05.640]   Remember, I'm talking about moving from a $2,500 car up to a $7,500 car.
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:08.720]   I'm not talking about going to a $30,000 new car.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:13.400]   Just moving up from a $2,500 car to a $7,500 car.
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:20.960]   For somebody who drives 1,000 miles a month and gets a 10 mile per gallon improvement
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:29.160]   in their gas mileage from 14 miles per gallon to 24 miles per gallon.
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:36.080]   And it takes six years to break even on the fuel cost.
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:41.440]   I'm going to give you a couple other examples here just to drive this point home to you.
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:48.080]   And then we'll talk about some of the factors that should influence your personal decision.
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.880]   So I'm going to give you two more scenarios, not real scenarios.
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.200]   I'm just making these up.
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:56.400]   I thought of friends that I knew and people that I am encountered with and I just thought
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.080]   this would be interesting.
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:03.040]   So scenario one is that you drive a 2,000, currently as I record this 2016, you drive
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:10.280]   a 2,000 Ford F-150, which gets you 16 miles per gallon of combined mileage according to
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:12.520]   fuel economy.gov.
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:15.640]   And this vehicle is worth $1,500.
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:18.240]   So that's the amount of money that you're going to sell it for.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:21.840]   Again, 2,000 Ford F-150, you get 16 miles per gallon.
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:24.480]   It's worth $1,500.
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:29.360]   And you're looking around and you're concerned about gas prices at $2.30 a gallon.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:34.760]   And you're looking around and by the way, I'm giving you this now.
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:37.360]   Don't laugh at the $2.30 per gallon number.
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:41.860]   We were doing these numbers when they were up in the $3 and $4 numbers, but I'm doing
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.640]   it now because I want you to be thinking about gas mileage.
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:47.960]   We're going to keep today's numbers and then we'll show you all the variables that can
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.680]   affect your personal situation.
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.120]   Now back to the scenario.
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:56.840]   So 2,000 Ford F-150, get 16 miles per gallon according to fuel economy.gov.
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:41:01.260]   I just priced it on auto trader and I saw some of these listed that I think you could
[00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:02.880]   get these for about 1,500 bucks.
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.520]   So that's what you would sell it for.
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:08.360]   You're going to buy a 2016 Toyota Corolla.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:12.680]   So you're going to go and buy a new car, but it's a very sensible car, intelligent car
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:17.400]   choice, small, very fuel efficient, should have a very long lifespan.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:21.820]   And I checked that out on trucar.com to see what the prices are in my area.
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:27.380]   And I could get a 2016 Toyota Corolla for $21,510.
[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:31.000]   So that was what they said is the average price actually paid.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.040]   Doesn't include taxes, doesn't include title, but that's just the number that we're going
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.200]   to use, $21,510.
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:47.160]   Now that Toyota Corolla gets according to fuel economy.gov, 30 miles per gallon.
[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:55.120]   So 30 miles per gallon, 2016, very reasonable situation and scenario here.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:57.480]   I think very reasonable.
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:04.640]   Now guess how long with no other savings or expenses every month to count in, just exclusively
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:10.760]   based upon gas mileage, not depreciation, not any other expenses.
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:17.620]   How long do you think it takes to break even on that car purchase?
[00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:28.220]   The answer is 298 months, which comes out to 24.8 years.
[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:35.380]   We'll round that to 25 years among friends.
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:43.780]   Going from an old 2004 to F-150, 16 miles per gallon to a new 2016 Toyota Corolla takes
[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:50.660]   25 years to break even based on gas mileage.
[00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:55.100]   You say, "But I don't want to have a car that's that old and I don't want to buy a car that's
[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:56.100]   not new."
[00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:58.900]   Okay, I planned out one other scenario to share with you.
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:06.420]   You're going to upgrade from an SUV, a 2006 Honda Pilot to a slightly newer but still
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:11.060]   used Prius that's very fuel efficient.
[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:17.940]   So I pulled the numbers here from autotrader.com, a 2006 Honda Pilot would sell for about 5,000
[00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:24.980]   bucks and currently that car is rated for 18 miles per gallon according to fueleconomy.gov.
[00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:29.300]   So we're going to sell it for $5,000, 18 miles per gallon.
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:34.620]   Now your new miles per gallon that you get with a Toyota Prius, it's rated by fueleconomy.gov
[00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:42.180]   to get you 48 miles per gallon, 48 miles per gallon and you're going to pay $11,000 for
[00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:45.980]   it because it's in the used market.
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:50.620]   No additional savings, no additional expenses and by the way in all of these I've kept constant
[00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:54.820]   that you're driving 1,000 miles per month.
[00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:57.180]   Guess how many months to break even?
[00:43:57.180 --> 00:44:02.620]   Answer, 75 months.
[00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:14.620]   75 months to break even just based upon gas mileage.
[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:18.820]   When I started running these scenarios using my calculator I was stunned because there
[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:24.180]   are other factors and other expenses and other things that you've got to consider as well
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:28.180]   but I was stunned at how long it took to break even on gas.
[00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:32.940]   Now you say, "Well, what if gas is more expensive?" because let's stick with this Honda Pilot
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:35.940]   to Toyota Prius example because this is the one where it's the closest.
[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:40.420]   This is the most reasonable type of scenario where you should consider changing on gas
[00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:41.420]   mileage.
[00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:47.940]   2006 Honda Pilot worth 5 grand upgrading just a few years, 5 years into a Prius and you
[00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:51.900]   go from 18 to 48 miles per gallon.
[00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:54.700]   You pick up 30 miles per gallon.
[00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:59.220]   Let's just change that and let's just bump gas prices up to $3 a gallon and see what
[00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:00.820]   the break even point is.
[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:09.980]   Well, now it's 58 months, 5 years at $3 a gallon.
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:18.420]   At $4 a gallon it's 43 months, so just under 4 years.
[00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:20.380]   I'm not going to take it higher than $4 a gallon.
[00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:23.460]   Okay, let's double your mileage and here's where things matter.
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:25.380]   Let's take you up to 2,000 miles.
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:40.140]   At $4 per gallon and 2,000 miles per month, it takes you 22 months to break even on that
[00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:48.660]   upgrade from a 2006 Pilot SUV to a 2011 Prius used.
[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:50.260]   So what do we learn from this?
[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:52.700]   A few things.
[00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:59.420]   Gas mileage is probably, gas cost and gas mileage is probably generally not your biggest
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:09.980]   expense and it will almost never make sense to upgrade your car in terms of cost exclusively
[00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:12.860]   based upon gas mileage.
[00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:21.500]   I emphasize again, it will almost never make sense to upgrade your car based on cost to
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:27.420]   a more expensive car exclusively based on gas mileage.
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:32.820]   The upgrade word is important because where can we save money?
[00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:41.260]   Well, first if you could go from a similarly priced car to a similarly priced car that
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:48.240]   gets better gas mileage, then you will experience some savings.
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:51.220]   So let's just do this.
[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:58.620]   Let's say that instead of going from a 2006 Pilot to a 2011 Prius, you went from a 2006
[00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:02.580]   Pilot to a 2006 Prius.
[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:06.780]   Well here we start to get into cars that are worth about the same amount of money.
[00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:11.140]   Now you've got to look for the individual numbers for your deal in your area.
[00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:16.020]   I just again, I'm doing a web search for cars listed for sale and doing a quick average.
[00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:24.420]   But when I do that, I find that a 2006 Pilot would be worth about $5,000 and a 2006 Prius
[00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:28.500]   would be worth about $5,000 to $6,000.
[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:34.400]   Well in this situation here, if we drop this gas back to $2.30, you're going to pay, let's
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:38.880]   just say you're going to pay $6,000 for your new car and you're going to sell your current
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:45.880]   car for $5,000 and you drive 1,000 miles a month, 18 to 48 miles per gallon.
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:50.580]   Now all of a sudden at $2.30, you've got 13 months and you'll be in the clear.
[00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:53.140]   You'll be in the black in 13 months.
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:58.000]   And if we drop that to 5,500, you'd be there in six months.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.640]   Maybe you can do an even swap.
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:07.380]   Well in this situation, if you drove 1,000 miles a month, you would wind up saving, switching
[00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:13.560]   from the Pilot of 2006 Pilot to the 2006 Prius, you would wind up saving about $80 per month
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:15.880]   in fuel.
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:18.440]   And that would add up pretty quickly.
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:23.960]   So if you want to change out your vehicle because you're concerned about gas mileage,
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:29.840]   look for a vehicle that gets better gas mileage, but that's of a similar vintage to your current
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:34.320]   vehicle or that is cheaper than your current vehicle.
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:41.060]   Because when you look at that, you can definitely save money based on gas mileage.
[00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:42.060]   What else do you need to consider?
[00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:47.600]   Well, you've got to consider what you actually expect the cost of gas to be.
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:49.460]   And that's the reason why I'm doing the show right now.
[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:52.460]   I know very few people who are complaining about the cost of gas.
[00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:55.700]   It's a little funny.
[00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:57.720]   There's a bumper sticker.
[00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:00.760]   It's a political bumper sticker, but it's funny.
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:03.120]   It says the cost of gas and has a picture of Barack Obama.
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:08.640]   It says the cost of gas when President Obama took office in January 2009 was, I think it
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:11.200]   was about $1.90 a gallon.
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:21.560]   And the idea here is that when gas was close to $4 a gallon, that was quite the damning
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:22.560]   political statement.
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:26.720]   Well, today with gas at $2.30, every time I see that bumper sticker, I just kind of
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:28.880]   chuckle and say, "Haven't you removed that yet?"
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:33.000]   That didn't really make a big argument for yourself.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.580]   So $2.30, no one is complaining unless you work in the oil industry or unless you live
[00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:40.640]   on dividends from your oil shares.
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:44.620]   Then you're complaining about current gas prices being what they are.
[00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:52.440]   But if you expect gas prices to change in the future, then this can be something that
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:54.540]   you should pay attention to.
[00:49:54.540 --> 00:50:01.080]   And you can use this calculator and you can use it to figure out what would be some significant
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:07.880]   changes that I can make in order to be prepared for changing gas prices.
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:15.160]   As an example, if I switch the cost of gallon per gas from $2.30 to $4 a gallon, now all
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:24.240]   of a sudden you're going to be saving $140 a month if you swap out your pilot for a Prius.
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:27.900]   And the time to do that is when prices are low.
[00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:32.420]   The time to shop for fuel-efficient cars is when the demand for them is low.
[00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:34.200]   Right now, the demand is low.
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:35.340]   People aren't thinking about that.
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:39.380]   People are very happily going out and buying bigger vehicles.
[00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:45.000]   They're not worried about it because at $2.30, it's easy to fill up the tank.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.360]   That's not for you.
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:47.800]   You're smarter than that.
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:52.800]   So you should be shopping for your fuel-efficient vehicle now and my calculator can help you.
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:57.400]   One other fact, two other lines that are on my calculator that will make a big difference
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:58.400]   for you.
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:00.720]   First is how many miles do you drive every month?
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:04.880]   If you drive a low number of miles per month, and this should be intuitive, but for many
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:06.600]   people it's not.
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:13.120]   If you only drive a few hundred miles a month, the actual MPGs of your vehicle is probably
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:19.960]   the least relevant number for you because you're only paying for gas when the vehicle's
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:21.800]   moving.
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:27.600]   If you have a full-size van or like me, one of my vehicles, I have this big Dodge van
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:29.800]   RV.
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:35.260]   The thing gets about 15 miles per gallon, but I don't drive it all that much.
[00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:36.880]   It's not a commuting vehicle.
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:42.720]   So the cost of gas matters, but it doesn't matter all that much unless I'm on the road
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:44.400]   a ton, a ton, a ton, but it's an RV.
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:47.360]   They usually don't get driven all that much.
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:48.360]   So don't worry.
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:51.200]   If you don't drive very much, don't worry about swapping out your vehicle because you're
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:54.140]   concerned about gas prices.
[00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:58.080]   The other number, however, on my calculator is one that you do need to pay attention to.
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:51:59.080]   And I have it listed here.
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:04.200]   It's called additional monthly expenses or savings from the change.
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:08.480]   And the idea is you want to make sure that when you're thinking about a purchase decision
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:12.920]   like a car, that you factor in all the costs.
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:18.360]   Now the way this process goes for most people is they run out and they start looking for
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:19.360]   cars.
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:24.760]   And unfortunately, they start by looking according to their budget.
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:29.640]   Then they start going to dealerships and looking at the newer cars because after all, I want
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:32.720]   to get an idea of what's out there and it's a lot easier to look at the newer cars at
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:33.720]   the dealership.
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:37.840]   Well, at the dealership, all of a sudden you find out how nice those newer cars are, how
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:43.700]   comfortable they are, how beautiful they are, and how inexpensive they are.
[00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:47.240]   And so you start looking at the numbers and many people just calculate them based upon
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:52.400]   the monthly number and they forget about the total cost of ownership.
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:55.240]   What you need to do is you need to calculate the actual number.
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:58.640]   If you're going to change from one car to another car, you need to calculate the cost
[00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:03.360]   of transferring the title, transferring the tag, paying the tax.
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:07.080]   In my state, we have a 6% sales tax.
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:10.580]   So if I were going to switch from one car to the next, I'm going to automatically incur
[00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:13.920]   a 6% sales tax from that.
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:19.240]   You want to consider if there are any savings with insurance because this can help a lot.
[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:21.680]   My calculator does make provision for that.
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:25.600]   You might drive an older vehicle that has a very high insurance cost, but you might
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:30.800]   be able to switch up to a newer vehicle that has a very low insurance cost.
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:33.560]   In that situation, you want to count that as savings.
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:41.080]   Or you want to factor in savings based upon you're not having to repair your older vehicle.
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:49.120]   Older vehicles do tend to nickel and dime you on repairs and newer vehicles might have
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:51.200]   fewer repairs.
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:55.320]   Here you need to figure out are we talking about actual repairs or are we talking about
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:56.760]   maintenance items?
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:54:00.240]   All vehicles burn up batteries about once every two, three, four years.
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:02.400]   All vehicles burn up tires.
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:05.640]   You got to replace your tires every five to six years, even if you're not putting a lot
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:07.960]   of miles on them just to keep them safe.
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:12.040]   So that six year, most people aren't going to run through an entire set of tires.
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:16.080]   You can buy a set of tires now at 90,000 with a 90 to 100,000 mile.
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:18.400]   I've seen them with 90,000 mile warranty.
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:21.960]   So figure 70 to 100,000 miles of useful lifespan.
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:26.760]   Most people are going to be replacing their tires not because they're worn down, but because
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:31.160]   they're old, which by the way, if you don't know that, you need to do that for a safety
[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:32.160]   consideration.
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:36.480]   Majority of significant, let me not say a majority because I don't know that to be the
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:44.680]   fact, a significant number of catastrophic blowouts of tires are caused due to the age
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:48.840]   of the tire, not due to another factor.
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:55.440]   So when your tires get to about five to six years old, you need to replace them proactively
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:58.280]   so that you don't wind up with a catastrophic blowout.
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:02.960]   A catastrophic blowout is the type of thing that you want to avoid.
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:06.720]   That's when it happens at 70 miles an hour and all of a sudden the tire shreds.
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:09.040]   You get a flat tire because you popped it with a nail.
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:10.040]   That's no big deal.
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.620]   That's not a safety hazard.
[00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:13.720]   Catastrophic blowout on the interstate is a safety hazard.
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:18.120]   So replace your tires when you get them to about five to six years and don't take a chance
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:19.120]   on that.
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:20.360]   It's not worth it.
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:28.120]   The other side of the tire issue though is all vehicles need tires.
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:29.800]   All vehicles need oil changes.
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:34.120]   So sometimes with an older vehicle, there aren't a lot of actual changes.
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:42.600]   I've had now a little 1998 Toyota Corolla that I bought for, I bought it for $500, a
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:44.600]   little more than a year ago.
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:50.120]   I have not repaired anything with it and I put 4,000 miles on it.
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:51.680]   There's not been a single problem.
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:52.920]   I haven't had to repair anything.
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:54.420]   The vehicle just works.
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:58.280]   It works largely due to its nature, meaning it's very, very simple.
[00:55:58.280 --> 00:55:59.360]   It's mechanically simple.
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:02.440]   I've got a manual transmission and roll up windows.
[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:03.680]   I don't have anything.
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:06.200]   There's very few things on it that can break.
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:11.320]   Now, of course, things can break, but mechanically it's very simple.
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:15.960]   That's different than the TPMS, tire pressure monitoring system light on my other car that
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:20.720]   I can't seem to fix no matter how much money we throw at the thing because it's got more
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:23.880]   issues, more things to break.
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:28.000]   So do some actual true calculations for your situation.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.160]   You figure out if there are additional monthly expenses.
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:34.680]   Do you have insurance costs that go up?
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:37.720]   Or if there are additional monthly savings, you need to factor those in.
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:42.320]   Obviously, of course, you also want to factor in the depreciation.
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:48.160]   Now my calculator does not factor in depreciation, but you need to do that mentally.
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:52.240]   And what I mean is, and the reason it doesn't is because I built it real quick and I was
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:55.620]   just trying to answer the question of fuel mileage.
[00:56:55.620 --> 00:57:02.320]   But remember that your car is going to be worth progressively less and less and less
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:04.620]   for each year that goes on.
[00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:07.440]   Now you can't always drive a 1922 vehicle.
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:10.360]   Of course, you've got to upgrade at some point in time.
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:13.440]   But that depreciation is a real cost.
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:19.520]   And if we were going to go back to my Toyota example, my Toyota Corolla example, let me
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:20.520]   run these numbers again.
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:24.720]   Okay, so we've got a 2000 Ford F-150, 16 miles per gallon.
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:27.760]   2016 Toyota Corolla gets 30 miles per gallon.
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:30.960]   Gas, let's put it at $2.50 now.
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.840]   We're going to pay $21,510 for it.
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:39.240]   We could sell our current car for $1,500, drive 1,000 miles a month.
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:46.200]   So in my situation here, under this example, what I find out is that the average, the current
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:53.380]   cost of fuel per mile is 16 cents per mile, just gas in that F-150.
[00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:57.880]   And the newer cost of fuel per mile to go up to the Toyota Corolla is 8 cents per mile
[00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:00.220]   of gas.
[00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:02.080]   So I'm going to save some money in gas.
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:10.400]   I'm going to wind up saving a total of $73 per month of fuel.
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:19.920]   Now it's going to take me 412 months to break even on the fuel costs, but I'm saving $73.
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:24.480]   But now let's talk about depreciation on that $30,000 vehicle.
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:35.120]   $3,510 times 0.15 comes out to $4,726 of depreciation in the first year.
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:48.520]   Brought out monthly, divide that by 12, we wind up with $393 per month of depreciation,
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:53.320]   meaning the car is just worth progressively less from sitting in my driveway and from
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:55.640]   driving me to work.
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:59:02.760]   That's $400 out the door gone before we even get to fuel savings.
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:06.880]   My calculator doesn't take this into account, but you need to take this into account.
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:11.680]   Now it won't always be $400 a month because in the future the car will be worth less and
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:12.680]   less.
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:15.880]   But let's say a couple of years from now it's now worth $15,000.
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:24.520]   Well a $15,000 car is losing $2,250 this year in depreciation costs, divide that by 12,
[00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:28.520]   that's $187 gone.
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:33.100]   Double what I'm saving on fuel mileage savings.
[00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:38.320]   At that point in time, I guess the car would probably have to be what, $7,500.
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:44.840]   So we'd have to get down to when the car is worth, in order to save money on fuel here,
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:52.200]   excuse me, in order for the loss of depreciation to equal the loss of savings on fuel, we've
[00:59:52.200 --> 01:00:03.600]   got to get down to $5,000 times .15, 750 divided by 12, a little bit more, $6,500 times .15
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.160]   divided by 12.
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:06.220]   Great, good enough.
[01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:19.120]   So when your 2016 Toyota Corolla is worth $6,500, now at this point in time you are
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:27.520]   finally going to only be losing $81.25 this month, every month this year in depreciation
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:35.480]   costs where you're saving $73 per month of fuel.
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:38.760]   So you've got to drive, in that example, if you were going to think about trading in your
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:47.740]   2004 F-150 and buying a 2016 Toyota Corolla, you would have to drive off $24,000 of value
[01:00:47.740 --> 01:01:03.360]   of the Corolla before you ever make up your fuel savings when we factor in depreciation.
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:10.360]   Here's the story, don't buy a newer car because it saves you money on gas.
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:15.400]   Buy a newer car because you want a newer car, because at this stage of your life it's appropriate
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:17.080]   for you to have a newer car.
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:21.700]   Buy a newer car because your circumstances change.
[01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:26.720]   Buy a newer car because you have a reason to buy a newer car that's not financial.
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:32.640]   Now when you're buying a newer car for a reason that's not financial, make sure you factor
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:36.120]   in good financial decisions.
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:39.920]   There's no reason to buy something that gets bad gas mileage if you have an option to buy
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.600]   something that gets better gas mileage.
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:46.760]   I remain convinced and Consumer Reports and many other people agree with me that if you
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:52.600]   are interested in driving a car, a Toyota Prius is the best car for the vast majority
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:54.600]   of people to buy and to be driving.
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:55.600]   It's fantastic.
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:02:01.120]   I'm going to do a show, it might be tomorrow, on the Chevy Volt, the new 2017 Chevy Volt.
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:06.480]   I think it's one that if I were buying a newer car today, I would seriously consider it.
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:09.160]   It's a great vehicle.
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:12.560]   But I wouldn't be telling myself that I'm buying the newer car because I'm going to
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:16.240]   save on money by switching from gas to electric.
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.960]   Although that will come eventually.
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:23.360]   Yes, you can save on gas by switching to electric.
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:26.000]   But it's going to take a really long time to make up those savings.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.880]   I'm just saying if you're in that stage of life where you need to upgrade your car, make
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:34.760]   a sensible decision at that point in time.
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:40.840]   And don't fool yourself into thinking that you can buy the new car because you're going
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:43.440]   to save on gas.
