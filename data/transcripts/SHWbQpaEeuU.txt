[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160]   a lot of procrastination doesn't come from not having the time to do something. It comes from
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.320]   actually like our emotions that get in our way. And there's a researcher called Tim Pitchell, who
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.160]   has a great book, I think it's called the procrastination puzzle, which is basically all
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.000]   about the emotional side of procrastination. And he researches this and talks about all the all the
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.720]   different emotional barriers that get in our way. And so for example, if you know, the example I
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.000]   use a lot is people who procrastinate from starting a YouTube channel, for example. And it's like,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.440]   yeah, I know that I've got my time slot. And I know, I just need to film this video, because I've
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.360]   taken Ali Abdaal's course on YouTube, whatever, I know, I just need to film the video. But you're
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.080]   in the time slot. And there's something stopping you something that's holding you back from doing
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.520]   this thing, which you claim to want, usually. And it's like, what's going on there?
