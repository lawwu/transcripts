[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, it's live Q&A.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.760]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.600]   skills, insights, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.360]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.000]   My name is Joshua Sheets, today is Friday, January 5, 2024.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.880]   And on this Friday, as we do on any Friday in which I can arrange the appropriate recording
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.960]   technology, we record a live Q&A.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.400]   Open microphones, you call in, talk about anything you want.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:54.200]   If you'd like to gain access to one of these Friday Q&A shows in the future, and you're
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.360]   listening to the recorded version, going out on the podcast, or on YouTube, etc., you can
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.760]   do that by becoming a patron of the show.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.960]   Go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance, patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance, sign up
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.440]   to support the show there on Patreon, and that will gain access for you to one of these
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.440]   Friday Q&A shows.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.280]   I use that paid methodology of simply screening the calls so I get a reasonable number of
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.080]   calls that I can handle in 45 minutes to two hours, somewhere in there.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.040]   Usually winds up being between four to 10 callers, things like that.
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.360]   We begin today with Andy in Indiana.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.360]   Andy, welcome to the show.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.360]   How can I serve you today?
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.360]   Hi Joshua, thanks for taking my call.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.360]   My pleasure.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.360]   I see you have the music back.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.360]   Indeed.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.360]   Glad to hear that.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:40.440]   You commented a couple of weeks ago, a couple of months ago, about you wish people would
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.480]   call in and argue with you a little more.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:51.040]   So I wanted to call in and prod a little bit about the idea of mindset and how much that
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.760]   gets talked about online in general and how you had talked about that with several callers
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.960]   you had in the last couple of weeks about house buying.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:07.480]   And so I hear that, I think you do this less than a lot of online podcasters and YouTubers
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.840]   and stuff, but there's a lot of get your mindset right, things will follow if you get your
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.280]   mindset right.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.160]   And I listened to you specifically, the three calls you've had on people looking to buy
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.960]   houses the last couple of call-in shows.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.560]   I think that was kind of your approach was, hey, you need to think about this a little
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.880]   differently and it's a mindset thing and a motivation thing.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.000]   And it seems to me that there's sort of a tiered level and a lot of us who are not at
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.560]   as high a level of success on things, it's really, I would say more of like a toolkit
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.560]   thing.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.960]   And so it's not just the mindset of, well, if you had to raise this $20,000 to save your
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.920]   child's life, of course you'd get it done.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.520]   Well, if you told me I need $2 million in six months to save my child's life, absolutely
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.680]   I would do anything I could to get that.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.600]   But I don't have the tools in my toolbox to earn $2 million in six months and I probably
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.200]   can't figure out how to do that.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.120]   Maybe I can beg and borrow and steal and maybe I'd go rob a bank or something.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:19.480]   But I think my problem would be in that instance, I actually have no idea how you earn $4 million
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.280]   a year and I need a different toolbox.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.120]   Maybe I need a different mindset to find that toolbox.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:31.160]   But I think sometimes things like how should I buy a house really could be, your mindset
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.360]   is go to a mortgage broker, they walk you through some numbers, that's what you can
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.560]   afford, go to a realtor, they find it, here's a different way to walk through the numbers
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.920]   and a different way to calculate what you can earn and look on Zillow instead of MLS
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.840]   and more like sort of practical things that people will figure out for themselves if their
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.400]   mindset is right but also could just be told to them by a different advisor.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.400]   Does that make sense?
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.160]   I think I hear you saying two things.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:07.500]   I hear your critiques as number one, you can say to somebody you should just have a different
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.320]   mindset and somehow that's going to magically solve something for them and that's not always
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.320]   true.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.280]   And then the second critique that slipped in at the end was basically, instead of talking
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.760]   about mindset, wouldn't it be better if you told someone go meet with a mortgage broker,
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.960]   sit down and go through the numbers, see what you can afford, etc.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.960]   Was I accurate?
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.320]   Were those the two primary critiques you were driving at?
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.200]   I think I didn't maybe say that very well.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.940]   I think the critique would basically be mindset.
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:47.140]   If you have the proper mindset, you'll find the tools eventually but if someone can just
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.260]   show you, hey, there's a specialty tool here, that's much quicker.
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:58.020]   You give lots of financial advice where there's some very esoteric piece of financial knowledge
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:07.160]   and you don't say, you do what I'm saying here, you should just go ask an insurance
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.760]   broker who will tell you exactly what the right number is for this and that's how you
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.760]   get your answer.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.360]   As opposed to saying, well, if you read a bunch of books and focus your mind on being
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.560]   a person who's well insured, eventually you're going to come across this number and then
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.960]   you'll know what to do.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.420]   That was the critique with the house buying things in particular.
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:34.740]   Coming from people who are, several of them were on the, we're just trying to save up
[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:40.540]   20 grand to make a down payment, this is a more mainstream, I'm not the person that's
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.180]   got hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars and doesn't know where to put it,
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.740]   sort of financial problem.
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:52.220]   I think you have good insight on there's different ways to look at the problem and use a different
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:58.220]   tool to solve your problem and then sometimes you get advice that's more like change your
[00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.420]   mindset and then you'll figure it out instead of, well, most mortgage brokers will tell
[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.100]   you this but they don't tell you this other important thing and if you think about this
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.340]   other important thing, that's the actual clue to this problem.
[00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.340]   Sure.
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:18.660]   Let me try to respond and then you can follow up with step two because, first, with regard
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:30.020]   to mindset, I believe myself that there's a real truth that the mindset that you have
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:38.500]   about money dramatically affects the decisions that you make, the opportunities you're exposed
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:46.340]   to and how you take advantage of those opportunities when they come into your life.
[00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:55.500]   I'm mostly aware of it, of the truth of the mindset being important by my own personal
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:02.900]   lack of, call it a wealth-oriented mindset.
[00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:14.340]   Because I grew up in humble circumstances, I am aware of how uncomfortable or how, especially
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:21.780]   when I was younger, how I thought that the only way to generate significant income, generate
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:27.260]   significant savings was through more hard work, was through working a little bit longer,
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.660]   being a little bit more frugal, etc.
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:35.380]   And then I know very distinctly for me when I became a financial advisor and started becoming
[00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:40.900]   exposed to people who were wealthy who had never gone that pathway and had never needed
[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:47.980]   to live the frugality and the kind of the hardcore saving, etc., but who had a different
[00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:52.460]   way of interacting with the world, I realized there was something different.
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:59.940]   The problem was that when I went looking for advice or input on how to adapt and change
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:07.980]   my mindset, I found that world of gurus quite slippery.
[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:13.980]   And I found it full of people who wanted to teach me how to change my mindset, enriching
[00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.540]   the guru in the process.
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:24.780]   And so I have believed for many years now that our mindset, our philosophy with regard
[00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:32.100]   to money drives us, but I have never known how to completely and carefully articulate
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:39.020]   that across the board in a coherent kind of all-encompassing package.
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:43.340]   I have changed quite a lot in my own method of thinking.
[00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:48.620]   My own fixed beliefs have changed a lot over the past years, and so I've tried to embrace
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:53.580]   opportunity and I've experienced dramatic change myself, but never having been to the
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:09:01.180]   mountaintop, I can't look back and say to someone, "Here's all of the mindset things
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.780]   that are necessary."
[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:10.940]   But I do believe that in many financial decisions, just like in many life decisions, the usefulness
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:19.300]   of a coach is primarily related to influencing somebody's desire and influencing their perspective
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.940]   in some way.
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:26.860]   And so I try to incorporate that in how I answer a question or how I think about it
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:32.020]   to say that a lot of times we already know what we need to do, and there are very few
[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:38.940]   people who are analytical enough to have explored all the options and genuinely be sitting with
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:46.500]   a conundrum, with two choices, and either one of them could work and they're just not
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.660]   genuinely sure what to do.
[00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.620]   Most – maybe I'm just making up an 80/20 rule, but it seems to me like about 80% of
[00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:59.100]   financial problems are actually indeed problems of emotion and problems of purpose, problems
[00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.300]   of clarity of mind.
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.820]   And so those things genuinely are a mindset problem.
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:09.580]   So I released a standalone episode that had been part of a Q&A and it was a guy, I think
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:13.660]   he was in Texas, and he said, "I'm trying to save a $20,000 down payment."
[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:19.580]   To me, the fact that the idea that someone doesn't know how to save a $20,000 down payment,
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:27.380]   that is an ideal question for a discussion of mindset or a question of clarity of goal,
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.380]   etc.
[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:35.260]   Because saving $20,000 related to his income was a perfectly reasonable amount of money
[00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.140]   for him to save based upon his income.
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:43.300]   I do try and I did try in that specific circumstance to probe on the income and make sure we're
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.820]   talking about something reasonable because I wholeheartedly agree with you.
[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:50.860]   I would never say to somebody, "If you had to save the life of your child, could you
[00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.060]   come up with $2 million two months from now?"
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.100]   Of course not.
[00:10:55.100 --> 00:11:00.780]   The only way out is some massive fraud or robbery of some kind for most people in that
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:01.780]   scenario.
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:06.500]   But $20,000 off of $130,000 annual income, that's something that can be done through
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.860]   a series of small steps.
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:15.940]   Now the other questions that I think on last week's Q&A show that I was a bit ambivalent
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:27.300]   on, I think what motivated my frustration on that or my lack of willingness to commit
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:36.980]   to clear, confident advice has primarily to do with uncertainty over the real estate market
[00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:47.220]   broadly and uncertainty about someone's individualized level of commitment to a specific property
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.340]   or something like that.
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:54.380]   This is genuinely puzzling to me because what I have observed in my own life and in lives
[00:11:54.380 --> 00:12:04.060]   of other people is that I'm quite willing to commit myself to a course of action even
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:12.780]   if it's very difficult or not entirely correct or someone else might advise me against it
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:17.460]   because I can assess my own level of commitment.
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.340]   If I want a house, I'll get the house.
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.340]   Can I afford it or not?
[00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.980]   If I want the house, I can afford it.
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:27.420]   Obviously good analysis is necessary and hopefully I stick in some good appropriate analysis
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:31.900]   to make sure that I'm not going to impoverish my family or put myself into bankruptcy over
[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:32.900]   a house, etc.
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:37.060]   At the end of the day, I pretty much live my life doing most of what I want to do and
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.740]   my primary driving factor is that I want to do it and so therefore I figure out a way
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:42.740]   to do it.
[00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.620]   I don't go around asking if I can do it.
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:48.340]   I figure out a way to do it and to make it happen.
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:54.260]   But I have a very hard time giving advice to other people not being able to judge another
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:13:03.100]   individual's certainty with regard to his goal and I don't know how to do that very
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.100]   well.
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:11.060]   I guess the other thing is that I should probably drive more practical.
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:16.860]   I think it would be good for me to create more standalone resources and go through and
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.100]   say, "Okay, here's how you know what you can afford a house.
[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:23.860]   You go and speak to a mortgage broker and here's what you look at and here's how the
[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.500]   whole process works."
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:31.100]   I guess I've kind of tried to steer away in my own thinking broadly from subjects that
[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:37.300]   are pretty easily answered with a library run, but I also recognize that a lot of people
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.940]   don't know what the inside of a library is and they may be coming across a podcast like
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:52.260]   mine and my own lack of interest in the topic shouldn't be necessarily a deciding factor
[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.060]   of my giving them bad advice on it.
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:14:00.980]   Because you are right, my interest in quite esoteric topics, when my interest is high,
[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:06.500]   my specificity of advice is very detailed.
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:10.540]   But usually that's because it's something I couldn't find in a book and so I had to
[00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:15.980]   go out and figure it out myself and come up with some wacky six-step plan to solve it.
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:20.540]   And then because my interest is high, my enthusiasm to share that with other people is high and
[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:24.380]   I just don't have that interest for a lot of the nuts and bolts day-to-day personal
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.300]   finance discussion.
[00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.300]   But point taken.
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.580]   What are your thoughts on that?
[00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:30.580]   Thank you.
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.940]   Yeah, I think that was clarifying and helpful.
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:38.900]   I can respond back or if you have another caller, that was a good response.
[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:42.140]   I think maybe that clarifies for me.
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:49.740]   I think maybe the point I'm trying to make is that you seem to have a very good skill
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:56.540]   at knowing what you want and being able to articulate that and gain clarity on a question.
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:02.660]   And I think a lot of people don't have that naturally, myself included, and need tools
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:09.180]   to figure out what we want or where we go or if this is a good idea.
[00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:14.620]   And I think it's common for all of us when you first start something, when you first
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.940]   start to understand it, it's very obvious.
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:21.580]   And then after you become some level of an expert in a topic, it gets harder and harder
[00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:26.180]   to remember what it was like to be ignorant about that.
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:33.580]   And so, for example, knowing whether or not you want a house, it doesn't sound like you
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.620]   have ever struggled very much to think, "Do I want this house?
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:37.620]   How do I know which house?
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.060]   There are seven houses that look really nice.
[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:41.060]   This is very overwhelming.
[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.980]   How should I prioritize all these things?"
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:48.540]   Whereas myself, that sort of thing is quite a bit of a struggle.
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:55.580]   And so, I have found specifically finding tools to sit down and be able to use decision-making
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.580]   tools.
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:03.900]   And so, I think maybe a modified point of the critique I was trying to make was it seems
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:08.940]   to me like sometimes the problem is you're talking to someone like me who is ignorant
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:17.860]   of how to go about evaluating something and the advice to give is more of change your
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:22.500]   motivation, change your mindset rather than, "Oh, you seem to be someone who has no clue
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:27.100]   how to evaluate what you're trying to accomplish, what you're doing, what your options are.
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:33.260]   Maybe you should read this book or take this course or use this tool to understand what
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:37.580]   your options are, how to make decisions better, whatever the specific issue is."
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.900]   >> JASON: Yeah.
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:46.540]   I think also just for the sake of honesty, our discussion would need to include that
[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:52.140]   there's probably a very significant percentage of a general population and any individual
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:56.460]   person could fall within this percentage, but there's a significant percentage of the
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:05.660]   general population that I am simply incapable of really helping or serving because I look
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.340]   at the world in such a radically different way.
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.740]   And I'll illustrate that with a very poignant example.
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:17.940]   I have a brother of mine who has gone through many challenges with his career, many challenges
[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.500]   with his finances, etc.
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.260]   We have a close relationship.
[00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.460]   We talk frequently.
[00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:29.140]   There is no animus of any kind between us.
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:34.620]   Our relationship is free, open, of mutual respect.
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:38.300]   He respects me, I respect him, etc.
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:46.320]   I for the life of me cannot seem to come up with any useful advice for him with regard
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:55.220]   to anything related to his career, his finances, his life in any way whatsoever.
[00:17:55.220 --> 00:18:01.500]   We have spent hours going in circles with me listening carefully, him listening carefully,
[00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.820]   me going back and forth.
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:10.860]   And basically at this point in time I've come to the conclusion that we live mentally
[00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.420]   and intellectually on different planets.
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.000]   And to be clear, he's super smart.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.420]   His brain just functions in a completely different way than mine does.
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:24.380]   And I cannot relate to his struggles and he cannot relate to my struggles.
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:25.380]   They're totally different.
[00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:30.460]   So when I share my troubles and my hardships to him, they're like, "Why do you struggle
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.780]   with that?"
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:37.180]   And having such a close relationship to me where we have had such extensive communication
[00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:42.660]   over such a long period of time and yet having to recognize that I am basically incapable
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:48.300]   of providing useful advice for him has forced me to just to realize that at the end of the
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:59.060]   day we can't all learn from one person and we can't all interact with one person.
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:06.340]   And so with that as context, when you described to me the difficulty of the hypothetical example
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:11.140]   you made of choosing among seven houses, I can understand the difficulty of choosing
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:12.900]   among seven countries to live in.
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:17.780]   I have a hard time thinking of the difficulty of choosing among seven houses because to
[00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.260]   me the house is a house is a house.
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:23.660]   It's a commodity and it's going to be fairly obvious.
[00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:29.380]   Whether it serves the vision or it doesn't serve the vision or it is new and unlikely
[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:32.540]   to cost me a lot of money or it's old and it's cheap.
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:40.980]   To me, the idea of there being seven similar houses is difficult to imagine but I can totally
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:44.800]   imagine choosing among seven countries to live in.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:52.020]   So it just may be one of those things where you and I, we have to go and one person can't
[00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:55.420]   give us good useful frameworks, we need to keep on looking.
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:59.460]   And in the same cases like with my brother, we can be good friends, we can respect one
[00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:04.140]   another, we can talk about all kinds of things that we can talk about but there are just
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:09.700]   certain things that for whatever reason we can't seem to understand.
[00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:15.260]   We're both with the best of intentions trying at the deepest levels, we just can't seem
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:20.180]   to understand how one another thinks or why someone struggles with something.
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:25.140]   And to add to that, probably we have the same thing is that we can't understand our own
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.140]   hearts as to why we struggle with certain things.
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:35.300]   There are some areas of my life where my behavior is objectively superb and there are some areas
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.740]   of my life where my behavior is objectively terrible.
[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:42.500]   And you go through any process where you set a goal and you think this should be simple,
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.380]   this should be obvious and you fail at it again and again and again and you think what
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.380]   is wrong with me?
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.820]   It's like how is it that in one area of my life I can be such a high performer and in
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.620]   another area of my life I can be such a loser?
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.180]   And even just understanding ourselves is difficult.
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:21:02.940]   So my hope is that I can do a good job.
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.420]   I'll do the best job I have possible.
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:11.880]   I'll do the best job that I'm able to with the skills, resources, knowledge, etc.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:17.100]   And I appreciate critiques and feedback because I'll try to even consider it and ponder them
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.380]   and try to think about how to do it better.
[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:23.840]   But at the end of the day this is one of the reasons I'm so excited about the revolution
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:29.260]   in connectivity that we have that any other individual who also has similar skills or
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:35.300]   different skills or complementary skills can go and create content, attract an audience
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:40.420]   and be able to provide useful feedback and useful advice with a completely different
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.820]   perspective.
[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:43.700]   And that's probably what is necessary.
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:50.260]   So if you find that I'm unable to articulate something in a way that's truly helpful, don't
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:51.260]   stick with me.
[00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:55.380]   Go and find someone else and look for someone else until you find someone who speaks your
[00:21:55.380 --> 00:22:00.060]   version of brain language in a way that really connects on a deep level.
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:02.300]   Thank you.
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.380]   That's helpful.
[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:08.380]   And for the record, I do appreciate all of your mindsets.
[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.860]   It's been tremendously helpful in my life.
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:14.700]   I thought that was it.
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:23.940]   And I will keep trying to talk appropriately about mindset without becoming just another
[00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:28.860]   guru who makes his money by telling people that they should believe about money kind
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:29.860]   of the way that I do.
[00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:30.860]   Anything else, Andy?
[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:31.860]   No, I think that's good.
[00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:32.860]   Thank you.
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:33.860]   And you're definitely not one of those gurus.
[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:34.860]   Not yet.
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:35.860]   There's still time.
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:36.860]   There's still time.
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:37.860]   We all start somewhere.
[00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:38.860]   I'm going to go ahead and close out the show.
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:39.860]   Thank you.
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:40.860]   Thank you.
[00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:41.860]   We all start somewhere.
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:42.860]   I'm just kidding.
[00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:43.860]   All right, Marcus in Virginia.
[00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:44.860]   Marcus, welcome to the show.
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:45.860]   How can I serve you today?
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:46.860]   I'm doing well, Joshua.
[00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:47.860]   Can you hear me?
[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:48.860]   Sounds good.
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:49.860]   Yes, sir.
[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:50.860]   I'm happy to be here.
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:51.860]   A long time listening to your show.
[00:22:51.860 --> 00:23:00.980]   Epic, epic show episode you did on the last call where you talked about the experiences
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.580]   of what men are experiencing in church.
[00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:03.820]   I love that episode.
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:07.740]   I pulled over and screamed to the roofs off when you said what you said.
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:10.380]   So thank you for what you do.
[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:11.380]   I'm calling you.
[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:12.380]   I need some advice.
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:17.900]   I'm an entrepreneur, but I've fallen into the trap of doing that hybrid situation where
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:22.460]   I'm working a nine to five, but I also have several entrepreneurial endeavors on the side
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:26.180]   that generate passive income for me.
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:28.380]   I am tired.
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:37.060]   I am exhausted because I have a logistics company that I do Monday through Friday from
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:43.540]   8 a.m. to 3 p.m. virtually.
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:51.060]   And then Wednesday through Sunday I work IT help desk at night.
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.700]   And that's Wednesday through Sunday.
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:57.460]   And I do it from 3 p.m. in the afternoon to midnight.
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:00.660]   So I'm exhausted.
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:08.780]   So my question is I want to give up the IT job because the logistics job that I have
[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:15.320]   or the self-employed thing that I do on the side, I can make the same amount of money
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:21.580]   doing that that I make doing the IT help desk at night.
[00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:26.300]   And I would make the exact same amount of money that I make per month.
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:31.560]   I would just beef up the amount of deliveries that my logistics business does.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.660]   And I would make the same amount of money.
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:38.720]   The job gives me medical dental vision, and I've calculated what that is.
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:45.500]   And I pay through my employer $331 a month to have the employer benefits and HSA and
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:46.660]   all that.
[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:53.380]   But with Obamacare, I can do the same thing and get a plan for the same amount or a little
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:54.420]   bit more.
[00:24:54.420 --> 00:25:00.140]   So for medical and dental.
[00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:05.620]   And so I wanted to call in and ask, do I go the self-employed route?
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:07.180]   Because I'm tired.
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:12.420]   To give you a breakdown of why, I do medical carrier work and I do medical equipment delivery.
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:15.860]   So I deliver specimens, labs, pharmaceuticals from hospitals.
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.700]   A lot of hospitals where I live.
[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:23.300]   And I get paid about $6 to $12 per package.
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:30.780]   And on average, Monday through Friday, I deliver about anywhere from 21 to 32 packages a day.
[00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:38.820]   And I can do that in four hours, which gives me the rest of my day to do everything else.
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:44.200]   So in essence, I make more per day, just taking on more deliveries versus working a nine to
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.620]   five job for eight hours.
[00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:48.700]   The equivalent is I'm working eight hours and I'm making less.
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:49.700]   Does that make sense?
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:50.700]   I understand.
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:51.860]   How old are you right now?
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.860]   So I'm 36.
[00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:55.980]   I just made 36 in December.
[00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:56.980]   December.
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:58.900]   Thank you.
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:25:59.900]   And are you married?
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:00.900]   Single children?
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:02.900]   Single, no kids.
[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:03.900]   Okay.
[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.300]   Tell me the vision.
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:10.180]   What's the vision five years from now?
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:19.380]   The vision, if I continue to follow your show, is family, married, but I'm not this absentee
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:20.380]   father, right?
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.420]   I'm home.
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:22.420]   I'm present.
[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:28.220]   I can be home because of my investments and my different compensation, the different businesses
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:31.460]   that I have on the side that supplement my income.
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:34.540]   Right now I'm a veteran, so I received disability compensation.
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:40.720]   I have a cannabis dispensary vending machine business.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:44.460]   I just picked up my second location.
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.900]   And so that's going to grow.
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:49.820]   I have a third machine on the way.
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:54.780]   I have an ATM portfolio of about 10 to 13 ATMs that produce cashflow for me.
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:58.860]   I have three rental properties that kick off.
[00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:04.540]   So as you can see, I have a progression towards affluence, right?
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:10.020]   And I'm working towards one day just being completely self-sustaining so I can be home.
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:15.220]   So I can be home and daddy doesn't have to be this apparition that you see pictures of
[00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:18.820]   him all over the world, but he's not home because he has to work three jobs.
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:19.820]   That's what I grew up in.
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:25.020]   My dad worked three jobs to support 11 siblings.
[00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:26.820]   And so I don't want that.
[00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:28.580]   And so that's the vision.
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:34.820]   But coming out of COVID, to give you some insight, I almost lost my life to COVID in
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.780]   2021.
[00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:40.780]   I got sick and I was hospitalized for a month and a half.
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:46.980]   And last year, the company that does the logistics, the dispatching company that sends us the
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:51.500]   deliveries, they lost a major hospital.
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:56.420]   The hospital had just fired us because they put out a bid and someone outbid us and won
[00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:57.580]   the contract.
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:03.020]   Now luckily the company couldn't do what we do, so they fired them and brought us back.
[00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:08.060]   So we're back up and running as if normal and the income is fine, but it's self-employed
[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.660]   income and Virginia is an at-will state.
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:16.540]   So they have the ability to lay you off and we can't have them sign a long-term contract
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:21.100]   saying, "Hey, you have to work with us for at least five years.
[00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:25.000]   You can't just terminate us like you did before."
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.100]   So hence my apprehension.
[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.500]   The IT help desk job is not a necessary job.
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:36.220]   It's a hedge against a potential loss of the contract again.
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.220]   Okay.
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:38.220]   But I'm tired.
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:39.220]   Understood.
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.100]   How much money do you currently...
[00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:44.380]   What's your current net worth?
[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:48.460]   Current net worth is 400,000.
[00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:54.700]   And across all of your sources of income, what is your current monthly income?
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:58.260]   My currently monthly income, I mean, there's real...
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:01.900]   Ballpark, ballpark, just big numbers, big numbers.
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.460]   About 8,000 a month.
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:07.540]   And current monthly expenses, big picture.
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:15.060]   Big picture monthly expenses about monthly or...
[00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:17.060]   Yes, monthly.
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:24.540]   Monthly expenses are about 6,000.
[00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:29.460]   Why are your monthly expenses so high for a single guy?
[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:33.100]   They're high because of debt.
[00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:39.740]   I don't require money to do some of these entrepreneurial and different...
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:40.740]   These things.
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.100]   I'm not including the rental properties.
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.220]   So the rental properties have mortgages on them.
[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.420]   So I'm just including the personal debt.
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:47.420]   Okay.
[00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:48.580]   So that's enough personal details for the moment.
[00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:50.220]   We'll come back to it in a moment.
[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:54.140]   One more question and then I'll give you some thoughts.
[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:58.860]   What is the biggest obstacle for you?
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:06.680]   What is the biggest impediment or obstacle right now for you?
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:13.860]   What don't you have enough of right now that you would need in order to go up two levels
[00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:16.900]   in your current wealth building plan?
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:22.200]   What is holding you back at the moment more than anything else?
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.340]   To go up two levels in an IT job, I need certain...
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:26.340]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:28.500]   Two levels in your overall plan.
[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:29.500]   I'm just...
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:30.500]   Think big picture.
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:33.780]   What's keeping you from doubling up over the next couple of years?
[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:34.780]   Is it lack of money?
[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:35.780]   Is it lack of time?
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:36.780]   Is it lack of energy?
[00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:37.780]   Is it lack of context?
[00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:46.300]   What's the biggest impediment to your significant success over the next couple of years?
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:47.620]   Lack of time.
[00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:48.620]   Okay.
[00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:55.340]   What would you do if you had more time available under your control?
[00:30:55.340 --> 00:31:07.220]   I would double down and focus on getting more ATMs, getting the second CBD dispensary profitable,
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:12.620]   getting the rental properties are going, and I'll take more deliveries, the logistics business,
[00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:18.140]   but the goal is to get rid of that eventually too, because it's me delivering those packages.
[00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:21.940]   And that's not sustainable long-term for my age and body wise.
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:22.940]   I can't...
[00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:26.420]   When it's a great day, it's a great day, but when it's snowing, it hurts.
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:28.380]   When it's raining, it hurts.
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:30.040]   And I have to do those deliveries.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.500]   So that will be gone.
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.120]   That's the goal to get rid of that too.
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:38.380]   And so replacing that passive income so that I can have...
[00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:46.620]   If I had more time, I would increase the vendings, the ATMs, and the real estate.
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:47.940]   Okay.
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:50.840]   The first thing I would point out, this is a pet peeve of mine.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:54.700]   You didn't do anything wrong, but I don't think you have a single source of passive
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:55.860]   income.
[00:31:55.860 --> 00:32:00.740]   You have several businesses that provide you with residual income, but you work very hard
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:02.660]   for every dollar that you make.
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:10.660]   And I point this out because I think that people with a mindset of building various
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:16.140]   businesses, investments, et cetera, are often attracted to the term of passive income.
[00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:20.940]   You say, "Well, if I own a string of ATMs or a string of cannabis dispensing vending
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.140]   machines," or whatever the version is, it's passive.
[00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:24.920]   No, it's not passive.
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:28.800]   You have to work really, really hard to go out and find those locations, to place your
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:29.800]   machines there.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:33.780]   You have to work to go and service them, to keep them in proper running order.
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:35.940]   The income is residual.
[00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:37.440]   It may grow over time.
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:42.200]   It may even be, in some cases, exponential, but it is not passive.
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:47.200]   And so I used to use passive income for that term, but I think that when we use passive
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:51.120]   income for that kind of stuff, we're selling a lie.
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:55.280]   And what's happening is the reason it's important to be honest is that if we're not honest with
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:33:01.240]   the fact of what it is and what it's not, then we may be successful and not actually
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.240]   realize it.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:06.260]   So, if we were to go back 10 years and I were to tell you that if you woke up with three
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:13.360]   rental houses and 10 ATMs and three vending machines, wouldn't you feel like you were
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.360]   winning?
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.360]   You would have said, "Of course I'd feel like I'm winning.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.140]   I'd be doing amazing."
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:20.480]   But in reality, you don't currently feel like you're winning because you're hustling all
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.200]   the time, even though you've built this infrastructure.
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:33.860]   So I exclusively reserve the use of the term passive income to things like dividends and
[00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:38.900]   stock appreciation from publicly traded companies that I don't manage, control, or even choose
[00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:40.900]   among necessarily.
[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:48.480]   And I'm also willing to consider it for something like royalties, where it's an intellectual
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:53.820]   property that has been done and created and it's not something that I'm trying to enhance,
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:56.140]   not something I'm trying to build, et cetera.
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:34:00.880]   And since most of the time, even when we create royalties, we're generally trying to continue
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:04.520]   to grow the brand and not just live on the current royalties.
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:09.700]   Since that's the case, then I usually just use it for stocks because that's the only
[00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:14.260]   thing that's actually truly passive, that you truly do nothing for and have the income.
[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:15.460]   Everything else, I relabel it.
[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:23.900]   So I relabel it as residual income or renewals or a low, whatever word is appropriate for
[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:24.900]   it.
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:27.780]   But I don't label it as passive because it's not passive.
[00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:30.660]   And so that is kind of just a personal pet peeve that I think will be helpful to some
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:31.660]   people.
[00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:34.660]   It's not directly related to advice for your situation.
[00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:40.560]   Now back to your situation, you need to start always, begin with the end in mind.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:46.740]   And so when I asked you what the vision is, you said, "I'd like to be a family man and
[00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:50.140]   I'd like to be home with the children," et cetera.
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:54.300]   That's a, "I'd like to have enough money that I don't have to be gone all the time the way
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.900]   that my dad was with me."
[00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:56.900]   Do you agree?
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:57.900]   I agree.
[00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:58.900]   Okay.
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:04.580]   So question, are you currently dating anybody who might become the mother of your children?
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:06.300]   Yes.
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:07.900]   Okay.
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:17.860]   When will you know whether she's likely to become the mother of your child?
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:21.940]   Are we in the process of getting married and stuff?
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:22.940]   Yeah.
[00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.700]   Just saying, you said you're dating someone, great.
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:27.860]   We hadn't entered into the factor before.
[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:31.140]   So is this the kind of thing that, "Hey, a year from now, we'd like to have babies,"
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:35.100]   or "I don't even know, I just met her, it might be five years," or where are you in
[00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.100]   this process?
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:40.700]   How soon do you think realistically, based upon the prospect that's in your life right
[00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:43.700]   now, how soon do you think you might be having babies?
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:48.100]   A year and a half, two years.
[00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:49.100]   Okay.
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:50.100]   Awesome.
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:54.900]   So the reason I ask that is because one of the big, and this doesn't apply to you, just
[00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:59.420]   fact finding, but if you had said, "Well, I'm not dating anybody," one of my first points
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:03.900]   was going to be that you might be doing all this for reasons that aren't actually helpful,
[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:06.900]   meaning you're never going to meet a girl if you're spending all your time working and
[00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:08.260]   you're not going on dates.
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:11.300]   And so we got to get things in the right priority.
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:16.300]   And if you have a $400,000 net worth and you have a lot of goals and visions and things
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:20.260]   that you're trying to do, but your primary reason for doing those things is so that you
[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:25.660]   can be a present father with your children, then we got to remember that along the way
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:29.300]   we can't neglect to go and meet a wonderful girl and have children.
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:32.620]   And the longer that you wait to do that, the harder it becomes.
[00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:37.940]   And so don't settle for the idea that somehow it's going to be easy if you're 50 years old
[00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:40.340]   and you got all the money, that then that's the time to go and have babies.
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:44.700]   No, the time to have babies is now, as soon as you find and set up an appropriate family
[00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:48.260]   situation, find a girl who is going to be a good mother, marry her, et cetera, then
[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:49.980]   start having babies.
[00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:54.740]   Don't wait until 50 because the biggest, what we're looking for is to say, what is the biggest
[00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:55.980]   obstacle?
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:37:01.820]   And the biggest obstacle to you living that kind of life that you described is not financial.
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:05.620]   If you have a $400,000 net worth and you're 36 years old and you're a hardworking guy
[00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:09.420]   with all of these businesses that you're working on and properties that you're controlling,
[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:12.580]   et cetera, you are dramatically ahead of the curve.
[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:17.460]   You're so far ahead of many other people that you have to then make sure that you're not
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:19.780]   getting focused on a fake goal.
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:24.460]   And financial independence is in some cases, and even in many cases, a fake goal.
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:30.620]   You don't need to be financially independent with $2 million in the bank and $100,000 of
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:36.060]   passive income, truly passive income, in order for you to be a present father.
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:37.260]   It's not that difficult.
[00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:39.060]   You don't actually need that.
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:44.900]   And so I used to think I needed that and then I found I didn't.
[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:49.940]   And basically just to share kind of my story is that I became obsessed with the FIRE movement
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:56.380]   early on and I had something similar of a vision to what you have.
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:02.460]   I wanted to be, it wasn't so much to be, I always knew I was going to be a very present
[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:08.140]   father because I couldn't conceive of anything different, but it wasn't to sit home all day.
[00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:11.140]   And I don't think actually, by the way, as a man, I don't think that should be your ambition,
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:12.820]   but I'll come back to that in a moment.
[00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:15.860]   But it was more of a matter of being in control of my life.
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:17.860]   I wanted to be able to come and go as I wanted.
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:21.520]   I wanted to be able to fulfill my vision of the things I wanted to do with my children.
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:26.580]   And virtually none of those things involved me having the constraints of a job requiring
[00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:29.180]   me to go to the job all the time.
[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:33.660]   And so when I sat down and looked at it, the first thing I came across when I finally became
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:37.300]   clued into the world of early retirement, I was like, "Well, I'll do this with money."
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:41.540]   So I started working, working, working, practicing extreme frugality, saving, et cetera, but
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:47.340]   I got my timing wrong because here I was married, having babies, et cetera, and I realized the
[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:53.980]   entire edifice of early retirement doesn't work for me because it would destroy the most
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:56.880]   important years for me to actually accomplish the goal.
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.340]   So I need a different goal.
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:03.420]   And what I realized was the single biggest obstacle for me living my life the way I wanted
[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:09.620]   to live was simply to have a job or a business that provided me with flexibility and enough
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:11.220]   money to live on.
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:16.020]   Because if I said, "If I have enough money to live on and I can make this job or business
[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:21.780]   from anywhere, then it provides me with basically all of the lifestyle of being financially
[00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:26.220]   independent except the ultimate ease to know that I can lie around in bed all day and do
[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:27.220]   nothing."
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:39.860]   And I realized that Paula Pant has this great line that you can afford anything, but not
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:40.860]   everything.
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:42.460]   I don't know if she would talk about it.
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:44.740]   You can afford anything, but not everything.
[00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:46.060]   And I look at it like that way.
[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:52.300]   It's to say that my goal is to be able to do anything I wanted, but not to do nothing.
[00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:56.700]   And so financial independence would give me the opportunity to do nothing.
[00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.060]   So then the question is, is that necessary?
[00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:05.020]   Well, it's not necessary for me to do nothing, nor is it even particularly desirable.
[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:08.740]   Now I think we all have a sense in which we really want that to be the case.
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:13.580]   We want to sit back and do nothing because that appeals to us, but we all know deep down
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:16.340]   that that's not actually good for us.
[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:21.300]   We all know deep down that it doesn't actually feel good for a long period of time.
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:26.540]   And so if we can be a little bit rational and recognize that it's just not good for
[00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:31.140]   us to do nothing and it doesn't feel good to do nothing, then we can set the whole thing
[00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:32.180]   aside.
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:37.680]   And I came to the realization that financial independence is not a necessary step for me
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.180]   to live my life.
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:43.380]   And it also – and just to define the term here, what I mean by financial independence
[00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:48.180]   is the ability to live off of the passive income from my portfolio of investments rather
[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:52.780]   than from things that I'm actively working in and involved in, etc.
[00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:57.300]   So when you do that, it makes it much more feasible and achievable.
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:01.080]   And it's not that you can't and shouldn't accumulate assets and it's not that your
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:05.900]   ambition long-term shouldn't be to be able to live on the passive income from your portfolio
[00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:10.380]   of investments, but rather that it's not a necessary thing in order for you to live
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:12.980]   something like the life that you want to live.
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:19.460]   And so this was among many reasons, one of the reasons I became an entrepreneur.
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:28.360]   And the basic entrepreneurial businesses that I have pursued have been specifically chosen
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:33.920]   to provide me with the highest levels of flexibility and control over my life.
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:38.220]   And it hasn't always been easy and it's not easy, but I have always exercised that
[00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:42.360]   control so at least I get that to myself.
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:45.180]   And one more comment because I guess it fits in here better than later when I was going
[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:46.180]   to say it.
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:54.560]   In terms of being an absentee father or a present father, as you know, I am a very devoted
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:42:01.020]   father, much more devoted and much more involved in the lives of my children than certainly
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:03.540]   the vast majority of fathers out there.
[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:06.980]   There are various memes and jokes and they're real, they're true in terms of people go
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:10.380]   and say, "Dad, do you know the birthdays of your kids?"
[00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:13.020]   And things like that.
[00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:17.180]   I am very, very involved with my children.
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:22.260]   Still however, I believe that that's a false god, a false idol, a false goal even.
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:33.200]   That the definition of success for a parent, especially for a father, is not measured by
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:39.940]   your physical presence 168 hours a week.
[00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:40.940]   That's not the goal.
[00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:50.420]   And in fact, having that as the goal I think can in and of itself be a rather damaging
[00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:56.580]   form of helicopter parenting taken to the extreme.
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:43:03.440]   I'm probably currently living the most extreme lifestyle in terms of physical presence because
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:07.800]   my wife and I live a very home-focused lifestyle.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:13.840]   But I'm still acutely aware of how important it is, especially as my children grow older,
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:15.960]   that I not always be there.
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:19.760]   And so it's just kind of a false goal.
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:25.240]   In addition, I think it's a goal that can become a very feminine ideal rather than a
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:27.020]   masculine ideal.
[00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:32.580]   What I mean is that your wife doesn't probably actually want you there all the time.
[00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:37.280]   And if you were there all the time, she probably is not going to be very attracted to you.
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:42.040]   Because as a father, you want to be setting an example.
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:47.360]   And part of that example involves a high degree of involvement with your children in their
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:49.340]   lives, et cetera.
[00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:58.100]   But there's also another important component in which your destiny is to be a visionary
[00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:03.340]   leader of society in addition to your family.
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:06.820]   And there'll be different periods in your life at which you're more with your family
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:08.820]   and periods at which you're more with your society.
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:13.340]   I wouldn't go and run for political office now, as an example.
[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:19.940]   But I also don't want to have my ambition to be completely at home and just to be there
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:25.020]   all the time as a full-time, never-leaving, stay-at-home dad.
[00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:26.900]   I don't think that's really healthy for dads.
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:31.740]   I don't think it's healthy for children any more than it's healthy for moms to have the
[00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:36.120]   only and exclusive thing that they do be their home and their children.
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:40.820]   Because then when their children are gone, what do they have left?
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:43.100]   There needs to be other dimensions of life.
[00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:46.220]   So as adults, we all need to have a multivaried lifestyle.
[00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:50.700]   Now, I doubt you'd agree with any of those things, but my first instinct in listening
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:58.780]   to what you're saying to me is that you don't have to achieve on this intense of a time
[00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:05.120]   schedule in order for you to accomplish your goal, which is to be a present father.
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:14.080]   You can dial back the intensity a partial amount and still achieve your goals because
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:22.480]   you've done the necessary foundational work in order to see to the success and the future
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.000]   of your family.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.640]   So that's kind of big overarching point number one, is that when we get clear about the goal,
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:34.440]   which is to be a present father, then what we should see from that is that it's not necessary
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:38.520]   that you be entirely financially independent, able to live exclusively from the income from
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:44.200]   your portfolio in order for you to do that, nor is it particularly even desirable, especially
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:50.000]   in the first few years when you're dealing with very small children, et cetera.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:55.640]   Where I think the sweet spot is where you want to be the maximally available is somewhere
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:46:02.400]   around I would say maybe seven, age about seven to about age 13.
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:08.320]   To me that's the sweet spot where as a father being with my children all day every day just
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:09.680]   feels like a dream.
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:16.400]   The reason I say that is somewhere around the age of seven, then children become intellectually
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:21.800]   active enough for me to really enjoy being together with them, talking with them, teaching
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:23.680]   them, et cetera.
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:27.400]   Whereas before that they're babies, they're children and the games and things like that
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:32.640]   are very simple and they're not super intellectually fulfilling and you don't feel like you're
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:38.160]   shaping the destiny of the child when you're doing those simple things.
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:43.520]   You are, you still should do those simple playing together and being together, et cetera,
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:47.040]   but it doesn't have anywhere near the same feeling that I have when a child is old enough
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:50.000]   to be intellectually curious, et cetera.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:55.360]   Then I say 12 or 13 because by the age of 12 or 13 we want to be very, very intentionally
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:47:01.320]   pushing children towards independence and very, very strong forms of independence.
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:06.560]   Those strong forms of independence means that just quite literally not with us.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:12.480]   We want to be pushing children to adult roles as they're capable in their early teens and
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:18.240]   throughout but keeping the relationship one of connection but not the day-to-day always
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.160]   being physically present.
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:25.480]   You need them to be going out into the world on their own, away from you, into their own
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:29.740]   unique circumstances so they can fight the battles of life, be exposed to the challenges
[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:33.600]   of life, et cetera, and then be connected back with you.
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.040]   Those are big words with lots of different ways of applying it.
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:41.880]   What I mean is that the sweet spot in my mind is basically 7 to 13 and you give or take
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:46.120]   a year or two here and whenever it's convenient for you, but that's where you definitely want
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:54.920]   to have maximum connection, maximum freedom in your life and in your schedule.
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:57.080]   Let's pivot now back to the money.
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:01.000]   The first point I'm trying to make broadly is simply that you don't need to achieve full
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:11.120]   financial independence and that what you need to achieve is control over your schedule and
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:16.720]   enough money to provide a comfortable living for your family under your own terms and that
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:22.600]   could probably be achieved as an initial step along the way as you're working towards full
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.240]   independence.
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:28.400]   If that's true, then you should look at all the different opportunities and say, "What
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:33.560]   are the opportunities that are leading me to this potential outcome?"
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:37.360]   If we talk about the three or four things that you've said, each of them is going to
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:38.360]   have a different constraint.
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:43.240]   You have a logistics job and when you labeled it logistics, that was a job that you said
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:46.800]   of doing medical deliveries for a per delivery fee, is that correct?
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:49.400]   Yeah, per package fee.
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:50.400]   Yes, sir.
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:51.400]   Okay.
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:57.280]   You have a logistics job and that sounds to me as basically a dead-end job that pays you
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:01.680]   a decent rate in a pretty quick amount of time, is that correct?
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:02.680]   Correct.
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:03.680]   All right.
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:09.960]   IT job, that sounds like a fixed job and how much do you make with the IT job?
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:12.680]   $21.50 an hour.
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:17.680]   Is there a future that you're interested in with the IT job of advancing in some way?
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:24.360]   Yes, but it requires those higher level certifications, which the tests aren't easy.
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:30.520]   I've attempted one of the certifications and failed and those are $500, $600 tests.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:35.480]   I don't want to keep, I want to be able to commit the time.
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:42.040]   I feel there's a future in IT, hence why I got into it this way, but the higher pay comes
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:44.520]   with advanced certifications.
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:51.760]   And then with regard to these other businesses, what is the constraint right now of your growing
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:57.240]   the ATM business?
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:02.000]   Right now, the ATMs are growing.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.360]   I fill them, they operate, they run.
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:12.320]   I have 12 ATMs, 10 of them active, two of them in my garage.
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:14.280]   And so I haven't placed those two yet.
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:20.880]   And the ATMs, the beauty about them is as the money grows, it's just recycled money.
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:25.040]   So the cash that's flowing inside of them, it takes me seconds.
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:31.040]   Go to the bank, fill them up, put $5,000, $10,000 in there, and then I don't have to
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:36.040]   visit that ATM for two to three months as the income goes.
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:42.920]   So it becomes more relaxed and less obstructive as time passes.
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:46.120]   And how much money can you earn from one ATM?
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:52.580]   What do you expect or forecast as your normal operating income from one ATM?
[00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:57.000]   Just a mean ATM, not the best one, not your worst one, but just a normal average ATM of
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.640]   your current 10?
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:02.040]   $800 a month.
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:03.040]   Okay.
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:12.760]   So right now with your 10 that are in the field, you're making say $6,000 a month?
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:13.760]   Yes.
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:14.760]   Okay.
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:18.720]   So we're getting pretty deep in the weeds.
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:23.060]   And for the sake of my podcast, I don't want to go deeply through each and every one of
[00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:28.140]   these things or provide the specific suggestions on each of these things.
[00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:30.740]   But let me just sketch it out in big picture.
[00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:34.820]   What you need to analyze is you need to analyze your constraints.
[00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:42.940]   And so a homework assignment I would give you is write down each of your different jobs
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:43.940]   that you're doing.
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:50.500]   You have your logistics job, you have your IT job, you have your ATM job, and you have
[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:53.140]   your new cannabis vending machines jobs.
[00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:55.100]   And then you have your real estate job.
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:58.560]   And maybe something else as well that you're considering.
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:03.420]   You need to identify and think about that job individually.
[00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:07.860]   And then ask yourself a series of intelligent questions about it.
[00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:13.900]   I'm making up these questions on the spot, but these are the kinds of things that you
[00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:14.900]   want to think about.
[00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:22.420]   Number one would be something like, what is the ultimate opportunity that I have with
[00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:25.360]   this job/business/investment?
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:27.220]   So logistics job.
[00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:29.220]   Notice that that's kind of what I was hinting at.
[00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:34.340]   Logistics job is, all right, I can make a little cash, but it's kind of a dead end thing.
[00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:39.100]   They can hire anybody to drive around and deliver these things at the same fee that
[00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:40.240]   I'm making.
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:44.200]   So the long-term opportunity is not super great.
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:48.120]   On the other hand, with an IT job, you might say the long-term opportunity, if I had these
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:55.000]   five certifications, is I could make $75,000, $100,000 a year pretty comfortably with a
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.440]   pretty stable job, good security, et cetera.
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:01.160]   What's the long-term opportunity of the cannabis machines?
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:02.640]   I don't know, but you'll put that in.
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:05.700]   What's the long-term opportunity of the real estate, et cetera?
[00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:10.920]   So get clear on kind of what the best case long-term opportunity is.
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:13.840]   Another kind of question you would want to ask yourself is something along the lines
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:17.720]   of what is keeping me from maximizing this opportunity?
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:20.480]   So let me give two examples that are very obvious.
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:24.480]   What's keeping you from maximizing the logistics job?
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:26.720]   Well, one thing just might be the number of deliveries.
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:29.640]   There's just no more than four hours a day available.
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:30.640]   Okay, great.
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.820]   So you know that there's just not a market there.
[00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:37.880]   But then we get into things like, well, what's keeping me from maximizing the real estate
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:39.460]   business?
[00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:41.060]   It might be deal flow.
[00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:44.420]   There may not be any good investments that I can purchase right now.
[00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:48.420]   What is commonly the case with things like real estate businesses, well, what's keeping
[00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:54.420]   me from maximizing this is I don't have enough money for down payments on properties.
[00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:57.140]   Or this might be the same thing for another business.
[00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:59.620]   It's like, what's keeping me from buying more ATMs?
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:01.420]   You obviously have enough of them.
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:04.540]   So what's keeping you from doing there is not money.
[00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:07.780]   It's not even machines or availability of machines.
[00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:10.060]   It's availability of locations.
[00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:11.380]   What's keeping me from getting the locations?
[00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:15.820]   Well, the time to go out and talk to the business owner to wherever your placement scheme would
[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:18.420]   say that you would put one of those machines in.
[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:22.120]   And so in order for that to create, you have to have more time.
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:25.900]   And so if you look at these and you go through them one at a time and you ask yourself some
[00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:30.460]   intelligent questions, another kind of question would be, what's the long-term vision?
[00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:34.700]   Is this something that I would be doing in the long term, five years from now when I've
[00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:37.220]   got two children at home or not?
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:44.180]   And so example would be if you've got ATM machines that are making you $800 each and
[00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:48.340]   it's super simple for you to make your rounds with whatever frequency you need to to replace
[00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:50.080]   the cash, et cetera.
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:56.540]   And lo and behold, you can have 20 of them making say $15,000 a month from 20 machines.
[00:54:56.540 --> 00:54:59.800]   Obviously that's something that you're still going to be doing five years from now.
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:02.940]   On the other hand, you're not going to be doing the logistics job.
[00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:10.860]   So you need to free up your time, which is your most valuable asset.
[00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:17.860]   And you need to drop off your lowest returning activities of time from your schedule so that
[00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:22.420]   you have the time to invest in your highest returning opportunities.
[00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:28.460]   Because right now you have full control over your time and you have 168 hours a week.
[00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:34.860]   So you need to get rid of anything that is not the highest and best use of your time
[00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:38.980]   and focus in on the things that are the highest and best use of your time.
[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:42.820]   And in order for you to do that, you need to analyze and be clear what is the highest
[00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:46.540]   and best use of my time and then do more of that.
[00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:52.020]   And I guess the best image for this comes down to basic idea of an hourly wage.
[00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:58.300]   If you set yourself an hourly or an annual wage target, so the obvious example is if
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:03.580]   somebody is earning, you know, somebody wants to earn $100,000 a year.
[00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:06.660]   Well, $100,000 a year is $20.
[00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:09.140]   Hold on.
[00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:10.580]   What's the mathematical relationship?
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:14.700]   There's a simple formula that just flipped me.
[00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:19.020]   So $100,000 a year, divide that into 50 weeks, give yourself.
[00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:21.860]   >> 100,000 a year?
[00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:23.860]   >> Yeah, just a second.
[00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:24.860]   >> Divided by 50 weeks?
[00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:25.860]   >> All right.
[00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:26.860]   So that's $50 an hour.
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:27.860]   There we go.
[00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:32.860]   I forgot the mathematical relationship between the hourly rate and the annual outcome.
[00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:37.860]   So if you make $50 an hour on average for a 40-hour week for a 50-week year, then you
[00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:40.420]   make $100,000 a year.
[00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:46.540]   And so if you're making right now $50,000 a year, then what you have to focus on is
[00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:52.140]   you have to say, how do I go from doing $25 an hour work to doing $50 an hour work?
[00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:57.740]   Now if you want to go from $100,000 a year to a million dollars a year, you have to go
[00:56:57.740 --> 00:57:03.060]   from doing $50 an hour work to doing $500 an hour work.
[00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:05.980]   The problem is that you only have a certain number of hours.
[00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:12.140]   And so any hour that you work for below your target hourly rate, that's an hour that you
[00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:13.300]   can never get back.
[00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:18.040]   And that's an hour that is going to keep you from achieving your ultimate long-term goal.
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:23.740]   And so if you're doing medical deliveries at $6 to $12 a package, and you're going and
[00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:29.300]   let's just say it's $6 a package, and you're delivering four of those in an hour, and you're
[00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:35.860]   making $24 an hour, but your goal is to make $100,000 a year, you can't do that anymore.
[00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:40.820]   Because making those deliveries is keeping you from doing $50 an hour work that's going
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:43.740]   to make you $100,000 a year, et cetera.
[00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:49.720]   So the point is that you have to systematically prune out of your schedule the low return
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:55.620]   activities and put in the highest returning activities and always focus on the most important
[00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:56.740]   things.
[00:57:56.740 --> 00:58:02.020]   And this is just a variation of an application of the 80/20 principle, which is simply that
[00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:05.980]   20% of your activities are going to give you 80% of your results.
[00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:10.040]   And financially, 20% of your investments are going to give you 80% of your outcomes.
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:16.400]   Or 20% of your decisions are going to give you 80% of your long-term results, et cetera.
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:25.300]   So you need to decide and prioritize what is your most, your best returning business.
[00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:32.400]   You need to do that in light of your goal of whatever your lifestyle goal is, and then
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:38.500]   systematically get rid of everything that you're doing that doesn't, is not necessary
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:40.460]   for you to achieve that goal.
[00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:45.660]   So if your highest returning business is ATMs, then you should be focused, laser focused
[00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:47.680]   on placing those ATMs.
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:52.620]   And the only reason you would bring something else in, like an IT job or a logistics job
[00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:56.980]   or et cetera, is because it's giving you something that is otherwise a constraint.
[00:58:56.980 --> 00:59:01.780]   So there's a lot of guys who will have a job, and they'll have a job because that job gives
[00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:06.940]   them income that they're using to save for a down payment or to, you know, buy more Bitcoin
[00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:09.220]   miners, or buy more ATMs, et cetera.
[00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:10.580]   You need cashflow.
[00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:15.060]   And so a job is a good provider of cashflow for you, but that job can't be getting in
[00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:18.720]   the way of your businesses, and it can't be destroying your health, et cetera.
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:20.060]   So I want to stop it there.
[00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:22.900]   Does that kind of method of analysis make enough sense to you that you think you can
[00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:26.540]   take it a few steps further on your own?
[00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:27.940]   I think so.
[00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:34.900]   I feel like I want to get rid of the IT job because my highest returning, even though
[00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:41.340]   it's, my highest returning is the logistics because I make 192 in four hours.
[00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:43.420]   And that's not four hours because I'm limited to four hours.
[00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:49.020]   That's four hours because I'm that quick with, I have 32 deliveries per day average.
[00:59:49.020 --> 01:00:01.940]   And so at $6, that's 192, where I'm working eight hours for 2150, 2150, and I'm making
[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:03.100]   172.
[01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:08.140]   So the highest use of my time is the logistics temporarily to make the extra cash so that
[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:16.260]   I can invest in the more residual income so that I can eventually walk away from it.
[01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:18.460]   That's what is screaming out to me.
[01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:19.460]   Sure, sure.
[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:25.900]   So as you're making those decisions, just don't discount the long-term value of something
[01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:28.740]   that could be very useful for your family in the future.
[01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:30.620]   So I don't want to add more confusion.
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:36.420]   But what I would say is that if you can get a few certifications, having always a great
[01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:39.420]   backup career can be a good move for you as well.
[01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:40.420]   You probably don't need it.
[01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:41.420]   Actually, nevermind.
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:42.420]   I take that back.
[01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:44.540]   You have enough net worth at this point in time that you should be fine.
[01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:48.220]   You should be able to handle those details.
[01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:56.020]   And if you can just keep pressing forward on your businesses and you don't need the
[01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:57.940]   cash from the IT job, give it up.
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:00:59.860]   You can always go back and get it in the future.
[01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:05.300]   And if the logistics job is enough to give you cash flow in a short amount of time, then
[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:06.300]   that's fine too.
[01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:09.180]   I'm going to quit there just because we've gone pretty deep into it.
[01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:11.540]   Call me back on a future Q&A show and we can dig further.
[01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:15.940]   I just want to close with this, close yours and I go on to the next caller, close my comments
[01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:23.860]   to you to say, get clear on what you want, as clear as possible.
[01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:30.660]   Imagine what is necessary to get you what you want and then think about what the constraints
[01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:33.700]   are to getting you on that pathway.
[01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:39.420]   And then only do what you need to do and then use that as kind of the filtering framework
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:40.420]   for what you're doing.
[01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:43.340]   And then call me back on a future show and we can go through the details again.
[01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:44.340]   Tyler in Bogota.
[01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:45.340]   Tyler, welcome to the show.
[01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:46.340]   How can I serve you today?
[01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:49.340]   >>Tyler: Hey, not actually in Bogota, but thanks, Joshua.
[01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:53.380]   >>Joshua: Your VPN is in Bogota today, so that works great.
[01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:54.380]   >>Tyler: Yes.
[01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:57.180]   Yeah, I had a quick question.
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:00.900]   You've talked in the past several times, at least you've mentioned it, about that you
[01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:05.780]   treat some of your whole life insurance policies as a glorified emergency fund.
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:12.940]   I have both myself and my wife have annual renewable policies that have conversion options
[01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:14.140]   on them.
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:17.460]   And I was just kind of thinking through, wondering if you could maybe walk me through your thought
[01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:22.460]   process on how much you would recommend having in whole life if you were to use it as an
[01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:23.780]   emergency fund.
[01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:24.780]   How would go about doing that?
[01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:29.940]   And maybe your thought process on thinking through what makes sense given our situation
[01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:34.300]   and how much you might recommend that we keep in that kind of setup.
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:35.740]   >>Joshua: Yeah.
[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:39.980]   Let me give you kind of a big picture framework to that and then you can decide if we want
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:47.380]   to talk more details rather than kind of just probing for specifics in your situation.
[01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:54.780]   So first of all, I think you have to value life insurance.
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:57.260]   You value life insurance such that you have it.
[01:02:57.260 --> 01:03:01.420]   Somebody who doesn't value life insurance shouldn't buy whole life insurance of any
[01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:03.940]   kind because it doesn't value life insurance.
[01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:10.700]   Number two, you need to value having insurance that is enforced forever, that is permanent.
[01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:14.820]   And that is necessary.
[01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:18.800]   It can't be something where you just don't care at all about the insurance.
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:21.660]   You have to actually appreciate having insurance.
[01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:25.120]   And what that means is that generally you're going to be someone of a certain financial
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:31.140]   class and a certain asset base where the idea of having insurance that's around when you
[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:35.900]   die at 107, it feels good and you can see how that can be useful and appropriate.
[01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:42.900]   Now most people, their first initial steps are to say, "Well, okay, I could see that
[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:46.540]   it would be nice to have a little bit of money around that's around forever.
[01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:51.820]   So maybe there would be $50,000 for a funeral and final expenses, and it might be nice to
[01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:56.940]   have another $50,000 for cash," or whatever number is relevant for your situation.
[01:03:56.940 --> 01:04:01.460]   And so when I used to sell life insurance, I would often start with a $100,000 policy,
[01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:02.780]   something like that.
[01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:07.660]   And then you go and the idea is that I'm solving for death benefit first, which is always the
[01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:10.500]   appropriate ethical way to sell life insurance.
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:15.780]   Quite literally, you can't buy a life insurance policy unless there's a justification for
[01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:18.180]   the death benefit.
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:26.700]   So if you go and you look and you say, "$100,000 of death benefit for me, $100,000 death benefit
[01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:28.820]   for my wife, what does that look like in premiums?"
[01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:31.780]   And you talk to an insurance agent and the insurance agent says, "Well, your premiums
[01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:33.700]   for that are X number of dollars per month."
[01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:37.940]   And you look at an illustration and you say, "All right, where is this going to be in five
[01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:41.320]   years in terms of cash accumulation, et cetera?
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:44.460]   Is that a number that's relevant to my life?"
[01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:51.860]   So for someone who's making $150,000 a year, then to have some life insurance policies
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:05:00.220]   that might be a death benefit of $100,000 and might after, sorry, total $200,000 for
[01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:05.820]   the family and might have, say, $30,000 of cash value after five years, something like
[01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:08.860]   that, that's an okay start on an emergency fund.
[01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:10.300]   It's a few months worth of expenses.
[01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:12.120]   It's a good start.
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:17.180]   But for someone who obviously is at different levels, you have to make it be more.
[01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:22.060]   And so you want to have enough money in the policy where it's actually going to make sense
[01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:26.460]   to where it's in the amount that you're targeting.
[01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:32.860]   And so if the number is really small from a cash accumulation perspective as compared
[01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:36.220]   to your goals, then you need to ramp up the total policy size.
[01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:40.900]   And then the two levers that you push there is you ramp up the death benefit, obviously,
[01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:46.460]   to have more capacity, and then you start smushing the premiums earlier into the policy.
[01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:50.260]   And so in many cases, if you can sit with an insurance agent, let's say you build a
[01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:55.900]   10-pay life program and your goal is to put 10 years' worth of premiums and it's an amount
[01:05:55.900 --> 01:06:05.820]   that feels good, like this will be a good amount of money that's there in my emergency
[01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:09.740]   fund for myself, then that'll provide you with a starting point and you get there based
[01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:10.980]   upon premium.
[01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:13.420]   What this shouldn't do is it shouldn't do a few things.
[01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:19.260]   Number one, it shouldn't limit your other advantaged investing, so 401(k)s, things like
[01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:20.260]   that.
[01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:25.020]   This should be complementary to 401(k), Roth IRA, HSA, et cetera.
[01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:28.740]   It should not be instead of because I think that those things are superior to whole life
[01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:29.740]   insurance.
[01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:37.740]   Number two is it should not be something that is harming you, and there's other obvious
[01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:41.260]   stuff, so it shouldn't be keeping you from making a job change that you want to make,
[01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:45.380]   making a house change that you want to make, et cetera, making those lifestyle decisions.
[01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:48.660]   It should be a number that is significant but is also something that you can commit
[01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:53.820]   to kind of consistently because the problem with life insurance payments is they got to
[01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:55.820]   be made consistently.
[01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:59.540]   You can carve off a lump sum, put it in a bank account with the insurance company and
[01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:04.260]   just pay the policy from that if you have the money, but if you're doing this out of
[01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:08.980]   your just normal income, there's got to be an amount that is feasible, and that's feasible
[01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:13.220]   if you get laid off, that's feasible, et cetera.
[01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:16.700]   That's how I would always approach it, and then the details make sense.
[01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:18.140]   I guess I shouldn't have gone that route.
[01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:23.180]   I should have asked you numbers about your own situation, but if you talk with an insurance
[01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:27.180]   agent and you look at a policy and you look at your income and you look and you say what
[01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:33.060]   can I maintain over time, then it should be a fairly apparent number, and if you're looking
[01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:37.260]   for a percentage, you know, a few percent of annual income, 3 to 5 percent of annual
[01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:43.020]   income was often something that I would look at because that kind of percentage would never
[01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:50.340]   keep you from doing investments into retirement accounts, but it wasn't so significant that
[01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:56.300]   it – I wish I had answered it the other way, Tyler.
[01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:59.540]   Does that help at all or you want to get into some details of your situation?
[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:05.020]   Yeah, maybe just some details would be helpful because the reason I'm asking is I have a
[01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:09.300]   lot of idle cash on the sideline right now that are just in high yield savings accounts
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:16.860]   that I do value insurance and I kind of admired your philosophy of using the whole life policies
[01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:20.220]   as a venue for emergency savings.
[01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:23.660]   I just wasn't sure where the numbers shake out.
[01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:26.660]   And your income is how much?
[01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:27.660]   185.
[01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:29.940]   And current net worth is how much?
[01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:30.940]   About 750.
[01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:35.900]   Okay, and how much cash is currently on the side?
[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:37.820]   About 200.
[01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:42.080]   And right now, any idea what your expenses are, just ballpark either on a monthly or
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.080]   annual basis?
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:45.500]   About 5,500 a month.
[01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:48.340]   So you've got quite a lot of extra cash.
[01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:53.500]   So in that situation, I would say two things.
[01:08:53.500 --> 01:09:00.900]   Number one, when we're trying to do – so in what I have described, we're not trying
[01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:06.500]   to do bank on yourself or infinite banking or some kind of hardcore thing.
[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:11.780]   I think that can work in some circumstances but limited circumstances.
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:14.660]   So I'm setting that aside for the moment.
[01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:20.340]   So what we want to shoot for is an amount of money that we can do basically over 10
[01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:23.340]   years or so that's going to be really doable.
[01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:33.220]   And so if you looked at premiums of say $10,000 a year and you look at those policies, $10,000
[01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:36.960]   a year over 10 years would be $100,000 into a policy.
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:42.300]   That would buy you several hundred thousand dollars of permanent death benefit.
[01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:48.180]   You would break even in the cash value accumulation probably depending on the policy design within
[01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:52.260]   four to six years, three to five years, somewhere in that range.
[01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:57.240]   I got to be careful because I don't even have policy illustration tools anymore.
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:01.700]   And so I would look at something like $10,000 for the household.
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:10.060]   That would be a starting point and then just see how it feels.
[01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:14.980]   And if you've got $5,500 a month of expenses, you still have other…
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:21.900]   So maybe somewhere in that range, $4,000 a year for you, $4,000 for your wife, $8,000.
[01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:26.620]   That would be around less than 5% of your household income.
[01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:35.740]   I would talk to an agent and try to look at something in that range of like $8,000 a year
[01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:46.300]   for 10 years and then see what that would buy you.
[01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:52.580]   And I would make sure that a significant portion of it is additional premiums.
[01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:57.420]   So anything that's uncomfortable in time, if there's some kind of change, would be
[01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:01.580]   able to be dropped off if necessary as well.
[01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:06.380]   And then see what those numbers would feel like five to 10 years from now in terms of
[01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:07.700]   the amount of money in cash value.
[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:13.020]   Is that sufficient for you in terms of an emergency fund with your other things that
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:14.020]   you have as well?
[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:16.300]   >>BETSY EVES: Okay.
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:23.860]   And would you prioritize doing that cash flowing it as a premium or taking a lump sum?
[01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:24.860]   Do you have any preference?
[01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:26.420]   >>AJ DAHLIA: Well, you don't really have…
[01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:28.460]   So you only have two choices.
[01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:31.660]   So what we're trying to do, especially if this is going to be an emergency fund, is
[01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:35.260]   you can't run the risk of it becoming a modified endowment contract.
[01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:40.540]   And a modified endowment contract means that if your policy becomes a modified endowment
[01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:49.540]   contract, then you lose the ability to take a tax-free loan from the policy.
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:51.800]   And that kind of destroys the whole thing.
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:55.380]   So how does a contract become a modified endowment contract?
[01:11:55.380 --> 01:12:01.260]   Well, first of all, if you pay into it for fewer than seven years, it's automatically
[01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:03.740]   a modified endowment contract.
[01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:09.780]   And so single premium life insurance is a great product, and it's a modified endowment
[01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:11.500]   contract from day one.
[01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:16.780]   There is something called the seven-pay test that has to be met, that there's a ratio of
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:21.340]   death benefit to premiums, and that ratio can't be too high.
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:23.420]   I can't explain to you how you calculate it.
[01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:25.540]   It's in all the illustration software.
[01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:29.940]   But basically, you have to make sure that you have enough death benefit as compared
[01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:37.100]   to the ratio of death benefit to premium.
[01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:42.020]   And so you have to pay at least seven years of premiums into the contract, and you can't
[01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:45.660]   put so much in that it becomes unstable.
[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:48.380]   Unstable is not the right word.
[01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:53.260]   For whatever reason, about 20 minutes ago, my brain just turned off, so I apologize.
[01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:54.640]   So that's the rule.
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:58.260]   So in order to defeat that, you have to have a big enough policy, and you have to pay into
[01:12:58.260 --> 01:12:59.660]   it for a long enough period of time.
[01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:01.660]   So that's why I'm saying something like 10 years.
[01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:06.180]   A 10-year quick pay contract will never be a mech, but it's not something that you're
[01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:08.000]   planning to do forever.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.260]   And so that aggressive extra premiums and things that you put into it allows it to very
[01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:18.300]   quickly accumulate cash, unlike what we call an ordinary life contract, just a kind of
[01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:22.720]   a long-term, very slow thing that accumulates more in the long run.
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:30.900]   This kind of contract would fit your goal of developing a contract that would be suitable
[01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:34.700]   for your emergency fund.
[01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:39.040]   So you can't just put $200,000 into it on day one.
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:45.820]   What you can do is you can, the insurance companies all have some form of like a service
[01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:51.020]   account, an insurance servicing account, and those accounts can basically function like
[01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:52.800]   a cash management account.
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:58.900]   So if you want to have both of those things, you could take your $200,000 of cash, you
[01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:06.100]   could design a policy for your wife and for you that's total annual premiums of $20,000
[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:09.060]   per year, paid over 10 years.
[01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:12.620]   You could deposit your $200,000 with the insurance company.
[01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:18.140]   They will give you a normal market rate on your money, et cetera.
[01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:22.340]   They all have FDIC insured versions and things like that.
[01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:26.980]   And then they'll just take $20,000 a year from your $200,000 initial deposit and use
[01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:28.820]   that to pay the insurance premium.
[01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:30.980]   And then if you wanted the money back, you could do that later.
[01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:35.420]   So you could manage it in that way, but what you can't do is just make a lump sum premium
[01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:40.860]   payment into the life insurance policy or you'll lose your ability to take out the tax-free
[01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:45.980]   loans when you need it and the tax-free gains first, excuse me, the return of premium first,
[01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:49.500]   which kind of destroys the whole point of it being as an emergency fund.
[01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:50.500]   Okay.
[01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:55.580]   And is that, so the point I mentioned earlier too is I've got policies that have conversion
[01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:56.580]   riders on them.
[01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:59.180]   Is this something I can do with that or is that more of a conversation?
[01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:00.180]   No, absolutely.
[01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:03.540]   No, you would convert the term that you already have.
[01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:05.020]   Okay, great.
[01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:06.020]   Okay.
[01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:10.820]   So I see like I could also potentially just keep the money in my high yield account and
[01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:15.700]   have the trickle from that to pay the premium for 10 years as well.
[01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:16.700]   Got it.
[01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:20.860]   The balance, it's a difficult balance because I can't give a formula that makes sense.
[01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:22.620]   I always used to use these words.
[01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:26.740]   I'd say something that's doable and meaningful and both of those are important, meaning that
[01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:30.260]   with insurance, because we're dealing with a contract that you have premium payments
[01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:33.700]   to go into and there's always non-forfeiture benefits.
[01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:38.140]   So let's say you go into a contract and you're planning to put money into a life insurance
[01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:42.500]   contract for 20 years and you get 10 years in and you can't do it anymore and you have
[01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:43.980]   to stop making premium payments.
[01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:45.180]   That's fine, right?
[01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:49.340]   You can just reduce the amount of insurance, take the policy paid up, you can do policy
[01:15:49.340 --> 01:15:50.780]   loans for a time to pay the premiums.
[01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:51.780]   There's always options.
[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:56.140]   But at the end of the day, it's not like just putting money into an investment account and
[01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:59.180]   if I run into a difficult time, I just stop putting money into an investment account and
[01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:00.180]   don't have to do anything.
[01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:04.540]   This is a contract and so you need to do something that's doable where you feel like I can see
[01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:09.040]   this plan through because a well-made insurance plan is something that is going to make sense
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.380]   for the long term.
[01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:16.060]   And so the big mistake that junior insurance agents make that I made is you get super hyper
[01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:18.700]   aggressive about selling insurance.
[01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:19.860]   And I learned this the hard way.
[01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:22.900]   I was pretty good at motivating people, pretty good at saying like, "Hey, this is going to
[01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:25.020]   be fantastic," etc.
[01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:30.180]   And somebody in the thrill of the moment and the throws of all of their future money signs
[01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:31.740]   up, starts writing you big checks.
[01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:35.300]   You're highly motivated as an insurance agent to take those checks because your commissions
[01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:36.500]   are based on them.
[01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:40.340]   You get into it and all of a sudden, sometimes six months later, sometimes three years later
[01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:41.340]   etc.
[01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:42.820]   And they're like, "I just can't do it anymore.
[01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:44.220]   It was just too much."
[01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:47.540]   And they just abandon the whole thing, cancel the contract and go away.
[01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:53.380]   And that's really bad because whole life insurance doesn't have good returns when it's only owned
[01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:54.500]   for a short period of time.
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:56.900]   You wind up losing all your money basically.
[01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:58.940]   And so it's got to be something that's really doable.
[01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:04.540]   So I learned very quickly to always dial back my enthusiasm a little bit and say, "Hey,
[01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:06.220]   it's got to be doable."
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:08.140]   The flip side is it's got to be meaningful.
[01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:13.140]   Is that because you got to get the contract, the money in, there's this really difficult
[01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:17.300]   kind of balance that the earlier somebody starts doing life insurance, the lower the
[01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:22.320]   cost of the mortality, the lower the mortality cost inside the contract.
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:26.900]   And so the better it is to do it earlier and the longer you have for the money to accumulate.
[01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:30.900]   And so the best life insurance contracts are the ones that are taken out at the youngest
[01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:33.620]   age and have the most money put into them.
[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:34.620]   That's when they perform the best.
[01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:37.220]   And so these two things are in conflict with each other.
[01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:40.660]   That you want something that's really doable and yet the best performance always comes
[01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:43.940]   when you get the biggest contract at the youngest age possible.
[01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:46.300]   And so you want something that's meaningful.
[01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:52.180]   And so it's a delicate balance of doable yet meaningful where it's got to be enough money
[01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:53.860]   where it's going to make a difference to you.
[01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:57.140]   Because if you sign up at your current age and you say, "Well, I'll go ahead and put
[01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:58.980]   $100 a month into it."
[01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:02.740]   And then five years from now, you've got an account that's got $10,000 in it, that doesn't
[01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:03.740]   do much for you.
[01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:06.260]   It's not a genuine store of money.
[01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:09.580]   It's just a tiny little asset that doesn't make much of a difference.
[01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:11.140]   The plan didn't work.
[01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:16.500]   And so I don't have a formula for it other than that kind of soft tension between doable
[01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:18.040]   and meaningful.
[01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:19.640]   That's where the tension always is.
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:25.360]   And then we also want to remember that life insurance never makes us rich.
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:30.140]   And so we don't want to put money into it that would be otherwise destined for a great
[01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:33.140]   business or a career advancement, et cetera.
[01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:36.940]   It's got to be those lower amounts, but those lower amounts that accumulate over a long
[01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:42.340]   period of time wind up being really, really valuable and they wind up changing your psychology
[01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:46.220]   and allowing you to go for the bigger riskier opportunities as well.
[01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:52.940]   So it's one of the most debated subjects in financial planning because it's so complicated
[01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:54.700]   and it's rightly complicated.
[01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:59.220]   And that means that if it were so obvious to give the exact formula for it, then everyone
[01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:00.260]   would do it.
[01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:01.420]   But it's not.
[01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:02.580]   There are things that are obvious.
[01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:05.740]   If you have access to a 401k, you should max it out every year.
[01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:06.740]   That's obvious.
[01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:08.540]   There's only tiny exceptions to that.
[01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:09.940]   So that's why everyone agrees on that.
[01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:13.740]   But with how much to go into life insurance, that balance of doable and meaningful and
[01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:21.180]   what role is this contract likely to play in 10 years, in 50 years, in 70 years.
[01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:22.180]   Great.
[01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:24.020]   Thanks, Joshua.
[01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:25.020]   My pleasure.
