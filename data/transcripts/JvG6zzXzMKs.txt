[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.820]   Introverts and extroverts. It seems like a useful designation for personality types.
[00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.180]   Even if they're not biblical categories, they lead to an interesting conversation for Christians
[00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:20.080]   and to this question in particular today from a middle-aged man. Pastor John, thank you
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.820]   for this podcast. How can I tell if I'm being introverted in social settings or simply being
[00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.500]   selfish? Is this something you have ever struggled with? Are there strategies for an introvert
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.600]   to grow in social selflessness and kindness and love without feeling a false guilt for
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.900]   not being an extrovert? Pastor John, what would you say to him? My experience is that
[00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:52.940]   categorizing ourselves and others as introvert or extrovert has not borne very good fruit.
[00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.000]   In general, it seems to me to frame our way of thinking about ourselves and our behaviors
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.940]   in a way that is more naturalistic and fatalistic and limiting than perhaps is healthy for a
[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:15.980]   Christian. I think it tends to have the effect of minimizing our sense of what is good and
[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:24.660]   bad, helpful and harmful, loving and unkind, edifying and destructive, and replacing those,
[00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.900]   I think, more biblical categories with a kind of fatalistic personality typing that very
[00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.380]   easily says, "Well, that's just the way I am. The way I just acted, you didn't like
[00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.100]   me for it. Well, just get used to it. Deal with it, because that's who I am." Say that
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.220]   to a wife or a husband or a friend. I think our friend who wrote this, who didn't give
[00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.780]   us his name, so we'll call him our friend, I think our friend who wrote this realizes
[00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.460]   this, and that's why he's asking the very question that he's asking. How do you keep
[00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:07.940]   from using a category of introversion or whichever as a justification, say, of being withdrawn
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:16.500]   or selfish or unkind? So let me suggest that we come at the issue of our personalities
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:25.500]   from another angle, namely, from the angle of spiritual gifts. So the suggestion I'm
[00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:33.380]   going to make is that we think of introvert and extrovert not as limiting personality
[00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:42.880]   types but as strategic spiritual giftings. This really will provide some practical guidance
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.620]   for our friend's question in just a moment. But first, let me set up the biblical foundation
[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:57.740]   for this suggestion, this proposal. Consider, for example, Romans 12, 6-8. "Having gifts
[00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.380]   that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them," and then listen to
[00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:09.860]   these three, "if service in our serving, the one who contributes in generosity, the
[00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.180]   one who does acts of mercy with cheerfulness." And I only mentioned three in that longer
[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:25.100]   list because serving and contributing and mercy, they sound so natural. I mean, like,
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.860]   anybody can do that, right? Serve, contribute, mercy. They don't look supernatural. They
[00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:38.260]   look ordinary. And yet, Paul puts them in the category of "gifts that differ according
[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:46.660]   to the grace given to us." So they are supernatural. So I take this to mean that what looks like
[00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:55.380]   a natural bent toward serving, or a natural bent towards contributing with generosity,
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:02.940]   or a natural bent towards being merciful—that those bents, those personality types, you
[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:13.260]   might say, become spiritual gifts when they are suffused with grace and made edifying
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:21.500]   to others to point people to the glory of Christ. So I think this is the way Peter talks
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:28.420]   about spiritual gifts in 1 Peter 4, 10-11, as well. Just to underline this, he says,
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:34.020]   "As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another as good stewards of God's
[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:41.340]   varied grace. Let him who serves serve in the strength that God supplies, in order that
[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.940]   in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ." That's 1 Peter 4, 10-11.
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:55.820]   So, I think it would be fair to say that in Peter's mind, a spiritual gift is any bent
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:05.460]   or ability that you turn into a stewardship of God's varied grace, so that God is glorified
[00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:13.820]   and people are built up. So a spiritual gift in Peter's mind is any trait of your personality
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:21.660]   which you, in the power that God supplies, becomes graciously helpful to others and draws
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:27.340]   attention to the glory of Christ. So here's the implication for thinking about introversion
[00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:36.460]   and extroversion. Shift your thinking away from naturalistic, fatalistic, limiting categories,
[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:44.380]   and direct your thinking into categories of introversion and extroversion as this kind
[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:55.220]   of spiritual gift, which means that our entire focus will be on, "How do I make my peculiar
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:04.260]   personality serve, by God's power, the extension of grace into other people's lives for the
[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:11.580]   glory of Christ?" And I think this will have two really good effects if we do that
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:19.820]   kind of thinking shifting. First, when I'm in a situation outside my comfort zone, okay,
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:27.860]   I will not surrender to the selfish, fatalistic thinking of, "Well, I just am the way I
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:39.380]   am," but will seek God's power to make my peculiar bent and gifting a means of grace
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:45.700]   to others. That's the first implication it will have. And second, when I remain in my
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:54.260]   comfort zone, I do not simply slip into a kind of fatalistic self-centeredness. The
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.740]   attitude, "Well, this is just the way I am. I'm not going to go to that party. I'm
[00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.860]   not going to go to that reception. I'm not going to stand over there and talk to anybody.
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.500]   I'm going to sit over here in a chair. I'm just going to chill." And a lot of people
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.100]   feel justified because they're one way or the other. "I'm just going to do it because
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:17.500]   I feel like it." Instead, I should focus all my thinking toward this, "How can my
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:26.260]   peculiar bent and gifting in this comfort zone that I'm staying in become an instrument
[00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:32.940]   of grace for others and for the glory of Christ?" Now, let me just give a couple of examples,
[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:37.100]   because people may not be clicking with me what I mean there, because I'm saying you
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:41.340]   can walk out of your comfort zone and deal with this as a spiritual gift, and you can
[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:47.420]   stay in your comfort zone and turn that into a miracle of grace. So here's the illustration.
[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:52.620]   Suppose a person—I got real people in mind here when I say this, but I won't name anybody—suppose
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:59.780]   a person is so introverted that he decides he could never function as an upfront minister
[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:05.220]   or manage a lot of social gatherings the way a pastor might, and so he's never ever going
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:11.380]   to do that. What does he do? He asks, "Okay, if I'm not going to do that, if I'm going
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:20.980]   to remain in my limitations and my comfort zone, how can I maximize my gift of introversion,
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:27.460]   my spiritual gift of introversion for the glory of Christ in my comfort zone?" And
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:34.860]   what does he do? I know him. I know his name. He became a Bible translator in a remote tribe
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:43.340]   for 30 years. I've watched this happen. So in other words, in choosing to remain in his
[00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:52.440]   comfort zone, he denied himself, as Jesus said, and he made sacrifices in that kind
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:58.020]   of comfort zone, leaving another kind of comfort zone, and risks his life for the glory of
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.620]   Christ in the translation of the Bible. That's the kind of thing I mean.
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:09.140]   Or here's one more example, like John Piper, okay? If I would probably put myself in the
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:15.060]   category of an introvert, I really love to be alone, I love to read, it's a chore in
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:21.420]   a sense for me to hobnob in gatherings and just go around and make small talk. If I choose
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:29.540]   not to move toward a more sociable lifestyle, here's what happens. And I have chosen. I
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:37.180]   have chosen not to move toward a very sociable lifestyle. What do I do? I feel a tremendous
[00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:46.820]   impulse inside of me to make my solitude as productive as I possibly can in writing for
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:50.260]   the good of others and for the glory of Christ.
[00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:58.940]   So bottom line, shift your categories of thinking from naturalistic, fatalistic, limiting personality
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:07.700]   typing to the category of spiritual gifts, which means that your introversion and extroversion
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:16.900]   are given to you not to justify selfishness or hobnobbing or whatever, but to shape the
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:22.260]   stewarding of grace for the good of others and for the glory of Christ.
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:27.740]   That's a good word, Pastor John. Thank you. And thanks for listening to the podcast over
