[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   So how is God at work in our most unproductive days?
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   When it feels as though we've accomplished nothing and we fall so far short of our own plans and our own expectations.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Those days are so frustrating to us, but they are never outside of God's sovereign power.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   It leads to today's question on what efficiency looks like in the first place.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   A very good question from a listener named Melinda.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   "Hello Pastor John, thank you for this podcast. Back in episode 1115 about caring for those with dementia,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   you closed your remarks with this phrase, 'God's priorities for efficiency in this life are not ours.'
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Can you please elaborate on this for me? I struggle mightily with time management skills
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   and I'm a homeschooling mom trying to balance kids' needs and activities, ministry, household duties, and sleep.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   I feel overwhelmed with the need to be efficient every minute when it does not come naturally to me.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   What should efficiency look like in the busy Christian life?"
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   I will explain what I mean by saying God's priorities for efficiency in this life are not ours,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   but let me say first and right off the bat that the reason I want anybody to know that is not so that they can get more done,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   but so that they do what they do in the right spirit.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Okay, so that's preface over everything I have to say.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   So now what do I mean by saying God's priorities for efficiency in this life are not ours?
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   I mean that our priority may be that between 10 and 11 this morning,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I plan to run to the bank and get some cash so that I can be back in time to pay the boy,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   the teenager who is cutting my grass, while a neighbor watches my two- and four-year-old for me.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   That's the plan. And you feel good. I feel good. I'm making this up.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   I feel good that I worked it out. I worked it out so that the neighbor was available and the teenager could come
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   and I could get to the bank and get back before both of them had other engagements.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Those are my priorities, and I have an efficient plan.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Cut grass, kids watched, bank trip made, boy paid, everyone off to their next engagement.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Victory! Efficiency! That's what I mean by our efficiency.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   However, God, in this case, has a totally different set of priorities.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Your neighbor was scheduled to be at a real estate office at 1130,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   so she could join her husband to close on a new house, a house which, unbeknownst to them, has a flawed foundation.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   The teenager was planning to take his money from cutting the grass and pool it with some of the guys
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   and buy some drugs that they shouldn't be using.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   You hit a traffic jam caused by a rollover of a semi, which has another Unleashed story behind it,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   and you're locked up on the freeway for an hour. You never even get to the bank.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   You rush home as fast as you can. You get there an hour late.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   No money to pay the boy, and your neighbor has missed her appointment.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   You are frustrated almost to tears.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Your efficiency proved utterly useless to accomplish your priorities. You failed.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   But God's priorities totally succeeded. He wanted to hinder that boy from buying drugs.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   He wanted to spare the neighbor from purchasing a house that's a lemon.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   And he wanted to grow your faith in his sovereign wisdom.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Now, that's what I mean by God's priorities for efficiency in this life are not ours.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   And in my view, this isn't happening just now and then. It's happening all the time.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   When you read the Bible, you see in virtually every book the story of God doing things
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   that are not the way humans would do them or want them done.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   God almost never takes the shortest route between point A and point B.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   And the reason is that such efficiency, the efficiency of speed and directness, is not what he's about.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   His purpose is to sanctify the traveler, not speed him between A and B.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Frustrating human efficiency is one of God's primary—I say primary, not secondary—means of sanctifying grace.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   The story of Joseph, Genesis 37 to 50, is one of the clearest examples, right?
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Joseph is hated by his brothers, thrown in a pit, sold into slavery, sold to Potiphar,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   accused of sexual harassment, thrown into prison, forgotten by Pharaoh's butler,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   and then finally—what's that?—17 years in, made vice president of Egypt
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   so that he could save his family from starvation.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Moral of the story, chapter 50, verse 20, he says to his brothers,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   "You meant it for evil. God meant it."
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   God had an agenda. God had a plan. God meant it for good.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   So you guys, you rascals, were the traffic jam that kept me from getting to the bank for 17 years.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   But God was positioning me to be the savior of my people.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   And he was in no hurry. And I was being tested at every single point.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Would I trust him with his seemingly meaningless inefficiency? Which it wasn't.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   And when Paul was trying to get to Spain instead, he had a plan. He had a really good plan.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   "I'm going to go to Jerusalem, going to deliver the money, going to get on a boat,
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   going to go to Rome, going to gather some support, going to end my life in Spain."
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   What a great plan. He found himself in prison in Rome.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   What did he say? What did he say in Philippians 1.12?
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   "I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to all the rest that my imprisonment is for Christ."
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   So his priorities for efficiently getting to Spain were shattered.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   But God's purposes to evangelize the imperial guard in Rome? Right on track.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   So here's the implication for Melinda.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   By all means, make your list of to-dos for the day. By all means.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Get as good as that as you can get. Prioritize the list. Yep. First things first.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Make your plan. Do that the very best you can. Go ahead, read a book about it.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   But then walk in peace and freedom that when it shatters on the rocks of reality, which it will most days,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   remember, you're not being measured by God by how much you get done.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   You're being measured by whether you trust the goodness and the wisdom and the sovereignty of God
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   to work this new mess for his glory and the good of everyone involved, even when you can't see how.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Wow. Now that would make an interesting productivity book.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Thank you, Pastor John, for this God-centered perspective on efficiency and productivity in the Christian life.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   "Frustrating human efficiency is one of God's primary means of sanctifying grace."
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   I wrote that down, and I'm going to return to that, no doubt, by the end of this day already.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Melinda, excellent question today. Thank you.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   As always, we appreciate those very articulate questions, Melinda, like this one you sent in.

[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   even questions about daily productivity and what it looks like from God's perspective.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Those are great questions.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   We do all of that through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Well, speaking of trying to discern God's will in the midst of our lives,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   "Does God feel distant to me because I messed up, because I angered him,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   because I made choices that made him mad and caused him to withdraw from me?"
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   is a very common question we get from people when it feels like nothing in life is going their way.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   And it's a question we will tackle on Wednesday.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Don't miss it.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We'll see you then.
