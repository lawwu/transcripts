[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640]   Good Monday morning and welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.040]   Thanks for making us a part of your weekly routines, maybe your commute to work, whatever
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.520]   it is you're doing right now.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.800]   We don't take it for granted that you welcome us into your life, so thank you.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.520]   Well, if you listened on Friday, we looked at 1 Peter 3.8.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.160]   There Peter calls Christians to strive towards a unity of mind, he says.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.400]   But we also saw that this unity of mind is not uniformity.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.400]   We don't all think identically, which means that Christian unity must hold together by
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.920]   love, not simply by uniform thinking.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.840]   And without this critical heart of love, unity simply cannot happen.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.200]   And speaking of love and how love unifies, Peter goes on to say in the very same letter,
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:59.240]   just a little later, a chapter later, that love "covers a multitude of sins."
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.200]   Our love covers sins.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.560]   Peter makes that point in 1 Peter 4.8.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.680]   But what does it mean?
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.600]   Two listeners want to know.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.200]   Dustin in Atlanta asks Pastor John, "How does love cover over a multitude of sins?
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.200]   What sins?
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.200]   Whose sins does it cover?
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.600]   Mine or the person or people I'm loving?"
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.080]   In the same vein, Alan in Brisbane, Australia writes in to ask this.
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.640]   Pastor John, what is Peter driving at in this text?
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.360]   Are we covering over our inclination to sin by loving or covering over their sins by not
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.800]   reacting to them, that is, forgiving them rather than taking revenge?
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.200]   Pastor John, what would you say to Austin and Alan?
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.920]   Here's 1 Peter 4.7-8.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.640]   The end of all things is at hand.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.200]   Therefore, be self-controlled and sober-minded for the sake of your prayers.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:05.320]   Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, and here comes that key phrase, since love
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.000]   covers a multitude of sins.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:20.280]   So let's begin by mentioning, observing a few Old Testament texts that lie behind Peter's
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.900]   language of covering a multitude of sins.
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.640]   For example, here's the closest parallel, Proverbs 10.12.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:36.000]   Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all offenses.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.720]   That's really close to what Peter says.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.880]   Love covers all offenses.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:48.280]   So you can see how close the parallel is to love covers a multitude of sins.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.200]   So what does this proverb mean?
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.640]   The contrast is between hatred and love.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.520]   What hatred does is stir up strife, and what love does is cover offenses.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.820]   So the opposite of covering offenses is to stir up strife.
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:14.440]   So I take the strife, then, to be what happens when you don't cover offenses, but rather
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.000]   you try to uncover as many as you can.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.620]   You're on the lookout for people's flaws and failures and imperfections, and you draw attention
[00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.320]   to them, and you stir up conflict by pointing out as many of a person's flaws as you can.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.560]   That's what hate does, according to the proverb.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.560]   So the opposite of this would be you're not eager to draw attention to people's flaws
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.080]   or failures.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.880]   You're not eager to create corporate blame and conflict.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:54.760]   Instead, love seeks to deal with flaws and failures and sins another way, more quietly.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:02.280]   Of course, you're not ignorant that some sins must be dealt with publicly, as in the case,
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.980]   say, of sexual abuse or some kind of violence.
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:14.480]   But you also know that there are hundreds of things that people say and do that are
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:22.360]   offensive or selfish or prideful or off-color, and they need to be dealt with quietly and
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.360]   kindly.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.440]   I think this is what Paul was getting at in Galatians 6, where he said, "Brothers, if
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:38.040]   anyone is caught in a trespass or a transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.440]   a spirit of gentleness.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.600]   Keep watch over yourself, lest you too be tempted."
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:51.800]   So you don't blow a trumpet and try to placard the person's transgression all over the community.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:58.240]   You do your best to bring about repentance quietly, personally, or if there are reasons
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:05.000]   that it's not your place to confront the person, you simply give the person slack and you hope
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.760]   and you pray that the kindness that you show by overlooking would have a good effect in
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.400]   due time.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.800]   So cover offenses can have two meanings, can't it?
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:29.000]   One is to simply let it go, overlook it, as we say, and that's referred to in Proverbs
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:37.040]   19.11, "Good sense makes one slow to anger, and it is the glory to overlook an offense."
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.160]   So that's one meaning of cover, overlook.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:48.800]   You see it, but love inclines you not to take offense or to be angered or hurt, but to hope
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.900]   that your endurance of the injury, perhaps, against you and your forgiveness and patience
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.760]   will bear fruit in change.
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:05.680]   The other meaning is that under that cover of patience, you may be quietly and actively
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:15.040]   dealing with the person in one-on-one ways that actively and quietly seek repentance.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.920]   We shouldn't jump to the conclusion that when love covers a multitude of sins, it's not
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.280]   in there talking to anybody.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.520]   Love wants peace, not conflict.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.080]   Love wants holiness, not sin.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:32.640]   Love wants the good of the sinning person, not public vengeance.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:39.800]   And in both of those meanings, the overlook one and the quietly deal with the sinner,
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:46.160]   in both of those meanings of cover, there is a forgiving spirit at work.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:53.320]   We see that in Psalm 32.1, "Blessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven," and
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.280]   then parallel, "whose sin is covered."
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.440]   So cover parallels forgive.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:08.800]   To cover is to work toward forgiveness, where the sin doesn't break the relationship anymore.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.120]   So now back to 1 Peter 4.8, "The end of all things is at hand.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.720]   Therefore be self-controlled, sober-minded for the sake of your prayers.
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:23.880]   Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of sins."
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:29.440]   So against the Old Testament background, as well as the New Testament parallels that we'll
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:36.560]   see in just a minute, the sins that are being covered here are the sins of fellow Christians,
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:43.240]   not your own sins and not those outside the church, but the failures of Christians to
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.400]   live up to the biblical path of righteousness.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:54.960]   And with that in mind, we start to see this work of love all over the New Testament.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.920]   That covering idea is everywhere.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:04.840]   For example, 1 Corinthians 13.5 says, "Love is patient and kind.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.640]   It does not keep an account of wrongs."
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.480]   That's the old King James translation, and it's good.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.800]   Isn't that the same, not keeping account of wrongs?
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.760]   Isn't that the same as saying love covers wrongs?
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.280]   It doesn't keep an account of them.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:29.560]   Or he goes on in 1 Corinthians 13 and says, "Love is not easily irritated."
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.560]   Huh.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.640]   That's like overlook, right?
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:33.640]   It's like a covering.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.600]   Isn't that the same as saying love covers irritations?
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:45.080]   Or verse 7, same chapter, he goes on and says, "Love bears all things, endures all things."
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:52.480]   Well, bears and endures means that love doesn't throw your flaw and your failure back in your
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.760]   face.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.760]   It bears it.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.880]   It endures it.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:02.760]   That's a covering rather than a flag waving over it and saying, "Hey, everybody, look.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.760]   What I found.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.760]   Jim's a loser.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:05.760]   He offended me.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:06.840]   Mary's a hypocrite.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.840]   She hurt me."
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.560]   That's not bearing and enduring.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.720]   It's not covering.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:19.520]   Or we see this covering work in Colossians 3 where Paul says to believers, "Bear with
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:29.520]   one another, and if one has a complaint, forgive one another as the Lord has forgiven you."
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:36.700]   So enduring, forgiving means that people have offended me, hurt me, irritated me, and I
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.040]   choose not to retaliate.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:45.040]   Instead, I cover the offense of the hurt or the irritation.
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:53.400]   Now, the closest parallel in the New Testament to 1 Peter 4.8, which sheds even more light
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.720]   on what's going on with this covering, is James 5.19.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:03.440]   "My brothers, if anyone among you wanders from the truth," you've got a believer who's
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.680]   straying off, about to make shipwreck of faith.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:12.360]   "If any of you wanders off from the truth and someone brings him back," so you go after
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:17.720]   your brother, you quietly plead and deal and pray and share, and you win him.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:24.320]   "Let him know that whoever brings back a sinner from his wandering will save his soul from
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.800]   death and cover a multitude of sins."
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:36.240]   In other words, when we mercifully pursue a wayward brother or sister and win them back
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:44.760]   to the path of faith and obedience, they are saved from making shipwreck of their faith,
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:53.360]   and when they take their place under the blood of Jesus, all their sins are not only covered
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:11:01.760]   by our own patience and endurance and forgiveness, but they're also covered by the blood of Jesus,
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.080]   which is why Peter says, "You will save their souls."
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:14.000]   So, I think it is fair to say as we cover the sins of those who offend us, rather than
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:23.440]   retaliating, we are offering them an expression of Christ's covering by his blood, so that
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:32.600]   if they rest their faith in Christ because of our kindness, our covering, they will experience
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:40.240]   the ultimate kindness and the ultimate covering of the forgiveness of the sins in Christ.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.240]   Amen.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.800]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:48.640]   And speaking of a straying believer or a wayward brother or sister who is on the path of shipwrecking
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:53.200]   their faith, that was a theme that we addressed just a couple of weeks back on the podcast,
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.200]   you might remember.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.640]   Those proved to be very popular episodes, no surprise.
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:03.760]   See APJ's 1849 and 1850 for more on what it means to shipwreck the faith.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.360]   Thank you for joining us today.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.080]   You can ask a Bible question of your own.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:15.680]   You can search our growing archive or subscribe to the podcast, all at askpastorjohn.com.
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:21.800]   Speaking of covering sin, at the center of our faith, we celebrate the cross of Jesus
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:27.600]   Christ, his horrific suffering and death by crucifixion.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:34.620]   His blood truly covers our sin in the most profound way, and his death was no accident.
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.320]   It was not a fluke of history.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:42.280]   It was not merely an end result of mob violence unstopped.
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.200]   His death was designed.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:53.620]   It was intentional, divinely intended, intended from the beginning of time.
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:59.040]   This is a somber and significant point to grasp from Acts chapter 4, verses 27 and 28,
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.760]   the text we're going to look at next time.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.280]   We'll see you back here on Monday.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:04.960]   Have a great weekend.
