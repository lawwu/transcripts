[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   and then we're going to do specialty drinks up here and we'll still have full sponsorships.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   I want one of these.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Dave is obsessed with Palomas.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   I love Palomas.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   I'm into Palomas right now.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   I'm a Paloma guy right now.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   It's like the all-in intro do you think?
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Yep.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   Which I've done a live arrangement for with the brass.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Now, we're not going to do a year-in-review discussion.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   We're just going to go right into...
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Right.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   I think we caught it.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Yeah, we're going to go right into the awards.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Well, you're going to go right into Santa Catas doing this bit.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   We could do that.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   That's easy.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   That could be the change line.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Exactly.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   How much time does he need to change?
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   It's me!
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Santa Catas!
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   That's good.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   I mean it's pretty hilarious.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   So, we're really excited to have some Bestie Awards to give out tonight.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Let's get started.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Jake, how are you?
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Are you back?
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Are you here?
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Where are you?
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Oh, God.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Sorry.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   I was just getting in founder mode.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Woo!
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Let's go!
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Saturday Night San Francisco!
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   All right, J-Kel, you want to warm us up?
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Okay.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   All right, everybody.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Let's get loose.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   We know what we do.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   We have a game plan.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   We've been doing this for 206 episodes.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   We're not changing anything.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   We are who we are.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   We know what to do.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Frank Burt, bring that science.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Sax, I got the red meat for you.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   And you're going to help me.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   And you're going to help me.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   And you're going to help me.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   And you're going to help me.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   And you're going to help me.

[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   And you're going to help me.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And you're going to help me.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   And you're going to help me.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   And you're going to help me.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   And you're going to help me.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   And you're going to help me.

[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And you're going to help me.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   And you're going to help me.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   And you're going to help me.

[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   And you're going to help me.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   And you're going to help me.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Let's go.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   America, 2024.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   A year of political earthquakes.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Extraordinary market events.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   War.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Space.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   And the revelation that Diddy is super into baby oil.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Authority has located more than a thousand bottles of baby oil lubricant.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   It was a year so profound.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Gotta give him that hawk poo and spit on that thing.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   America was at times at a loss for words.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Look, um, the, uh, like I said, I'm--
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Well put, gentle Joe.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   So tonight, we look back.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   The All In Podcast presents America 2024.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   What in the fuck just happened?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   The story of 2024 starts with AI.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   The revolutionary technology has fueled a boom in countless sectors.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   But mostly, the legal field.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Scarlett Johansson's legal team wants details on exactly how they were able to create
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   that voice that sounds like she said, so eerily similar.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   No, it sounds just like her.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Of course, it's a digitally altered version of Scargent.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   And they got caught.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   OK.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Cookie jar.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   And AI also created the most remarkable deepfake video ever.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Welcome.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   They almost look like friends.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Amazing.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Yes, 2024 proved there's no problem AI can't solve and/or cause.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Google has had to pause AI-made images, quote, after race inaccuracies.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   This year, AI helped launch the most drool-worthy tech product in years.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   A computer chip.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Yeah, baby.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   DGX has become the essential instrument of AI.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Never seen anything like this in the history of Silicon Valley or corporate America.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   NVIDIA is king of the AI revolution, and they're so hot, they're literally too hot.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   The information reported that the chips are overheating in servers.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   But don't worry, there's an elegant solution to the problem.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   I bought myself this Hiroshima mask so I do not have to smell the burn on those conductors.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Problem solved.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   But NVIDIA wasn't alone in AI news.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   OpenAI was at the forefront of reinventing another crucial industry, office drama.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   A lot of drama involving OpenAI.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   What a mess.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   What's next?
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   This week on General AI Hospital.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Is Sam Altman's job security in jeopardy?
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Whose data was stolen this time?
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   What did Ilya see?
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Why isn't he talking about it?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   And with our special guest.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Will our special guest get her revenge?
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   General AI Hospital.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   But Sam Altman never let the drama distract him from OpenAI's primary mission, philanthropy.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   It's actually really important that you're not doing private enrichment off philanthropic donations.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   And so, you know, it's, it's...
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   But isn't that what's happened?
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Um, you know, I think that the, you know, um, you know, I think, like I said, sour grapes.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Well said, Reed.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   But even if OpenAI was a little more like closed AI,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   its humble leader, Sam Altman, was still toiling away humbly for the betterment of mankind.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   You make a lot of money, do you?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   I make, no, uh, I'm paid enough for health insurance, I have no equity in OpenAI.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Really? That's interesting.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   But don't think this working class hero doesn't suffer.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Did you know that his 1.9 million dollar supercar wasn't available in candy apple red like he wanted?
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Still, it wouldn't be a year in review without mentioning Elon Musk.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Who, incidentally, we will all be required to mention daily in 2025 as bound by federal law.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   The world's jumpiest capitalist and the new co-leader of the free world
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   showed everyone in 2024 that being Elon Musk is a pretty fucking sweet gig.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   From soaring in space to delivering charity,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   from business booms to getting anointed by Joe Rogan as free speech Jesus,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   from getting hired in politics to getting hired to fire people in politics,
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   2024 was a year that couldn't shake Elon Musk.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Just ask this guy.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   You know, he likes this place. I can't get him out of here.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   And it was all prophesized by our own David Palpatine.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Everything has proceeded as I have foreseen.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   2024 was a banner year in tech.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   And in how many giant names we tricked into coming on our podcast.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   I love that house he has. I love David's house.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   I can't believe I get to sit down with one of the most famous investors in Uber.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   It was like the hand of God massaging my central nervous system.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   What the flying f**k happened?
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   If you have specific questions, I'm happy to.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Did somebody stab you in the back? Did you find AGI?
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Oh my God, what have we done inviting these lunatics on the program?
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Hold on guys, I got to get into founder mode.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Oh wow, founder mode.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   If he founder modes, I'm going to, I'm going to founder.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   S**t, I got to founder mode too.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Ah.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Where's Jayco?
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Oh s**t.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Speaking of financial highs, 2024 experienced a wide range of viewpoints
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   from the effectiveness of ESG to disagreement on new CTA BOI reporting.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   But there was unanimous agreement on one key financial issue.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Lina Khan has become the most aided and feared person on Wall Street.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   And Lina Khan is utterly ineffective.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   What Lina Khan has done is just go after "bigness"
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   which just means stopping these companies from doing anything that would make them bigger.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   The only acquisition she couldn't stop, Chamath's $5,000 sweater habit.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Oh yeah, Chamath, strut your stuff.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Let's talk about the sweaters.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   This, Jason.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Oh, really?
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Is the thin summer gilet.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Okay, beautiful cashmere.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Cashmere?
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   F**k yeah!
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   These days, the all-in boys and their friends are looking slim in their cashmere
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   thanks to a new class of miracle drugs that stormed the world of biotech in 2024.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Ozempic.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   The game-changer.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Injectable weight loss drugs are hot.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   In our broker group, like, 4 of the 12 or 13 regulars are on it.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   2025 is looking to be the year GLP-1s change the face of everything.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Literally.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   But we've heard that term "ozempic face."
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   First we had "ozempic face," and now we have "ozempic butt."
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   But if 2024 will be remembered for one thing,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   it will be for shining a light on elder abuse.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Our 46 presidents stepped aside,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   introducing the country to a fresh new upstart
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   ready to tackle the problems of a fractured country.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   I grew up a middle-class kid.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   I grew up a middle-class kid.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   I grew up a middle-class kid.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   I grew up a middle-class kid.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   President Trump, however, wouldn't stand by idly and let Kabbalah torch her own campaign.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   They're eating the dogs, the people that came in.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   They're eating the cats.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   In the end, however, it wasn't even close.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Literally nothing?
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Literally nothing.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Literally not one county?
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   There was just so much to 2024 that we can't cover it all.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   From Trump nearly getting assassinated to Trump nearly getting assassinated.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   From continued wars in Europe and the Middle East to continued battles on the home front.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   From the cringiest of TikToks to black Nazis and an Aussie dance legend,
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   2024 was anything but.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Very demure. Very mindful.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   With 2024 in the rearview mirror,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   let's turn to our outgoing president for some sage advice on our collective future.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   But I tell you what, I don't know about you, but I'm going to go to bed.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming your bestie.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   What's up?
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Merry Christmas.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   Welcome, CzarSax.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   You weren't allowed to say Merry Christmas until about three weeks ago.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Merry fucking Christmas, everybody.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Where's...
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Happy holidays.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Where's Jkal?
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Where's Jkal?
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Jkal?
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Jkal?
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   It is I, Santa Canis,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   here to spread joy and stock options and bitcoins
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   to all these fine San Francisco they-thems-its-whatevers.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Ho, ho, ho!
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   This is starting off horribly, but OK.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Ho, ho, ho!
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Shabbat!
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Ho, ho!
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Santa Canis, where are you coming from?
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Well, you know, uh...
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   You know they paid money for this, right?
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   You could have at least memorized your lines.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   It's just too funny.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Sometimes the cold opens work, and sometimes they don't.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   They don't. It's true. It's true.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   The problem is, this one's supposed to go for eight minutes, so...
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   Eight minutes?
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   You have stuff in there for eight minutes?
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   It's not like you guys are going to make this crowd laugh, OK?
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   No, it's, uh...
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   We moved the North Pole.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   We moved it.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Where'd you move it to, Santa Canis?
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   It's a problem, because, you know, all these elves who've come across the border up there...
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   Tons of fentanyl. It's a disaster. Terrible.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   And just crazy inflation up there.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   So we-we moved the North Pole down to Austin, Texas.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Oh, it's-it's in Austin, Texas now. Yeah.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Better tax treatment, you know.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Can you get elves there, Santa Canis?
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   You know, it's a little bit hard.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Some of them have come across the border.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Some of them work hard.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Other ones, not so much.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   Have you automated?
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Well, you know, it's interesting you say that.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Oh, oh, no milk and cookies.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   I'll take some Bitcoin if you have any extra.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   OK. Thank you there, Tremont.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Yes, we've done some automation.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   Ho, ho, ho, yes.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Oh, here it is, everybody.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   You know, we have a lot of problems with the elves.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   You know, they've been unionizing sacks.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   It's too much regulation, but we can get these here from 1X.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Only $1 per hour, but we need you back in Santa's lab, OK?
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   You need to be building some toys, OK?
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Now get back to work.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Yeah, we don't have HR anymore, OK?
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   So what are you doing after?
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   No, I mean, I got my friends, got the good K.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   OK, we'll talk later.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Whose robot is this?
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   It's Santa's robotic elf, right?
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   Ho, ho, ho.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   Sorry, hold on a second. Hold on.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Before we continue with this clearly incredible bit that you two ding-dongs wrote.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   I was just told to read it.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Can we just say a cheers for the new czar?
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Huzzah!
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   Huzzah!
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   Mazel tov, bro. Congratulations.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Yes, congratulations there. Congratulations, czar.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   It's a little hard with the $27 Amazon Santa suit.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Ho, ho, ho.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   Well, you know, guys, I have the list here that you guys were asking about.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   This is the naughty list.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   This bit goes on for like eight minutes.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   Hold on.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   I've got the naughty and the nice list.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   It's a pretty big list this year.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Let's take a look.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Sam Altman is on the naughty list.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   Very naughty.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   Two, three, four times on the naughty list.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   Oh, Jensen, also on the top of the list.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   You know, Santa's got a lot of that NVIDIA.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   20 baggers so far.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   Yes, also some NVIDIA employees here.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   They didn't sponsor, though.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   Oh.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   I don't know why.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   He's so cheap.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Okay, Santa, Kenneth, I think it's time for you to go back to Austin.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   Yeah, well, you know, I have to do another podcast.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   Yeah, it's got 20 times the ratings of All In.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   It's called Hot Ones.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   I don't know who the host is, but you're getting beaten in the ratings by 12 chicken wings.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Congratulations, boy.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   More work for you guys, okay?
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   I'll see you next time.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   Bye, everybody.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   Can you get Santa, Kenneth, out of here?
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   Ho, ho, ho.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   Ho, ho, ho.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   Ho, ho, ho.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   Okay.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   Well, you have to admire the dedication to the bit.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Most people have given up after about two minutes.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   He just kept going with it.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   He's really committed.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   He keeps going, yeah.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   That's great.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   So just to get you guys oriented, thank you all for being here.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   This is going to be awesome.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   We got a great night planned.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   We got a show.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   We're going to walk through the Bestie Awards tonight.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   It's going to be super fun.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   Oh, here we go.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Sorry I'm late.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   I was in an Uber.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   I was in an Uber.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   I heard Santa Claus showed up.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   I was in an Uber.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   Okay.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Oh, sorry.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Let's do a drinking game.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   The number of times J. Cal shills his companies, we need to drink.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   J. Cal, introduce the awards.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Let's kick this off.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   How's this going to work?
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   So you guys know we do this amazing Bestie Awards.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   So we're going to do a bunch of Bestie Awards here live on stage.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   And interestingly, this year we actually made a Bestie Award.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   It's right next to you, Chamath.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Maybe you can hold one up.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   Sax, go ahead and take a look at this.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Now, this Bestie Award is two men embracing in a long, awkward hug.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   And many people don't know the inspiration for this awkwardness,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   but here it is to remind everybody.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   There it is.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   And that's actually Chamath and David Sax.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   David Sax is actually reciprocating the hug.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   He actually reciprocates.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   You're saying that we were the mold for this.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   It was cast out of our body shapes.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   It's actually accurate down to the inch.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Yes, it's very accurate.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   You and Sax, you and Chamath are hugging.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   So the first award we're going to do is business.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Biggest winner, biggest loser, and biggest surprise.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   So, Chamath, would you like to kick it off with your biggest business winner?
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   I think the biggest business winner of 2024 is the business of speech.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   And what I mean by that is I think that we have made freedom of speech
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   a very successful business model.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   All right, well done.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   What's your biggest business winner, Sax?
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Well, I want it to be original, but I really couldn't.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   I thought it was so obvious this year it has to be Elon Musk.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Okay, Elon Musk, that's always a safe choice.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   Freeberg, who do you have?
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   It's SpaceX, Starlink, Starship.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   I don't know what else comes close.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Chopsticks.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   What's that?
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   Chopsticks.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   First Neuralink implant.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   And SpaceX at like a $350 billion valuation,
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   like tripling from that level in a year.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   It's insane.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Never been done before.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Boundaries just don't matter.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   It's incredible.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   It is incredible.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   I went with NVIDIA just to mix it up.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Who's your biggest business loser, Sax?
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   I said the biggest business loser was the legacy media.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Oh, mainstream media, okay.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   They lost the election in something like half their ratings,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   and they've been exposed as basically being overpaid podcasters.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   But podcasters aspire to be overpaid legacy media hosts.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   Chamath, who is your biggest business loser?
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   Business loser, Intel.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   From the company that basically commercialized Moore's Law
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   for the advancement of humanity
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   to just a totally confused shell of its former self.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Who do you got, Freeberg, as your biggest business loser?
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   Very old business.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   Has had a kind of mantle place position in the United States for decades.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   That would be Boeing, which seemed to unravel this year
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   with obviously the debacle with the aerospace program,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   particularly with Starliner stranding some astronauts
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   needing to get rescued.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   And there's a lot of turnover happening in the organization.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   It just seems like a mess.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   You know, I went with Apple only because I felt the Vision Pro felt flat.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   The new iPhone 16, not very strong.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   And I feel like they're adrift.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   And Warren Buffett sold all his shares in it.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   I feel like the company could do much better.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Well, their stock's up like 30% this year.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   I think it's a little bit in the middle,
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   but I think it's based on potential.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   I think they should be releasing great new products, and they aren't.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Let's go to business surprise.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   Did you have a business surprise over there, Saxipoo?
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   I said Palantir was the biggest business surprise this year.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   I mean, I thought the company would do well,
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   but its stock went up 5x this year from $16 a share to 76.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Completely counterintuitive.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   It just--the market cap of Palantir just passed the market cap of Lockheed Martin.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   The amazing counterintuitive thing about Palantir
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   was how much time they spent with their customers.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   Everybody shat on that idea, and they were totally right.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   Totally right.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   So were they your biggest surprise as well?
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   No.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   My biggest business surprise are GLP-1s.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   I think the number of markets that it seems to help--
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   this year it went from weight loss to cardiac fitness
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   to depression to drug addiction, alcohol--
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   I mean, it's basically a wonder drug of wonder drugs.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   And also, I think you might be interested,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   they said it can help with compulsive gambling as well, Chamath.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   That is why I am not on a GLP-1.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   I don't have a problem.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   Okay, Freeburg, did you have a surprise?
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   I was surprised by the return of kind of the long tail of crypto.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   Okay.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   It's come roaring back, and everything seems to be on fire again.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   No comment from the crypto czar, I know, but--
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Crypto comeback is your big surprise.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Crypto comeback. The long tail of crypto comeback.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   I feel like Bitcoin was always a different story,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   but the long tail's got a different story.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   You know, I looked at it, and I always love great products.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   I picked Google.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Everybody was talking two years ago about how Google was falling behind
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   and 10 blue links weren't going to work.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   The Gemini app is absolutely fantastic.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   I've been using Gemini app.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   It's as good or better than--
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   Do you jay trade Google shares?
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   I jay trade some shares, yes.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   I jay traded some Google shares.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   Also, Waymo, also delightful.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   And, you know, they had a rough year with some of that woke imagery in Gemini,
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   but I think they had a great rebound.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Waymo's a really good story.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   Yeah, I think Waymo--
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   I also felt like it's like what is that business a year and a half ago,
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   two years ago, and I don't know.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   I've been taking Waymo's around the city.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   You don't come to the city.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   My sister and my brother-in-law are visiting this weekend.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   There they are.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Hey, how you doing, guys?
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   And they took a Waymo yesterday, and I saw the video.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   And basically what you have is my brother-in-law,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   who's, like, totally blown away,
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   my sister, who's, like, cautiously optimistic,
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   and their two kids who are, like, pinned to the back in fear
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   because they're like, "Who is driving this?"
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   And my brother-in-law, who's Indian, he's like,
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   "Don't worry.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   There are people like us somewhere driving this car."
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   [laughter]
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Okay.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Let's go to politics.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   Sax, here's your red meat.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   I can't imagine who you have as your political winner,
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   but I know you probably struggled over this one.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   This one's pretty obvious.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   It's the man who won the White House.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   [cheers and applause]
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   He--actually, he not only won the White House,
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   he won the House, he won the Senate,
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   he won the popular vote, and he overcame a hostile media.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   He overcame two assassination attempts,
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   one that missed him by millimeters.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   So my biggest political winner for the year is Donald Trump.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   Okay, there it is, folks.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Biggest winner.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   Wow. You just glow.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   When you mention DJT, you're just glowing.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   We don't even need to like the stage.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   When we say DJT, it's like a fusion reactor.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   Chamath, who is your biggest political winner for 2024?
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   My biggest--and listen to this very carefully, folks.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   My biggest political winner of 2024
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   is David motherfucking Sax.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   [cheers and applause]
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   Let's go, David Sax!
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Fuck yeah. Nicely done.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   All right.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   Say more, say more.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Well, I said this before, but I'll say it again.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   I've never seen a team of people
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   assembled in any government like this,
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   and I really do mean what I say.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   He is really the best of everything that happens.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   A guy that has emigrated, okay?
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   A guy that's worked his ass off.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   He's done it in many different places,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   in many different ways.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   He's an amazing friend, and he's fucking brilliant.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   And we need brilliant people.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   Yeah, way to go.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   Did you have a political winner there, Friedberg?
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   I know you don't talk too much about politics.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   Well, I went with independent media.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   I think that it totally reinvented--
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   Everyone talks about this,
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   but it had such a huge impact in changing the narrative,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   getting new messages out there that were being filtered
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   or distracted away in other contexts,
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   so I thought that was the biggest winner.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   And everyone's talking about the legacy media anchors
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   all leaving and moving to independent
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   podcasting platforms and so on,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   so that was the biggest winner, I thought.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   All right, I picked the PayPal mafia,
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   yourself included, of course, Sax,
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   Peter Thiel, JD, and Elon, obviously.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   The whole group, I think, really did a great thing.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   Now, whether you are a fan of Donald Trump's or not,
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   if you're left or right,
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   I feel really great that you guys are around Donald Trump,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   and I feel really optimistic
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   and great energy for the country.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   So the fact that the PayPal mafia is there,
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   yourself included, Sax,
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   makes me feel really great about the next four years,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   and I'm so proud that you're doing this,
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   and it's a great sacrifice for your country.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   You could use these cycles for your own benefit,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   and you're using these cycles
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   for the benefit of America and humanity,
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   and I think that deserves a big round of applause.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   [cheers and applause]
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   Okay.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   - Thank you.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   Well, you know, one thing I'll say is,
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   Chamath and I co-hosted the dinner for President Trump.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   It was on June 6th of this past year.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   I remember that because it was D-Day.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   I thought that was somehow significant.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   But they asked me if I would be willing
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   to host a fundraiser for President Trump,
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   and I said, "Well, how much do we need to raise?"
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   And they said, "Well, at a minimum, $5 million."
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   And I didn't--I thought maybe that's a hard number to raise
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   because there's not that many Republicans in San Francisco.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   So the first call I made was to this man, Chamath,
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   and I said, "Would you co-host this with me?"
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   Because I figured, okay, well, if nobody shows up,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   Chamath and I can just split it.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   [laughter]
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   - You dollar-cost-averaged your fundraiser?
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   - Oh, that's so bad.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   - You dollar-cost-averaged.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   - So I knew he could pick up the check with me.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   It was--so in any event, it was a big ask from Chamath
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   because Chamath had never supported Republicans before.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   Obviously, I've been a crazy right-winger from way back,
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   but Chamath had only supported Democrats,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   and he said he was in, and he decided to co-host it with me.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   And so based on that, I told him,
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   "Okay, we're in. We can do this."
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   And then it turns out that more and more people wanted to come
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   because we showed some conviction.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   So then we had $8 million committed,
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   then $10 million committed.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   Then we ended up raising $12 million that night.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   - $13, I thought. - $13, and then $13.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   Well, we got another million on top of it,
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   so we ended up raising $13 million that night, so yeah.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   But it wouldn't have happened unless he decided
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   to co-host it with me, so thank you, Chamath.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   All right, political losers, who do we got?
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   [laughter]
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   I mean, I know this is a tough one, too.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   I've already said this, so this is going to be repetitive,
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   but it's the thing that disappointed me the most personally.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   I think the biggest political loser was Barack Obama.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   [laughter]
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   It's the same thing where there were so many of us
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   that literally would have stood in line for hours
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   to just shake his hand.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   I guess I just revered the idea of who he was,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   and then I just saw a person that was reduced
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   to honestly not telling the truth
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   and doing it repeatedly and repeatedly,
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   and it just lost a tremendous amount of cachet that I had for him
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   and the sensation that I had of who he was as a man.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   Who do you got, Freeberg, biggest loser?
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   It's been said. I just went with legacy media.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   So my biggest political loser was lawfare.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   I thought lawfare was the biggest loser,
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   because not only did it not work, it backfired.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   It backfired.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   Which you predicted.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   You remember, they started the lawfare
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   right when the Republican primary started,
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   and I think Donald Trump would have won it anyway,
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   but once they started these sham trials,
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   they tried to bankrupt him.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   They went after his kids.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   They tried to imprison him.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   Republican support shot through the roof,
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   and he won the primary easily,
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   and then they did the same thing in the general,
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   and it activated and sort of radicalized a lot of people,
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   including myself, because it was so un-American
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   to try and imprison your political opponent.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   So I think it massively backfired,
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   and, of course, it wasn't just against Trump.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   It was also against Elon, too.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Well, where did that get him?
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   They turned Elon from someone who identified
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   formally as a Democrat or an independent
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   to someone who became a Republican.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   So it was not only-- not only did it not work,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   it basically had the exact opposite effect
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   of what they intended.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   Yeah, I picked Biden and the Democratic machine
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   as my biggest loser for obvious reasons,
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   and as we talked about on the pod, gosh,
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   it was so obvious that they were covering up
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   Biden's cognitive decline,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   and we're all sadly going to be in decline
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   at some point in our lives,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   and that should be something where that person
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   is supported and not abused in the way he was abused.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   I felt it was elder abuse.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   We make that as a joke.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   And then not running a speed primary,
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   and that's when, for me, a left-leaning moderate,
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   I felt like I can't support this
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   if you don't actually have a primary process,
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   and I think they destroyed the party,
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   and it just has to be rebuilt from the bottom up.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   It was a disaster, and I'm super disappointed,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   like many people, in their thuggy
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   and criminal-type behavior.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   I felt it was really low ethics,
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   and I'm not happy about it.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   [applause]
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Okay, let's go political surprises.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   Political surprises.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Anybody have a surprise?
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   Chamath, you look like you got one ready to go.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   My political surprise is J.D. Vance.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   [applause]
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   I don't think, if this works out properly,
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   there will be a Republican Party
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   the way that you normally knew it.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   I think it is a MAGA party,
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   and I think that J.D. Vance has the potential
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   to become the standard-bearer past Trump,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   so that baton pass, I think, has the best potential.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   And what I'll tell you about him as a person
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   is this is a guy, if you have a chance,
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   he will be here a lot, I suspect,
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   especially because of David.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Meet the man, understand where he's coming from.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   This is an incredible human being.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   I really do mean that, folks.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   And I'm like a skeptical kind of--
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   generally, I'm not super effusive about people.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   You're thoughtful about who you would become friends with.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   He's an incredible human being.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   You got a surprise for us, Friedberg?
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   What was your surprise this political season, 2024?
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   I listened to the episode of Pod Save America last week
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   where the Democratic leadership that ran the Harris campaign
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   kind of gave their breakdown on what happened.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   And what struck me the most about the conversation
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   and the way they talked about everything
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   was everything was about some demographic heuristic.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   Black males should do this.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   White college-educated females should do that.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Everything was broken down to this, like,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   you are defined by whatever label we put on you
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   and we expect that voting bloc,
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   and we analyze you as a voting bloc, as a group,
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   and how you all move together.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   And all of that shit broke down.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   What happened in this election cycle
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   was a lot of people voted as independently-minded people
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   in a way that I think broke their brains.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   They didn't understand how and why
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   people were starting to think on their own.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   And so I don't think anyone anticipated
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   that going into this year.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   It's certainly closely coupled
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   with the rise of independent media,
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   but individuals taking choice
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   for not just being categorized and labeled and bucketed
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   and told how to vote and what to think and what to do.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   People stood up and said,
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   "I'm going to have my own thoughts on stuff."
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   And suddenly all of the models broke.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   That was the biggest surprise,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   and I thought it was like a big sea change,
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   at least in the United States.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   - I think it's a really great point you're making.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   One great thing that could come out of this
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   is the return to judging people by their character,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   their performance, their actions,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   as opposed to identity politics,
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   which is a true dead end in our society.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   I think it's really well said, Freeberg.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   Did you have a political surprise this year, Sax?
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   - Yeah, I would say building on what you guys said,
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   my biggest political surprise was that
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   even in deep blue cities like San Francisco,
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   the voters rejected the woke left
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   in favor of more moderate alternatives.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   So here in San Francisco,
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   we got Daniel Lurie as mayor.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   He was elected.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   Dean Preston and Aaron Peskin were defeated.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   We have a moderate majority on the Board of Supervisors.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   In Oakland, the leftist mayor and DA got recalled.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   In L.A. County, we beat George Gascogne,
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   who was the Soros DA.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   [cheers and applause]
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   Statewide, Prop 36 passed.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   This is the proposition to make crime illegal again.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   [laughter]
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   And so even in a deep blue state like California,
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   you're seeing a return to sanity.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   - You know, I had a surprise.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   I was gonna say "podcasts,"
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   but when I thought about it, it was obvious to us,
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   and I think a lot of people,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   that podcasts were gonna play a big role.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   And it's clear podcasts played a big role,
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   but I want to specifically shout out
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Friedberg and our podcast
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   for bringing up the topic two or three years ago
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   of the budget deficit
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   and our out-of-control spending.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   And you harped on this, Friedberg.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   [cheers and applause]
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   And, you know, I thought the election
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   would be a referendum on Trump's behavior in the past.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   I thought it would be a referendum on abortion
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   and a woman's right to choose,
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   and I'm not saying these aren't important issues.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   But now it's turned out that efficiency of our government
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   and our fiscal responsibility
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   and what we pass on to our children
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   is now the most important issue.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   I want to pause for a second. - Hallelujah.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   [cheers and applause]
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   - Yeah, and I think it's a big round of applause for Friedberg
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   because I just want to pause for a second
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   of how unpopular that topic was.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   We said ourselves on the pod,
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   there is no way that any politician
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   will ever take this up
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   because it's too toxic to talk about cutting spending,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   you'll never get elected, et cetera.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   And now we're sitting here,
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   and I think because of you harping on it,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   us talking about it,
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   Elon caring about it,
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   Vivek, who came on the pod,
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   and he really got passionate about it,
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   now we have Doge.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   And one of the greatest things
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   that could happen in this administration,
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   and I would be very proud, you know,
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   of your contribution and the pod's contribution to this,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   is if we can just control our spending
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   so we do not mortgage
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   our children's future disastrously.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   And this is the most important thing
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   over the next year or two.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   If you don't like Trump and you didn't vote for him,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   you can support Doge, you can support Elon,
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   you can support having a balanced budget
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   and us controlling spending.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   It is an issue for all Americans, truly.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   All right, this is a hot start.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   We got a hot start.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   Pass me one of those awards there.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   - Here you go. - Here we go.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   - All right, J. Cal's gonna invite
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   our first guest tonight.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   Look at this.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   - Wow.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   - This is some serious man love.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   - That's me and Chamath.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   - Should we clean up the naughty and nice list,
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   by the way, off the--
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   - It's an ergonomic representation
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   of me and Chamath hugging it out.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   - It's not easy to give a hug like that
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   when you're on the spectrum, is it, Sax?
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   - Not easy.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   - But you got through it.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   So, it's a strength for him.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   Tonight, I'm very proud
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   to give the award
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   for setting the most money on fire
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   in pursuit of a failed campaign
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   to the one, the only, Aaron Levy,
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   friend of the pod from Box.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   Welcome, Aaron Levy.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   [cheers and applause]

[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   ♪ ♪
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   - Okay, I have no idea why I said yes to this.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   So, also, what the hell is this thing?
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   I think this is the closest I'll ever get
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   to speaking at the Republican National Convention,
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   so thank you.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   Good to be here.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   I have a couple notes.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   So, first of all,
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   why didn't Mark Cuban or Vinod Khosla accept this?
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   Why is this me?
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   I don't understand what happened here.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   - Vinod doesn't have a sense of humor.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   - Okay, okay, so...
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   All right, so yes,
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   we did waste a little bit of money on this campaign,
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   but it went to the Vegas sphere.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   So did you see the sphere
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   and how well that was-- the campaign used that money?
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   So I decided to do a little bit of a post-mortem,
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   so we called the campaign and talked to Kamala
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   just to, you know, understand afterwards,
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   you know, what the reaction was.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   Her response stood out to me, actually, pretty profoundly,
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   so I actually wrote it down.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   I wanted to make sure I got it kind of word for word.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   She said, and I quote,
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   "I'm in the arena trying stuff.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   "Some will work, some won't,
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   "but always learning."
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   And, you know, I actually felt like that was a really good
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   and profound way to think about the campaign.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   So I left a lot better after hearing that.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   So now I do want to congratulate David Sachs.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   Obviously on his new role in the administration.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   Pretty incredible.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   The PayPal mafia takeover of the government is now complete,
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   so good work on that.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   [laughter]
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   You know, I was getting worried, actually.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   So they told me about this, actually, like three or four days ago.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   Changed the whole plan, obviously, midway.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   Nothing about what is going on right now was the plan.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   But I had to kind of say a couple lines about each person,
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   and so David I was getting worried about because I didn't--
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   you know, sort of, I've been worried for David
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   because I didn't know what he would do
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   given Trump promised to end the war in Ukraine.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   Like, what else is David going to talk about?
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   So, you know, I've known David's views on the war in Ukraine,
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   but I actually didn't know that it was so serious
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   that you become a czar.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   I mean, that's pretty impressive.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   Now, what's cool about David's new role,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   leading the Council of Advisors for Science and Technology,
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   you can kind of think about him as, like, the IT guy of the government now.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   [laughter]
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   So if you have any issues with the DMV website, he is your guy.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   And you also have the benefit of being the crypto czar,
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   so I think if you could just let us know at some point in the conversation,
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   what do you think the price target is on the Hoctua coin?
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   Like, where are we headed with this?
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   Now, David works in the government,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   which means we have an inside track for some of the besties.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   Which I think will be pretty helpful for various positions in the Cabinet.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   And I know there's already a pick for this one,
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   but if a position happens to open up for Transportation Secretary,
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   maybe you could let them know that Jason was the first investor in Uber.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   [laughter]
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   And I feel like that would make him an expert in this topic.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   Third or fourth, I think, actually.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   I was just going off of Wikipedia.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   [laughter]
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   I changed it today in anticipation.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   Now, unfortunately, Jason's probably disqualified for the Cabinet,
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   because somehow he's actually even more woke than me.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   [laughter]
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   This guy loves masks more than Anthony Fauci.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   He once tweeted--
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   and I actually want to be very clear about this.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   This was in October of 2021.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   He once tweeted, "Not to be a narc,
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   but half the folks are not wearing masks at the Staples Center right now."
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   [laughter]
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   Hashtag super spreader.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   [laughter]
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   I added the hashtag, sorry.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   Okay, and speaking of COVID, we're going to bring it home now.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   Friedberg, I know this situation must be very difficult for you
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   with RFK Jr. coming on board.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   Everyone knows about preppers building out bunkers in case of disaster, right?
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   Everybody talks about these kind of preppers.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   Friedberg's bunker looks a little bit different than everybody else's right now.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   Usually you want to stock up on ammo, cans of beans, et cetera.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   For Friedberg, it's obviously quinoa, but--
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   [laughter]
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   He has one of every vaccine, tons of pesticides,
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   and a lifetime supply of fluoride packed away.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   [laughter]
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   So we're getting ready for anything that could come next in this government.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   Anyway, in all seriousness, thanks for this incredible honor,
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   whatever this thing is.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   I'm extremely optimistic for the path ahead in America.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   We have a lot we can get done.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   So excited for that. Let's do it.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   Thank you. Have a seat. Join us.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   Give it up, everybody, for Aaron Levy.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   Well done.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   Come join us.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   All right.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   [applause]
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   Aaron's going to hang out and do the next couple of awards with us.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   I just want to say that Aaron is my favorite white dude for Harris.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   [laughter]
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   All right. The official line is beta male for Harris.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   That was--you got that wrong.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   I'll let Mark Cuban know he's number two.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   [laughter]
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   You know, I just realized I was the Series B investor in both of your companies.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   Wow.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   You know, it's incredible that David Sachs blew off the typical ceiling that you have
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   being a B2B SaaS founder.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   So this means we have something we can now strive for.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   So this is incredible.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   All right.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   We're going to do another set of awards here.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   Let's get this back on track.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   But actually, can we be--it was pretty cool, though,
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   that the literal upcoming president of America mentioned Yammer in a tweet.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   I mean, that is actually pretty cool.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   That was pretty great.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   I was surprised you didn't get a genie mentioned in there.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   It's a deep pull.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   Let's go over to our next set of awards.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   This first one is Best CEO, Not Named Elon Musk.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   So this is our yearly award for the Best CEO, Not Named Elon Musk.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   Who do you got, Freeberg?
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   Jensen.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   Jensen, an obvious one.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   I mean, everyone knows the numbers.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   What else is there to say?
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   Okay.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   That guy has been compounding.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   And the crazy thing about compounding is if you zoom out at the end,
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   everything looks pretty slow and flat and steady for a while until the end.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   And he's built so many advantages into that business,
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   and it's finally paying off.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   The macro was right, technology advantage, everything.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   It's just extraordinary patience, diligence, execution.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   Okay, Best CEO, Not Named Elon Musk.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   What do you got, Shamak?
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   Dave Ricks, the CEO of Eli Lilly.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   Okay.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   Managed to build a billion-dollar company and is just ripping.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   Ripping.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   Seems unstoppable.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   Sax, who's your Best CEO, Not Named Elon Musk?
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   Well, I mean, Freeberg's right.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   If you look at the Mag 7, Jensen had the best performance.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   But since that one was taken,
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   the number two actually was Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   You know, he's--
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   5X?
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   Hold on.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   He's been sneaky creeping up there.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   I mean, if you look at Facebook's performance or Meta's performance over the last two years,
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   it's up 500%.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   So it has done surprisingly well.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   And I will give him credit for back in August,
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   he wrote a letter basically apologizing for the censorship that Meta had done
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   exposing the government's role and the FBI's role in the whole Hunter Biden cover-up,
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   which he did not have to do at that point in time.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   It was not clear yet that Trump was going to win the election.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   So I think he deserves a little bit of credit for basically--
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   A little bit?
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   --for wanting to do the right thing on free speech.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   But in all honesty, how long did you make him wait to meet with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago last week?
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   How long was the wait?
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   Did you put an extra hour on the wait?
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   Okay. Did you have a best CEO not named Elon Musk, Aaron Levy?
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   I'm actually going to steal saxes.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   Zuck, for a very different kind of reason,
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   but I think Zuck is our counterpressure on the price of AI right now.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   And I think that he has a way of monetizing AI that is--
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   I mean, Google kind of has a similar thing, but they have a more existential challenge
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   that I think they're actually doing relatively well kind of dealing with.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   And Zuck, just to improve ads, can give away AI for the world
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   and keep everybody on their toes in terms of driving down the price.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   So I think that's good for all of us.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   All right. Well done.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   I also had Jensen, for obvious reasons.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   Let's go with best investor.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   The NVIDIA crowd here is great.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   Just sponsor the show next year, guys.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   You could be in the VIP. You can afford it.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   I don't know why you guys are in Section Z.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   Unbelievable. Maybe they're frugal.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   I guess Jensen's checking those expense accounts.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   Who do you got as your best investor, Friedberg?
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   I just gave the best investor to the best public trade of the year,
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   which was Druckenmiller, when he shorted treasuries.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   Told everyone inflation is not under control yet.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   We still have a ways to go.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   No one was listening. He shorted treasuries.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   We don't know what the actual ins and outs were,
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   but he has an incredible ability to be so very prescient, very public,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   very, like, direct when he has big bets and be right.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   Even if it is just a trade, I don't know what net returns are, etc.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   But, man, that guy, when he talks, you got to listen.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   Chamath, who's the best investor of 2024 in your mind, besides yourself?
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   I was going to say me, but--
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   We know.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   I'd give it to Michael Saylor.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   I think that--
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   Whoa!
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   Bitcoin Max is in the back.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   I think he's found this incredible--
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   He's an investor.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   I mean, he's the executive chairman of MicroStrategy,
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   so he's not really involved in the day-to-day.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   He's really running their Bitcoin position,
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   and he's created this massively levered, long Bitcoin play.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   He's borrowing money at essentially zero.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   His returns are bananas right now.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   What could go wrong?
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   Sax, who is your best investor?
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   I had Druckenmiller as well for a similar reason,
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   which is it wasn't just the Treasury bet.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   It's the fact that he's been warning for years
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   that the U.S. fiscal situation is unsustainable.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   And in a way, he's like the investor version of Doge.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   He's basically saying, "If we don't fix this,
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   we're going to have a huge, huge problem."
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   Aaron, do you have a best investor for 2024 you can share?
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   I think the solo GP kind of cohort,
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   but Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross,
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   they're quietly building
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   probably one of the most powerful AI portfolios
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   that we're going to see kind of play out.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   So they were first in line in this wave,
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   and I think they're on top of it.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   Okay, obviously an LP in the firm.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   And so I'm going to go with Peter.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   I'm just taking a guess, an educated one.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   Best investor for me was Peter Thiel, but on two tracks.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   Obviously, Peter's been in some of the great companies
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   through Founders Fund, including SpaceX.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   But he also picked Trump, he also picked Vance,
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   and he also picked Sachs.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   So I think it's undeniable that Peter Thiel
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   is just a great picker, hands down,
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   one of the greatest investors,
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   whether it's in people, politics, or businesses.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   So I give it to Peter Thiel.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   Let's do our best new product, best new product of 2024.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   Aaron, I'm going to start with you this time.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   What's the best new product that you launched at Box?
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   We do, but I'll exclude ourselves from this.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   But I think the wave of voice AI I'm most compelled by right now
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   as sort of the 2024--
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   you can see the semblance of actually a new paradigm for mobile.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   We've kind of had the same thing on mobile for 20 years.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   And so the ability to actually, in a high-quality way,
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   talk to your phone, have it do something,
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   I think you're starting to see signs.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   The latest version of Gemini is just incredibly powerful.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   Perplexity has very good work here.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   Chat GPT, advanced voice mode.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   So I think you're going to start to see this shape
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   kind of computing in the next couple of years.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   Sachs, any new products this year that captured your imagination?
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   Yeah, I think this is the year that self-driving finally broke through.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   Obviously, Tesla's got full self-driving,
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   but also this Waymo One app, people are going wild over it.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   I think this is the year that self-driving broke through,
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   and I think next year it's going to get bigger and bigger.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   Chamath, best new product this year?
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   I'll pick the 2024 King's Cashmere collection from Loro Piana.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   That was my number two.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   Exceptional, like a baby's foreskin.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   Okay, I think--
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   I just got a message that Loro Piana made a big drop-off at your house.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   Okay, unbelievable.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   I would just like to say the best new product of the year
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   is anything Tom Ford made, so I'd like to pander as well.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   What do you got, Freeberg?
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   I was with Aaron.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   I think advanced voice AI is a game-changing new UX.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   It's going to change computing, and it's weird.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   When you start using it, you can have a dialogue,
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   learn something you never thought you could learn,
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   and just ask questions and engage like you're speaking to your own personal tutor.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   It's incredible.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   Very interestingly, we have two people talking about voice AI,
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   and Sax, I was with you.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   I think this is the year that self-driving is actually manifesting
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   across nine different companies.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   The companies in China, there are six or seven of them actually active,
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   as well as obviously Waymo and FSD 12.X has been really a major upgrade,
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   so I went with self-driving.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   That's our amazing cohort.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   Let's give it up for Mr. Aaron Levy.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   Thanks, all. Thank you.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   Here's your chart.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   We had this great moment of hourly earnings growth going up,
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   so how much people make on average.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   You're probably wondering why I look so bored.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   I mean, honestly, I want these dipshits to stop blabbering on,
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   pass me the ball, and get the f*ck out of the way.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   The wine is delicious, by the way.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   If only we could do an episode my way.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   Hey, everybody, welcome to the All In Podcast.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   For the first time ever, I, Chamath, the dictator, am moderating.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   I've replaced the besties with a couple of special guests.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   We literally have three of the world's greatest minds and bodies on the show.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   First up, let me welcome one of Silicon Valley's most legendary investors, Chamath.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   Thanks, Chamath.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   By the way, that is a beautiful sweater.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   Okay, but let's cut the sh*t and let's get right into the show,
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   because honestly, this could be the best episode ever.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   You're right, Chamath.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   Let's start with markets today, because we also have
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   one of the greatest public market prognosticators in the world.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   What is going on with the economy, Chamath?
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   Great question, Chamath.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   Well, look, I think the U.S. economy, honestly, is a tightly coiled spring.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   The future looks unbelievably bright.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   Or we're in a recession.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   My gosh, I couldn't have said it better myself.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   Okay, guys, let's get into Science Corner next.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   We have another brilliant mind on the show,
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   technically incredible, a scientific genius.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   Tell us what you've made, Chamath.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   Well, I'm really excited to share that my new company, Shmoshmallow,
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   has come up with a new way to grow perfect grapes in any weather.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   So now every grape can produce a 1992 Chateau Latour.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   What? That's incredible!
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   Can I invest a billion dollars?
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   Well, we're going to have to see about that, Chamath.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   Wow, guys, this truly is the best episode ever.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   Orgasmic!
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   Wow!
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   Wow.
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   All right, we're going to move on.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   I would watch that show.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   We're going to welcome our second in-person award winner.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   I would watch that show. I want to see that.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   Our second in-person award winner of the night,
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   our award for second best Botes sister,
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   please welcome Alex Botes.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   All right, friend of the pod.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   [music]
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   Can you guys hear me?
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   Well, good, because I have some awards to give out as well.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   Oh, no.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   Chamath, congratulations on the most likely to think of Elon
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   when making love.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   Do you guys remember when Chamath
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   was posting thirst traps on Twitter?
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   Imagine being a billionaire so annoying
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   that you still need a six-pack to get laid.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   Next up, please join me in saluting
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   America's first czar, All Hail Sax.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   Congratulations on no longer being the least successful
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   of the PayPal mafia.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   [laughter]
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   Oh, that one stung.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   It's good to see J-Cal laughing.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   I'm surprised you showed your face tonight
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   after Palmer Lucky annihilated you last summit.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   Congratulations on proving that ass-kissing can be a career.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   This year, you win most investments, least exits award.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   Thank you. Thank you.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   Okay, guys, this next one is a little bit spicy.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   J-Cal gets pegged by the VC industrial complex,
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   and each time he whimpers "Uber" as his safe word.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   And last but not least, David Friedberg,
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   the human equivalent of Soylent.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   Oh! Ooh!
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   Jamaad likes that.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   Friedberg definitely got bullied all his life,
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   but lucky for him, being autistic is now trendy.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   But, hey, I got to give credit where it's due.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   Friedberg, thank you for making the world a better place
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   for Monsanto shareholders.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   [laughter]
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   Thank you very much, everyone. I'm Alex Bowden.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   Okay. Thank you, Alex Bowden.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   [cheers and applause]
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   All right.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   Wow.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   Well, you know, let's do our congratulations.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   Alex, welcome back to the stage.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   Thank you for having me.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   It's great to see you.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   Last time you were here, you beat three or four of us
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   at the same time playing chess.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   Two of four.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   Two of four, and what?
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   She had a push with one of you, a stomach?
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   I blundered the queen, but I won on time.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   Okay, you won on time.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   I don't really give it to myself.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   How much have you been thinking about your defeat by Saks
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   over the last six months?
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   Clearly a lot after that roast.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   Yes, it explains a lot.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   Not that you're competitive.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   You know, we have some amazing awards to give.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   Let's go with our favorite media, favorite media of 2024.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   Did you have a favorite media pick, Saks?
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   Well, it's got to be podcasts, and I don't just mean our own.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   Like, pretty much all I watch these days are just podcasts,
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   you know, so I never watch any network TV anymore.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   Do you have a specific one that comes to mind?
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   Well, if--
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   It begins with a T.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   If I could only pick one that's not us,
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   there's a podcast called The Duran
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   that I like a lot on international affairs,
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   so check that one out.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   Oh, okay, deep pull, deep pull.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   Tucker's going to be brokenhearted.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   Chamath, favorite media, 2024.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   This is--the director is a friend of ours.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   His name is Francesco Carozzini.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   The show is called Super Sex on Netflix.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   It is about the life of the Italian porn star Rocco Soffredi.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   It's phenomenal.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   It builds, there's drama, it's about his life as a kid,
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   it's his relationship with his mom,
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   his relationship with his older brother.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   It's really good.
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   Super Sex on Netflix.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   Okay, so Chamath just picked Pornhub for his favorite media.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   Great, deep pull, so to speak.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   Freeberg?
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   Dune 2.
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   Come on, it was unbelievable.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   I did not think that Dune 2 could beat Dune.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   The black--I mean, you saw, you're a little--
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   Don't act like you're not a nerd on the cinema right now.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   You can't do that.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   Dune 2 is pretty great.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   You know, I wanted to come up with something a little bit more recent,
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   so I went with Day of the Jackal.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   It's a new show based on the 1970s thriller.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   I just watched episode 8.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   Nat and I watched it before we came up.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   Good.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   Great, episode 8.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   Have you seen episode 8?
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   I watched episode 8.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   Yes, it's great.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   Awesome.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   Phenomenal.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   So just, you know, great pull.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   Alex, what do you got?
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   Any favorite media for 2024?
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   Hawk 2 Up, but listen up, not what she did with the meme coin,
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   but I've never seen anybody ride her 15 seconds of stardom
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   the way she was able to do,
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   especially when it's so hard to become viral across all platforms nowadays.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   She was like a top 10 podcast for a couple weeks, right?
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   Yeah, I think she peaked at number three.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   Yeah, it is pretty incredible.
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   Inside story, the week Hawk 2 Up happened,
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   we were going to have her on the pod.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   Sax and I were like, "Yeah, great pull.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   We should do it."
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   And guess who spiked it?
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   Not Shamov.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   We could have had Hawk 2 Up on the pod to talk about Ukraine,
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   to talk about Kamala.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   I mean, the world needed to know her take.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   Let's--imagine right after that clip comes out,
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   let's have a bunch of guys talk to her and be like,
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   "Yeah, what do you think?"
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   and not look like a bunch of creepers.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   That would have been a terrible idea.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   I still stand by the strike.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   Your editorial instincts remain terrible.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   Sax, best startup of the year.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   I'm just going to use this to promote my own thing.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   Yes, of course.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   I go glue, I go glue.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   Glue, of course.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   Fantastic.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   Shamov, your best startup of the year.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   I'm going to go with O'Halo.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   Oh, wait a second.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   I want grapes the size of my balls.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   I want strawberries--hold on.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   I want strawberries the size of women's boobs.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   I want potatoes the size of butt cheeks.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   It's going to be fabulous.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   The world's going to be incredible.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   But you have not--none of them--
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   No, no, no.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   Kidding aside, I do think what Freeberg is doing is bananas.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   But true story, none of us have been able to wet our beaks in O'Halo yet.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   None of us except Founders Fund.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   No, he offers us a chance to invest every time a round is closed
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   and a new valuation is set.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   Unbelievable.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   With friends like this.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   Freeberg, would you like to commit at getting us all in?
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   Well, now I've got to say 80/90 and glue.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   I mean, it's tied.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   But I will say we've obviously talked a lot about the thesis behind 80/90.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   I'm an investor; you're an investor.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   But I put Anderle as my winner because--
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   Yeah, friend of the pod, Palmer Lucky.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   I will say just talking about the collapse of Boeing, the new administration,
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   and the number of people that are around Anderle that are also now around the administration
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   creating a merit-based system for defense spending
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   to kind of upgrade systems and strategies in defense, it's inevitable.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   If you look at what China's doing, the U.S. is going to have to respond accordingly.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   He's like another one of these crazy people which is like,
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   how does he go from building a VR headset to--
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   Well, he also made this game system called Chromatic.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   I mean, he's incredible.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   The guy's a genius.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   But, I mean, the whole business is set up with just a great group of investors.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   It's perfectly aligned.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000]   The macro is right.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   I just think that that's going to be the next Boeing.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   Yeah, great timing.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   It's of the moment.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   What do you got, Alex?
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   Do you have a great favorite startup?
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   I like Anthropic because I like Claude a lot.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   And also, I'm not going to say OpenAI
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   because I don't know what they're going to do with all the rumors lately,
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   but I do use ChatGPT even more.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   Okay, well done.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   And I picked Athena, one of our great investments this year
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   that has tripled revenue.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   I'm very proud of the team over there.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   Let's go with biggest flop.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   Do you have a biggest flop, Chamath, this year?
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   Okay, this is going to be a controversial take.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   I think the biggest--I don't want to say it's a flop,
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.000]   but I think the biggest disappointment of this year, to me, was OpenAI.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   I'll tell you why.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   I think they are the most at risk,
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   mostly because of things that are out of their control.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   So, number one, I think the quality of these models have hit a wall,
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   and it's the folks that own private information--
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   for example, what Elon owns through X--
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   that is going to make the game changer in the quality of the models.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   Two, he's actually bought now not just the largest NVIDIA cluster,
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   but he's promised to buy 900,000 more.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   Do you know what happens when you buy 100,000
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   and then promise to buy 900,000?
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   Not only are you at the front of the line, you consume NVIDIA's attention.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   And what that means is it's going to be so hard for everybody else
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   to get a hold of what they need to train.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   I think it's a very tricky situation for those guys.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   Sax, you got a biggest flop for the year? Biggest flop?
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   My biggest flop was the self-declared knucklehead, Tim Waltz,
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   from Minnesota.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   Freeberg?
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   Apple Vision Pro.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000]   Apple Vision Pro?
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   Yeah, I think it's a great start. It feels like the Apple Newton.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   It's definitely going to usher in kind of a new computing platform,
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   but it's definitely not prime-time ready, as we saw with the sales.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   Alex, did you have a biggest flop for the year?
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   The Netflix cover of the Jake Paul-Mike Tyson fight.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   It was their first--
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   Good call, good call.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   That was a good one, yeah.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   I mean, they were into live sports,
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   and they just couldn't keep up with the streaming capabilities,
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   and then they got hit with a $50 million lawsuit.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   Do you think it was fake?
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   Do I think it was fake?
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   I don't think so.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   I think Mike Tyson actually needed the money,
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   and that's probably why he fought.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   But you think he tried fully, like he went--
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   I think he tried his best.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   Yeah.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   Doesn't your sister box?
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   Doesn't your sister do boxing?
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   My sister does box, yeah,
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   but tonight she'll be DJing at the after party.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   She'll be kicking ass on the ones and the twos.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   You know, Friedberg used to DJ in college.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   I heard Friedberg used to rave, actually.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   Is that true?
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   Yes.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   Friedberg used to drop the beat.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   Yes.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   My biggest--
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   It doesn't get old.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   I mean, what do I say?
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   My biggest flop was Boeing's Starliner embarrassment.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   I mean, if you bring astronauts up to the space station,
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   you're kind of obligated to get them back down.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   That's true.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   That's-- I can't think of anything worse than that.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000]   That's a great-- that's a great call, actually.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   Okay.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000]   Thank you, Alex, for joining us.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   Let's thank Alex Botez.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000]   Well done.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   Big round of applause for our friend of the pod, Alex Botez.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   And by the way--
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   Thank you.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   [music]
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   All right, we have one more award to do.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000]   Two more awards.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   Two more awards.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   Here we go.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   The biggest sports story and the moment of the year.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   Biggest sports story, a little sports in here,
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   and then the moment of the year.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   Chamath, do you have the biggest sports story of the year?
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   I think it's Brawny James playing with his dad, LeBron.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000]   I think it was an incredible moment,
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.000]   and I think LeBron deserved it for everything he's done for the NBA.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000]   All right, well done.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   What about you, Sax?
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000]   Do you have a best sport?
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:34.000]   I know you're not physically active at all, but do you have a sports--
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   Well, I think the biggest sports story of the year was the Olympics,
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000]   and really the memes that came out of the--
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   I didn't really watch the Olympics.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   I just saw the memes.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   That's what I was in it for.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   And we had that trans last supper.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   There was that shooter from Turkey, and the pole vaulter.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000]   Pole vaulter, yeah.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   Remember the pole vaulter?
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000]   Yeah, Chamath.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   He was moonlighting as the pole vaulter.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000]   That's happened to me a couple times.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000]   That was what I remember.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   Pole vaulter was pretty depressing.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000]   Freiburg?
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   I went with Australian hip-hop at the Olympics.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   Australian hip-hop at the Olympics.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:16.000]   But I do think that that moment really kind of showed everyone
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.000]   how ridiculous things had gotten.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000]   And it was like, at least in certain circles,
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   it felt very resident of a broader set of things that were happening.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000]   And everyone was like, "How is this an Olympic sport?
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   How is this happening?"
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000]   And it made a lot of people start to question the sanity
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   of a lot of the institutions around us and things that were going on.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000]   Yeah, and I too thought the biggest moment in sports was at the Olympics,
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000]   and just gender in sports generally as a topic,
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000]   which we're going to need to get through as a society,
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   where we have not only transgender individuals but intersex folks.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000]   We need to work this issue out in good faith and have, I think,
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000]   a thoughtful dialogue about it, specifically with the boxing
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   and some of the other sports.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000]   Let's go to our moment of the year.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000]   The moment of the year.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   I'll kick it off, Sax.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   I thought the moment of the year for me was not the assassination attempt
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000]   at Trump, obviously, but his reaction to it.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000]   When he got up and he pumped his fist and he said, "Fight, fight, fight,"
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   I think you got an idea of his character and that he wasn't going to give up.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000]   [applause]
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   And thank God that he wasn't hit by that bullet.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   I know it was an inch.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   Yeah, 100%. I mean, that was mine too, 100%.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000]   That was like the moment of the year, the photo of the year.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000]   That's the image we're always going to remember.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000]   Pretty iconic, yeah.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000]   What do you got for the moment of the year, Chamath?
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000]   March 16th.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   It was a Saturday.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000]   It was the greatest sexual encounter of my life.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   [laughter]
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000]   I gave Nat an enormous internal "oh."
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   All by myself.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000]   Wait, wait.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000]   [laughter]
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   Okay, so wait, the greatest moment of the year
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   was the sexual encounter that you had--
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000]   With my wife.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000]   With your wife.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   Really, you know, it's interesting.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000]   I think we all got the tsunami warning when that happened.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.000]   It was pretty-- it shattered the whole Bay Area.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   Freeberg, would you like to also pick the 17 seconds
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000]   of your latest sexual encounter?
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.000]   [laughter]
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000]   It was the Trump assassination attempt.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000]   So we had consensus here
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   of what the most iconic moment of the year was.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   When it happened, I was sitting outside
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   having beer with a bunch of people.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   And I remember there was, like, 12 of us.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000]   And we looked around the table, and everyone was like,
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000]   "He just won the election."
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000]   That was it.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000]   It was, like, in that moment, I knew--
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000]   It felt like that was it.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   So I think it defined the year.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000]   Okay, so that concludes
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   all of the amazing awards we've given.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   That is.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000]   That's our awards.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   Do you want to do a--
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000]   I don't know, maybe end with a little Christmas card?
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000]   What you're grateful for, looking forward,
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000]   hope for the New Year, and then we'll kind of--
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000]   Well, you know, it's always a good time
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   at the end of the year to reflect
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.000]   on the pod, on the community,
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   and what we all experienced this year.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000]   Obviously, a major eventful year.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   Looking into next year,
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   maybe what we learned this year,
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000]   having just great conversations
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000]   on the pod and off the pod,
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   in the group chat, at the summit.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   Any reflections on the year that was, Shamath?
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   And then maybe some hope for 2025.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.000]   I'll just remind everybody that we are
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000]   the sum of our family and our friends.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000]   This year, you moved away,
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000]   which is really heartbreaking.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000]   One of our really great friends in the poker game
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   has been struggling with
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.000]   a bunch of very serious health issues.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000]   So it's just a reminder for me that,
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000]   you know, it just goes by really fast.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.000]   I feel really lucky to be around you guys.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000]   I feel really lucky that folks like you exist.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000]   Thank you for listening.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000]   I love all of you.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000]   Thank you.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   Saks, would you like to try to channel emotion
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000]   as we wrap up the show and reflect on
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000]   feelings that might have come up
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   inside of that meat sack, yeah, over there?
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000]   Call him a meat sack?
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000]   I mean, to be honest, I was starting to feel
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000]   really annoyed with you, J. Cal, on the pod.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.000]   I wasn't sure how much longer I could put up with it,
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000]   to be perfectly frank.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000]   But, you know, tonight,
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   you kind of remind me why it's fun to do this.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000]   Oh, thank you.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000]   And so, yeah, I'm very happy to be here tonight
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   and be part of this.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000]   Well, yeah, reflecting on it, thank you.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   I, too, am reminded
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000]   how absolutely insufferable it is
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   to talk about Ukraine every week.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   But that I love you and spending time with you,
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000]   all three of you, and debating this
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000]   and learning together and growing as men
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000]   and maybe trying to help and give back.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000]   You know, there's so many positive things
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000]   that come out of a good faith discussion.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000]   And, you know, we argue, we fight, we debate,
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000]   but we always come together every week
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000]   and we start it all over again.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   And we are cantankerous and we're perfectionists
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000]   and we really try to make this a great product
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000]   and we really care about the audience.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000]   And it's just so wonderful that we didn't quit.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000]   I remember we had that conversation in the beginning
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   and Chamath was saying, like, you know,
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000]   "How does this become successful?"
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000]   And I said, "It becomes successful
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000]   if we just show up every week.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000]   If we just show up every week, it's going to work
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   and it's going to be great."
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000]   And, you know, here we are going into year five
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000]   and I'm just so happy that we didn't quit.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000]   [cheers and applause]
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000]   And that we kept going forward.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000]   And I hope that we can all do this in 30 or 40 years
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000]   in diapers, in a nursing home somewhere in Italy.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   I hope we do this for the rest of our lives
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000]   because it's been such an incredible joy.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000]   And, man, I just love the fact that y'all come out
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.000]   and stop us at airports or take a selfie
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   and tell us what you think of the show.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000]   Friedberg, any thoughts on the year that was
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.000]   and the pod and, you know, this incredible moment of sacks?
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000]   Many times when I was going to quit this show
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000]   and I think how much I really don't like J. Kell.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000]   That's the theme and the reflections.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000]   And then sometimes I'll sit in my bath,
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000]   I'll have my feet up, and I'll think to myself,
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000]   "Man, I love J. Kell."
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.000]   And for all the challenges that each of us have,
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000]   I'm very grateful for the moment of being here with you guys.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000]   It's made a huge impact on my life
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000]   that I never thought would be the case.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.000]   Thank you.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.000]   I also think we're in an amazing moment.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000]   The United States, certain people in the United States
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000]   are really blessed and do really well.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000]   There's a lot of challenges
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000]   and a lot of things that need to be fixed
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000]   and a lot of people that struggle a lot.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000]   And outside the United States,
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000]   there's a lot more people that struggle a lot.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000]   And I'm really hopeful that--
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000]   I really do believe that technology drives prosperity
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:37.000]   and that technology and kind of the ability for technology
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000]   to kind of transform lives around the world
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.000]   can help everyone.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000]   And I'm very hopeful because I have not been hopeful
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000]   in this way in a long time.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000]   And I think that over the next couple of years,
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.000]   there will be an amazing kind of evolution
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000]   that'll be unleashed in prosperity
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000]   that will really make a big impact.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000]   So I'm super helpful, super happy, and super excited.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000]   Yeah, that's a great note, great note.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000]   Thank you to the amazing band tonight.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000]   Very well done.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.000]   Big round of applause for the band and the production team.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000]   That's it. Well done.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000]   Let's get some founder mode. Come on.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000]   Yeah, let's get some founder mode.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000]   Happy holidays!
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.000]   Happy holidays, everybody!
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000]   We'll see you at the party!
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000]   [cheers & applause]
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000]   [trumpet solo]
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000]   [cheers & applause]
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000]   [trumpet solo]
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000]   [cheers & applause]
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000]   [trumpet solo]
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000]   [cheers & applause]
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000]   [trumpet solo]
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.000]   [cheers & applause]
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000]   [trumpet solo]
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000]   [cheers & applause]
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000]   [trumpet solo]
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000]   [cheers & applause]
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000]   [trumpet solo]
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000]   [cheers & applause]
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000]   [trumpet solo]
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000]   [cheers & applause]
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000]   [trumpet solo]
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000]   [cheers & applause]
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.000]   [trumpet solo]
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000]   [cheers & applause]
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000]   [trumpet solo]
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.000]   [cheers & applause]
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.060]   you
[01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:28.120]   you
