[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440]   - Let me ask the last, the silliest,
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.520]   or maybe the most important question.
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.620]   What is the meaning of life?
[00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.720]   What gives your life fulfillment, purpose, happiness, meaning?
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.840]   - From a scientific point of view,
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.840]   the meaning of life is the propagation of DNA,
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.400]   but that's not what I feel.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.960]   That's not the meaning of my life.
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.080]   So the meaning of my life is something
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.360]   which is probably different from yours
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.340]   and different from other people's,
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.220]   but we each make our own meaning.
[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.040]   So we set up goals.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.920]   We want to achieve.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.760]   We want to write a book.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.760]   We want to do whatever it is we do, write a quartet.
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.640]   We want to win a football match.
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.600]   And these are short-term goals,
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.980]   well, maybe even quite long-term goals,
[00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.480]   which are set up by our brains,
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.640]   which have goal-seeking machinery built into them.
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.000]   But what we feel, we don't feel motivated
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.240]   by the desire to pass on our DNA, mostly.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.920]   We have other goals, which can be very moving,
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.920]   very important.
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.420]   They could even be called spiritual in some cases.
[00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.800]   We want to understand the riddle of the universe.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.360]   We want to understand consciousness.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.500]   We want to understand how the brain works.
[00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.040]   These are all noble goals.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.620]   Some of them can be noble goals anyway.
[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.020]   And they are a far cry from the fundamental
[00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.100]   biological goal, which is the propagation of DNA.
[00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.540]   But the machinery that enables us to set up
[00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.540]   these higher level goals is originally programmed
[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.980]   into us by natural selection of DNA.
[00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.380]   - The propagation of DNA.
[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.660]   But what do you make of this unfortunate fact
[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.420]   that we are mortal?
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.700]   Do you ponder your own mortality?
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.460]   Does it make you sad?
[00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.860]   Does it?
[00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.060]   - I ponder it.
[00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.380]   It makes me sad that I shall have to leave
[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.840]   and not see what's going to happen next.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.380]   If there's something frightening about mortality,
[00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.100]   apart from sort of missing, as I've said,
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.060]   something more deeply, darkly frightening,
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.340]   it's the idea of eternity.
[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.540]   But eternity is only frightening if you're there.
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.060]   Eternity before we were born,
[00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.700]   billions of years before we were born,
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.700]   and we were effectively dead before we were born.
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.940]   As I think it was Mark Twain said,
[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.820]   "I was dead for billions of years before I was born
[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.100]   "and never suffered the smallest inconvenience."
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.220]   That's how it's going to be after we leave.
[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.220]   So I think of it as really,
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.500]   eternity is a frightening prospect.
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.500]   And so the best way to spend it
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.140]   is under a general anesthetic, which is what it'll be.
[00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.380]   - Beautifully put.
[00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.700]   Richard, it was a huge honor to meet you, to talk to you.
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.980]   Thank you so much for your time.
[00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.100]   - Thank you very much.
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.300]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.900]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.100]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:19.700]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
