[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.360]   Now we have come this evening in our consideration of this second chapter of Paul's epistle
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:17.880]   to the Romans, to verses 2, 3, and 4.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.180]   But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit
[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.100]   such things.
[00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:31.400]   And thinkest thou this, O men, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same,
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.200]   that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:43.380]   Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and longsuffering, not knowing
[00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.880]   that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.680]   Now we must remind ourselves that here the apostle is bringing home, especially to the
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:03.140]   Jews, the fact that they, like everybody else, were under the wrath of God, and that the
[00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:10.060]   only hope of salvation that was open to them as all others was in this righteousness provided
[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.620]   by God in the Lord Jesus Christ which is received by faith.
[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.140]   Now the Jews were trying to argue that this didn't apply to them in either respect, negative
[00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.560]   nor positive.
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.140]   And in this chapter the apostle is bringing the argument home to them and convicting them
[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.660]   of their sin and of their entire helplessness to save themselves.
[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.880]   And we have seen that the argument runs like this.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.720]   First of all, in the first verse he proves to them that they are convicting themselves.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.140]   They are guilty of the same things that they condemn in others, therefore they are condemning
[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.860]   themselves.
[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.360]   We have looked at that.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.640]   In verse 2 he says that they are guilty of the terrible fallacy of forgetting that God's
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.460]   judgment is always according to truth.
[00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.240]   They think that God's judgment is like their judgment, and human judgment is not only fallible,
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.040]   it is always unworthy, it is never entirely according to truth, even at its best.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.400]   But God's judgment, this is known, everybody knows this.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.260]   He says we are sure everybody who believes in God at all must believe that God is perfect
[00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.640]   in every respect, and therefore his judgment must always be according to truth.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.880]   And we worked out what that means in detail.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.700]   And then we finally showed that the ultimate proof of all this, of course, was the case
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:43.520]   of the Jews themselves, because God, though they were his own chosen people, actually
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.580]   did judge them and punish them more than once.
[00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.900]   Very well, that's the point at which we've arrived.
[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:59.000]   God's judgment is always according to truth against them which commit such things.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.460]   Now before I leave this, there is just one thing I've got to add.
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:09.640]   There is a kind of deduction which we make from all that which is of tremendous significance
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.040]   and importance.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.520]   We shall find the apostle taking it up himself later in the third chapter.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.880]   But I must notice it at this point, because I said last Friday evening in introducing
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.720]   this question of God's judgment according to truth, that failure to understand it and
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:33.020]   to grasp it accounts for many a heresy that has troubled the life of the Church.
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.320]   And in a very special way, it does account for the fact why so many people are in trouble
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.680]   about the doctrine of the atonement.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.440]   Now I think you will all agree with me when I say that there is no doctrine which is more
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.840]   crucial than the doctrine of the atonement.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.160]   There is no better way in telling where a man stands with regard to evangelical truth
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.200]   than to have his opinion on the doctrine of the atonement.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.160]   And I suggest that there are many who are not only not clear on the doctrine of the
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:13.160]   atonement, but who in particular reject the substitutionary idea of the doctrine of the
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:20.240]   atonement, simply because they have never grasped this tremendous statement that God's
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.800]   judgment is according to truth.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.800]   Now how does it work out?
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.080]   Well it works out like this.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.080]   I'm merely glancing at this in passing.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.480]   The first thing that we see is that God will judge.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:43.720]   I go further, that God, because he is who and what he is, must judge.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.740]   God would no longer be judge if he didn't judge sin.
[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.800]   So there will be and must be a judgment upon sin.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.420]   Now you know there are many whose view of the atonement is just this.
[00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.180]   They say that what was really happening on the cross on Calvary's hill was that God
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.060]   was announcing through the death of his own son that he is nothing but love and that there
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.540]   is no judgment, that he is ready to overlook sin.
[00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.060]   Now you see that is because they don't realize that God's holy character and God's justice
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.580]   and righteousness insist upon a judgment of sin.
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:29.420]   But secondly, this judgment of sin must always be according to truth.
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:36.980]   In other words, God has said, and said it so repeatedly in the Old Testamentâ€”you see
[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.260]   it perfectly in the Ten Commandments and the moral law, but God has said it in many other
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.260]   places.
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.620]   It's there even before that, it's there afterwards in the writings of the prophets.
[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.060]   God has said that he will punish sin.
[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:57.140]   He told Adam that in a state of perfection, that if he sinned he should die, and because
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.900]   he sinned he did die.
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.460]   Now that is because God's judgment is always according to truth.
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.920]   The punishment must fit the crime.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.700]   God has said what the punishment is and God always insists upon that punishment being
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.700]   carried out.
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.700]   Very well, you see the significance of that for the doctrine of the atonement.
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.220]   There are those who regard the death of Christ in this way.
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:29.780]   They say what God is saying there on Calvary is that he's not going to judge sin any longer,
[00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:35.500]   that if you only say that you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, God forgives you.
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.740]   They say that's all that's happening.
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.780]   It is an announcement, a proclamation that God is love and that he is prepared to forgive
[00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:47.940]   the sins of anybody who repents and who says that he is sorry.
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.740]   Now if you hold that view of the atonement, you are denying this statement that God's
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.020]   judgment is according to truth.
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:03.740]   For this means this, that the punishment that God has said he will meet upon sin, he must
[00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.860]   meet it out.
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.180]   Otherwise he is no longer true to his own word.
[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.220]   He's not any longer judging according to truth.
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.620]   So the right way of viewing the doctrine of the atonement and the death on the cross is
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.220]   this.
[00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.980]   God has said that he is going to punish sin.
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.900]   Therefore God must punish sin and God does punish sin.
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.740]   How then can he forgive me?
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.340]   How can he possibly forgive me?
[00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.220]   There is only one answer.
[00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:39.060]   It is because he has punished my sin in the person of his own son.
[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.820]   So you see this whole theory here, this great doctrine about the judgment of God according
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:48.840]   to truth, introduces the great doctrine of the atonement.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:57.740]   And it insists upon our viewing the atonement in a penal manner, in an expiatory manner,
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:01.880]   in a peculiar manner, it doesn't matter which of the terms you use.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:07.980]   But you see it insists upon this, that God cannot forgive anybody without punishing the
[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.900]   sin.
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.820]   God cannot say to me, "Oh well no, because you say you're sorry, I'm going to forgive
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:14.820]   you."
[00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.100]   No, no, God must punish sin.
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.700]   His judgment is according to truth.
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:24.900]   And we believe that that is exactly how we are saved by the death of Christ.
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:32.180]   That God has judged our sins according to truth, and in so doing it meant the death
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:41.320]   of his only son, for my sins, for my guilt, to bear the punishment that I so richly deserved.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:46.360]   So any view of the atonement which doesn't include the idea that God's judgment is according
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.500]   to truth, is a denial of this scripture.
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:54.840]   Now I needn't stay with it any longer because as I've said, when we come to the third chapter
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:59.120]   we shall find that Paul there elaborates it from verse 24 onwards.
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.960]   He says, "Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:10.240]   whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:16.200]   righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of God,
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:24.200]   to declare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.760]   him that believeth in Jesus."
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:31.640]   If you've got a view of God's forgiveness of sin, which in any way delegates or detracts
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:37.400]   from the justice of God, it is a denial of the scripture.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:43.440]   Therefore you see the importance of observing every one of these phrases as we proceed.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:50.600]   It is because God's judgment is according to truth, that it was necessary for the Son
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:55.280]   of God ever to come on earth from heaven, and especially was it necessary for him to
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:01.680]   go to Calvary and there be so dealt with under the wrath of God that he cries out saying,
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.200]   "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:14.400]   It is just an exposition of this tremendous statement that God's judgment is according
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:21.760]   to truth, always, everywhere, even when his own Son is the sin bearer.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:29.480]   He spared him nothing because his judgment is always according to truth.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.680]   Very well, we leave it at that and go on.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.360]   In the third verse, the apostle really is just applying that.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.960]   It needn't detain us more than a second.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:44.360]   Thinkest thou this, O men, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same,
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.720]   that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.040]   This is what the argument means.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:54.520]   If you yourself condemn this sort of thing when you see it in others, and thereby condemn
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:11:02.680]   yourself, how much more so must God condemn it, because he judges according to truth?
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:06.880]   Very well then, if you see that, this is what follows.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.360]   There is no escaping his judgment.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:14.840]   There is no way of escaping the judgment of God.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:20.320]   There is no argument, no subterfuge, no cleverness, nothing that's going to avail.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.800]   It's a terrible word, this word "escape."
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:29.520]   Look through your New Testament for it, and you'll find it frequently.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:37.240]   Judgest, thinkest thou, O men, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:41.760]   The world is as it is tonight because men still think that they can escape the judgment
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.760]   of God.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:47.360]   They have got many ways in which they think they can do so.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.880]   You see, the psalmist understood them, people who have always been like this, and one of
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:56.960]   them, he says in his psalm, something like this, God speaks through him and says, "Thou
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:01.360]   thinkest that I am just such another as thyself."
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.440]   And how common that is.
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:09.080]   O men, display their ingenuity in trying to escape the judgment of God.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.640]   They think that God doesn't see, or that he's going to make an exception, or this
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.000]   or that or the other.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.280]   And thus, they're constantly persuading themselves that somehow or another they're
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.040]   going to escape it.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:26.080]   And the question the New Testament therefore keeps on asking is this, how shall we escape
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.400]   if we neglect this only way?
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:33.280]   How do you think you can escape, O men, in the light of what we've just been seeing
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.320]   and which you can't refute?
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.600]   There is no escaping the judgment of God.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:44.520]   You know, my friends, this is one of the first things that the gospel proclaims.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:51.200]   The message of John the Baptist was that men should flee from the wrath to come.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.040]   When he saw the Pharisees coming to him to be baptized, he says, "Who hath warned you
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.760]   to flee from the wrath to come?"
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.080]   Our Lord repeats the same message.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.920]   Paul in writing to the Thessalonians in that first chapter of the first epistle says that
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:09.240]   he turned from idols to serve the living God, and then he talks about our Lord who saved
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:15.600]   us from the wrath to come, this escaping.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:21.040]   That's the terrible thing this evening, that the world goes on with its laughter and its
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:28.000]   joking, paying no attention to this, not interested in this question of the wrath and the judgment
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.680]   of God, and saying that in general it believes in God, but fondly imagining that it's going
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:39.960]   to escape this righteous judgment of God according to truth.
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.020]   This is the great motive to evangelism.
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:46.760]   This is the first reason why you should ever talk to a man about his soul and present the
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.440]   gospel to him.
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:52.240]   Before you begin to tell him anything of the benefits of Christian salvation and Christian
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:57.520]   living, we must tell them that as they are, they are under the wrath of God, and that
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.840]   they cannot escape it.
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:13:59.840]   Do what they will.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.360]   They have got to die, and they can't escape death.
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:08.680]   It is appointed unto men once to die, and after death is judgment.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:14.440]   Now Christian people, do we realize this as we ought?
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.520]   Is this our motive?
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:16.840]   Does this urge us?
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:20.120]   Does this give us a concern about the souls of men and women?
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:24.400]   The terrifying thing that's proclaimed here is this, that the whole of mankind is under
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:32.200]   the judgment and the wrath of God, and that there is no escape apart from the way that
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:36.880]   God himself has provided through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:44.800]   But, let us proceed, man I say believes in the depth of his being in sin that he can
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:49.360]   escape, and he puts up an argument, when you knock it down you'll take up another, you
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:54.000]   knock that down you'll take up yet another, and that's exactly what these Jews were doing.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.640]   So the apostle goes on to the next argument that they put up, and that's what's stated
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.640]   in verse 4.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:07.760]   Here, you see, is a very clever and apparently a very subtle argument that mankind thinks
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:13.000]   up in order to show how it can escape this judgment of God.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   What is this?
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.680]   Well, this is the argument about the goodness of God.
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:23.680]   You see, when you establish that a man condemns himself because he condemns the same thing
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:27.920]   and the other, and he's got nothing to say, he then says, "Ah, but after all, you know,
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.920]   we're in a special position in the sight of God."
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:30.920]   You say, "You're not.
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.560]   God's judgment is always according to truth."
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.480]   Then he waits for a moment, "Ah," he says, "wait a minute, I've still got another argument.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.760]   What about the goodness of God?"
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:45.840]   Now, the Jews were constantly bringing this particular argument forward.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.800]   They were doing it in the time of our Lord himself.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.320]   They were doing it up against the apostle Paul.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.560]   Their argument was this.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.360]   They said, "Look here.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.920]   Look back across our long history.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:03.000]   Is there anything plainer and clearer than this, that God has blessed us?
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   That God loves us?
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.620]   We don't say we are perfect, but look at the way he's blessed us.
[00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.240]   Look at the way he's led us."
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.600]   They said, "Look at the way that he's still blessing us now.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.680]   He's not only done it through the centuries.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.440]   He's still doing it.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.400]   Isn't he therefore always going to do it?"
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:25.600]   So that you see, when John the Baptist preached to them, John knew their case so well that
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:30.880]   he said, "Now, don't begin to say in yourselves, 'We have Abraham to our father.'
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:35.800]   For I say unto you that God could out of these stones raise up children unto Abraham."
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.680]   But he knew that that's what they were saying.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.640]   They said, "You know, we are Abraham's children."
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:44.240]   And because of that, they were bypassing all this doctrine about the wrath of God and fleeing
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.240]   from the wrath to come.
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.920]   He said, "Don't fall back on that.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:47.920]   That's not going to do it.
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.760]   God isn't going to be good to you simply because you're the children of Abraham."
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.920]   But that was their argument.
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:01.400]   They put up this goodness and kindness of God towards them and said, "A God who has
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:06.200]   treated us like that cannot possibly punish us in the way that you're suggesting."
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:15.840]   Now, here I think we see very clearly, don't we, the terrible blinding effect upon sin.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:18.400]   Sin is something that affects the whole of man.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.120]   It has ruined man.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:23.720]   It affects our intellects as well as every other part of us.
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.720]   And what it does is to blind us.
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:31.000]   Now let us see how it has blinded these Jews.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.600]   You see, it made them misread their own Old Testament.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.360]   They were very proud of their Old Testament.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:43.720]   It was the thing that differentiated them from all other nations, the oracles of God.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.000]   And they were proud of the fact that they had got God's Word and that it was read to
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.720]   them every Sunday in the synagogues.
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.720]   They said, "This is it.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:50.720]   This is our life.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:56.200]   This is the thing that we enjoy, the Old Testament Scriptures."
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:01.800]   But you see, they had completely misread and misunderstood their own Scriptures.
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.160]   Why?
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.840]   Because they had been blinded by sin.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:10.520]   Now the Old Testament Scriptures had told them quite clearly what God's character
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.880]   was.
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:16.480]   God had revealed himself and his character to them, as I say, in the Ten Commandments,
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:19.360]   the moral law, in the writings of the prophets.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:25.080]   It was perfectly plain and clear that he is a righteous and a holy God who judges always
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.080]   according to truth.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.840]   They had read the very Scriptures, but they hadn't seen that they had misread them.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:36.000]   They were twisting the Scriptures to suit their own case.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:44.200]   But not only that, it had blinded them to their own actual history.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.560]   This is almost incredible, but it's a fact.
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:52.040]   Because if you read the story of the children of Israel in the Old Testament, isn't this
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.280]   what you find?
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:19:00.840]   That because of their sin, God himself had punished them by raising up the Chaldeans,
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:05.240]   who came and destroyed them, and carried them away, captives, to Babylon.
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:10.040]   It's there in their own history, and yet they read the history and they couldn't see it.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.040]   Now this isn't a theory.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:15.000]   Let me give you proof of it.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:21.600]   You remember how one afternoon our Lord was preaching, and he was preaching with unusual
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.760]   tenderness and authority.
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:29.640]   Because we read that as he spoke these words, many believed on him.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.080]   And our Lord looked at these men who had just believed on him and had said, and said to
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:42.160]   them, "If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed, and ye shall know
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:47.560]   the truth, and the truth shall make you free."
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.280]   What a wonderful thing to say.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.520]   And they shouted out, "Hallelujah!" and "Amen!"
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.640]   Nothing of the sort.
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:59.080]   They stood back on their dignity and they said, "We be Abraham's seed, and were never
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.880]   in bondage to any men.
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.840]   How sayest thou ye shall be made free?"
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:09.360]   They said, "Don't you realize that in promising to us that we shall be set free, that you're
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.360]   insulting us?
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:15.880]   Don't you know that we are Abraham's children, and we've never been in bondage to any men?"
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:20.080]   Said the creatures whose own history told them that they'd been in bondage in Egypt
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.680]   and in bondage in Babylon.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.160]   But that's what sin does, you see.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:30.200]   Though you've got the book open before you, and though you're reading the history, in
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:34.880]   your national pride you say, "We've never been slaves."
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.480]   And their own history proved that they have been slaves.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.640]   Sin blinds.
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:42.920]   It blinds us to facts as well as to teaching.
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:50.120]   But not only that, it blinded these Jews to the signs of the times.
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:56.400]   It blinded them at that very time to the things that were happening round and about.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.720]   Again let me quote our Lord's words.
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:05.360]   You'll find them in Luke chapter 12, verses 54 to 57.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:12.480]   Our Lord turned upon the people on that occasion, and you remember this is what he said to them.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.920]   He said, "I don't quite understand you."
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:21.840]   He said, "When ye see the cloud rise in the west, ye say, 'There cometh a shower,' and
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.560]   so it is.
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:30.200]   And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, 'There will be heat,' and it cometh to pass.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:36.840]   Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth, but how is it that
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:40.600]   ye do not discern this time?
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:46.400]   Why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?"
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.400]   What does he mean by that?
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.400]   He means this.
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.800]   He says, "You people are so experts on the signs in the heavens and the earth, and in
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.200]   every other respect.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:57.920]   Why is it that you didn't see the significance of John the Baptist and his preaching?
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:03.760]   Why is it that you don't recognize who I am and the significance of my coming and my preaching,
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.360]   the signs of the times?
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.400]   There they are, and you don't see them.
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.000]   Why didn't they see them?
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.880]   Because they were blinded by sin."
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.960]   Sin does that.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.480]   Another thing it does, therefore, is this.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.800]   It gives us a false sense of security.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:26.400]   "Here, you see, were these Jews at the time, as I say, of John and our Lord, and later,
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:31.120]   later when the apostle Paul was writing this letter to the Romans, for here, you see, we
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:36.960]   are some twenty years later, at the very least, it may be even more than that.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:44.400]   And Paul is preaching, and the other apostles are preaching, and the Jews are still saying,
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.400]   'Nonsense!
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.080]   This can't happen to us.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.360]   What about God's goodness?
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.280]   What about his forbearance and longsuffering?
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.280]   We are all right.
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.280]   We are Abram's seed.
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:53.280]   We are God's people.
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.280]   He's always blessed us.
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.280]   He is still blessing us.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.480]   He's always going to bless us.'"
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:02.000]   They were saying that, you see, right away up to A.D. 70.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.520]   And then you remember what happened.
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:11.600]   Then the Roman armies came and routed them and defeated them and sacked their city and
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.000]   destroyed their temple.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.480]   And the Jews as a nation were cast out of their own land and have been scattered amongst
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.520]   the nations ever since.
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:25.080]   They said until the last moment, "It will never happen to us.
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:30.640]   The goodness of God is covering us."
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.360]   You see, that's how sin blinds.
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.880]   They couldn't see it in their own history.
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.520]   They wouldn't listen to the preaching of John the Baptist or even the Son of God.
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.600]   Leave alone the Apostle Paul.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.880]   And then it came.
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.360]   It happened.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.520]   They couldn't escape it after all.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:49.360]   It descended as an avalanche upon them.
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:55.920]   Well now then, there is the argument that the Apostle is here, deplying.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.680]   But you see, it's still the same.
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:02.520]   And God forbid that any of us should think that we are met together simply to consider
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.720]   the case of the Jews nearly two thousand years ago.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.720]   No, no.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.840]   This is still the same.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.520]   It's happening at this evening as much as it happened then.
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:19.160]   And alas, I'm sorry to have to say it, it happens with many who are in the church as
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:23.360]   well as with that great crowd that is outside the church.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.360]   What do I mean?
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.240]   I mean this.
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:33.200]   That there is no argument which is put up quite so frequently against these doctrines
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:40.280]   of the wrath of God and the judgment of God and the righteousness of God and the absolute
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:46.080]   necessity of the death of the Son of God as one bearing the punishment of sins.
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:52.520]   There is no argument that is brought up and deduced and advanced against that so frequently.
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:25:00.920]   Whereas this argument of God's goodness and God's kindness and God's loveâ€”now you're
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:05.840]   familiar with this and it's important that we should know how to answer it.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:11.900]   This is the thing on which people are relying and this is how they put it.
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:18.640]   They pit God's goodness and his love and his kindness against his holiness and his
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.960]   righteousness and his justice.
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:26.000]   Indeed they go further.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.960]   Many of them do not hesitate to go so far as to say that to talk about the wrath of
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.240]   God is blasphemy.
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:37.600]   No, they say that in books.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:42.560]   They say, "You know, that's that old tribal idea of God that you get in your Old Testament."
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:46.080]   They say, "Jesus came and taught us something better than that.
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:53.080]   Jesus teaches us that God is love and that therefore he is no longer just and holy and
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:57.680]   righteous and that we must never speak of the wrath of God against him."
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:58.680]   No, no.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.320]   They say that's absolutely wrong.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.440]   It's a libel on God's character.
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:07.800]   They not only pit these qualities of goodness and love and mercy against the others, they
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:12.240]   do it to such an extent that they get rid of the others and they take those attributes
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.880]   out of the character of God.
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.960]   It's being done very freely.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:26.000]   Alas, I say not only outside the church, but even inside the church.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.080]   That's one form the argument takes, but here's another form.
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:36.880]   They argue that because God doesn't strike us down immediately, we sin, and punish sin
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:43.240]   the next second after we've committed it, that he will never do so.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.120]   You see, it sounds a very clever argument, doesn't it?
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.120]   This is how they put it.
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:50.640]   They say, "You tell me that God is just and righteous and holy, that he cannot look
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.640]   upon sin."
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.880]   Very well, I fall into sin.
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.940]   If God is what you say, he should immediately punish me and strike me.
[00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:00.120]   But he doesn't do that.
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.280]   We know he doesn't do that.
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.920]   He doesn't do it with us individually.
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:05.920]   He doesn't do it with nations.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.720]   He hasn't done it with the world.
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:12.200]   Therefore, they say, obviously he doesn't do it because what you are saying about God
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:17.080]   is wrong, and God is good and full of goodness and mercy and love and compassion, and he
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.560]   doesn't do that sort of thing.
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:21.640]   Therefore, he never will do that sort of thing.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:26.920]   You see the logic?
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:30.880]   And then another argument which they have is this.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:36.920]   They say, "You know, if what you say is right, and that God takes that view of sin
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:48.160]   and of men in sin, is it likely that God would ever grant any blessing at all to such sinners?
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:54.840]   How would it be possible for such a God to bless anybody at all unless he's a believer
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:57.400]   in him and a true Christian?"
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:02.800]   But the fact is, they say, that God obviously grants many blessings to many people who don't
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.160]   believe in him at all.
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:10.360]   And they say, "We can understand that because God is one who is full of goodness and love
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:12.160]   and mercy and of compassion."
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:16.600]   And really, these other things you're talking about, they're not true of God.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:21.120]   So they use the fact that so many people are enjoying good health tonight and perhaps a
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:25.560]   worldly material prosperity, and many other things, who don't believe in God at all.
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:30.320]   They say that's an absolute proof that God is full of goodness and love and mercy, and
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:37.280]   he will never do to anybody what you are suggesting he's going to do to all who are unbelievers.
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.240]   And then finally they put it in this form.
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:43.440]   There are many other arguments, I'm simply picking out some of them.
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:52.400]   They argue that the long history of the world is a proof in and of itself that God is never
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:56.320]   really going to judge the world.
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.560]   And it works out like this.
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:01.960]   I needn't keep you, it's all in the second epistle of Peter, the third chapter.
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:06.000]   There the apostle says that many scoffers will arise in the last times, and they will
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.320]   say, "Where is the promise of his coming?"
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:16.960]   You Christians, they say, and your preachers especially, have been talking about a judgment
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:21.040]   of God, and that Christ is coming back to judge the world in righteousness.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:25.960]   They say, "Where is the promise of his coming?
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:32.800]   For since the beginning of the world, things are still continuing as they always were."
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.360]   They said, "You know, you'd better change your argument.
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:39.180]   You'd better admit and confess that you're wrong.
[00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:43.720]   Are you asking us to believe, they say, that the God whom you say is righteous and just
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:49.040]   and holy, and who must punish sin because he hates it with a holy and divine hatred?
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:53.520]   Do you mean to say that God would have allowed a world of sin such as this to go on for six
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.520]   thousand years?
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:59.680]   Monstrous, impossible, these things can't happen."
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.800]   That's the argument.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.080]   Peter presents it there.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.760]   We are hearing it today constantly.
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:10.120]   Well now, there are some, I say, of these arguments, which men bring forward and deduce
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:16.340]   in order to try to escape this whole idea of the judgment of God according to truth
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:20.320]   against all sin.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:24.080]   And what has the apostle got to say about it?
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.040]   Well he puts it very plainly and very bluntly.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:33.340]   He says, "There's only one thing to say about people who talk like that.
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:38.960]   You are guilty of despising the goodness of God."
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:43.000]   No, the form in which he puts it adds to it.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.160]   He puts it in the form of a question, a rhetorical question which answers itself.
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:55.920]   "Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering, not knowing
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:01.680]   that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?"
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:07.080]   What you are doing, says the apostle, is to despise the goodness of God.
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:18.580]   Now here is one of the most serious and one of the most solemn charges that can ever be
[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:22.840]   brought against men.
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:32.320]   What he is saying is this, that there is nothing which is more reprehensible, more terrible,
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:38.800]   than to go on and to continue in a life of sin, talking about the goodness and the mercy
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:42.120]   of God.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:50.840]   I say this is a very serious and a very solemn thing, and I'll tell you why I say that.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:59.280]   It is because we, all of us, are up to a point guilty of it.
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:05.480]   We are all trying to excuse sin in ourselves in some shape or form, falling back upon the
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:09.080]   goodness of God.
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:13.740]   So that when we do fall into sin, our repentance isn't always true, it isn't always thorough.
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:17.080]   We heal ourselves a little bit too quickly.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.420]   We want to get rid of the pain.
[00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:27.280]   We jump to what we know to be true about God's love, but that's to abuse it.
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:33.920]   But however it may be true of us in that way, there is nothing more terrible in the world
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:40.840]   tonight than to think of men and women who are going on in a life of sin, and who do
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:47.280]   not submit to God, and who do not believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, because of their
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:52.080]   understanding of the goodness of God.
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:57.560]   Now my friends, I'm emphasizing this for this reason.
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:02.240]   It's such a common attitude, such a common condition.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:06.760]   I'm sure you all meet it as you talk to people about these matters.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:10.840]   This is the argument of arguments against becoming a Christian, against the necessity
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:14.960]   of doing so, against the necessity of the death of Christ, and all that we talk about
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.460]   here about the miraculous and the supernatural.
[00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:18.460]   This is the argument.
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:22.640]   Ah, it's the goodness of God and the love of God.
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:29.080]   It's put up against all this great doctrine that is expounded in the Scriptures.
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:34.960]   And therefore I say that for our own sakes and for the sake of others who are in this
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:40.440]   terrible and most appalling state, we must know the way to deal with it and the way to
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.240]   answer it.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.760]   And the apostle does it here for us.
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:49.240]   He makes the blunt assertion, he proffers this most specific charge, that this is to
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:57.840]   despise, to make light of, to regard as something cheap, the very goodness of God itself, of
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.380]   God himself.
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:00.920]   And how does he bring home the charge?
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:04.640]   Well, he does so in this way.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:09.000]   The very conduct of these people, their very attitude towards the thing about which they're
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.960]   speaking is a proof that in reality they are despising it.
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.040]   Now then, how does he establish that?
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.520]   Well, let me suggest to you these answers.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.520]   Here's the first.
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:28.760]   A man who thus goes on talking about the goodness and the mercy and the love of God, but at
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:39.360]   the same time continues in sin, is a man who is showing quite clearly that he's never really
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:49.120]   studied or contemplated or understood the goodness of God as he should have done, and
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:52.840]   thereby he despises it.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:57.760]   He's a sort of man who talks glibly and lightly and loosely about the goodness and the love
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:02.920]   of God, but who's never taken the trouble to really examine it and to work it out and
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.600]   to stand before it and meditate upon it.
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.120]   No, no, what he does is this.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:10.600]   He says, "I believe in the goodness of God," and rushes on to commit his sin or to continue
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.880]   the life he's been living.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:13.920]   He's never really considered it.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:19.140]   And isn't that to despise it?
[00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:26.760]   We all, of course, can see this very clearly when we do it with one another.
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:31.320]   You know, sometimes you have the privilege of being introduced or presented to some great
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:39.040]   men, and sometimes, unfortunately or unless we have this sort of experience, your turn
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:43.240]   comes to shake hands with this great personage, and you hold out your hand and he holds out
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:46.960]   his hand, but you notice that while he's holding your hand he's looking at the next person
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:52.880]   who's coming, and you feel that he's despising you, he's not interested in you.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:55.280]   He pretends to be, but he's not.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.240]   If he were really interested in you and glad to meet you, he'd look you straight in the
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.960]   face and in the eye.
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.840]   He'd pay a little attention to you.
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:06.620]   Or, you see, if you're perhaps good at drawing or at painting, and you've got something which
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:11.160]   you think is rather good, and an expert comes along and you say, "I'd like to show it to
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.160]   him.
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:16.600]   I wonder what he thinks of this," and he sort of takes a casual glance and goes on, "He's
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.960]   despised your painting or your drawing."
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:20.920]   Well, it doesn't matter what it is.
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:22.960]   There are endless illustrations that are possible.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:27.960]   Now, what the apostle is saying is this, that these people are guilty of doing that very
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:32.760]   thing with this goodness and love and mercy of God about which they talk so much.
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:35.280]   They've never really considered it.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.520]   Where do I find that here?
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:44.720]   Despises thou the riches of his goodness, the riches of his forbearance, the riches
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:45.720]   of his long-suffering.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:52.080]   They know nothing about the riches.
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:56.600]   Their estimate of it is very small and very little.
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:00.960]   But they've never taken the trouble to read right through their Bibles and to note it
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.600]   and to seek it out.
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:07.440]   And they've never ended by saying, "My word, how good God is and how kind and how forbearing
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.600]   and how long-suffering."
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:09.600]   Not at all.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:10.600]   They've never ended.
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:13.160]   They say, "I believe in the goodness of God," and off they go to what they want to do.
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:17.440]   They've got an appointment with sin or with something.
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.080]   Don't you see how they're insulting it?
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.520]   They don't know anything about it.
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:21.520]   They've never considered it.
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:23.800]   "Very well," says Paul, "let me show you."
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:26.600]   And he brings out his terms.
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:32.040]   The riches of God's goodness.
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:37.520]   Now that's a term he's very fond of, as you know.
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:41.840]   It's a term which really tells us everything, in a sense.
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:46.000]   When Paul ever uses this word "riches," he wants you to think of a treasury which has
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.400]   got endless wealth in it.
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.440]   You can never exhaust it.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:52.560]   It's the riches of God's goodness.
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.600]   It's eternal in its extent.
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:55.600]   That's the word he uses.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:57.360]   The richness of it all.
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.560]   The riches of it all.
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:02.640]   And these people know nothing about the riches of God's goodness.
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.040]   What does he mean by goodness?
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:11.200]   Well, by goodness, of course, he means God's kindness in a general sense.
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:16.840]   Now there's a very perfect statement of this by our Lord himself in the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:25.040]   Matthew 5, verse 45, where he says that "He," God, "maketh his sun to rise on the evil and
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:32.720]   on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust."
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:36.080]   That's an illustration of the riches of God's goodness.
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:45.960]   Here are people, do you see, who are evil and who are unjust and who hate God and who
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:51.160]   blaspheme his name and break his commandments and delight in doing so.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:39:00.080]   But God in the richness and the riches of his goodness causes the rain to fall upon
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:07.000]   their fields and their crops to fructify them and sends the sun with all its warmth, its
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.520]   heat and its life-giving power.
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:15.480]   He does it to the unjust as well as the just, the unrighteous, the evil as well as the good.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:19.240]   But do these people stop to consider that?
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:21.040]   Of course they don't.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:24.360]   They simply like to use the argument that God won't punish them because he's good.
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:27.000]   But they've never stopped.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:33.240]   As they look at their fields in late August and early September and see these marvelous
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:38.320]   crops, they never stop to say, "Well, what has produced this?"
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.980]   And then they begin to think and they say, "Well, of course I ploughed and harrowed and
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:41.980]   sowed and so on."
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:48.880]   "Ah, yes, but you know that wouldn't have done it if it had been bad weather, if God
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:51.720]   hadn't sent the rain and the sun.
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.880]   Oh, how good God has been!"
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:55.160]   But they don't do that.
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:56.160]   They know nothing about it.
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.160]   They've never examined it.
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:58.160]   They don't investigate it.
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:59.680]   They talk about the goodness of God.
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:00.680]   They know nothing about it.
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:05.440]   They just take a passing glance and say, "Very well," and off they go to sin again.
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.080]   They're despising it.
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:11.960]   They know nothing about it, the very thing they claim to believe in.
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:13.340]   But let me give you another illustration.
[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:17.340]   The apostle Paul, preaching, you see, at Lydda, he said the same thing.
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:20.960]   Listen to this in Acts 14, 17.
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:27.640]   He is now talking to a company of pagans who thought that he was a god and who began to
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:32.200]   worship him as a god because he'd healed the man who was lame in his feet from his mother's
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.200]   womb.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:34.200]   And Paul says, "Stop!
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.480]   You don't realize what you're doing.
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:36.480]   I'm no god.
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:39.760]   There are no gods except one, the living God.
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:44.600]   You don't know him and you don't worship him, but you're without excuse because, nevertheless,
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:52.280]   he left himself not without witness in that he did good and gave rain from heaven and
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:59.880]   fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness."
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:02.320]   They'd never considered that.
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:03.440]   They'd never worked out.
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.440]   They'd never examined.
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:05.440]   They'd never investigated.
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:07.480]   They said, "We believe it.
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:09.520]   You know nothing about it," says the apostle.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.120]   And he says the same thing here.
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:17.280]   There you see something of the riches of God's goodness.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.600]   There are people alive by the million in this world tonight.
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:24.760]   They've had the gift of life from God, the gift of health from God, the gift of families
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.560]   and loved ones from God.
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.240]   They haven't done any of these things.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.240]   God's done it all.
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:33.360]   Protection, home, food, clothing, shelter, all these things.
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:35.820]   God is the giver of every good and every perfect gift.
[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:37.280]   These people know nothing about it.
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:38.680]   They know nothing of the riches.
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.520]   They've never investigated it.
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:45.360]   And yet they talk about the goodness of God, and their very talk about it is an insult
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.360]   to it.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:51.240]   They're despising it by not looking at it and examining it and working it out as they
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:54.400]   ought and seeing it in all its glory.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.640]   But let me come to the next term so that I may finish.
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:58.920]   The second term is forbearance.
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:41:59.920]   The riches of his forbearance.
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:00.920]   What does this mean?
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:04.200]   Well, it means this.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:08.840]   It's the way in which God bears with us in our sin.
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:10.960]   Why doesn't God punish me the moment I sin?
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:13.440]   Why doesn't he strike us down when we sin?
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:20.560]   It's because of his forbearance, his patience.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:24.880]   Though he is who and what he is, and though he hates this sin, and though he's pronounced
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:27.680]   his wrath upon it, he doesn't immediately do it.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.680]   Why?
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.280]   Because of his forbearance.
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:35.960]   We'll come later to see why he is forbearing, but we're dealing now with the act, with the
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:38.560]   fact of his forbearance.
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:42.400]   And you know, were it not for this, we'd all be undone.
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:48.720]   We promise God a great deal sometimes, and then we forget all about it.
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:54.960]   Or we even break our promise, or even fall into sin.
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:58.920]   Why does he still have any dealings with us at all?
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.280]   It's his forbearance, my friends.
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:06.920]   And oh, the riches of his forbearance.
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:09.200]   He bears with us.
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:12.880]   He suffered the evil manners of these children of Israel down the years.
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:14.320]   I don't know how he did it.
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:15.320]   We'd never do it.
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:16.520]   We are not like this.
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:21.720]   But God is rich in forbearance.
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:25.040]   These people who presume upon it know nothing about it.
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.560]   They don't know the history.
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:27.560]   They've never analyzed it.
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:28.560]   They've never seen it.
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:31.840]   And the last word is the word "long-suffering."
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:32.840]   What does that mean?
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:36.240]   Well, long-suffering means that his forbearance continues.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:41.400]   The length of time he continues to be forbearing.
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:44.320]   He postpones the punishment.
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:50.000]   As our 103rd Psalm has put it, "He is slow to anger and plenteous in mercy."
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:58.480]   Or as you read in 2 Peter 3, 9, "He is long-suffering to us, Lord, not willing that any should perish,
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.320]   but that all should come to repentance."
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:08.520]   Oh, the riches of the long-suffering of God.
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:13.640]   You know it's the only explanation of why the world is still in existence?
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:18.840]   It's the only explanation of why God didn't destroy the world in the Garden of Eden.
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:25.960]   It's the only explanation why this is 1956, and why there has been all this long history
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:26.960]   of sin.
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:30.960]   It's the long-suffering of God.
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:34.960]   The riches of his long-suffering.
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:40.280]   Well as we have to leave it at that this evening, and go on, God willing, next Friday evening
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:46.520]   to the further arguments the Apostle works out, shall we leave it by asking ourselves
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:57.360]   the question, "Am I a student of God's goodness?
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:01.320]   Am I a student of God's forbearance?
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:05.880]   Am I a student of his long-suffering?"
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:11.080]   I'm talking to Christian people.
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:16.480]   Do you take your forgiveness as something that you have a right to and you're entitled
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:24.120]   to without remembering God's goodness and forbearance and long-suffering?
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:28.120]   Do you heal yourself very easily and very quickly?
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:35.740]   It seems to me we've not really accepted forgiveness truly from God, unless it brings us to this
[00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:47.880]   point at which we stand in amazement at his goodness, at his forbearance, at his long-suffering.
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:53.840]   God forbid that we should be guilty of just looking in a glancing manner at these things
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:57.300]   and passing on to what we're interested in.
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:03.200]   We who claim his name and who know him and who receive so much from him, God forbid that
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:08.920]   we should be unconcerned about those who are outside who are much more guilty of the same
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:16.040]   thing, infinitely more so, and who in a sense are producing their own damnation by their
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:24.520]   own quotation of the love of God, because in their talk about it they are simply despising
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:26.720]   it.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:27.720]   Let us pray.
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:39.280]   O Lord, our God, we come into thy holy presence again and we humble ourselves before thee.
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:42.080]   Forgive us our glibness.
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:47.760]   Forgive us for the ease and the superficiality with which we speak of thy love and mercy
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:53.960]   and compassion, thy goodness, thy forbearance and thy long-suffering.
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:59.200]   O God, teach us to meditate upon these things.
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.440]   Teach us how to measure them.
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:06.120]   Teach us how to see the riches of these things.
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:10.280]   O forgive us that our view of them is so small.
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:13.680]   Lord, take us into the depths.
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:19.720]   Lead us into the treasure house and so enable us to see them that we shall end by being
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:27.280]   lost in a sense of wonder, love and of praise.
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:32.840]   And now may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:40.760]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night and evermore.
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:42.680]   Amen.
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:46.600]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
