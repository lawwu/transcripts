[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.140]   How do I improve my discipline?
[00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:09.120]   My problem is that I have a problem with sticking to my long term plans.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:17.520]   Well, Toby, I think about discipline really more as an identity that you
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:25.460]   develop, then I do an approach to a particular challenge, if you can convince
[00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.300]   yourself that you are a disciplined person, that that is part of your
[00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.420]   conception of your identity.
[00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.700]   Then you will be able to, with discipline, pursue many different
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.700]   important objectives in your life.
[00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.660]   So the question is, how do you get to an identity where you see
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.980]   yourself as a disciplined person?
[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.660]   Well, let me tell you what not to do.
[00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.620]   Don't just pick out a random ambitious goal and say, you know what?
[00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.020]   I'm going to do this.
[00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.780]   I'm going to, I'm going to white knuckle, go after this really hard goal.
[00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.740]   And because I need to be more disciplined, that's what you're trying to do.
[00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:00.940]   That's not working.
[00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.020]   I'm not surprised it's not working.
[00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.780]   If you've not yet convinced yourself, you're a disciplined person, taking
[00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.700]   on ad hoc, large discipline, requiring challenges is not going
[00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.460]   to be a route towards success.
[00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.140]   So what should you do instead?
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.300]   Well, I think this is where actually the deep life procedure I talk about,
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.340]   the, the sort of self-awarely overly pragmatic approach to building a
[00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.180]   foundation for a deep life that we've been talking about on the show for over
[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.540]   two years is perfect for developing a self-identity as discipline.
[00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.900]   So remember, there's two parts to this.
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.740]   Number one, you identify the areas of your life that are important to you.
[00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.480]   We typically call these the deep life buckets.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.700]   They differ between different people, but our starter set of these
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.060]   buckets tends to be craft, what you do, what you create, constitution.
[00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.780]   That's going to be your health community.
[00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.940]   That's going to be your connections to other people, be it your family,
[00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.020]   your neighborhood, the people in the organizations where you work
[00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.180]   at your religious institutions.
[00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.820]   Uh, they'll often throw in contemplation.
[00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.540]   We're trying to capture philosophy, theology, and ethics.
[00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.380]   These are all important areas.
[00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.300]   Most people's lives, your list might vary.
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.820]   For each of these areas, the first thing to do is to identify a keystone
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.220]   habit, something in each of these buckets that you do every day, something
[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.060]   that is not trivial, but is also tractable and you track your completion
[00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.980]   of these habits every day.
[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.900]   If you use something like my time block planner, there's a metric
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.100]   tracking space at the top of the daily planning pages on every day.
[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.460]   You just track those keystone habits right there.
[00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.140]   So for example, for constitution, you wouldn't have something there.
[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.620]   Like I'm going to do a 45 minute intense workout because that's too hard to
[00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.100]   expect you to be able to do that every day.
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.740]   That's not really tractable, but you also don't want to say, you know, I
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.020]   will do one jumping jack when I get out of bed in the morning, like
[00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.020]   that's not going to get you anywhere.
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.980]   So instead you might want to do something like I want to
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.940]   hit this many steps in a day.
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.580]   Require a little bit of planning.
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.020]   Like I walk my kids to school.
[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.180]   I'll probably have to do one more walk in the afternoon in between
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.900]   meetings and, but it's tractable.
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.380]   If I think about it, my friend, Brian Johnson, uh, of optimize
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.620]   fame had this great constitution habit where he had a fixed number
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.220]   of minutes that he never wanted to go beyond without doing, I
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.420]   think he would do 10 burpees.
[00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.260]   And it was like 23 minutes or 20.
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.020]   There was some amount of time that he had because he had read somewhere.
[00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.380]   If you sit for more than this much time, it starts to be bad.
[00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.940]   And so it was just every, whatever it was, 23 minutes, he would do 10 burpees.
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.780]   And was it a fantastic boom?
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.900]   Now I think it helps that he doesn't work in the bullpen of a crowded office.
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.820]   I mean, I, maybe that would be an awesome thing to do, but, but it probably
[00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.300]   would draw some interesting attention.
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.140]   He, you know, he, he works in his own company, so he works at his own house.
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.420]   Um, but 10 burpees, three times an hour, roughly.
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.060]   And the way he pitched it to me is it keeps your ability to
[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.820]   concentration, to concentrate like an, like a laser because your body's
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.620]   always moving, it never gets into a sedentary, but anyways, for someone
[00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.020]   who works in their own home, works from home on their own business, very
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.580]   tractable, very tractable, Keystone habit takes 15 seconds or whatever.
[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.580]   Every time you do it, the fact that I think 10 burpees takes 15 seconds
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.300]   shows that I don't know.
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.060]   I don't know a lot about burpees.
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.980]   Does he still do that?
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.140]   I don't know.
[00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.700]   We should have him on the show.
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.820]   He should, we should, we should ask him.
[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.300]   I know at one point he was training, he was really into, and I don't think
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.060]   he'll mind me telling this story because I think he's talked about it himself.
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:42.060]   Um, he was really into Spartan racing, the Spartan races because he, yeah,
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.820]   because he was friends with Joe DeSena.
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.420]   So he knew the guy who started it and he was making a run at some point for
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.820]   doing them at a very high level, which requires, it turns out it
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.900]   requires a lot of training.
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.220]   Uh, you have to master a lot of these individual disciplines, but
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:03.260]   anyways, in his, his house, in the room where he worked, which I think
[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.860]   might've been their bedroom, he had installed into the ceiling of the room.
[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.940]   The, uh, hanging obstacles from the Sparta race.
[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.060]   Like, so I guess you do like Ninja warrior type stuff in that race
[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.820]   where like, you have to like switch you're holding on to like.
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.220]   Rope knots and whatever.
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.580]   And yeah, he installed them into the ceiling of the room so that
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.340]   when he was doing these breaks, he's like, instead of just burpees,
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.620]   let me jump up and just like do the, whatever hanging challenge.
[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.380]   I'll tell you what you do that for a few months, your grip, strength and
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.460]   balance, like you just own it, but you don't even, and I guess that's what you
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.780]   need to do to compete at a high level.
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.660]   You could just jump up there and boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.420]   And so that's, that's commitment.
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.900]   He'd probably still work out too during the day.
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.420]   I would think separately.
[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.080]   Yeah.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.660]   Yeah.
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.220]   So he, and he had a whole thing and yeah, so you still have a workout.
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.180]   So it was less, this was less about, which, which again is,
[00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.140]   I think is an important point.
[00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.700]   Like if your keystone habits are not, their job is not to capture everything
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.700]   you need to do, or it's important for that bucket, it's like getting up and
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.380]   doing some burpees or whatever throughout the day is a great way of saying you,
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.020]   you take motion important.
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.140]   You take your body important.
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.020]   You think there's a mind body connection, but it's not everything
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.260]   you need to do for exercise.
[00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.620]   You probably need to be doing weights.
[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.060]   You probably need to be doing cardio.
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.340]   So that's, it's a good point is that your keystone habits are not trying
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.460]   to take on the weight of everything important in that bucket.
[00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.820]   They are just meant to say that you take that bucket seriously and
[00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.300]   you're willing to take effort towards that bucket every day.
[00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.140]   That's non-trivial.
[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.140]   Now it takes a while to get those keystone habits, right?
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.140]   You have to experiment a little bit, but you get to the point where
[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.340]   you're knocking off, you have four buckets or five buckets.
[00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.540]   You're checking off all those, all those metrics every day.
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.220]   You see it every day.
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.460]   You don't want to break the chain.
[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.280]   Right.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.340]   That's step one.
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.540]   You've already now leveled up discipline.
[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.900]   Your identity as someone who's disciplined is now leveled up.
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.100]   You do stuff that's optional because it reflects your
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.700]   values, even if it's hard.
[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.700]   Now you're at a higher level.
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:07.420]   The next part of my general deep life foundation program is then you
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:13.180]   dedicate a one to two month period to each of those buckets one by one.
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.060]   And overhaul that part of your life when you're focusing
[00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.100]   on that particular bucket.
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.740]   So in the one to two months, you're focusing on constitution.
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.140]   Now you're getting serious about your health and fitness, and you're
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.900]   starting to make changes and figuring out like, maybe you're like, I'm
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.500]   going to start training for this sport.
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.660]   Like I'll tell you right now, Jesse, one of the things I'm doing.
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:38.220]   It's a goal is, uh, before my 40th birthday, which is in June.
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.500]   So it's coming up.
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.820]   Um, you might not remember what it's like to be in your thirties.
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:44.360]   Of course.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.740]   I mean, you've been 40 for literally weeks at this point.
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.140]   So you probably don't remember, but, uh, my birthday is coming
[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.420]   up as we've talked about.
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:58.780]   I want to, this is arbitrary, but I want to be able to once again,
[00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:07.580]   row, uh, 2000 meters on my concept to at a sub two minute, 500 meter pace.
[00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.500]   So this just connects me back to my, my, my deep past when
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.700]   I was rowing for Dartmouth.
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.020]   I remember the type of splits I could pull.
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.620]   So like seven and change.
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.560]   Yeah.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.260]   And so I was like, I want to, I was like, I would feel good at the age of 40.
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:26.620]   If, because I got, God knows what I could pull when I was 19 doing this, I could
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.820]   pull, but I'm 30 pounds heavier now.
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.300]   So it does have an advantage.
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.540]   Like I can actually, I was a lightweight rower, so I can
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:33.380]   now actually move that thing.
[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.860]   But anyways, it's kind of arbitrary, but it's like, it's, it's
[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:40.220]   hard, but not impossible, but like, I would feel good if I can be polling
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:44.340]   sub two minute, 500 splits for, for a 2000 meters, like I'm
[00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.660]   training for that right now.
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.900]   Uh, but that's the type of thing.
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:48.180]   Okay.
[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.340]   When you're doing an overhaul of a bucket, you start, you figure
[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.980]   out these challenges, you get your equipment in place, I mean, not to
[00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:56.660]   make a full, full circle connection, but I got that concept too, actually
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.740]   from Brian Johnson sent it to me as a gift.
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:00.380]   So there we go.
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.220]   Nice gift.
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:01.780]   Yeah.
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.740]   He's a nice guy known for a very long time.
[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:08.580]   Um, so anyways, that's the type of thing you will come away from doing
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:14.100]   the intense focus on the bucket with like, okay, now I'm going to start
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:18.220]   training to do this and I've overhauled my diet and I now am joined this
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.380]   team, this rec, you know, with other dads that we play, whatever.
[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.500]   And so when you, you, you, you give the one to two month focus, you
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.540]   really are changing your life more substantially to really integrate
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:32.660]   that area of value, um, more deeply.
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.220]   And there's a lot of experimentation in that.
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.300]   That's why it takes one or two months.
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.180]   You try some things, it's not really working.
[00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.420]   So you change your goals or challenges or habits.
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.700]   So you find something that's really working.
[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.940]   You come out of that second step, Toby, you're going to be
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:45.020]   a much more disciplined person.
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:50.500]   Step one, you build that base with the keystone step two, you overhaul
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.500]   tractable overhauls to experimentation.
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.700]   All the parts are important to your life.
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.740]   After that.
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.860]   Now if down the line, you're like, oh, here's a new long-term plan
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.060]   that I believe in, let me do some work towards it.
[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:01.620]   No problem.
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.900]   That's that's what you do.
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:04.740]   You're disciplined.
[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:05.700]   That's what you're gonna do.
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:06.460]   That's what you're going to do.
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:10.220]   So once you've changed the identity, then you can take on new challenges.
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:14.580]   The only final thing I'll say is even as a very self-disciplined person, if
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:18.220]   your challenges don't make sense, if your mind doesn't believe that it's
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.940]   worth doing or that your plan's actually going to accomplish what it is, you
[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.140]   will still struggle with discipline.
[00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:27.740]   So you have to be selective and careful in laying out what you do.
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.580]   Your brain is not dumb.
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:36.460]   If you're like, I'm going to be a Nobel prize winning novelist because I'm going
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:41.380]   to do national novel writing month, three days in your mind's like, this is stupid.
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:42.820]   We don't know what we're doing.
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.140]   This is not a good book.
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.460]   Um, I'm not going to do this.
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:47.580]   And that's not a failure of discipline.
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.380]   That's a failure of planning.
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:49.780]   So that's the only other copy I'll give.
[00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.300]   Even after you become a self-disciplined person, uh, you need
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.140]   goals your mind actually trust.
[00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.500]   All right.
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.140]   Rolling on here.
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.420]   We've got a question from Luke.
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:05.900]   Luke says, could you please work through an example where you break down a
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:10.180]   genuinely complicated long-term goal through quarterly, weekly, and daily planning?
[00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.620]   So Luke, the biggest problem people have with long-term planning is trying to
[00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.380]   actually do too much of the planning up front.
[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:23.620]   I think a better way of thinking about this is that there is a feedback loop
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:28.380]   approach to planning out, structuring and executing longer projects.
[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:34.900]   Like what I'll often do is if there's a longer term project, like the summer, I
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:41.500]   put finish book proposals onto my quarterly plan, like finish them by the
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.700]   new year, so that was my plan.
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:46.940]   I just put that on there, the very high level.
[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:51.420]   And then when I got to my weekly plan, I started like, okay, this is like
[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.580]   one of my things I want to work on.
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:53.860]   Like, let me get started into this.
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.780]   And it's really, once you dive into something, so on your weekly plan,
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:57.820]   you're putting a slight time to it.
[00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.740]   It's only then that you really begin to discover its contours.
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.660]   Oh, how is this really going?
[00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.940]   Where do I really need to spend time?
[00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:06.300]   How is this going to naturally break up at the different parts?
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:10.060]   And then you can go back and refine that quarterly plan a little bit later.
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.540]   It's like, okay, what we really want to do then is like this month,
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.220]   get the sample chapters together.
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:18.780]   It gets more specific, but it gets more specific because you get specific
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.180]   feedback from actually putting boots on the ground.
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:24.700]   So go back to my original plan of writing book proposals.
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.340]   I submitted those last week.
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:31.180]   So my original plan of do it by the new year was just throwing a
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:36.460]   dart generally in the direction of the dartboard, but I couldn't really
[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:39.100]   make a good prediction of how long it was going to take and how it was
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.180]   going to get it done and how it was going to break down into different
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.780]   pieces until I was actually doing it.
[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:46.700]   So that's the main thing I'm going to say, Luke, is when you
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.260]   first start a long-term plan, you should be doing shockingly
[00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.980]   little thinking about that plan.
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.300]   Just get going.
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:58.300]   Once you're convinced this is something important to do, start putting aside
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.900]   time during your weekly planning and that weekly planning will
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.020]   influence your daily planning.
[00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:06.540]   And let that feedback help you refine and improve those plans.
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.820]   And don't be mad at yourself when you get the timing wrong,
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.300]   because it's impossible to do.
[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:14.060]   You don't get a gold medal for guessing how long a hard
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.260]   project is going to take.
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.420]   All right.
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.620]   You get a gold medal for continuingly to follow the
[00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.980]   multi-scale planning process, to let the feedback, refine your plans,
[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.780]   to execute good weekly plans based on your quarterly plans and
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.140]   the realities of your schedule.
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.020]   Doing good time-block plans based on your weekly plans.
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.540]   That is the thing you want to do.
[00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.060]   Trust that process, how long things actually take to happen.
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.260]   Well, I don't know.
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.460]   Did your family get COVID?
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.820]   Did you have a giant project dropped on your lap?
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:40.900]   You weren't expecting.
[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.540]   Did something blow up two months in that you thought was going to be easy to
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.700]   complete and you had to go over and start over like, who knows?
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:47.460]   You can't predict that.
[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:53.140]   Why would you expect you could follow the multi-scale process, refine your
[00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:56.820]   long-term plans as, as you unfold your work on them, do that.
[00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.540]   And you should be happy with what you're doing.
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:02.300]   All right.
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.260]   Well, that's a lot of me talking.
[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.340]   Why don't we take a call, Jesse?
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.660]   Do we have a, do we have a call queued up that we can go to here?
[00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:07.980]   Yeah, we sure do.
[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:08.900]   It's from Laura.
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:12.300]   We've got a question about a book that you read.
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.340]   Hi, Cal.
[00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:16.100]   I've been reading your book, Digital Minimalism.
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:20.020]   I'm about over halfway through right now, and I'm looking forward to
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.180]   decluttering my technology life.
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:29.060]   I also saw a book that just came out called Stolen Focus, Why You Can't Pay
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.980]   Attention and How to Think Deeply Again.
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.740]   It's by Johan Hari.
[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.580]   I think it just came out this month in January.
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:38.900]   And I was wondering if you've read it and what you think about it.
[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:42.020]   It seems like something that could definitely help with productivity.
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.220]   Thank you.
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:47.300]   Well, Laura, I like Johan's work.
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:51.860]   So that's, that's the third book of his that I know about.
[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.580]   Um, let me not bury the lead.
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:55.980]   I have not read it.
[00:14:55.980 --> 00:15:00.460]   I have not read Stolen Focus, not because there's something I dislike about it, but
[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:05.700]   because when you write a book on a topic and you're done with that book, it's not
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:10.660]   uncommon that you're, you're kind of done with the topic in the sense that it's
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:14.420]   actually very difficult to get motivated to read a similar book.
[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.660]   This is very common among writers, especially writers, even writers
[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.140]   who read very widely like I do.
[00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:23.380]   I just don't want to read something that is covering very similar ground to
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:28.780]   something I've written about too, because I've spent a lot of time on those topics.
[00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:30.740]   I'm probably, I'm going to guess.
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:33.460]   I know the same people he's quoting.
[00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:36.500]   I know the same stories I've spent years in that world.
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:42.580]   So it's, it's, that's entirely a function of just, I'm up to my ears in that topic.
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.420]   Now, here's what I like about Hari though.
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:48.580]   I will say this, um, his approach to books, he has a certain formula that I
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.940]   appreciate, which is the, the big inversion formula.
[00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:57.100]   You thought X about this big topic, but the reality is Y.
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:02.580]   And the reality Y is often something that's going to be a little bit aspiration.
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.860]   Like, Oh, now that I understand that, that gives me hope.
[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.260]   That gives me a plan.
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.060]   I love that type of writing.
[00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.980]   Uh, that that's a Johan's approach.
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:14.620]   So he had this book out called chasing the scream years ago
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:16.180]   that was about drug addiction.
[00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.740]   And that was an interesting book because, uh, what he was, what he was arguing
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.700]   there, his big inversion in that book.
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:27.980]   If, if I understand it correctly, it's been a while is that we have this
[00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:34.500]   reductive chemical only cultural understanding of drug addiction, right?
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:39.340]   So his thing is, okay, the way we are taught about drug addiction is that if
[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:44.300]   the, the mad scientist kidnapped you and strapped you down, it was like, I'm
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:49.820]   going to put heroin into your veins every day, you would be released when
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:51.780]   he finally released you from his evil layer.
[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:53.380]   Um, you would be a heroin addict.
[00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:54.580]   That is the way we understand it.
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.100]   Like the, these drugs chemically build these dependencies in our
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.620]   brain, um, and then we can't shake them.
[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.740]   But he said, if that was the case, there should be a lot of heroin
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:07.820]   addicted grandmothers in the UK, because in the UK, the standard drug they
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:12.620]   give for pain, killing for hip replacement is Demerol, which is just medical heroin.
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:17.020]   So we have all these grandmothers in the UK, uh, getting basically a few
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.620]   weeks worth of heroin as their standard treatment for their hip.
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:21.700]   And they come away just fine.
[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:25.180]   They don't come away, uh, addicted to it or looking for heroin.
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:28.460]   And he said that the missing factor in chasing the scream was there's
[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:32.220]   also a socio-psycho component to it.
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.460]   So it's not just the chemical going into your body.
[00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:39.300]   It's when the chemical is going into your body as a means of escaping from
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:43.860]   something in your life, from pain, from post-traumatic stress, from trauma.
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:47.260]   It is the combination of that potent chemical, which gets right into your
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:52.660]   brain, plus the psycho-emotional usage of that to escape that creates the
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.580]   like impossible to shake addiction loop.
[00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:55.560]   So that was chasing the scream.
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:59.220]   So like this kind of interesting version, um, inject heroin, the
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.780]   mad scientist injects into you every day.
[00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:01.900]   You're not going to be addicted.
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:07.020]   You start taking the, the pain pills they gave you for your hip after your
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.420]   hip feels better because you're depressed about losing your job.
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.900]   And it's like, this helps, I need this to not feel depressed about losing my job.
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.780]   Then suddenly you can have a life destroying addiction.
[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:17.820]   So that was chasing the scream.
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:21.980]   Then he wrote a book called lost connections that was talking about depression.
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:27.500]   And again, he was, he was arguing that there is this biochemical model
[00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.340]   of depression that's too reductive.
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.980]   This idea that depression is just caused by something goes
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.260]   wrong with neurotransmitters.
[00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:39.060]   It's entirely chemical and you can, we can take pills to try to fix it.
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:39.940]   It's all you can do.
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:42.100]   And he's like, no, there's a chemical component.
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.900]   I think his big argument and lost connections is again, there's
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:46.820]   a socio-psycho component as well.
[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:52.980]   Like also, uh, a big source of depression is the things
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.180]   that are making you feel bad.
[00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.900]   Like someone close to you died, like you're really sad about it.
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.540]   Like you, you're, you feel hopeless about your work situation
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:01.980]   that you, you, you've lost some jobs.
[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:02.820]   You can't get into their jobs.
[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:03.380]   You're feeling worthless.
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.060]   He's like the socio-psycho psychological aspect of
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.300]   depression really matter too.
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.260]   And if we just say like, don't worry, don't worry.
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:10.140]   It's just your chemicals.
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.180]   We'll give you a pill to fix it.
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:13.380]   And don't also say what's going on in your life.
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.060]   We also let's, let's make your wife better.
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:16.700]   He's like, you're leaving most of the tools on the table.
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.380]   So that's like classic Yohan Harari.
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:22.220]   So in stolen focus, he's applying this to distraction and the attention economy.
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:26.060]   I don't know the book, the thesis really well, because again, it's too close to
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:30.260]   home, so I don't really want to get into it, but I think he's, he's, uh, I think
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:35.780]   his inversion there, if I understand vaguely is, uh, you think you're more
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:41.620]   distracted because you're like lazy, there's all these new shiny distractions
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:42.940]   out there and you can't help yourself.
[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:44.060]   He's like, that's not the case.
[00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:49.020]   Um, the attention economy has put billions of dollars to steal your focus away.
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:55.260]   Like there was this, this Apollo mission size effort to distract
[00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.300]   you and you had no chance.
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:57.460]   That's what I think he's saying.
[00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.660]   And if it is, I agree because I've written a lot about that.
[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:02.780]   So anyways, he's a, he's an entertaining writer.
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:06.740]   I like chasing the stream and lost connections and, uh, people who read, I
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.220]   get a lot of notes about lost focus.
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:12.100]   Um, so obviously lots of people are sending it to me to read, but people
[00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.220]   aren't telling me what they think about it.
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.780]   So let me know if you read it, let me know.
[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.700]   Uh, let me know what you think.
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:17.780]   All right.
[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:24.500]   Number one, pre-block important or timely work on your calendar.
[00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.140]   So what happens with time block planning is when you make your
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:31.580]   time block plan for the day, you look at your weekly plan.
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.820]   You look at your calendar because you're going to transfer from your
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:37.340]   calendar, any meetings or appointments you have onto your time block plan.
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:42.300]   What I suggest is if something is timely or important, you go, once you
[00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:46.540]   know about this thing on your radar, consider going ahead in your calendar
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:52.180]   and actually adding non appointment, non meeting blocks onto your calendar for
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.380]   when you're going to get that work done.
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:59.180]   You know, it's, uh, right now, for example, I'm reviewing copy edits for
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.700]   my upcoming book, slow productivity.
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.580]   This isn't, it's very important and very timely.
[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:05.020]   I have a very short amount of time to turn these around.
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:08.700]   So what I did is when I knew what date these were coming back, I actually
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:12.020]   went in advance and took three big blocks of time and just scheduled
[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:13.300]   it on my calendar, like a meeting.
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:16.820]   And now when I got to those days, I just transfer that work over to
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:18.140]   my time block plan for the day.
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:23.100]   So pre-blocking time, once you're in a time block discipline mindset,
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:27.540]   pre-blocking time is a great way to make sure that you don't, for example,
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.620]   over clutter your schedule in times when a lot is due.
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.340]   All right.
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.340]   My second little different than autopilot, right?
[00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:36.180]   It's different than autopilot.
[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:36.900]   It was a good question.
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:42.100]   Autopilot is your pre-scheduling work that occurs on a regular basis, right?
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:47.980]   So if you know, I always have to file a report on the last Friday of the month,
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.780]   you can figure out when and how you do that work and just set that repeating
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:55.340]   your calendar into perpetuity with pre-blocking is for one-off projects.
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:56.460]   Got it.
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:59.580]   So you're not finding a regular time to work on copy editing because it only
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:02.260]   happens once every few years, but you know, that's really important and it's
[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:03.620]   going to have a short turnaround.
[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:05.500]   So you go protect that time in advance.
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:08.460]   And then because you time block, you know, when you get
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.260]   there, that'll be safe.
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:09.580]   All right.
[00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:14.100]   The second tip time block relaxation into your work day.
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.540]   Right.
[00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:18.020]   So at first you might just be putting in a half hour.
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:22.060]   Uh, break it's in your time block plan.
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:26.220]   And when you get there, you know, okay, I'm going to just completely turn off work.
[00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:31.660]   But once you're in the habit of time blocking relaxation, you'll tend to
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:36.540]   get more aggressive about this because see, this is the, the advantage of time
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:40.820]   blocking from a sustainability point of view, uh, a critique, which I think is
[00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:44.100]   flawed of this approach is that people say, well, this is all about just
[00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:47.620]   optimizing every minute of your day, but time blocking can actually help
[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:48.940]   you much better do the opposite.
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:53.820]   Once you're in the habit of, I put breaks into my day and you
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:55.180]   have control over your time.
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:23:00.300]   Now, as your workload gets under control, you can get more aggressive about that.
[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:01.740]   And you can say things like, you know what?
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:05.820]   On Wednesday, I'm going to make very efficient use of the morning and then
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.740]   block off three and a half hours to go see Oppenheimer in the afternoon.
[00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:12.300]   You can now do that with confidence because you're controlling all of your time.
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:15.220]   So when you can control your time, not only can you get more work into your
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:18.660]   time, into your day, you can also get more relaxation the day without it
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:23.020]   causing trouble, so just introduce the habit of many days during the week.
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.260]   I put little breaks into it.
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:28.300]   Once you have that habit, as you get to periods where your workload's a little
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:34.020]   less, you can lean into completely guilt-free, unnoticeable, larger breaks.
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:37.820]   And that type of variation of work pacing is something that's going to
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:39.540]   make work much more sustainable.
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:44.660]   So you're not just trying to fit in work, use time blocks to also fit in relaxation.
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:49.140]   Because you can trust that that relaxation is fine, it's scheduled.
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:51.580]   You know when the other work's going to happen, nothing bad's going to
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:53.180]   happen if you turn off for a while.
[00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:55.020]   All right.
[00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:58.860]   Another advanced tip is when doing admin blocks.
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:00.660]   So I'm a big believer of admin blocks.
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:05.260]   I talk about this in the introductory material of the time block planner.
[00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:09.580]   For tasks, you want to have one block in which you execute multiple things.
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:12.020]   Consolidate tasks, right?
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:13.700]   That's standard time blocking.
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:18.620]   What I've been experimenting with recently is having smaller admin
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:24.460]   blocks, theming the admin work by cognitive context.
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:32.020]   So what I mean by that is if you have five different tasks to do that are all
[00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:36.340]   related to different projects or different types of work, it can be more
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:39.540]   difficult than you think to go one, two, three, four, five, and execute those.
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:44.100]   And the reason why it's difficult is because as you switch from one
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:47.860]   task type to another, your brain has to switch its cognitive context.
[00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:49.540]   Oh, we're thinking about this type of project.
[00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:52.980]   Now we have to think about like my kid's little league and some social event.
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.740]   Well, that's a completely different type of context.
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.860]   And you will notice the difficulty of this context switching.
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:02.980]   You will notice it subjectively as a feeling of resistance, of mental fatigue.
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:06.940]   So if you instead theme tasks, so they're in the same cognitive context,
[00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:08.820]   what you'll realize is you get through a much faster.
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:15.540]   So if I'm doing four things related to social planning for the family, those
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.740]   four things, if I do them one in a row is going to go much more smoother because
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:22.860]   once I switch into that context, now I can do the three, four, five other tasks.
[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:25.340]   And it's going to come without that subjective resistance.
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:28.660]   And then maybe I have another small block later with a bunch of things
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:32.140]   surrounding a particular type of project I'm doing for work.
[00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:34.700]   Oh, I have a lot of things result surrounding a conference.
[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.740]   I'm organizing, let me put a 20 minute block over here where I'm just going
[00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:39.020]   through a bunch of those in a row.
[00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:46.140]   So shorter blocks of themed admin tasks is way more comfortable than having
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.980]   bigger blocks where you mix together different types of admin tasks.
[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:53.580]   This is why the single hardest batched admin tasks that most people do on a
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:55.940]   regular basis is cleaning their email inbox.
[00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:59.980]   Because if you're just going through your inbox one by one, why is that so hard?
[00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:03.620]   Because you are switching context from message to message.
[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:07.660]   So even your email inbox, you can break out in the themes and say, okay,
[00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:13.220]   during this admin block, I'm doing some family related tasks and I'm responding
[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:16.420]   to all emails related to family related tasks.
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:20.660]   And then later in the day, when I'm doing tasks that are just related to
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:24.300]   this conference I'm organizing, I will then go through my inbox and handle all
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.700]   the emails related to that conference.
[00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:29.340]   And what you're going to find is those encounters with your inbox are going to
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:32.860]   go so much more smoothly because you are not behind the scenes trying to keep
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:35.220]   switching your cognitive context.
[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:36.620]   All right.
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:42.420]   My fourth bit of advanced time blocking advice is whenever you put a meeting of
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:48.820]   any significant length or complexity onto your time block plan at a short block
[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:54.820]   after it for just post-mortem organizing, what you learned, making a plan for what
[00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:57.460]   to handle, getting the information for that meeting into your systems.
[00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:05.180]   Never let a interaction based time block be immediately followed by another time
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:06.620]   block focused on something different.
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:09.460]   You have to close down to work of meetings.
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:12.340]   You need 15 to 30 minutes to do this.
[00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:12.780]   Okay.
[00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:17.100]   The meeting is over, but I have 15 to 30 protected minutes to go transform
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:20.180]   my notes and the tasks and the put reminders on the calendars.
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.460]   And if there's followup emails, let me just do them right now.
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.980]   Now I can completely shut down that thing.
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.780]   I don't have a ton of open loops hanging in my head as I jumped
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:28.820]   from this meeting to the next.
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:31.620]   I don't have a ton of open loops in my head as I jumped from this meeting
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:33.060]   right into trying to do deep work.
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:37.420]   So that should just be instinct when you write a meeting time block that
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:38.900]   you put another block under it.
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:43.380]   And you can even just, I'll sometimes just a shaded in this little shaded
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:44.780]   in block under each of my meetings.
[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:48.260]   And that's the catch your breath, process everything to
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:49.300]   just happen in that meeting.
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:52.220]   Again, it's going to make the whole day go smoother.
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:55.380]   That, that, that extra 15 or 20 minutes after every meeting makes the whole
[00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:57.980]   rest of the day actually makes sense.
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:27:59.620]   All right.
[00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:00.740]   So that's the same concept.
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.980]   No, that's the same concept.
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:06.580]   That's the same concept that you always suggested with students and answering
[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:09.420]   all their questions, like after a lecture and stuff, pretty much.
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:09.500]   Yeah.
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.180]   That's a good point.
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:10.580]   Right.
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:14.020]   I used to recommend the same thing for students that when you're taking notes
[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:18.220]   in lecture, you clearly Mark everything you didn't fully understand.
[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:22.020]   And as soon as lecture is over, you see how many of these things can I resolve?
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:25.380]   I mean, I guess the first I, so this is from my book, how to
[00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:26.260]   become a straight A student.
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.900]   And I say, there's, there's multiple lines of defense for
[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:30.940]   filling in these question marks.
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.140]   The first line of defense is you ask questions right away.
[00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:35.100]   Wait, I didn't get that.
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:36.340]   Can you say that again?
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:39.220]   The second line of defense is you go up to the professor right after class.
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.820]   I'd understand this.
[00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:41.980]   Can you explain it to me?
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:47.020]   The third line of defense is some combination of TAs, textbooks,
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:50.060]   office hours, and asking classmates.
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:51.860]   And the key is do that as soon as possible.
[00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.260]   Do not let the questions.
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:57.060]   Uh, don't let the questions just sit there as I don't
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.220]   understand this math technique.
[00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:01.100]   I guess I'll deal with that when I'm studying for the test a month from now.
[00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:02.580]   Close that down.
[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:05.340]   You want to try to close down and consolidate your understanding of
[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:07.660]   lectures as soon as possible after you encounter the lectures.
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:08.620]   So this is kind of similar.
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:12.220]   If you have a meeting process, everything related to it right away.
[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:13.340]   Don't just let that sit.
[00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:15.660]   And maybe tomorrow I'll remember what to do about it.
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:16.780]   Closing loops.
[00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:20.500]   I think is really important for having sustainable cognitive work.
[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:23.540]   All right.
[00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:24.700]   So that's time block planning.
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:25.820]   Good to revisit it.
[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:27.940]   Enjoy the time block planner.
[00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.940]   If you want to find out more, I have a website, timeblockplanner.com.
[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:35.460]   Um, that has a video where I really go through and show you a lot of
[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.580]   examples of exactly how time blocking works.
[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:38.940]   You can go watch that video there.
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:42.860]   And it has links to where to buy the second edition from Amazon, but I'm just,
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:44.940]   look, whether or not anyone buys it.
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:48.460]   And a lot of people are, but whether or not anyone buys this, I'm so happy to
[00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:54.420]   have it because it is just a perfected tool for exactly this method of time
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:57.100]   management that I have so long sworn by.
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:00.260]   All right, let's move on to some questions.
[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:03.300]   Uh, Jesse, I think all the questions we've chosen today have at least a
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:07.340]   tangential connection to time blocking or time management.
[00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:13.380]   So let's get our productivity geeks hats out and put on and get rolling here.
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:14.500]   So what's our first question.
[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.500]   Here we go.
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:18.740]   First question is from Pumi.
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:22.540]   I live my day using time blocking combined with autopilot
[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.380]   scheduling for my mornings.
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:27.500]   Every morning I do two hours of my work on my research.
[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:30.940]   Sometimes, however, I have to stay up late and I miss my morning blocks.
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:33.980]   I want to know how to deal with these setbacks.
[00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:37.580]   I feel guilty for the whole day for not executing my autopilot
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:39.140]   schedule because I slept in.
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:44.620]   Well, we have two different related concepts to differentiate here.
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:47.740]   I think that's going to help you find a solution.
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:53.780]   So autopilot scheduling, which is what you referenced in your question here is
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:31:00.140]   where for regularly occurring work, you have a set time on a set day and typically
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:03.540]   a set location for which you do that works.
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:09.180]   The whole idea is to, uh, take the decision of working on this out of your
[00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:10.860]   day-to-day decision-making process.
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:12.180]   It's just there on your calendar.
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:17.220]   Tuesdays at 10, I go to this library and work on my problem set.
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:18.420]   That's just when I do that.
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:20.260]   So that's autopilot scheduling.
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:24.060]   Now what you're doing is maybe not exactly autopilot scheduling.
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:27.100]   What you're trying to do is start each morning with two hours of research.
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.900]   So it feels like an autopilot schedule because like, oh, it's, it's work.
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:36.220]   I do on the same, uh, same time every day, but I would say what you're really
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:41.100]   doing instead is what we might call a heuristic autopilot.
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:49.220]   So a heuristic autopilot is not a calendar appointment that is set to show
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:52.940]   up on a regular basis and you treat like any other calendar appointment, like
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:54.300]   a dentist appointment or a meeting.
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:56.980]   A heuristic autopilot is a rule.
[00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:00.980]   It's something you're going to write down on the top of your weekly plan.
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:05.700]   For example, a, a rule that you think about when you're creating
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:06.900]   your schedule for each day.
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.940]   So I think what you're really doing here is you have the heuristic autopilot
[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:15.940]   that says when possible, spin the first hour or two of each day working on research.
[00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:21.540]   So some days that's not possible because you, uh, you're up late and you have to
[00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:26.100]   sleep in, uh, but you're not violating an appointment on your schedule.
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:28.500]   So if this was an actual appointment on your schedule, if this was a true
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:32.100]   autopilot schedule, you would treat this like a real appointment, like a meeting
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.100]   with your boss and you wouldn't say to your boss, yeah, sorry, I didn't show up.
[00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:35.660]   I slept in.
[00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:38.580]   You would have to go to that, but what you're doing here is more flexible.
[00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:39.820]   So that's why I call it a heuristic.
[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:42.940]   It's a general rule for how you get a certain thing done.
[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:48.580]   Like another example of a heuristic autopilot is sometimes when I'm deep in
[00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:53.020]   the problem solving phase of a theoretical computer science paper, I'll have a
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:58.140]   heuristic that says, okay, the drive to work every day for the next week, to
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:00.500]   the extent possible, use that to think about the problem.
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.340]   It's not something that's on my calendar.
[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:06.300]   When I actually drive to work might differ based on the days, but it's
[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:09.740]   a heuristic, keep this rule in mind each day when you're planning out your day.
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:14.140]   Another heuristic autopilot, sometimes I have a lot of tasks that are floating
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:15.620]   around for something that's coming up.
[00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:21.420]   I'll say 20 minutes every day dedicated only to working through
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:23.540]   tasks related to this upcoming thing.
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:25.060]   That's a heuristic autopilot.
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:28.740]   And then when I get to each day, I'll say, okay, I have to find where this is
[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:31.420]   going to fit, but I'm going to try to find 20 minutes where I can work on
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:32.940]   tasks and try to do that every day this week.
[00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:34.900]   So I think that's going to help you here.
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:37.940]   You really have a heuristic, not a hard autopilot schedule.
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:42.060]   And once you know that you shouldn't be so worried that occasionally you don't
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.140]   get to do research in the morning.
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.860]   What matters is you're following a heuristic rule of when there's
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:47.060]   time in the morning, you do.
[00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:52.060]   Now, if you find that you're almost never actually applying this rule,
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:56.940]   that almost always you're sleeping in too late to get this research done.
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.420]   Well, then you need to change something, right?
[00:33:58.420 --> 00:33:59.940]   That's no longer a good heuristic.
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:02.140]   You need to change where the research happens or you need to change your
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.340]   habits so you're not sleeping in.
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:04.420]   That's possible.
[00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:07.420]   But if what we're talking about here is once a week, you don't do morning
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:08.780]   research, the other four days you do.
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:12.980]   I think it's a perfectly fine example of a heuristic autopilot schedule.
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:15.020]   All right.
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:16.100]   What is that similar?
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:19.260]   Is that similar to when you were writing your, when you were in writing
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:21.220]   mode last summer, you would write.
[00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:23.460]   Is that, was that heuristic?
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:24.300]   Was that a little different?
[00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.420]   No, I think that's a fair point.
[00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:30.740]   Last summer when I was writing slow productivity, it was, you know, try to
[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:34.700]   write first thing before we go out and do activities, you know, try to write
[00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:36.300]   first thing every day if possible.
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:40.540]   And when we were on vacation, so last summer we were up in Vermont, the Mad
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:44.820]   River Valley, some days it was, look, we got to get going early in the morning
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:48.180]   because we're taking the family out to see something as it's a couple hours away.
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:49.820]   And I just want it right that day, but it was okay.
[00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.780]   The default is try to just write every morning.
[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:54.860]   And Julie was understood that schedule.
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.540]   So she's a lot of mornings be like, yeah, we might go do something in the morning.
[00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:01.260]   I might take the boys to do something brief before we do our larger trip.
[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:01.940]   And you're right.
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:04.380]   It was a heuristic and I couldn't do it every day.
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:07.300]   But most days I tried to write first thing.
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:09.220]   So that was a heuristic autopilot schedule.
[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:13.140]   And again, yeah, it's very different than these days, these hours, this
[00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:14.900]   location, I'm always doing this work.
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:21.380]   I want to react to something that has been going around the internet recently.
[00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:24.260]   So I'm actually going to share something on the screen here.
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:28.900]   So again, this is the deep life.com or youtube.com/calnewportmedia to
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:31.060]   watch this episode, episode 262.
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:33.260]   I'm loading up a YouTube video.
[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:35.980]   I won't have the audio on, but I have closed captioning on.
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:36.860]   All right.
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:39.980]   So this is a video from better ideas, a popular channel.
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.860]   It's 2 million subscribers.
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:47.580]   And the title of this video is how overstimulation is ruining your life.
[00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:51.580]   And we see there's a young man on screen here in the woods.
[00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:54.740]   Looking earnestly at the camera and I have the close captioning on.
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:57.220]   So I'm going to play this and read you a little bit of what he's saying.
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:59.500]   He's saying during certain periods of my life.
[00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:03.140]   Oh, that's where I said the volume was off.
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:06.060]   Uh, the volume was very much on.
[00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:06.860]   Let me turn that off here.
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:07.460]   Sorry about that.
[00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:07.780]   All right.
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:17.220]   During various periods of my life, I have a very difficult time focusing on
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:20.860]   pretty much anything important or difficult during these periods.
[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:26.740]   It seems almost impossible to break out of the social media limbo where you're
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:31.700]   just constantly switching between tabs, refreshing pages, kind of waiting for
[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:32.940]   something interesting to happen.
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:37.820]   Like for someone to post a cool photo or Instagram or something, you're
[00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:39.260]   kind of waiting to be entertained.
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:43.060]   But if you actually have to apply yourself, it's extremely difficult,
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:44.660]   borderline painful to do so.
[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:48.860]   And I'm pretty sure almost everyone can relate to this problem.
[00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:52.620]   I'm sure you've seen a lot of videos on YouTube, giving you little tips and
[00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:56.540]   tricks as to how to better focus, including my own channel, but they are
[00:36:56.540 --> 00:37:01.300]   very few videos kind of diving in talking about why it's so difficult to focus on
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:05.460]   hard things, you know, like what's the deal?
[00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:08.740]   Why can't we just sit down and do something important with very little
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:09.300]   strain?
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.460]   All right.
[00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:14.140]   So that's the start of that video on better ideas.
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:18.140]   And he goes on to get into some of the neuroscience of why we're distracted so
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:20.180]   easily when we're trying to work on something hard.
[00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:24.300]   And it's a neuroscience explanation you may have heard before, but essentially
[00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:29.420]   our dopamine system, which generates that urge to do something that's going to
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:30.500]   generate a reward.
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:34.020]   Keep in mind, we often get that a little bit wrong.
[00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:39.260]   I think in common parlance, we often think about dopamine as being a source of
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:39.660]   rewards.
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:42.820]   The dopamine itself is what makes you feel a lot of pleasure.
[00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:47.620]   Now, dopamine is what gives you that urge to do the thing that you think is going
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:48.740]   to give you the reward.
[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:52.220]   It's when you have an addiction, it's the dopamine that makes it so irresistible to
[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:56.380]   grab that cigarette because it wants the other rewards you're going to get when
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:58.820]   you actually smoke the cigarette, right?
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:02.980]   So what is talked about in this video is this common neuroscience explanation that
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:09.980]   the dopamine system is firing up to get those quick hit rewards of seeing the
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:13.660]   video that's really interesting, seeing the post that's a little bit scandalous,
[00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:17.460]   seeing the like number jump on something you did earlier, which gives you this big
[00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:18.940]   burst of people like me.
[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:20.260]   They really like me.
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:22.740]   The dopamine system likes rewards.
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:23.660]   It wants rewards.
[00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:26.700]   Now, the internet has many rewards lined up.
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:31.540]   That system kicks in the play in the play and you feel this irresistible desire to
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:32.180]   click, click, click.
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:41.140]   You do not get a similar dopamine push for I'm working for our 900 of 10,000.
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:44.300]   It's going to take me to finish this really big project because the reward's not
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:44.820]   proximate.
[00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:50.340]   And so what's going to win then the complicated deep thing, part of your slow
[00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:56.060]   productivity push to do something big over a long period of time or Instagram or
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:56.500]   tick tock.
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.420]   And he said, yeah, your brain is wired to go for that.
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:01.340]   And that's a very hard, that's a very hard challenge to win.
[00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:04.740]   And now what I learned from this video is that, yes, he is right.
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:08.300]   There are lots of videos that talk about this same thing, quote unquote, over
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:09.140]   stimulation.
[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:11.020]   People are really feeling it.
[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:15.180]   And I think young people are feeling it harder because they have more targets for
[00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:16.220]   their dopamine systems.
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:20.180]   They've more acclimatized their mind to all of these various rewards.
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:21.860]   And they're very good at these various rewards.
[00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:25.300]   There's so much pulling at them that young people in particular are really
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:25.740]   finding.
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:27.060]   Yes, this is ruining my life.
[00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:34.060]   I can't do anything longterm, deep, cognitively useful, getting bad grades at
[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:34.620]   school.
[00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:37.460]   I can't advance in my job.
[00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:39.660]   I can't produce something that I really want to produce.
[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:45.620]   Those of us, my age or older, maybe say I distract myself too much and it slows
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:47.380]   down me doing important work.
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:50.140]   Young people really do feel like it's ruining their lives.
[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:52.260]   So what should we do about it?
[00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:54.100]   Well, I thought, well, I can offer my own advice here.
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:57.140]   I mean, this is something I've studied and written about for a long time.
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:01.580]   Kind of wrote the definitive book on the power of focus and why you should
[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:02.300]   cultivate it.
[00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:05.420]   I've been thinking and writing articles and books about this for a long time.
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:12.220]   So I figured, let me, let me review here on the podcast, my own very complicated
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:15.420]   multi-part system for combating online overstimulation.
[00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:19.380]   So get a pad of paper ready because you don't want to miss step nine or 10.
[00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:23.180]   There's a very complicated explanation for how you're going to have to very
[00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:25.260]   carefully navigate the online world.
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:25.500]   All right.
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:26.380]   So it's gonna be very complicated.
[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:26.820]   Are you ready?
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:27.580]   Okay, here it goes.
[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:28.420]   Here's my solution.
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:32.060]   Don't use things that cause overstimulation.
[00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:34.780]   All right.
[00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:37.900]   Now, I mean, I'm being a little bit facetious here, but, but honestly, the
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:39.940]   answer is as simple as that.
[00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:42.100]   Dopamine system is powerful.
[00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:45.980]   So don't give it the targets that it's going to fire up for.
[00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:52.220]   You have to actually remove most of these sources of overstimulation from your life.
[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:56.340]   If you really want to start thinking and producing original
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:58.660]   thoughts at a high level.
[00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:04.140]   There's not these complex habits and careful ways of navigating your
[00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:07.780]   notifications and when you use this and when you don't use this, I'm telling
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.940]   you this as someone who thinks for a living and studies people who thinks for
[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:16.300]   a living, the more sources of overstimulation you eliminate from your
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:19.740]   life, the easier, and we of course know this type of abstention approach is
[00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:24.620]   effective because we see it with other things that historically have hijacked
[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:26.860]   the dopamine system and caused a lot of trouble.
[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:32.260]   We do not tell people who have an issue with smoking, okay, we need to build a
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:35.140]   complex system of where you have cigarettes and where you don't, and you
[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:37.820]   don't want to have it in the car, but you will have it here and we're going to
[00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:41.780]   have a, an app that, that keeps track of how many cigarettes you've had and then
[00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:45.340]   try to restrict, then during certain periods, there's a time lock that locks
[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:47.700]   off the cigarettes that you can't have it during that period, but you can't have
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:48.380]   it on this period.
[00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:52.340]   And, uh, we do a week on, but you don't smoke on Saturdays.
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:56.340]   No, we just say you got to quit smoking as the same with a lot of other addictions
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:42:02.900]   like this, that people have trouble with, but we resist applying that type of
[00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:06.420]   clarity and abstention to online overstimulation.
[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:10.420]   So let me get a little bit more granular about this.
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:13.700]   Uh, social media, this is a big source of it.
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:16.300]   You got to just basically get this out of your life.
[00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:20.460]   If you have to have some social media for professional reasons, it
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:21.540]   should not be on your phone.
[00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:23.700]   It should be on a boring computer.
[00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:27.820]   It's something you should do on a schedule or hire someone to do on your behalf.
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:30.780]   It should never, ever be something you go to when you're bored.
[00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:33.380]   Should never be a source of distraction.
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:38.540]   It should be, I'm an author and I set up my Instagram post in a
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:40.900]   shared document on Google drive.
[00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:42.140]   Here's the photos.
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:42.860]   Here's the text.
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:46.580]   And I have someone who posts it Fridays and Mondays, or if I have to do that,
[00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:51.340]   I log in the thing on my computer, I post it, and then I shut it back down again.
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:52.940]   All right.
[00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:55.860]   So if you have to use it professionally, it's on a computer is boring.
[00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:57.580]   You never use it as a source of entertainment.
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:59.820]   You don't scroll online news.
[00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:05.700]   Look, you're not a, you're not a editor at Gawker.
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.860]   You just get out of that, that world of online news and discussion.
[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:10.060]   You don't have to be a part of it.
[00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:11.940]   How do you keep up with stuff in the world?
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:15.820]   We talked about this earlier in this episode where I gave advice to reading
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:19.540]   guy, uh, you know, subscribe to some email newsletters that you read when
[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:23.300]   you can, that gives you interesting perspectives, listen to podcasts, maybe
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:25.460]   listen to a daily news roundup podcast.
[00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:29.100]   If you want to be kept up with more current events, right.
[00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:32.420]   Or listen to something like a saga and crystals, their breaking points
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:36.580]   podcast, where they go through 10 stories about what's going on in the world.
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:37.740]   Podcasts are fine.
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:38.060]   Right.
[00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:40.820]   Because it's, it's something you have to turn on and listen to.
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:41.940]   It's not a knee jerk.
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:46.340]   It's not a knee jerk distraction that your dopamine system is going to kick into.
[00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:50.100]   No one is like trying to write and halfway through writing like, Oh,
[00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:51.580]   and quickly turn on a podcast.
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:53.260]   Tick-tock and do that.
[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:54.500]   Online news can do that.
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:55.500]   Twitter can do that.
[00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:56.340]   Podcasts are fine.
[00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:57.380]   Newsletters are fine.
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:00.940]   Maybe even print out the articles you like and read them when you get a chance.
[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:01.540]   That's fine.
[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:02.180]   You'll be informed.
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:04.460]   Can I get rid of all that online news?
[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:06.220]   What about YouTube?
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:06.940]   YouTube is tricky.
[00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:08.020]   Why is YouTube tricky?
[00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:09.100]   Good.
[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:13.260]   I think video is the future of independent content creation, but the
[00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:18.100]   recommendations sidebar on YouTube can make it into one of these dopamine
[00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:20.940]   inflaming sources of distraction.
[00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:25.420]   So when it comes to something like YouTube, you have to use
[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:26.780]   it one way and not another.
[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:30.260]   So this is maybe the place where I come closest to the navigation
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:33.460]   lines that you hear in a lot of these online videos, but I do think
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:36.260]   YouTube is a source of information.
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:40.780]   YouTube is a become more a source of entertainment, high quality
[00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:44.980]   entertainment that rivals what you would get on TV, but it's also
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:46.180]   a giant source of distraction.
[00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:48.620]   So how do we, how do we make sense of YouTube?
[00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:52.300]   Well, here's my, here's my YouTube strategy.
[00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:56.860]   So in order to preserve YouTube as a way to look up instructions for
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:59.860]   things, which I think is a great use of YouTube, how do I change
[00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:01.380]   the oil in a Honda odyssey?
[00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:03.460]   You look it up on YouTube.
[00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:04.900]   You can see a video of someone doing it.
[00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:07.660]   It's better than trying to find an article to preserve that use of
[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:12.660]   YouTube without it making a dopamine inflaming system, get one of these.
[00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:17.060]   Plugins for your browser that you use YouTube on that gets
[00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:18.020]   rid of the recommendations.
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:20.340]   So what you can do is you can search for something.
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:21.300]   You can see the search results.
[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:22.420]   You can click on a search result.
[00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:24.980]   You can watch it, but there's no, here's what's coming up next.
[00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:25.900]   Or what about this?
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:26.500]   And what about that?
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:32.980]   So that one type of plugin alone makes YouTube into a fantastic
[00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:36.980]   library without it being something that you can use as a source of
[00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:39.380]   knee-jerk distraction, because again, when you're working on something
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:43.260]   hard, if you have blocked YouTube, you go home, let's go to youtube.com.
[00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:44.060]   You don't see anything.
[00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:46.260]   You have to search for something and find something.
[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:49.260]   It's not a, it's not a highly salient source of distraction.
[00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:52.020]   Now, what about entertainment on YouTube?
[00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:54.140]   Because again, I think this is actually important.
[00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:57.740]   I'm a believer that video Trump's audio, the future of independent
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:45:59.180]   content is going to be video.
[00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:02.420]   I mean, this is like radio became a big thing until television was around.
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:06.180]   And then television just smashed the market share of radio.
[00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:09.220]   It was just so much bigger because humans like to see faces.
[00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:11.020]   Humans like to see visuals.
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:16.580]   And I increasingly believe, uh, watching a high quality interview
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:21.500]   show on YouTube is better than 99% of the stuff that's on television.
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:26.460]   Or that's on a non unscripted streaming services.
[00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:27.900]   And I think that gap's going to close more.
[00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:32.260]   So how do you, for example, watch a show like mine, or maybe
[00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:34.100]   you're, you're a Lex Fridman fan.
[00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:35.220]   You want to watch his interviews.
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:38.820]   How do you watch these type of programming as a substitute for
[00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:43.460]   lower quality television with again, not having YouTube be a rabbit hole.
[00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:46.980]   And my answer here is television sets.
[00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:52.020]   I learned this from our YouTube guy, Jeremy, that increasingly
[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:56.300]   televisions are becoming one of the most common devices on which
[00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:59.060]   this style of YouTube video is watched.
[00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:02.740]   So if you're going to look something up, you have a browser with a
[00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:04.820]   plugin that blocks the recommendations.
[00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:09.300]   If you're going to watch quote unquote, independent, high quality content on
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:13.460]   YouTube, you have it on the YouTube app and your Apple TV or fire stick on your
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:16.700]   television, and you watch it like you would any other television show in the
[00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:20.340]   same circumstances where you'd watch television, I'm sitting down with a
[00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:22.660]   lunch break, I take out my remote.
[00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:23.500]   I turn on the TV.
[00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:24.540]   I go to the YouTube app.
[00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:27.260]   I searched for the latest episode of whatever, and I put it on the TV.
[00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:31.260]   There's a lot of friction in using a television.
[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:35.900]   There's also a lot of routine and ritual built into televisions where that's
[00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:38.180]   not part of your dopamine cycle.
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:40.980]   When you're in your home office trying to write something, you don't
[00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:43.500]   rush downstairs and turn on the TV and go to Netflix and select
[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:44.180]   a show and turn it on.
[00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:45.020]   That's too much overhead.
[00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:48.140]   The television, you think about, oh, I'm going to have a meal.
[00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:49.860]   I'm taking a break.
[00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:51.580]   It's a big production to get it going.
[00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:56.220]   So you move high quality, independent media consumption to the television
[00:47:56.220 --> 00:48:01.420]   and looking up to a browser protected, a plugin protected browser.
[00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:06.220]   Now you don't have to worry about something like YouTube being in your
[00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:07.500]   life, being a source of distraction.
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:14.060]   Also throw in place better, less dopamine susceptible entertainment
[00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:19.380]   sources to fill the gap that the highly salient, uh, distracting
[00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:21.660]   content is probably filling right now.
[00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:26.860]   Listen to get back into music, go see good movies and read about them
[00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:32.180]   before and after read much more books, high quality streaming content,
[00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:33.900]   high quality podcast, right?
[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:39.140]   Get your mind used to other sorts of much higher quality content for.
[00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:43.020]   The entertainment and distraction, the lower quality stuff will
[00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:45.220]   begin to seem less palatable.
[00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:47.460]   Same thing happens with food.
[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:50.900]   You eat a lot of junk food is really addictive.
[00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:52.540]   My God, I just need chips and cookies.
[00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:53.660]   And this makes me feel better.
[00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:54.660]   And what else would I want to eat?
[00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:55.980]   You stop doing it for a while.
[00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:57.060]   You start eating better food.
[00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:58.180]   You start cooking yourself.
[00:48:58.180 --> 00:48:59.340]   You go to the farmer's market.
[00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:00.820]   You're using a high quality ingredients.
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:01.820]   Everyone will tell you this.
[00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:05.300]   You start eating well, a Snickers bar, a chips.
[00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:06.340]   Ahoy seems weird.
[00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:07.100]   It's cardboard.
[00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:07.620]   It's fake.
[00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:08.420]   It's too sugary.
[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:09.780]   You don't crave it anymore.
[00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:11.820]   Right?
[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:14.940]   So you don't break this connection to junk food by just white
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:17.380]   knuckling and eating less, you replace it with better food.
[00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:21.580]   So that's the final part of solving overstimulation is in introducing
[00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:25.660]   flooding the zone with much more quality stimulation so that you lose
[00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:28.540]   your taste for a Tik TOK video.
[00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:32.860]   You lose your taste for an inflammatory online article that someone tweeted
[00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:34.980]   and that you're scrolling through and then clicking the other links.
[00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:36.660]   All right.
[00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:40.260]   So again, this is how I think you solve overstimulation.
[00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:43.820]   If you're serious about it, you get rid of most of the sources of overstimulation.
[00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:47.780]   You stop using social media, you stop doing online news surfing.
[00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:51.780]   You put in a lot of high quality content and in the few places where you might
[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:55.740]   need to encounter these worlds, YouTube looking things up or high quality,
[00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:58.980]   independent media, you have to do some limited social media for your work.
[00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:02.980]   You do so in a way that makes it so far from being a source of knee jerk
[00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:05.180]   distraction that your dopamine system forgets about it.
[00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:07.100]   So anyways, I appreciated that video.
[00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:08.580]   Overstimulation is a problem.
[00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:11.980]   I'm glad people care about it, but let's just get blunt.
[00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:17.220]   Stop doing the thing that's ruining your life.
[00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:22.940]   Stop smoking, stop eating the junk food, replace it with something better.
[00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:24.300]   Let's not get too cute about this.
[00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:27.260]   Let's not get too fine grained life without the overstimulation
[00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:28.300]   really is a deeper life.
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:30.700]   It really is a more intellectually engaged life.
[00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:32.740]   It really is going to be a more successful life.
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:35.380]   You are going to produce ideas that astounds you.
[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:37.860]   Next question is from Gerald.
[00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:40.460]   Do you think that if you don't have at least an informal plan
[00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:43.860]   for every hour of the day, you are losing part of your day to ineffectiveness,
[00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:46.180]   even if it's recreation or family time?
[00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:49.620]   Or do you think having intentions for every part of your day leads to burnout?
[00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:53.620]   Well, Gerald, I mean, I do stand by
[00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:57.260]   time blocking at the level of intensity that I recommend for the professional day
[00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:59.740]   will burn you out if you don't have a break from it.
[00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:04.300]   So if you're locked in, what's next?
[00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:07.820]   Oh, my God, I have a limited amount of time to get this done.
[00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:10.420]   I'm going to let the pressure of that time boundaries
[00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:12.580]   actually motivate me to focus even more.
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:15.140]   I mean, that's a very effective way
[00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:18.500]   of producing a lot of cognitive output in a fixed amount of time.
[00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:20.660]   But if you're doing that all hours of the day, you will burn out.
[00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:23.340]   It's just it's just too much.
[00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:26.180]   On the other hand, I think you are right.
[00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:30.060]   If you come to your evenings and say, all right, I'm done with work.
[00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:33.020]   Time to relax and maybe get some stuff done.
[00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:37.100]   You're not going to end up as relaxed as you think stuff is not going to get done.
[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:39.180]   But more importantly, you're not going to actually commit
[00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:43.100]   to the type of activities that maybe would give you satisfaction or meaning.
[00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:45.140]   You're going to drift from thing to thing.
[00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:48.900]   Your phone is for sure going to insert itself into your time there
[00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:50.300]   and really dominate your attention.
[00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:51.540]   Your head's going to hit the pillow.
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:52.820]   You're not going to be particularly happy.
[00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:56.820]   So we need a middle ground between I'm looking at my planner
[00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:58.900]   and I got seven minutes to get these three things done.
[00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:02.300]   And I've just been on my phone for the last four hours.
[00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:06.980]   And I guess I need to go get, you know, a napkin because my eyes are bleeding
[00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:11.460]   from staring at memes on my screen.
[00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:13.700]   We need something in between.
[00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:15.500]   So I recommend sketching a plan.
[00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:16.660]   I use that terminology a lot.
[00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:18.740]   Sketch a plan for your evening.
[00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:21.180]   Sketch a plan for your weekend.
[00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:24.860]   And what that means can vary depending on the specificity.
[00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:29.140]   So it might mean, look, OK, at this exact time tonight, someone's coming over.
[00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:30.180]   I want to watch this show.
[00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:32.140]   And so some stuff might have time.
[00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:35.140]   Other stuff might be more lower grained, like try to like
[00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:38.340]   take care of the tax stuff right after work.
[00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:41.620]   And let's try to exercise.
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:43.860]   Here's what we're going to do for dinner tonight.
[00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:47.340]   You know, let's I want to get in some reading time on my book.
[00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:50.020]   So most of it's not attached to times.
[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:52.580]   It's relatively loose.
[00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:55.580]   But it gives you some sense of I want to do this and that.
[00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:56.780]   And here's what's happening tonight.
[00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:58.860]   And you're sketching a plan for a reasonable night.
[00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:00.540]   And then you do your best to more or less follow that.
[00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:03.140]   And if you miss time, something you added a little bit too much to it
[00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:06.020]   and something took more time, that doesn't really matter at all.
[00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:10.100]   What matters is I had some intentionality with my time.
[00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:12.020]   I thought through, like, what do I want to do tonight?
[00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:14.460]   And I more or less followed that the best I could.
[00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:15.940]   That's the win here.
[00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:19.540]   Not I got through this many things or I'm on top of things.
[00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:21.380]   I said, like, I wasn't adrift.
[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:25.980]   And these sketch plans can have plenty of downtime, but it's downtime on your terms.
[00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:30.140]   So, well, downtime, I could just sort of look at my phone while I'm eating dinner
[00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:35.420]   or, you know, if we ate early, I could go for a walk on this nature trail
[00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:39.460]   and listen to this this novel I'm really enjoying and really get downtime
[00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:43.020]   that I really enjoy and is really relaxing and it feels really intentional.
[00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:48.820]   Or if I think about it, why don't we start bedtime 45 minutes earlier?
[00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:50.740]   Like I can actually read a book with each of the kids.
[00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:52.100]   And, you know, that's actually really enjoyable.
[00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:54.580]   But I had to think about that if we were just going through the motions
[00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:56.740]   and just looked up and said, it's bedtime, we wouldn't be able to do it.
[00:53:56.740 --> 00:53:58.940]   So I'm a big believer in sketching a plan.
[00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:03.500]   For nonprofessional time, intention is what matters,
[00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:06.860]   but don't care so much about how much you're fitting to that plan
[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:07.940]   or whether you get everything done.
[00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:12.620]   I just want you to avoid wandering haphazardly during your time.
[00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:13.380]   And there's a difference.
[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:16.140]   There is a difference on the spectrum from wandering haphazardly
[00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:18.580]   to being incredibly locked in.
[00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:21.260]   There is a gap in between there, which is where I think evenings
[00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:23.300]   and weekends can comfortably exist.
[00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:26.860]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:28.980]   I like this question. It's from Ricky.
[00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:32.460]   There is one area of my personal productivity system
[00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:35.180]   that I haven't found a good way to handle ongoing activities.
[00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:38.420]   Usually these are things that can sometimes be broken up into projects,
[00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:41.460]   but the overall area is something that you you're never done with,
[00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:43.580]   like getting better at hockey, a hobby of mine.
[00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:46.900]   Any suggestions on how to handle staying on top of these?
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:52.820]   So, Ricky, there's a different category of organizational commitment
[00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:54.300]   that becomes relevant here.
[00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:58.460]   And this is what we can call systems, habits or routines.
[00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:01.180]   So it's things that have been worked into your schedule
[00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:05.340]   that you do on a regular basis ad infinitum.
[00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:07.540]   This is just what I do.
[00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:11.460]   I exercise on Monday, Wednesday and Fridays, and I do it after work
[00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:15.540]   and I do it in the basement gym, and that's just what I do on those days.
[00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:20.620]   Or I play hockey with this adult league
[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:23.860]   on Saturday mornings and I do rink time on
[00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:30.580]   Monday evenings, and then I run two days a week for exercise.
[00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:31.500]   I just do that.
[00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:33.620]   It's not a task that I'm done and I take it off my list.
[00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:34.660]   It's just part of my routine.
[00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:38.380]   So we all have some systems, routines
[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:41.420]   and habits in our lives where we just get used to doing it.
[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:44.580]   So how do we install these things?
[00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:47.420]   Well, typically you put them on your calendar.
[00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:50.500]   And or you do some sort of metric tracking on it,
[00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:53.060]   so you have something to check off each day, did I really do this?
[00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:54.620]   So you instill the habit.
[00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:56.660]   There's a lot that's been written on how to instill a habit.
[00:55:56.660 --> 00:56:02.300]   And then once it's there, it will become more of a background part of your life.
[00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:05.420]   It generates a sense of identity, positive feedback,
[00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:07.460]   and then it's more likely to stick in.
[00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:09.460]   The issue is you can only fit so many of these.
[00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:13.700]   So if you don't have any, that's a problem because it's a very powerful weapon.
[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:16.300]   When you when you when you work something into a background.
[00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:20.260]   Routine in your life, it just happens every week.
[00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:24.780]   You can just look up a year later and typically really cool stuff has happened.
[00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:27.980]   It's the proverbial exercise routine.
[00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:29.300]   You make it a routine.
[00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:30.980]   You stop thinking about it. You just do it.
[00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:33.220]   But then a couple of years later, you say, actually, I'm in pretty good shape.
[00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:34.620]   Like this paid off over time.
[00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:36.820]   I'm glad this is a part of my life.
[00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:41.180]   Another example would be like my five books per month routine.
[00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:42.900]   I just do that.
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:44.300]   And now I don't think much about it.
[00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:45.420]   It's just that this is what I do.
[00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:46.460]   I read five books a month.
[00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:48.620]   We talk about them on the podcast.
[00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:50.700]   And that's really positive over time in my life.
[00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:51.700]   But I don't have to think about it.
[00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:53.100]   It's something I've instilled.
[00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:55.260]   But there's a limited number of things you could do.
[00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:59.940]   Maybe a fitness thing, a high quality leisure thing.
[00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:04.620]   There's a few of these you can do where you you're able to regularly put aside
[00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:06.780]   and protect time for a habit, routine or ritual.
[00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:10.340]   And so you want to choose them very carefully.
[00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:13.300]   If you're not doing any, you're leaving a powerful weapon in the armory.
[00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:14.660]   Right. And that's a that's an issue.
[00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:17.180]   But if you have five or six different things, they're going to collide
[00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:20.980]   and you're going to have to fail in your commitment to execute again
[00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:25.020]   and again, that destabilizes your commitment and eventually will dissolve.
[00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:28.580]   So when it comes to these sort of serious, I do it all the time.
[00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:32.060]   Five is probably the limit, depending on how big we're talking about.
[00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:33.740]   And maybe three is more reasonable.
[00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:36.500]   So it's almost like you want to have these slots written up on your wall.
[00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:39.060]   It's a draft.
[00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:39.980]   What do I want to draft?
[00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:43.380]   I have three slots for like major routines I can have in my life outside of work.
[00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:45.460]   What are they going to be?
[00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:48.220]   And if something hasn't earned that place, like I'm going to take that
[00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:49.860]   and replace it with something that's even more valuable.
[00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:52.100]   So you do want to take those seriously
[00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:54.780]   because you only have a limited capacity if you really want to stick with them.
[00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:57.300]   But you do want to be using these.
[00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:00.620]   So sports or athletic pursuit could be one.
[00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:03.100]   Everyone should have something here that has to do with fitness,
[00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:06.180]   probably just doing it again and again relating to fitness.
[00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:08.860]   I really like the idea of having some sort of intellectual
[00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:12.500]   high quality leisure in here, something you do on a very regular basis
[00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:15.100]   above the normal baseline that the average person would do.
[00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:16.260]   That's pushing your mind.
[00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:19.580]   That's that's helping you psychologically or philosophically
[00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:22.260]   or theologically in some sort of regular way.
[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:24.740]   I think that's really important.
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:27.020]   Beyond there, it just kind of comes to your interest.
[00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:31.340]   Maybe it's cooking or maybe it's a craft like with woodworking or knitting.
[00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:31.700]   I don't know.
[00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:33.820]   There's different things you could you could have in there.
[00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:36.980]   Maybe it's programming or microelectronics,
[00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:41.220]   but they have three, maybe four of these things that get serviced
[00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:43.900]   with rituals that you instill as I just do this on these days.
[00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:45.740]   I just always do that.
[00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:47.460]   I think it's part of a deep life.
[00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:49.300]   So that's what I do with hockey.
[00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:50.340]   If I was you, Ricky.
[00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:52.980]   Golf. Golf. Sure.
[00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:56.300]   Yeah, tennis, tennis and golf.
[00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:58.820]   Just read a book about tennis.
[00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:02.580]   How a few, not too many, not too few.
[00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:05.260]   Yeah, I like those.
[00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:07.420]   All right, let's do we have a longer deep plate.
[00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:09.220]   Let's do another. We'll do one more question.
[00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:10.500]   All right. Sounds good.
[00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:12.780]   We've got a question from John.
[00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:15.860]   I'd like to calculate my implicit hourly rate to determine
[00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:19.500]   if I should outsource a task instead of doing it myself.
[00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:22.020]   I struggle, though, when it comes to personal tasks
[00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:25.780]   that would take place outside of work hours like yard work, home improvement,
[00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:26.860]   stuff like that.
[00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:29.180]   For these types of tasks, it's unlikely I would use the time
[00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:32.260]   saved from outsourcing the tasks to do more work
[00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:35.900]   that would earn my hourly rate because it's a weekend
[00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:37.900]   and I don't want to work that anyway.
[00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:40.580]   Yeah, so I've heard about this approach.
[00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:43.140]   This is the approach where you take your salary
[00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:45.780]   and you divide it by the number of hours you work.
[00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:49.060]   And then you say, this is implicitly my hourly rate.
[00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:51.180]   And the idea is in a professional context.
[00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:56.780]   When you're considering whether to do a particular annoying task,
[00:59:56.780 --> 01:00:00.180]   I'm going to format a presentation or
[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:05.020]   whatever, fly a better flight that's going to save me time
[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:06.380]   that's more expensive or something like this.
[01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:09.780]   You say, well, how much would it cost for me to hire someone?
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:12.700]   How much would it cost for me to take the better flight and then say,
[01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:19.220]   is that more or less than what it would cost me in terms of my hourly rate?
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:21.980]   So if my hourly rate is five hundred dollars
[01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:24.820]   and it would take me three hours to do this annoying task,
[01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:26.940]   but I could hire someone for three hundred bucks to do it.
[01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:28.740]   You should hire someone for three hundred bucks
[01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:31.940]   because you're not out three hundred bucks, you're actually saving twelve hundred dollars.
[01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:34.140]   Like that's that's the mentality.
[01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:37.380]   It's a hack or heuristic that people sometimes use in work.
[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:40.860]   John is asking about trying to use this with chores outside of work.
[01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:44.660]   And he says, ah, the analogy kind of breaks down because it's not as if
[01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:48.940]   the three hours I spend doing yard work is three hours.
[01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:52.060]   I could be earning fifteen hundred dollars working because if I wasn't doing
[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:54.180]   the yard work on Saturday, I wouldn't be working anyways.
[01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:56.140]   And I agree with that, John.
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:01:01.500]   I don't think the monetary framework is necessarily what you want to use
[01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:05.780]   for evaluating the worth of activities outside of work,
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:08.540]   at least in a very specific way.
[01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:10.260]   There is another way where I think money does matter here,
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:12.020]   but let's put that aside for now.
[01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:14.940]   Instead, the cost I want you to think about is in
[01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:19.020]   footprint on your schedule and stress.
[01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:23.780]   And so you look at how big of a footprint on my schedule
[01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:27.700]   is this particular household thing going to have if it's highly disruptive.
[01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:31.420]   It eats up the the core of the weekend day
[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:33.740]   that you otherwise as a family could be doing lots of other things.
[01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:35.300]   That's a heavy cost.
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:39.380]   If it's something that's very stressful for you, that's also a heavy cost.
[01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:42.380]   This was like me doing my own taxes.
[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:47.020]   My issue is not that I am not
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:50.020]   quantitative or mathematical enough to understand taxes.
[01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:52.580]   The issue is I'm too mathematical and quantitative.
[01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:58.660]   And so my mind would hone in on the inevitable ambiguities
[01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:02.740]   or inconsistencies in the process of trying to fill out these different tax forms.
[01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:04.620]   And it would drive me crazy.
[01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:07.260]   And at some point, my wife said, you're hiring someone to do the taxes
[01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:08.940]   because most people are like, it's fine.
[01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:10.700]   Like, this is probably fine.
[01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:12.180]   I know what this means.
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:14.700]   Fine. And I'm obsessing about, well, wait a second.
[01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:15.940]   How does this match with this?
[01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:16.540]   And is this really?
[01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:18.420]   And I'm trying to figure out the whole thing. It's my type of.
[01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:20.580]   So that's a high stress impact.
[01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:22.700]   So it's very costly to me.
[01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:27.860]   So when it comes to outsourcing or eliminating non-work obligations,
[01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:30.380]   that's the cost that you care about.
[01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:33.020]   But that has a highly disruptive footprint on your schedule.
[01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:35.340]   Outsource or eliminate if you can.
[01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:37.940]   If it has a high impact in terms of your stress level.
[01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:41.300]   Outsource or eliminate if you can.
[01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:44.420]   That's what you should be thinking about, not what your time is worth
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:47.060]   or your hourly rate or something like this.
[01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:48.900]   I agree that that doesn't come into it.
[01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:53.540]   All right. So money is relevant here in the sense that outsourcing can take money.
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:55.460]   And that's fine.
[01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:58.060]   So you also have to factor in, can I afford this?
[01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:00.060]   I do want to underscore, though, a point.
[01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:03.580]   We talked about this some in the deep dive earlier in this episode
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:04.940]   when I was talking with Sarah Hart Unger.
[01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:07.180]   We talked about this a little bit that.
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:11.820]   I think we take off the table too quickly, the idea of investing
[01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:15.980]   in elimination of disruptive schedule, footprints and overhead.
[01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:20.940]   We just take that off our list of things where it's valid to spend money on,
[01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:24.340]   even if we could and we spend that same money on other types of things.
[01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:25.700]   We're very comfortable.
[01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:29.580]   Let's say we're talking about, you know, dual income,
[01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:32.060]   middle class, coastal America or something like this.
[01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:33.260]   People are very comfortable with
[01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:39.860]   what will spend more money to have a a nicer car or, you know,
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:41.540]   we the environment's important.
[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:44.100]   So we're going to have a seventy thousand dollar Tesla.
[01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:47.300]   We will spend that's fifty thousand dollars more than we need for the transportation.
[01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:49.260]   But like this isn't we think is important to us.
[01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:50.940]   And that's a good thing to spend money on.
[01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:54.500]   But if, on the other hand, it's a few hundred dollars a month
[01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:59.220]   to take out this yard work chore that just eats up your schedule
[01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:02.900]   and is annoying for your family, you say, I don't want to do that
[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:06.340]   because technically I could do this and that feels like a waste of money,
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:10.460]   you know, and we have these sort of inconsistencies happening all the time.
[01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:12.540]   Well, here's an activity, you know, a kid's kind of interested in this.
[01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:14.500]   We'll spend thousands on this activity.
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:18.100]   But the idea that we could hire a laundry service,
[01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:20.500]   I could do the laundry technically.
[01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:22.060]   And so now I don't know, I don't want to do that.
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:22.940]   That's somehow a failure.
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:26.100]   In fact, that last one is a point that Laura Vanderkam talks about a lot
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:29.580]   is many more people could and should be outsourcing their laundry,
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:33.780]   but they don't because it's not in this list of psychologically
[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:35.100]   appropriate things to spend money on.
[01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:38.660]   So I think we were weird and we'll spend a huge amount of money on this
[01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:42.780]   and on these things that have a cost in terms of schedule, impact or stress
[01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:45.260]   outside of work where we're very reluctant to spend money.
[01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:47.420]   And I think we should change the thinking about it.
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:49.940]   So I think that's one issue.
[01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:53.300]   The other issue and Sarah talked about this is people don't like giving that advice
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:56.660]   because anytime you talk about investing money in anything,
[01:04:56.660 --> 01:05:00.420]   there's this knee jerk response of not everyone has the money for that.
[01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:02.340]   It's true of everything.
[01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:03.540]   It doesn't mean we shouldn't give the advice,
[01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:05.580]   because for a lot of people, it could be helpful.
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:10.340]   So that's what I would say, John, is look for forget your hourly rate.
[01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:14.020]   What what is the cost in terms of scheduled disruption?
[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:16.140]   What is the cost in terms of stress
[01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:19.420]   and be more willing to invest in that than you might have otherwise been
[01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:22.860]   more willing to invest in optimizing outsourcing that you otherwise might have been.
[01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:26.780]   The final thing I want to say is often the solution here is not financial.
[01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:29.860]   It's elimination.
[01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:34.580]   So you have some sort of set up in your life
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:37.980]   that actually you could just stop doing this.
[01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:41.020]   You could step down from this position.
[01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:44.580]   You could reconfigure the specific teams that your kids are on.
[01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:46.300]   They're like there's some things you could do
[01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:50.180]   that might have a huge win in terms of schedule, input or stress.
[01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:53.900]   And you don't because it's well, there's some some advantage to this
[01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:55.460]   or someone might be disappointed.
[01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:58.260]   And we don't take elimination seriously enough.
[01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:03.940]   But often elimination is is possible and people forget about it two weeks later.
[01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:05.660]   No one cares, but you've had this big gain as well.
[01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:11.700]   So so outsourcing is one way to get rid of these high cost out of work activities.
[01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:12.780]   Elimination is the other.
[01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:15.940]   And they're both things that we don't think enough about.
[01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:19.660]   And so I'm glad you brought this up, John, because I think it's
[01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:22.300]   I think these are both strategies that we're thinking about
[01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:24.420]   organizing life outside of work, we should all think about more.
[01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:28.020]   I love eliminating things.
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:31.500]   My wife actually has to push back on that, but why don't we just stop doing it?
[01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:32.540]   Why don't we just start?
[01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:34.380]   Why don't we just cancel this? Why don't we?
[01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:35.380]   Why don't we do nothing?
[01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:37.740]   And it's a little more complicated than that.
[01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:40.420]   Like kids should be doing things.
[01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:41.260]   Yeah.
[01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:45.260]   But like some sports leagues make your schedule impossible.
[01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:47.860]   And this sports league, they're still playing the sport,
[01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:49.740]   but it's like way more reasonable.
[01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:51.980]   Like, you know, sometimes those type of things.
[01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:54.820]   Having kids play hockey is pretty tough because the ice time is always so like
[01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:56.260]   limited, it's late at night.
[01:06:56.260 --> 01:06:57.420]   It's late at night or early.
[01:06:57.420 --> 01:06:58.220]   Yeah. Yeah.
[01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:00.580]   Hockey, hockey can be a rough one.
[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:03.140]   That's the one advantage of baseball.
[01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:05.820]   Like it can't be played early in the morning, can't be played late at night.
[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:08.860]   So at least, you know, unfortunately, it takes a very long time to play.
[01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:13.220]   Well, it's got soccer, too.
[01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:14.100]   Soccer is pretty good.
[01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:17.020]   Yeah, there's no early morning fields.
[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:18.580]   Rowing is bad.
[01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:20.180]   A lot of early morning.
[01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:23.820]   All right. Next question is from Ruby, a 35 year old banker from London.
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:26.820]   I'm taking a few weeks off to recover from burnout
[01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:29.380]   due to a period where my responsibilities kept increasing.
[01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:33.340]   What would you recommend to do to make the most of my time away from work?
[01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:37.540]   So, Ruby, the productivity perspective here.
[01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:40.620]   Is that if all you do during your time off
[01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:45.260]   is recharge and then just go back into this environment
[01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:48.860]   where you were before, give it six months, you'll be back in the same place.
[01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:54.300]   What is important here, this is what I would do with my time off, is figure out
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:58.500]   what is the productivity framework I'm going to put in place
[01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:03.820]   so that I have clarity into all of the obligations entering my world.
[01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:05.980]   None of it is being held only in my mind.
[01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:06.980]   I am configuring.
[01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:08.340]   I can see what it is.
[01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:10.940]   What type of work do I have at different different parts?
[01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:13.340]   This is the traditional facing the productivity dragon.
[01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:16.100]   And then I control my time on different time scales.
[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:17.860]   Here's what I'm doing today.
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:18.580]   Here's what I'm doing this week.
[01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:21.060]   Here's how these projects fit.
[01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:23.420]   Now, here's the here's the goal here.
[01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:26.700]   Not that with this productivity framework,
[01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:30.660]   you can optimize your time enough that the the workload
[01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:32.380]   that burnt you out before you can now handle.
[01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:33.820]   That's not the goal.
[01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:36.340]   The goal instead is clarity.
[01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:39.140]   Clarity about what's on your plate.
[01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:43.100]   Clarity about what is reasonable to be on your plate.
[01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:48.540]   Clarity about proposing this, this and this makes sense.
[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:51.140]   This, this and this is too much.
[01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:53.980]   The productivity system, a good productivity system
[01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:57.420]   can give you the confidence you need to advocate for yourself.
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:09:01.140]   Now, again, this, I think, is one of the.
[01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:04.060]   One of the insidious side effects.
[01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:07.100]   Of rejecting productivity because you associate it
[01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:10.340]   with this optimization over a culture is that, ironically,
[01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:13.020]   it is exactly what your employer wants you to do.
[01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:13.700]   We think about it.
[01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:15.820]   Oh, no, the productivity is somehow part of this base
[01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:19.820]   superstructure, sort of early 20th century Marxist approach
[01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:24.380]   of of trying to exploit more labor from the from the the
[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:26.220]   the proletariat or something like this.
[01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:28.740]   Right. So we have this sort of grad school, blah, blah, blah
[01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:30.900]   approach to it, actually.
[01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:34.060]   Knowing what you're doing.
[01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:35.740]   Knowing what's on your plate.
[01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:39.420]   Having an extreme clarity about exactly your workplace.
[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:43.980]   Seeing the matrix of the obligations being thrown at you with clarity.
[01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:47.180]   That's actually what in a lot of these overwhelmed situations,
[01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:48.300]   your employer won't want.
[01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:51.580]   Because it means you can come back and say, I know this is crazy.
[01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:53.180]   We need to cut this in half.
[01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:54.140]   Let me tell you why.
[01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:57.020]   You know, I have my arms around everything and I'm very careful.
[01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:59.260]   I run my schedule very careful and I do very good work.
[01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:01.700]   This is 50 percent too much.
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:03.700]   And I have confidence in that conviction.
[01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:07.380]   If you instead fall back into haphazard busyness
[01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:10.900]   because you're trying to reject the the hustle culture, et cetera,
[01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:14.500]   you are at the mercy of these employers.
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:15.620]   It's just all stuff.
[01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:16.300]   We're all busy.
[01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:17.220]   You got a bunch of stuff.
[01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:18.060]   Why aren't you doing work?
[01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:19.660]   Why are you complaining?
[01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:21.380]   You're either going to burn yourself out again and again
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:24.220]   or give them an excuse to fire you.
[01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:28.260]   So productivity can actually be what you need to prevent
[01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:30.580]   and push back against overload, right?
[01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:34.180]   So this is, again, the whole autonomy frame for productivity
[01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:36.980]   is having your arms around your obligations is what allows you
[01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:38.220]   to do so many different things.
[01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:41.060]   And this is one of the things you can do is it allows you to stand up.
[01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:44.180]   It allows you to stand up and say with a clear voice and conviction,
[01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:47.140]   enough, this is too much.
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:49.180]   I know it's too much.
[01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:53.780]   You know that I know that now this is my this is what's reasonable.
[01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:55.940]   And this is what I'm going to do.
[01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:59.180]   And when people know that you have your act together
[01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:01.220]   when it comes to these sort of productivity systems,
[01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:03.580]   it's much harder for them to push back against that.
[01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:04.340]   So that's what I would say.
[01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:07.620]   Rest and recharge, but also get your systems fired up
[01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:09.980]   so that when you come back, you're no longer at the mercy of like
[01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:11.860]   whatever junk your employer is just throwing at you
[01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:14.580]   and hoping you won't notice that it's completely unreasonable.
[01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:17.540]   Yeah, I like what you said at the end of the deep dive, too,
[01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:19.060]   about having options.
[01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:19.940]   Yeah. Yeah.
[01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:21.980]   Productivity is about that's the autonomy frame.
[01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:25.540]   Yeah. If you don't have control over all the different obligations
[01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:30.580]   orbiting you in your professional life, you are at the mercy of whim,
[01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:34.340]   your boss's mood, your personality, what you can get away with.
[01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:36.900]   And basically, we'll probably just be stressed out.
[01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:37.860]   I mean, or you could be OK.
[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:40.420]   Like maybe you just whatever become kind of misanthropic.
[01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:44.100]   And and resentful and people don't want to deal with it.
[01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:45.540]   And you kind of find a way to make it work.
[01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:48.660]   But it's all just you're drifting towards some sort of steady state.
[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:51.300]   That's probably going to be a non-optimal equilibrium.
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:53.140]   But when you know everything that's going on,
[01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:56.100]   you can stand back and say this, this and this is the problem.
[01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:58.900]   And if I move this, I can't do those.
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:00.180]   I got to take this off my plate.
[01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:01.540]   And no, no, no. Of course, no.
[01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:03.060]   Of course, no. Of course, no. Yes, I'll do this.
[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:05.060]   Here's I mean, it just makes all the difference.
[01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:07.540]   You can do so much if you have a good productivity system
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:09.380]   and you can't do almost anything without it.
[01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:12.900]   I mean, you're just left with like I'm burnt out or,
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:18.020]   you know, quitting the workforce and hoping that people subscribe to my sub stack.
[01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:19.620]   There's got to be something in between those two.
[01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:22.180]   All right. Let's keep rolling.
[01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:22.820]   What do we have next?
[01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:27.300]   All right. Next question's from Rito, 23 year old from India.
[01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:29.540]   I have too many interests in my life.
[01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:30.740]   I have so many choices.
[01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:32.660]   It's crippling and I end up doing nothing.
[01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:34.980]   My question is, how do I learn to prioritize?
[01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:39.860]   So, Rito, I included this question because it helps show
[01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:45.060]   that the productivity perspective is also relevant to your life outside of work.
[01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:47.940]   It's also relevant to your leisure life.
[01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:52.820]   So haphazard busyness can cripple you like it's happening here
[01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:56.020]   in your leisure life in the same way that it can in your professional life.
[01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:58.420]   Especially like Rito, you're young, you're 23 years old.
[01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:00.820]   You have all this time and all this potential.
[01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:03.140]   And there's so many different things you can do that you bounce
[01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:05.940]   from one thing to another and nothing's making progress.
[01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:10.420]   Your brain will eventually stop trying to generate motivation.
[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:12.900]   I've written about this before, Rito.
[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:15.060]   What's really happening here, if you want my opinion,
[01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:19.860]   is that our brain is very good at evaluating potential plans.
[01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:21.380]   Is this objective worth it?
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:24.260]   And do I have reason to believe this plan is going to work?
[01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:28.420]   Our brain asks and answers those two questions all the time.
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:29.620]   We're very good at that.
[01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:32.180]   This is something that is bred into our Paleolithic path.
[01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:36.660]   Those mechanisms, when it doesn't trust you really know what you're doing,
[01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:39.140]   when it doesn't trust that there's a plan here that makes sense,
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:43.700]   that's going to lead to some sort of mastery or a highly fulfilling outcome.
[01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:44.740]   It says, nope.
[01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:49.140]   And what does it feel like when your plan evaluation apparatus
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:51.300]   in your brain says, no, it feels like procrastination?
[01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:55.780]   You can't summon motivation because there is a system in our brain
[01:13:55.780 --> 01:13:58.340]   that generates the feelings of motivation towards action.
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:00.020]   It has to believe what you're doing.
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:05.220]   So if your leisure life is crippled with or ridden with haphazard busyness,
[01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:08.340]   it's like, I'm not going to just start this whatever,
[01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:11.620]   buy a video camera to become the next Martin Scorsese,
[01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:12.580]   because you don't know what you're doing here.
[01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:13.220]   There's no plan here.
[01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:15.220]   This is one of like 15 different things you have.
[01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:17.540]   That is why you have this feeling of I can't do anything.
[01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:18.260]   I feel crippled.
[01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:19.540]   It's because it's too haphazard.
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:20.180]   It's too busy.
[01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:23.460]   So you can bring a productivity framework into your leisure life
[01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:27.300]   to get your arms around this, to start to be selective,
[01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:30.180]   to start to be intentional about what you spend your time on.
[01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:33.780]   And in doing so, you're going to end up in a much better place.
[01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:37.380]   So let me give you a particular suggestion here, Rito, just to plant a seed.
[01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:42.900]   So one way you might structure more intentionally your life outside of work
[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:45.540]   would be a four part focus.
[01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:46.580]   I've talked about this before.
[01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:50.260]   Three routines and one project in one time.
[01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:53.700]   So the three routines that just figure out how to have going in the background
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:55.860]   would probably be some sort of fitness health routine.
[01:14:56.820 --> 01:14:59.220]   Uh, this is eating and exercise.
[01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:00.340]   This is foundational.
[01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:01.460]   Let's get that going.
[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:05.220]   Background, some sort of reading routine.
[01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:06.740]   I'm reading on a regular basis.
[01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:08.420]   I'm moving away from just distraction.
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:13.860]   My mind is learning how to actually remain focused on complex thoughts.
[01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:15.540]   You're going to develop as a human being.
[01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:17.380]   You're going to develop as a, as a thinker.
[01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:22.180]   Uh, we did a podcast episode a few weeks ago on how to become a reader.
[01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:23.620]   It was called the joys of the reading life.
[01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:26.820]   It's probably like two 38.
[01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:27.140]   Yeah.
[01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:27.460]   Yeah.
[01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:28.500]   Episode two 38.
[01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:29.940]   So go back and watch that.
[01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:33.540]   Your third routine I would say to put in place foundationally is some sort of community routine.
[01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:38.180]   These things you do on a regular basis that keep you connected and serving your friends,
[01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:40.900]   your family, other people in the communities that you're involved with.
[01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:44.420]   Get background routines for those three things going.
[01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:45.540]   That's just foundational.
[01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:47.780]   You can tweak those, but you should always on a regular basis.
[01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:50.100]   Those things are just woven into the fabric of your life.
[01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:50.340]   Okay.
[01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:52.420]   And then one major project.
[01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:56.740]   And then do that major project until you get to a great milestone that you can swap in
[01:15:56.740 --> 01:15:57.700]   another major project.
[01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:02.820]   So just one major project at a time, spend six months on it, spend a year on it.
[01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:03.700]   I don't really care.
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:04.180]   You're young.
[01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:05.300]   You're 23.
[01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:06.980]   You have more time than you think.
[01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:11.620]   So this is just one particular suggestions of how you might establish a more intentional
[01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:16.020]   approach to your leisure life, but, but having routines for the things that are foundational
[01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:21.620]   to a life well live and then pursuing one thing at a time until a good point, giving
[01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:22.500]   that your full attention.
[01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:24.660]   That for example, works really well.
[01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:29.220]   And it's the type of thing that you're not going to get to until you get more intentional
[01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:29.860]   about your time.
[01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:32.260]   All right.
[01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:33.060]   We're making progress here.
[01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:34.020]   What do we got next, Jesse?
[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:35.620]   I like this question.
[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:40.340]   Next question is from Jonas, a 32 year old research analyst.
[01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:45.060]   I'm trying to decide whether a ditch postpone a side hustle idea in order not to overwhelm
[01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:52.100]   myself versus adopting a slow part productivity mindset and see how progress compounds over
[01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:53.140]   time.
[01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:57.060]   So Jonas, what you need is extreme clarity, and this is where the productivity perspective
[01:16:57.060 --> 01:16:57.860]   is going to help you.
[01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:04.180]   You have to get your arms around the job that's making you feel busy right now.
[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:07.460]   Capture, configure, control, see where you can get that.
[01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:12.580]   You reduce the stress, take control of your time, begin with the configure step to be
[01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:15.060]   more aggressive about workload management.
[01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:18.020]   See where you can get that line in a place that's allowing you to do what you need to
[01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:19.380]   do without feeling overwhelmed.
[01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:24.340]   And then step back and say, where would the side hustle fit?
[01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:26.820]   And answer that question honestly.
[01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:31.220]   And now, Jonas, knowing what I know about you, because in your elaboration, you talked
[01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:34.100]   a little bit more about your busyness and you have a lot of going, a lot of things going
[01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:35.380]   on with your family and young kids.
[01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:41.860]   When you step back, you might say, there is not time for me to execute a reasonable plan
[01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:42.740]   for the side hustle.
[01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:43.220]   And you know what?
[01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:43.860]   That's fine.
[01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:44.820]   Don't do the side hustle.
[01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:47.300]   But you're going to get that answer with clarity.
[01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:50.900]   Or after you capture, configure, control, you might really tame your job.
[01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:55.140]   And so you know what, I could work on this two days a week, three hours in the morning.
[01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:56.340]   It's my remote work days.
[01:17:56.340 --> 01:18:00.020]   Nothing really gets going until noon or whatever.
[01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:02.740]   And this would allow me and here's my plan.
[01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:04.740]   And I could actually make pretty good progress on this.
[01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:07.620]   And then you might find like, OK, now I see exactly where I'm going to work on this.
[01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:09.300]   And I'm looking at exactly where I'm going to work on this.
[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:10.180]   And this is enough time.
[01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:12.020]   And this is worth it enough to me.
[01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:12.660]   Let's do it.
[01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:16.340]   But you cannot get to these answers with confidence unless you really know what's
[01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:19.220]   going on with your current work obligations.
[01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:20.420]   And so that's what I want you to do.
[01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:26.980]   Pull out, capture, configure, control until you are a master of your job.
[01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:31.540]   Then work through what are the reasonable scenarios for me to make progress on the
[01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:33.460]   side hustle and evaluate those.
[01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:34.100]   Will it work?
[01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:36.180]   And is it worth it?
[01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:40.100]   Is where the achievement the side hustle would generate?
[01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:42.180]   Is it worth it for what I would have to do?
[01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:43.700]   And be very honest with you, answer it.
[01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:46.260]   And especially at this stage of life, you have young kids at home.
[01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:47.940]   It's completely fine for your answer there.
[01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:50.340]   Just be no, it's not worth it.
[01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:51.380]   I've controlled my job.
[01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:52.820]   I like having this flexibility.
[01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:57.060]   I want to just use this to do more things in my family or a hobby.
[01:18:57.060 --> 01:18:59.300]   I think that's a completely reasonable solution as well.
[01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:01.780]   But you don't get those options until you know what's going on.
[01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:03.060]   You're just haphazardly busy.
[01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:03.540]   Good luck.
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:07.140]   You're just going to start doing the side hustle that in a way that you don't have
[01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:08.580]   time for that's going to cause stress.
[01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:10.100]   And you're going to let it peter out.
[01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:12.820]   So, again, the productivity perspective here says once you have control, you get
[01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:14.980]   autonomy, autonomy gives you options.
[01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:18.980]   I actually thought when I first read the question, I thought that he had already
[01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:22.020]   started the side hustle and was working on it for a while.
[01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:22.820]   And then--
[01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:23.940]   You know, it's a little hard to tell.
[01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:25.940]   I read the longer one.
[01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:30.500]   He talked a lot about the various things that he was worried about, like his
[01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:30.980]   busyness.
[01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:33.620]   And there definitely was a sense of haphazard busyness.
[01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:37.060]   Yeah, but it was a little unclear if he had started and he was feeling
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:38.180]   overwhelmed by it already.
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:41.860]   Or if he was pretty sure that if I just started this, I'd feel overwhelmed.
[01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:46.820]   I mean, the slow productivity approach, it can work with a side hustle, but you
[01:19:46.820 --> 01:19:47.780]   really got to evaluate it.
[01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:47.940]   Right.
[01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:50.180]   So you could say, like, at some point it's too slow.
[01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:52.900]   If it's I'm going to work once a month, I'm going to have an hour session like
[01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:53.700]   that's too slow.
[01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:54.260]   Yeah.
[01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:58.660]   I mean, to me, slow productivity also involves obsessing over quality.
[01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:00.980]   It also involves the reduction of things.
[01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:02.660]   You can give more attention to something.
[01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:06.820]   It's not just about you can fit another thing into your schedule, because if you
[01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:10.180]   stretch it out long enough, you can find little pockets of time to make progress.
[01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:13.300]   I mean, slow productivity is it's a lot of it's about simplification.
[01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:16.900]   So it can take more of your attention.
[01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:17.300]   Yeah.
[01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:21.940]   Obsession over quality so that you can really come at it again and again.
[01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:23.780]   I think just trying to spread something out.
[01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:25.460]   So you touch it here and there.
[01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:27.060]   It's not really a slow, productive approach.
[01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:29.300]   I think it's just a fragmented approach.
[01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:30.660]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:31.620]   All right.
[01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:33.540]   Let's try to fit in one more question here.
[01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:34.340]   All right.
[01:20:34.340 --> 01:20:37.940]   Next question is from Andrew, 51 year old biology professor.
[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:42.340]   I'm a professor because research production is not a shared goal.
[01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:46.260]   I have difficulty getting my colleagues to think creatively about system changes,
[01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:47.940]   even if we might benefit from it all.
[01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:51.620]   It's always easier to do what is easiest in the immediate moment.
[01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:53.620]   Other folks productivity be damned.
[01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:54.500]   What should I do?
[01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:58.180]   Well, I included this question in part just because I like professor questions,
[01:20:58.180 --> 01:21:04.500]   but it's another good example for us to apply the productivity perspective.
[01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:09.700]   So what Andrew's talking about is the type of collaboration systems I detail and motivate
[01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:14.500]   in my book, A World Without Email, where I talk about in the knowledge work context.
[01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:20.820]   There's many informal collaboration styles that are built mainly around haphazard back
[01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:25.220]   and forth messaging that are actually really unproductive for everyone involved in the long
[01:21:25.220 --> 01:21:29.940]   term, even though in the moment, it's easier just to shoot off a quick email than it is
[01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:33.460]   to actually implement some sort of collaboration system, like whatever.
[01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:35.380]   There's a shared document where the thoughts go.
[01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:37.620]   And on Monday night, I review that.
[01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:39.940]   And then I put the notes using track changes.
[01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:42.260]   And you have till Wednesday, close a business to react to them.
[01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:44.660]   And then we have a standing meeting on Thursday morning.
[01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:49.220]   Those type of systems get you away from constant back and forth messaging, but they're a little
[01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:50.500]   bit more work in the moment.
[01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:55.060]   Andrew is saying, I can't get fellow professors to do this because we're not all working
[01:21:55.060 --> 01:21:56.500]   towards the shared same goal.
[01:21:56.500 --> 01:22:00.340]   It's not everyone in my department is working on getting this new product out.
[01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:01.620]   We're each working on our own thing.
[01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:09.380]   And so we're not that interested in being collectively focused on improving how we collaborate.
[01:22:09.380 --> 01:22:16.980]   So, Andrew, my productivity perspective here is you have to shift the scope that you're
[01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:18.100]   thinking about productivity.
[01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:27.460]   If you are a professor at a research institution, you need to think about yourself as a standalone
[01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:32.100]   business and the other professors in your department and other professors that you interact
[01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:38.340]   with and other departments, you know, the HR department, the whatever, like other, whatever
[01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:41.780]   you would call them, groups within university, like their own businesses with which you have
[01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:43.940]   various professional relationships.
[01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:49.460]   You're Ford and you work with Firestone tires.
[01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:54.020]   They're two separate businesses, but you know, you guys have a contract and a relationship
[01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:57.940]   to get the tires for your car manufacturing plant, but you're not the same company.
[01:22:57.940 --> 01:23:01.060]   So you have to think of yourself almost as like a standalone silo.
[01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:05.060]   So when you're thinking about systems internally is where you're really trying to get a handle
[01:23:05.060 --> 01:23:06.980]   on what is my work?
[01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:07.780]   What do I work on?
[01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:08.660]   What are my quotas?
[01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:09.620]   What do I not do?
[01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:10.820]   When do I get this work done?
[01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:12.340]   How much time do I have available?
[01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:13.700]   How do I want to use this time?
[01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:16.740]   And you're keeping track of all that and have all your complex systems.
[01:23:16.740 --> 01:23:19.620]   Then when you're interacting with the rest of the world, it's well, you have sort of
[01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:23.620]   interfaces with interacting with these other standalone entities.
[01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:26.260]   And I don't know, they're bothering you with emails.
[01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:28.420]   You could just do what you need to do with that.
[01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:32.980]   Just process centric emailing might work there where you never formally develop a new
[01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:35.940]   collaboration system with someone else.
[01:23:35.940 --> 01:23:37.460]   You just sort of tell them in your response.
[01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:38.500]   Yeah, great.
[01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:39.380]   We should think about this.
[01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:43.540]   Put any thoughts you have in this Google doc that I started.
[01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:47.860]   I will review it if I have any questions because you're a professor.
[01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:50.740]   I know you have clearly posted office hours.
[01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:55.140]   I will actually just come to your office hours next week and we'll talk about it.
[01:23:55.140 --> 01:23:58.820]   You just sort of put a process into the communication and there it is.
[01:23:58.820 --> 01:24:00.020]   You're not calling it a process.
[01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:01.060]   You're not negotiating about it.
[01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:02.180]   You're just saying it.
[01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:05.460]   Certain types of work like this is very disruptive.
[01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:08.500]   This person just constantly wants to email things.
[01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:10.100]   OK, I'm not doing that.
[01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:11.860]   I'm not going to work on that person.
[01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:12.740]   I'm going to leave that committee.
[01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:13.700]   You have all this autonomy.
[01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:17.540]   This is like a company saying we're going to get out of selling etsels because there's
[01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:18.420]   not a lot of profit there.
[01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:23.060]   We're going to focus more on, you know, selling Ford focuses or whatever.
[01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:28.020]   You think of yourself like a standalone business that interfaces with other organizations and
[01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:31.860]   you do your best to keep those interfaces as non-disruptive as possible.
[01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:34.420]   So you need to be more ruthless, Andrew.
[01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:35.540]   That's, I guess, what I would say.
[01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:39.620]   Your department is not your team members.
[01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:40.740]   They're your colleagues.
[01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:41.700]   You're collegial to them.
[01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:42.260]   You enjoy them.
[01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:48.020]   But you're all your own standalone entities trying to figure out how to exist in the same
[01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:52.580]   academic sphere while still accomplishing your internal objectives.
[01:24:52.580 --> 01:24:58.020]   So I don't know, maybe it maybe I'm being a little bit Darwinian there, but I think
[01:24:58.020 --> 01:24:59.620]   it's the best academia really is.
[01:24:59.620 --> 01:25:00.980]   It's entrepreneurial.
[01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:03.620]   Yeah, you're trying to produce original research.
[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:04.740]   That's the whole game.
[01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:05.700]   If you don't, you get fired.
[01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:06.420]   That's the whole game.
[01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:08.340]   And you work with other people.
[01:25:08.340 --> 01:25:10.180]   There's other things you have to do and service you have to do.
[01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:13.540]   But but it's just like Ford has these other things they have to do.
[01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:16.100]   But ultimately, if they're not selling cars, they're out of business.
[01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:17.460]   You kind of have to keep that in mind.
[01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:21.780]   Hey, if you like this video, I think you'll really like this one as well.
