[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.840]   Thank you. -- Thank you. -- Thank you for the nice words. -- And I wanted to acknowledge that this summer I spent four months cycling across the US and Europe. As someone in my twenties, through the knowledge you've provided and understanding the value of money, I've been able to put away that time and money and I think that's really unique and I think something that's what I'm going to do next.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.840]   -- I'm going to do next. -- I'm going to do next.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:07.240]   guess
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.960]   Is that your question?
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.180]   Yes, yes.
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.500]   Well, in my mind, I think, first of all, you choose your friends,
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:58.240]   and you choose your friends carefully, and you seek to choose people who are not seeking to take advantage of you.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.980]   And if you are interacting with somebody who is taking advantage of you,
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.360]   or who is trying to take advantage of you,
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:12.300]   then I think you simply speak directly to that, and your actions should reflect that.
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:17.520]   Now, if you're interacting with somebody who's a true friend in the situation that you're describing,
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.780]   and you know that they're not simply a fair-weather friend,
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:20.820]   and you know that they're not simply a fair-weather friend,
[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.860]   and you know that they're not simply a fair-weather friend,
[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.920]   and you know that they're not simply a fair-weather friend,
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.980]   and you know that they're not simply a fair-weather friend,
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:21.240]   and you know that they're not simply a fair-weather friend,
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.260]   and you know that they're not simply a fair-weather friend,
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:50.920]   and you know that they're not simply a fair-weather friend,
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:50.940]   and you know that they're not simply a fair-weather friend,

[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:45.920]   I think power imbalances are entirely unavoidable. There will always be somebody who you have more money than, and there will always be somebody who has more money than you. There will always be somebody who has more money than you. There will always be somebody who has more money than you.

[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:56.740]   wouldn
[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:35.240]  › You're getting a benefit out of it. You're getting your friends to accompany with you. Just make it clear to them. I want to do this because I'm enjoying your company. I don't expect anything from you. This is a free and open-hearted gift. Those are my thoughts.
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:43.320]   Okay. Excellent. Yeah, thank you. That does clear it up a lot. I'll just add a little note.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:53.680]   but
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.220]   I the is
[00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:37.880]  Ã©t.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:37.880]   It is a problem.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:37.880]   That there is this power imbalance, but that's not a problem. I think it's the right. And so one of the things that I do think is good, especially if you're concerned about that, is it's very nice to allow somebody else to make a gesture indicating that they are not beholden to you, even if it's something of a token gesture.
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:13:05.140]   So, you know, let's say that you take somebody out for a nice dinner and it's a hundred dollar dinner. Then in that circumstance, when somebody is taking your, sorry, you're taking somebody else out for a hundred dollar dinner, very fancy, you know, they wouldn't be able to avoid it. It's not, sorry, they wouldn't be able to afford it in their budget. It's nice if you let them pitch something in for the tip or if you give them an out that allows them to maintain their sense of dignity and say, well, I'll tell you what, you know, let's go out for ice cream.
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:05.140]   It's nice if you let them pitch something in for the tip or if you give them an out that allows them to maintain their sense of dignity and say, well, I'll tell you what, you know, let's go out for ice cream.
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:33.300]  , and say, well, I'll tell you what, you know, let's go out for ice cream.
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:33.400]   And you buy the ice cream after, after this expensive dinner.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.400]   It usually will help somebody not to feel beholden to you in that way.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.180]   And I think that it's entirely fine to do.
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:43.220]   And for just for companionship now, and your friend is an honorable person who knows that you're being kind to them, but they don't want to be beholden to you.
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:48.220]   So you invite them out for dinner and then they offer naturally to say, tell you what, let me leave the tip.
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.220]   And you say, no, no, no, you don't need to do that.
[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.220]   And they say, let me leave the tip.
[00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:58.220]   You should protest a couple of times because then they've at least made the gesture that, Hey, let me leave the tip.
[00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:59.220]   They've satisfied that.
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.220]   And if you overcome them by saying, no, this is my, this is my treat.
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:31.260]  , then they'll go ahead and they'll go ahead and just be quiet and appreciate the treat.
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:32.260]   Now, on the other hand, if you, if they really press it, you know, three times, you know, no, let me leave the tip.
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:32.260]   I think you should let them leave the tip because maybe they're solving that particular, that particular need.
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:32.260]   There are people in my life who have been deeply generous with me and I don't like feeling beholden to people financially.
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:32.260]   And I appreciate the generosity. Extraordinaire. I very much do.
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:32.260]   But then I'm not going to be beholden to people who I'm not going to be beholden to me.
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:32.260]   I'm not going to be beholden to people who I'm not to be beholden to me.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:42.300]   And what I will try to do is at times go ahead and without permission, I'll try to make a token gesture to simply show, listen, I appreciate your generosity, but I'm not a freeloader.
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.300]   I'm not a charity case.
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.300]   I'm not asking for anything.
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:51.300]   And so I'll, I'll force the circumstances in some way that allow me to demonstrate that I'm not trying to take advantage of you.
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:15:02.300]   And so, you know, fighting over the tip, I think is the normal thing, but trust yourself, you know, the back and forth is a little silly sometimes, but if the person really insists, let them, let them pay the tip or offer them a tip.
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:02.300]   You know, I think that's a good thing.
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:02.300]   You know, I think that's a good thing.

And so if your wife is actually going to work for the company and she's actually going to perform duties for the company and engage in product, then if she's actually going to work for the company, then what you say can work. And so the key needs to be being able to say, "Hey, is this person actually working for the company?"
[00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:50.900]   It's like a little bit more sophisticated, but it's a little bit more sophisticated.

[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.100]   That's the work that my children are going to do.
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.340]   They're going to help me with filing my papers.
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:29.540]   And the temp agency would say, "We would charge you $15 an hour,"
[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:32.580]   or whatever the actual price is that they would say.
[00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:35.140]   Then I would take that estimate, I would get an estimate from them,
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.740]   and I would put that in my tax files,
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:40.940]   and I would say, "This temp agency is giving me an estimate
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:44.180]   "of charging me $15 per hour for them to send over
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:46.380]   "an office worker to file my papers.

[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:21.220]   and I'm going to pay them $15 an hour."
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:21.220]   But I'm substantiating it based upon what the market rate is.
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:21.220]   And this is basically how most things work,
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:21.220]   is you want to substantiate the pay that somebody is receiving based upon the market rate.
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:21.220]   Now, obviously, different markets will have different rates, and some market rates are easier to establish than others.

[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:34.240]   So a self-settled trust is not a separate entity for tax purposes. The taxes all flow through. But usually that type of trust is a self-settled trust. And so a self-settled trust is a trust that you contribute assets to and you're a beneficiary of. So a self-settled trust is not a separate entity for tax purposes. The taxes all flow through. But usually that type of trust is a self-settled trust.
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:36:04.260]   So in that case, you have to be in one of those states. And the downsides of domestic asset protection trust seems to be there's a minimum amount of settled law of case law that's been established. And you have to be in one of the states that recognizes that a self-settled trust has asset protection features to it. You can go offshore. But the challenge with going offshore is frequently that you have to be in one of those states that recognize that a self-settled trust has asset protection features to it. You can go offshore. But the challenge with going offshore is frequently
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:34.280]  .
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:34.280]   It's not necessarily that you will pay substantially higher fees and those may not be necessary to you, especially if you don't have a current threat that has materialized. An offshore trust, the biggest benefit of an offshore trust is the you'd establish the persons in the trust to be in an entity that doesn't recognize U.S. law. So the most famous jurisdiction here is a trust that's based in the Cook Islands. The Cook Islands is big and the most famous jurisdiction here is a trust that's based in the Cook Islands.
[00:36:34.300 --> 00:37:04.300]   So if you hire a trustee for your trust that's based in the Cook Islands, if somebody wants to sue that trust, then they have to actually go to the Cook Islands. They have to hire a Cook Islands attorney. Their lawsuit has to be admissible under the law of the Cook Islands. They have to reach a much higher level of proof in their case. So for example, in civil cases, one of the challenges for asset protection is in order to win a civil case, somebody has to be in the Cook Islands.
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:04.300]   The Cook Islands attorney has to be admissible under the law of the Cook Islands.

[00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:46.740]   in my opinion, that really is

[00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:38.720]   where somebody had early onset Alzheimer's,
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:39.680]   early onset dementia,
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:41.900]   some kind of ongoing chronic illness

[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:42.840]   and so I think it's at least reasonable to say it's possible that we might have significant health care costs from an extended illness that are not paid for by health insurance.
