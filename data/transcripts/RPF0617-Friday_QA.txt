[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.520]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while

[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.520]   My name is Joshua, I am your host, and today on the show, we do live Q&A.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.360]   You get to call me up, ask me any question, make any comment, we can talk about whatever
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.480]   you want to talk about.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.560]   That's what a live Q&A show means.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:17.460]   A couple of quick notes as we begin these shows, or as I begin today's show, these shows
[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.400]   are entirely driven by you and what you would like to talk about, which means sometimes
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.800]   they work out really well, and sometimes they don't.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.880]   I do my best to keep the content moving along, I do my best to deal with the calls, but I
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.920]   just simply take them in the order that they come in.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.960]   I don't pick and choose, I don't sell some people they can't call in, I just take them
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.520]   in the order that they come in.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.160]   A couple of notes, you will notice if you look in the notes on your podcast listening
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.080]   device, you will notice that I have put in to those notes the different questions and
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.920]   topics along with some time stamps.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.320]   If there's a call that's just simply not interesting to you and you want to just skip forward,
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.320]   go ahead and feel free to do that.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.360]   It won't offend me one bit, but I do my very best to keep things concise and focused on
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.360]   the specific questions.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.160]   I hope you're enjoying the variety of these Q&A calls.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.960]   We begin with Dan in Alberta, Canada.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.960]   Dan, welcome to the show.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.960]   How can I serve you today?
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:14.000]   First, I just wanted to say thank you for providing such a diverse and unique set of
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   advice and just being yourself without conforming to the mainstream.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.920]   I just really, really appreciate that.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.920]   My pleasure.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.760]   Thank you for the nice words.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:33.080]   And I wanted to acknowledge that this summer I spent four months cycling across the US
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.080]   and Europe.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:43.240]   As someone in my 20s, through the knowledge you've provided and understanding the value
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.520]   of money, I've been able to put away that time and money.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.600]   I think that's really unique and I think something that a lot of people don't have the skills
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.480]   to realize what's possible.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.800]   So I remember you mentioned traveling in one of your shows and how really what you want
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.800]   to do is travel.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.080]   You can hop on your bike and ride and that's what I did and it was really an experience.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.760]   What did you learn on your trip and how is it impacting your life now?
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:19.640]   Well, the first thing that jumps out is the value of companionship.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:26.560]   When planning the trip, I was focused mostly on biking because I just really enjoy cycling
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.560]   and traveling.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:34.080]   But yeah, about three weeks in, I kind of realized that I've been alone for three weeks
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.720]   on the road on my bike.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.040]   And yeah, really started to appreciate people a bit more.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.560]   Yeah, that has always been my experience traveling alone as well.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.680]   There seem to be certain personality types that thrive on it, but anytime I've traveled
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.200]   alone I've never enjoyed it as much as when I have been with people that I enjoyed being
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.200]   with.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.200]   So go ahead with your question for today, Dan.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:09.080]   So to phrase it generally is how to give and share effectively.
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:18.840]   And a more specific example is when I do travel with friends, I work hard to save money to
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:27.720]   do this traveling and I can understand that my friends might not exactly be able to afford
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.920]   the same things or want to afford the same things that I can.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:40.480]   So if I'm asking a friend to join me to do something and finance is a barrier to them,
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.960]   how can I approach paying for them?
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.880]   Because for me, it's definitely worth my money to share that experience with them.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:58.440]   However, if they can't afford it, how can I share with them without having a power imbalance
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:06.720]   where they feel like they owe me something or just sharing effectively, if that makes
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.720]   sense.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:15.160]   So your concern then is you're traveling with a friend and you want to have a peak experience,
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.080]   something that's going to cost money.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.720]   And you feel, you know that you would love to have them go with you on this peak experience
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.680]   that's going to cost money, but you know it's not in their budget.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:33.320]   And so you're trying to figure out how to magnanimously or magnanimously, anyway, with
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.940]   magnanimity you're trying to figure out how to simply say, "Listen, this is a treat on
[00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.300]   me in an appropriate way."
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.300]   Is that your question?
[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.300]   Yes.
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.300]   Yes.
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:50.020]   Well, in my mind, I think first of all, you choose your friends carefully and you seek
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.100]   to choose people who are not seeking to take advantage of you.
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.900]   And if you are interacting with somebody who is taking advantage of you or who is trying
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:07.300]   to take advantage of you, then I think you simply speak directly to that and your actions
[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.020]   should reflect that.
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.900]   Now if you're interacting with somebody who's a true friend in the situation that you're
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.420]   describing and you know that they're not simply a fair weather friend, somebody who's trying
[00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.860]   to take advantage of you just while things are good, then in my opinion, just make it
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.260]   clear to them and simply say, "This is a treat," and do it simply and easily.
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:33.820]   I think the best way to do it is to just simply speak clearly about the subject and to say,
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.220]   "I would like to do this and I'd like to take you with me.
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.740]   I'd like to buy this ticket for you.
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.660]   Are you willing to come with me?"
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:40.660]   And make it clear to them.
[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:41.660]   There are no strings attached.
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.940]   I'm not trying to do anything.
[00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:49.540]   I just want to do this for you as an act of generosity so that we can enjoy this experience
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.700]   together.
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:57.140]   And if you just simply do that, then I think you will have... if you do it and you state
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:02.620]   it and you make it clear to them, you can avoid a lot of problems.
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.020]   The key thing is for you to clarify it up front.
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.860]   I have... there are people, for example, there are people that in my life, when they invite
[00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.860]   me to do something, I'm very cautious to understand the full situation.
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.900]   So they might say, for example, "We'll go here and I'll pay for this."
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.940]   Meanwhile, I know that there are other associated expenses.
[00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.060]   So I need to know, "Okay, if you're inviting me, are you inviting me and you're going to
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:29.580]   pay for the ticket, but then I'm going to pay for the meals, I'm going to pay for the
[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.020]   lodging, et cetera."
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.540]   I need to know the full budget going in.
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:37.420]   So one thing you can do as the wealthier party is make it clear to them what they can expect
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.700]   to pay for.
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.740]   When I invite people to do things, I like to take people shooting, for example.
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:44.740]   It's fun.
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.340]   I like to take all my liberal friends that don't own guns and don't ever shoot guns,
[00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.340]   I like to take them shooting.
[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.620]   It's super fun.
[00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.620]   And what I try to do is I try to make it clear to them what the expenses are going to be,
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:58.500]   because somebody who's never gone shooting doesn't know what the expenses are going to
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.500]   be.
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.260]   So if they're going to use my guns and I'm going to pay for the range fees, I do that,
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.340]   but then I give them a budget.
[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.220]   If they're going to be paying for ammo and I'm going to do that and have them do it,
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:11.180]   I tell them, "Here's how much you can expect to pay for ammo or for targets," or if I'm
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.620]   going to provide those things, I make it clear.
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:19.340]   And so when you're inviting somebody to do something that they're not sure about whether
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.980]   or not they're going to be able to do, and if that person is in a financial situation
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:27.620]   where they need to know and to budget those expenses, then you can really do a good job
[00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:32.900]   by just simply being explicit with all of the costs and what they could expect to pay
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.980]   for and not pay for.
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:35.980]   That's on your end.
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.340]   So I think first, if you look for the friend and make sure that you're dealing with people
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:43.140]   who are – they would be your friends if you did nice things for them or not, and then
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:47.420]   number two, then you are clear with them, you can do a really good thing.
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:52.220]   And I've had so many people in my life who have been economically generous with me when
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:56.100]   I didn't have money, and I so appreciate what those people have done.
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.980]   Now to the topic of a power imbalance.
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.180]   There's always a power imbalance in life.
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:06.180]   One of the things that really bothers me about a lot of kind of modern philosophical reasonings
[00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:12.780]   is people think that somehow you can get rid of power imbalances, that somehow you can
[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:19.380]   eliminate any difference between people that would lead to a power imbalance.
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:24.460]   And usually, unfortunately, the way that people try to eliminate a power imbalance is not
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:29.220]   usually by strengthening the person who is weaker, but often it's by tearing down the
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.900]   person who is stronger.
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.400]   I think power imbalances are entirely unavoidable.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.620]   There will always be somebody who you have more money than, and there will always be
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.900]   somebody who has more money than you.
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:44.140]   There will always be somebody who is bigger than you, and there will always be somebody
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.600]   who's smaller than you.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.500]   There will always be somebody who's smarter than you and somebody who's dumber than you.
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.060]   There will always be somebody who's more attractive than you are and somebody who's less attractive
[00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.100]   than you are.
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.460]   So we're all going to live in a life of imbalance.
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:03.320]   And so from that perspective, it's your job and your responsibility to cultivate the character
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:09.120]   and virtue not to impose coercion or manipulation on other people.
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.420]   So let me use a simple example.
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.620]   I am a physically large person.
[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:18.000]   There are very few people who are physically larger than I am.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.060]   So of course there's an obvious power imbalance of me compared to other people who are different,
[00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.860]   different in physical size.
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:31.360]   But does that make my size somehow wrong or a bad thing?
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.140]   Only if it's not guided in an appropriate way.
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:39.500]   So my size can be a very good thing if I use it for virtuous and upright and righteous
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.500]   ends.
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:46.340]   If I use my size to defend somebody who is smaller, to stand up to a bully, to stop some
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.900]   wrong that's happening, then that's a good thing.
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:54.420]   If I use my size for coercion against another person and I try to bully them or I try to
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:59.700]   physically force them or to intimidate them in some way, then now that's a bad thing because
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:04.300]   I'm expressing that coercion which individuals ought not to do.
[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.300]   And so I would just say that's your job.
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:11.580]   Just because you're richer than your friends doesn't mean automatically that you're going
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:15.200]   to exert a wrong power over them.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.980]   It just means you have a choice and you want to be careful that you're not manipulating
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:19.980]   them.
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.000]   And so you're getting a benefit out of it.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.220]   You're getting your friends to accompany with you.
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.860]   Just make it clear to them, "I want to do this because I'm enjoying your company.
[00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.140]   I don't expect anything from you.
[00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.420]   This is a free and open-hearted gift."
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.420]   Those are my thoughts.
[00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:32.420]   >>Toby: Okay, excellent.
[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.420]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:34.420]   That does clear it up a lot.
[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:44.180]   I'll just add a little note of sometimes as a response, people have valued their own kind
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:52.620]   of financial independence in terms of like they don't feel comfortable accepting gifts
[00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:53.620]   all the time.
[00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:58.820]   Is that their right to hold on to that value?
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:06.860]   Or do you think there might be some room for me to kind of explain how you explained it,
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:12.580]   to kind of see things more from my perspective, that there is this power imbalance but that's
[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.380]   not a problem?
[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.860]   >>Steven: I think it's their right.
[00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:22.060]   And so one of the things that I do think is good, especially if you're concerned about
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:30.380]   that, is it's very nice to allow somebody else to make a gesture indicating that they
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:34.740]   are not beholden to you, even if it's something of a token gesture.
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:41.780]   So let's say that you take somebody out for a nice dinner and it's a $100 dinner.
[00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:45.940]   Even in that circumstance, when somebody is taking, sorry, you're taking somebody else
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:50.300]   out for a $100 dinner, very fancy, you know they wouldn't be able to avoid it.
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.460]   Sorry, they wouldn't be able to afford it in their budget.
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:58.220]   It's nice if you let them pitch something in for the tip or if you give them an out
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:03.340]   that allows them to maintain their sense of dignity and say, "Well, I'll tell you what,
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:07.540]   let's go out for ice cream and you buy the ice cream after this expensive dinner."
[00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:12.580]   It usually will help somebody not to feel beholden to you in that way and I think that
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:13.940]   it's entirely fine to do.
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:18.820]   Now usually, in my opinion, the way to do it is to give them a chance.
[00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.380]   So let's use dinner as an example.
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:26.380]   You're feeling flush, there's a really nice restaurant that you really love going to and
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:34.780]   you want to invite a good friend of yours along for company and for just for companionship.
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:38.100]   And your friend is an honorable person who knows that you're being kind to them but they
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.900]   don't want to be beholden to you.
[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.700]   So you invite them out for dinner and then they offer, naturally, to say, "Tell you what,
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.320]   let me leave the tip."
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.100]   And you say, "No, no, no, you don't need to do that."
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.860]   And they say, "Let me leave the tip."
[00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:53.500]   You should protest a couple of times because then they've at least made the gesture that,
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.740]   "Hey, let me leave the tip."
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:59.620]   They've satisfied that and if you overcome them by saying, "No, this is my treat," then
[00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:05.180]   they'll go ahead and just be quiet and appreciate the treat.
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:10.980]   Now on the other hand, if they really press it three times, "No, let me leave the tip,"
[00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:14.740]   then I think you should let them leave the tip because maybe they're solving that particular
[00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:16.740]   need.
[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:21.900]   There are people in my life who have been deeply generous with me and I don't like feeling
[00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.860]   beholden to people financially.
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:27.900]   And I appreciate the generosity, extraordinary, I very much do.
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:33.180]   But then what I will try to do is at times go ahead and without permission, I'll try
[00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:38.060]   to make a token gesture to simply show, "Listen, I appreciate your generosity, but I'm not
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:39.060]   a freeloader.
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.060]   I'm not a charity case.
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:41.420]   I'm not asking for anything.
[00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:46.340]   And so I'll force the circumstances in some way that allow me to demonstrate that I'm
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.480]   not trying to take advantage of you."
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.020]   And so fighting over the tip, I think, is the normal thing.
[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.740]   But trust yourself.
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:57.020]   The back and forth is a little silly sometimes, but if the person really insists, let them
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.660]   pay the tip or offer them, tell you what, you get the beers afterwards or you get the
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:04.940]   cigars or you get the ice cream or whatever the next thing is, give them a chance to show
[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.420]   that they're not a freeloader.
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.420]   Okay.
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.460]   Thank you very much.
[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:11.020]   I really appreciate that advice.
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:12.020]   My pleasure.
[00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:15.380]   And congratulations on what you experienced with your traveling.
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.600]   I'll repeat it for anyone who wants to know.
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.100]   Traveling doesn't have to cost money.
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:23.020]   If you want to travel, walk out your front door, turn right and start walking.
[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.540]   You're traveling officially.
[00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:28.540]   You can walk across the country, you can bike across the country, you can walk around the
[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.620]   world and you don't need a lot of money to do it.
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.880]   Now, of course, many people by traveling mean other things.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.460]   So design what your ideal method of traveling is and go from there.
[00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.460]   We move to Mark in Texas.
[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.460]   Mark, welcome to the show.
[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.980]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:43.980]   Thank you, Joshua.
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.180]   I really appreciate you taking my question.
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:50.980]   Also, I highly appreciate all the great content you put out.
[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:54.460]   I've definitely benefited from it.
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:59.020]   My question is concerning a 401k.
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:11.340]   I am a VP of a small company and I recently was setting up our new 401k for all of our
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:12.340]   employees.
[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:16.560]   And my question is regarding that.
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:24.120]   After setting it up, I had a good conversation with the owner of our company and he was okay
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.780]   with this idea.
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:32.980]   But I am more concerned about if there's any issues with it concerning the IRS or anything
[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:33.980]   like that.
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:43.220]   It's my understanding that you can, a company can pay any employee that it wants to, no
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:48.500]   matter what type of work the employee is doing.
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.520]   It's all based upon the company's decision.
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:17:01.060]   So in a scenario like that for a 401k system, if I am working for a company as a VP and
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:11.380]   if I had the company going forward, any yearly bonus or really it's more any yearly, excuse
[00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:21.100]   me, any change in my salary, any increase in my salary going forward, if I was to have
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:28.700]   the company put that in my wife's name, not my name directly going forward for the cause
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:38.100]   of having a greater 401k limit so I could put more money in a 401k, I wanted to understand
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:44.020]   if there's any issues that the company would have in the future by doing that.
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.980]   My wife has done some work for the company.
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:50.340]   She is not a full-time employee for the company.
[00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:56.220]   So I wanted to know kind of your thoughts on that type of strategy.
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:02.220]   What kind of dollar amounts are we talking about here?
[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:14.180]   So obviously my plan in the future would be able to fully maximize two 401k amounts.
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:17.020]   So I guess it's 18.5 right now.
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:23.140]   So going forward, that would be my plan or my desire to see that happening.
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:27.860]   So give me a ballpark.
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:31.780]   What is your current compensation, your total compensation from the company that you are
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:32.780]   a VP of?
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:33.780]   Okay.
[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.460]   So it's a small company.
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:40.460]   My total compensation would be right around $100,000.
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:45.320]   And when your wife has done work for the company in the past without thinking about how her
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:52.820]   compensation would be structured, how much was she paid by the company?
[00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:59.340]   That was solely based on whatever project, it was per project that she was working on.
[00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:07.500]   So it could be anywhere around 500 to a thousand, just depending upon the contract per se.
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:11.220]   And how many projects did she do in the past per year?
[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.220]   Very limited basis.
[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:15.220]   So a few thousand dollars then?
[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.020]   Yeah, very limited.
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:25.180]   Now, of course that could change going forward, but I'm more interested so that way it's a
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:26.580]   consistent thing.
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:29.440]   Any increase in my salary goes straight to her.
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:35.300]   And so that would help us to have the two 401k limits to utilize.
[00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:36.300]   Understood.
[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.300]   Understood.
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.300]   Okay.
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:43.620]   So what I'm just trying to narrow focus in on is what things have been in the past, because
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:52.140]   there is, you have to fall in, in your work, you have to come in under virtually, basically
[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.420]   reasonable compensation.
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:20:02.420]   Now that word reasonable will depend on what's actually happening and who and how things
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:03.760]   are working.
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:07.580]   So my first obvious answer should be, this would be a good question for an accountant
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:10.500]   who is familiar with the local laws of your state, who works on your company's books,
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:11.500]   et cetera.
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:12.660]   And I can help you think it through.
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.900]   And we have the benefit of my not being an accountant, not being supervised for that.
[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:19.380]   So we can kind of say, is there a straightforward way to make this happen?
[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:27.700]   So if you were to, if your wife were to work for the company more and be paid a higher
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:31.940]   salary, so the goal would be that she'd be able to earn at least $20,000.
[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:36.300]   So she could make basically a full contribution to the 401k.
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.180]   Are there services that she can actually provide to the company?
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:42.180]   Is there work that she can actually do to the company?
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.340]   Or is she just never going to show up?
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:53.060]   Yes, there is different projects that she can potentially work on.
[00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:56.100]   And will your compensation go down?
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:21:01.740]   Is that the idea that your salary, your total compensation of $100,000 would go down because
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:06.540]   of trying to adjust some of the salary over to your wife?
[00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:07.540]   Or would hers be a different?
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:08.540]   No.
[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:09.540]   No.
[00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:10.540]   No.
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:15.260]   My thought process was simply any increase, yearly increase would go over.
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:21.140]   So mine would stay level and any increase would go towards her.
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.140]   Right.
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:27.380]   So let's start with what the law would say as best I understand it.
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:34.020]   There is a doctrine, and I'm not a competent enough accountant to perfectly identify it
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.180]   or to identify the court case.
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:42.300]   But there was a court case at least probably a century ago in which a high income earning
[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:48.500]   professional, a high income earning, I don't remember exactly what case he was and I could
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.300]   look it up for you, or you could look it up.
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:22:01.100]   But a high earning income professional was trying to get the money.
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:05.980]   He was basically saying, "Hey, all the income is coming in but giving it to his wife."
[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:09.420]   I can't come up with the name of the court case, so I apologize.
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:13.740]   But in so doing, it went to the, I think it went to the US Supreme Court and it was ruled
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:19.900]   that no, the person who earns the income has to be the one who reports it and who pays
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:20.900]   the tax on it.
[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:28.180]   So if the question is this, the question is I'm working earning $100,000 per year, can
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:39.060]   the company "hire" my wife and pay her $30,000 a year and she doesn't show up to work, she
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:44.900]   never comes into the office, she never does any projects, she never writes an email, she
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:50.940]   doesn't have a corporate email account, et cetera, can they hire my wife and then she
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.740]   can make a 401k contribution?
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:56.020]   The answer is no, they can't.
[00:22:56.020 --> 00:23:05.540]   And if you think about why, that's basically creating a non-defensible deduction for the
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:09.020]   company in terms of them deducting the employee wages.
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:13.900]   And if you could do that, if you could actually do that, it would be the basis of all kinds
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.780]   of tax fraud, at least under the way that the US tax code system works.
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:24.660]   Because under that same circumstance, I could hire my wife and I could hire all of my children
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:29.260]   and I could hire my brother and my sister and my parents, I could hire everyone in my
[00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:37.460]   family, pay them all a $30,000 per year salary, I would create virtually an unlimited business
[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:41.100]   deductions, like I could hire as many people in my family as I need to, now the business
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:45.700]   can deduct those wages and then with those incomes coming to them, yes, they would pay
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.820]   personal income taxes but at those rates it wouldn't be much.
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:53.780]   So you can't do it if the "hire" has to be in air quotes.
[00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:58.620]   You can do it if they are legitimately hiring somebody.
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:03.340]   And so if your wife is actually going to work for the company and she's actually going to
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:09.300]   perform duties for the company and engage in products, then if she's actually going
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:13.580]   to work for the company, then what you say can work.
[00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:18.140]   And so the key needs to be being able to say, "Hey, is this person actually working for
[00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.140]   the company?"
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:25.980]   Now in that context, then I think there is substantial room for the business owners to
[00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:30.220]   choose how much they pay her, to choose how they structure her compensation, to make those
[00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:31.460]   choices.
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:38.940]   And so there's so much of a range of how much would be paid for different products and different
[00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:43.820]   services and the things that different people would do that the IRS doesn't have the ability
[00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:48.420]   to say, "One person has to - you have to pay this amount of money."
[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:53.100]   So usually what you would do is for most - if you're hiring somebody who's a relative or
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:57.580]   a close friend, something like that, for most things it's good to get a market survey of
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:00.220]   what's happening in the local employment marketplace.
[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:04.740]   If I were going to hire my children to work for me in my business, then I would call up
[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:11.560]   a temp agency and I would say, "How much would you charge me to send over a temporary worker
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.020]   to help me with filing?"
[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:18.380]   If that's the work that my children are going to charge me for - that's the work that my
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:19.380]   children are going to do.
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.380]   They're going to help me with filing my papers.
[00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:26.420]   And the temp agency would say, "We would charge you $15 an hour," or whatever the actual price
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.580]   is that they would say.
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:31.660]   Then I would take that estimate, I would get an estimate from them, and I would put that
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:37.420]   in my tax files and I would say, "This temp agency is giving me an estimate of charging
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:42.400]   me $15 per hour for them to send over an office worker to file my papers."
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:47.060]   So now I'm going to hire my child to work for me and they're going to file my papers
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:50.740]   and I'm going to pay them $15 an hour.
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:55.300]   But I'm substantiating it based upon what the market rate is.
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:26:01.060]   And this is basically how most things work, is you want to substantiate the pay that somebody
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.820]   is receiving based upon the market rate.
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:09.740]   Now obviously, different markets will have different rates, and some market rates are
[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.740]   easier to establish than others.
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:16.900]   Let's say that your wife is hired to do public relations for the community, and one of her
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:22.620]   major jobs is to work as an Airsats lobbyist, where she goes around in the community and
[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:25.660]   she goes to the morning breakfast meetings and markets your business.
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:29.220]   Well, how do you choose how much to pay somebody for that?
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:32.180]   A lobbyist can make millions of dollars or very little money.
[00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:35.780]   And so those kinds of things, there's a lot more flexibility.
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:41.300]   So in summary, I would say this, yes, I think that that arrangement can work, and I think
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:47.420]   that you could work it out with your employer for them to hire your wife and to pay her
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:52.740]   substantial compensation so that she can participate in the 401(k).
[00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:57.020]   And I think that can work out for you and for her and for your employer.
[00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:06.100]   What I would do is make sure that all of the dots are, I's are dotted and the T's are crossed,
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:10.940]   where you actually, she has an email address for the company, she works for the company,
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:16.460]   she shows up on certain days or she makes business correspondence, she files some form
[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:19.140]   of report to the employer about what she's doing.
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:23.220]   If she's not, if her job and her function is not to come into the office, she needs
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:27.980]   to file activity reports, she needs to send in some form to actually substantiate that,
[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:31.380]   yes, she is a legitimate, bona fide employee of the company.
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:36.660]   Now within that, I think you have enough creative license to make it work for you, for her,
[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:42.140]   and for the company, but you can't just do it without those actual facts being there.
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.140]   Is that clear enough, Mark?
[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:45.820]   Yes, that's perfect.
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:49.860]   I really appreciate that because that gives me some clarity on to make sure it's structured
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.380]   properly.
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:54.740]   And so that's really helpful, and I do fully understand.
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:55.740]   Good, good.
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:28:01.900]   So as long as you're following basically the spirit of the law, then I think you will be
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:03.020]   in good shape.
[00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:09.980]   And within that, I think you have enough license, just as any business has with their employees,
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.540]   to make things work for you.
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:12.980]   We go now to John in Pennsylvania.
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:13.980]   John, welcome to the show.
[00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:14.980]   How can I serve you today?
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:15.980]   John, are you there?
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:16.980]   Sorry about that.
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:17.980]   Yep, John, you're back.
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:18.980]   Okay, go ahead, John.
[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:19.980]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:20.980]   Thanks for taking the call.
[00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:21.980]   Yeah, I have two questions if you have time for them.
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:39.580]   First one is, after hearing the asset protection series you just went through, I kind of had
[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:44.300]   some new concerns about some money that I had in various accounts.
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:53.700]   I had about $450,000, some of it, a good portion of that, about $300,000 in brokerage accounts
[00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:58.340]   and about $150,000 in other bank accounts.
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:04.380]   And I may soon be coming into another $100,000 that will probably go into one of those brokerage
[00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.060]   accounts or bank accounts.
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:08.460]   And I have this money just kind of not doing a whole lot.
[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:13.940]   The brokerage accounts are, of course, invested, but the other ones are just, I guess, they're
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:14.940]   accessible.
[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.660]   It's accessible money is the first reason I have it there.
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:25.580]   It's money I could live off of for a number of years if I lost my job or whatever or just
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.980]   chose to take off for a number of years.
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:35.580]   And especially the money in the non-invested accounts, they kind of give me like a mental
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:38.900]   hedge against being more aggressive in my other investments.
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:43.460]   So they serve some purposes, but now I'm looking at them in another light, which is they're
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:48.620]   very exposed as far as not being protected assets.
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:54.100]   And I was just wondering if you had some other ideas on if I have all my other things, the
[00:29:54.100 --> 00:30:01.380]   easy things like the IRAs and the 401(k)s correctly listed with their beneficiaries
[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:03.460]   and all the other things you had described.
[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:09.500]   For money that's not in protected accounts, what kind of things would you suggest?
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:15.220]   Or is asset protection kind of not something that's so far worth it that you want to kind
[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:17.900]   of make the tail wag the dog?
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:18.900]   You know what I mean?
[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:19.900]   All right.
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:21.820]   Well, you'll have to make that judgment.
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:29.660]   Certainly, asset protection strategies will cost you money, and that's the problem with
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:30.660]   the analysis.
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:38.980]   I don't know the answer in terms of when you're saying, "How do I judge my risk?"
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:49.180]   For somebody who's not in a high-profile occupation, for somebody who's not out and in the front-facing
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:54.700]   function of some kind, for somebody who's not a politician or a business owner or a
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:31:00.500]   doctor or some kind of thing where there's higher risks, for somebody who doesn't have
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:06.740]   a high-risk lifestyle, they don't own an aggressive, vicious dog, or they don't drive their car
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:12.140]   too fast, then is the actual risk all that high?
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.500]   Probably not, but how do you know?
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:21.140]   I've seen enough evidence that people are targeted for having deep pockets, and I've
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:28.340]   seen enough evidence of real cases that are brought against people that I'm not confident
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:30.500]   like I would like to be about that question.
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:33.500]   So I think it is worth considering.
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.380]   But how much is it worth considering?
[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.380]   That's the question.
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:37.420]   How much money should you pay?
[00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:41.940]   If you have half a million dollars that's exposed, how much should you pay?
[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:44.540]   Would you pay $5,000 to protect half a million dollars?
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:46.380]   I think most of us would.
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:49.820]   That seems really reasonable, because for somebody who has a half a million dollars,
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:52.340]   $5,000 is not all that much.
[00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:57.020]   Would you pay $50,000 to protect $500,000?
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:58.540]   That's hard to say.
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:03.900]   You would have to say, "Well, I've got some substantial risk that I'm concerned about."
[00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:07.340]   And where those numbers line up are very different for each person.
[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:10.100]   So I don't know how to answer that question.
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:15.940]   What I do know is if you are aware of the strategies that exist for you, and if you
[00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:19.980]   are aware of the things that you can do, then you can think about it, and you can take the
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:25.260]   actions that will help you in that context.
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:27.980]   So let's talk just very briefly.
[00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:31.500]   I'll just give you a couple of ideas, because I will do more shows on asset protection and
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.860]   some of the more advanced strategies, but that starts to get where I get out of my area
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:40.620]   of expertise, and I don't want to make any terminal errors there in my advice.
[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:44.340]   And so usually I'm going to refer you to somebody who is an attorney in your state.
[00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:46.480]   But I would say this.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:50.220]   When you look at your money and you think about what do you actually want to do with
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:56.020]   the money, then you can think about how to protect it.
[00:32:56.020 --> 00:33:02.460]   So in many of the things that we have talked about, the entities and such, you can use
[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:07.300]   those entities and they'll benefit you no matter what.
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:11.420]   The ones that I like to talk about are what we've talked about so far on the show.
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:15.900]   I haven't talked about college accounts, but in your state, college accounts may be protected.
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:20.180]   And so some parents can just move the money into a college account.
[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:25.900]   I really like, for some of those safer dollars, I really think life insurance is a good, useful
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:26.980]   scenario.
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:33.020]   So you go through all of those different accounts and you kind of cover those.
[00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:34.980]   Now then you go back and say, "Well, I've still got the money."
[00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:35.980]   So what do you do now?
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:41.620]   Well, I think this is where you do definitely move into an entity, either a business entity,
[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:48.220]   such as a limited liability company, or a family limited partnership, limited liability
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:54.380]   partnership, whatever you're going to establish, or you move into a trust.
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:59.620]   And I think that you can design those things in a way that is inexpensive enough to work
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:00.620]   for you.
[00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:04.900]   Example, let's say that you enjoy trading your money.
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:09.220]   Well, in that situation, you can establish an LLC.
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:13.460]   It's a flow-through entity, so we're not going to make any tax changes here, but you
[00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:19.700]   can establish an LLC that allows you to trade your money, but yet the assets become, you
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:24.940]   make a contribution to that LLC and the assets become the property of the LLC.
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:30.720]   And so now, instead of your brokerage account being held in your personal name, now it's
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:35.540]   a business that you are a director of, and you can easily set that up with substantial
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:36.860]   protection.
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:41.860]   I think at this stage of your wealth, you certainly should seriously consider a trust.
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:45.820]   The challenge here will be to figure out how to get a trust that is cost-effective.
[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:51.220]   And so you basically have a couple ways that you can do this.
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:55.620]   Usually in the asset protection world, you'll hear people talk about a domestic asset protection
[00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:59.500]   trust and/or an offshore asset protection trust.
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:07.620]   And so when you look at these options, if you set up a domestic asset protection trust,
[00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:13.220]   there are, I think, something like 13 states that do have legislation that allows a self-settled
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:16.740]   trust to have asset protection.
[00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:20.540]   So a self-settled trust is a trust that you contribute assets to and you're a beneficiary
[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.540]   of.
[00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:26.740]   So a self-settled trust is not a separate entity for tax purposes.
[00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:31.780]   The taxes all flow through, but usually that type of trust doesn't give you any kind of
[00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:33.580]   asset protection planning.
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:40.140]   And so in that case, you have to be in one of those states.
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:44.660]   And the downsides of domestic asset protection trust seems to be there's a minimum amount
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:50.180]   of settled law, of case law that's been established, and you have to be in one of the states that
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:56.000]   recognizes that a self-settled trust has asset protection features to it.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:02.140]   You can go offshore, but the challenge with going offshore is frequently that you will
[00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:06.660]   pay substantially higher fees, and those may not be necessary to you, especially if you
[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:13.140]   don't have a current threat that has materialized.
[00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:19.520]   An offshore trust, the biggest benefit of an offshore trust is you'd establish the persons
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:23.860]   in the trust to be in an entity that doesn't recognize US law.
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:28.500]   So the most famous jurisdiction here is a trust that's based in the Cook Islands.
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:31.820]   The Cook Islands is big in the trust business.
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:35.980]   And so if you hire a trustee for your trust that's based in the Cook Islands, if somebody
[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:40.820]   wants to sue that trust, then they have to actually go to the Cook Islands, they have
[00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:46.540]   to hire a Cook Islands attorney, their lawsuit has to be admissible under the law of the
[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:53.780]   Cook Islands, they have to reach a much higher level of proof in their case.
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:58.020]   So for example, in civil cases, one of the challenges for asset protection is in order
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:02.660]   to win a civil case, somebody just simply has to meet the preponderance of evidence
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:07.020]   standard, basically a 51% chance that the person is guilty, not the criminal standard
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:10.020]   in the United States of beyond a reasonable doubt.
[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:13.180]   But you can move your trust assets into a jurisdiction that requires the proof of a
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:14.700]   case beyond a reasonable doubt.
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:20.260]   So you start to stack up all of these features of an offshore trust, and you have major protection,
[00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:25.900]   major legal protection for your trust.
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:27.820]   The downside is all that stuff costs money.
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:30.900]   So I think if you're going to have an offshore trust, what seems to make the most sense to
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:34.780]   me is establish a domestic trust that is portable.
[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:41.500]   So you establish a domestic trust, and then you put into your trust documents a design
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:47.780]   that says if the beneficiary of the trust, which is you, if you are facing a significant
[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:53.260]   legal threat, then this trust jurisdiction is going to be changed from the United States
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:55.680]   to an offshore jurisdiction.
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:03.640]   And so you can maintain a trust with lower costs inside the United States, and then when
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:08.620]   a legal threat materializes, at that point in time, your trust moves offshore, so you
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:10.620]   get the benefits of the offshore trust.
[00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:22.860]   And by doing it in that way and funding the trust in advance, you don't run afoul of the
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:27.020]   fraudulent transfers or fraudulent conversion legislation, so it keeps your assets safe,
[00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:34.100]   but it keeps your costs down.
[00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:37.040]   And that's the real challenge.
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:41.820]   And so when you start to put these benefits of an offshore trust together, in my opinion,
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:44.100]   that really is the best solution.
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:51.740]   There really is an ultimate solution that's really good for most people, but you've got
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:53.260]   to manage the cost.
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:39:00.220]   Now you'll have to look into it, and you have to assess your actual risk, you have to assess
[00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:06.900]   what you can do, and you'll need to get competent legal advice from an actual attorney who can
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:09.380]   set those things up for you.
[00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:11.420]   But that's my best answer for you.
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:16.220]   And by the way, there are other things that you can do in the United States.
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:21.580]   So for example, one of the concepts that intrigues me is if you're in a stable marriage relationship
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:26.340]   and you have a good relationship with your wife, and you're not concerned about the potential
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:31.580]   of divorce especially, there's a trust that you can set up called a Section 541 Special
[00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:40.700]   Power of Appointment Trust that basically is a domestic trust with low costs in it,
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:44.420]   and that can work really well inside the United States.
[00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:47.500]   So there are other options, but you've got to go and consult an attorney.
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:49.620]   Let me stop going on and just stop with that.
[00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:51.700]   Is that helpful at all?
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:53.380]   Yeah, that's very helpful.
[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:54.380]   I appreciate it.
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:59.620]   I was kind of looking more towards things like trusts, or I don't think umbrella insurance
[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:05.980]   is the same kind of asset protection that we talked about, but these trusts and the
[00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:10.220]   things you had mentioned about life insurance was what I was really curious about, but it's
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:12.460]   good to get the overview of what those things are.
[00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:17.220]   And I don't, at this point in my life, I don't engage in a whole lot of risky behavior, and
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:23.580]   the older I get, the more so that is.
[00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:29.540]   And I also keep a pretty low profile in a lot of regards, and I was more concerned about
[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:38.500]   an unfortunate bad car accident or something that you just can't control that's out of
[00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:40.620]   the blue that puts a lot of stuff at risk.
[00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:45.220]   I think in a very backup situation where, obviously, if I hurt someone, I'd want to
[00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:49.340]   settle that and take care of that, but in a backup situation, you had also mentioned
[00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:55.060]   just going to buy property in Florida as a last minute thing, which is kind of just tumbling
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:56.060]   in the back of my head.
[00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:58.500]   But yeah, nothing on the horizon now.
[00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:01.060]   I'm just kind of a worrywart about this stuff.
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:02.060]   Right, right.
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:03.060]   Yeah.
[00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:04.620]   And it's hard to not ... I have no idea how to solve that.
[00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:10.300]   I'm an extremist by nature in almost everything in my life, and so I always go to the hardcore
[00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:12.060]   extreme.
[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:16.540]   I want the ultimate protection, but I always do try to qualify that.
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:21.100]   The ultimate protection is usually inconvenient and expensive, and you have to say, "What's
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.740]   this worth at this phase of my life?"
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:25.740]   I want to make one comment on insurance.
[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:28.980]   Don't think that you don't need insurance.
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:33.780]   An umbrella liability insurance policy is some of the absolute cheapest protection you
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:34.780]   can buy.
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:36.820]   So I haven't gotten to talking about insurance.
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:41.060]   I tried to just start with kind of low-hanging fruit of exemptions in the series, but definitely
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:42.700]   insurance has a place.
[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:47.900]   And insurance is usually your very best first form of defense, making sure that you pay
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:50.100]   for proper insurance.
[00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:52.540]   Your cars, your liability coverage should be high.
[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:55.200]   Your house, your liability coverage should be high.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:59.260]   You should have an umbrella liability policy that coordinates with policy limits that are
[00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:03.620]   on your car insurance and your home insurance, and that umbrella liability insurance will
[00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:06.060]   be high, should be high.
[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:08.180]   That is your absolute cheapest form of defense.
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:13.780]   It'll be much cheaper for you to do that than to go and establish various asset protection
[00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:14.780]   trusts.
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:19.460]   So if you haven't done those, do those, and I'll cover insurance in the future.
[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:26.780]   But don't think that you don't need insurance, because that is a lot cheaper than setting
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:28.940]   up new trusts.
[00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:29.940]   One more comment.
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:37.600]   The basic function of trusts and other forms of entities is to do your best to unbundle
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:41.340]   the rights of property.
[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:44.620]   So one of the things that lawyers deal with when they're in law school is they try to
[00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:46.940]   figure out what is property?
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.540]   How do you actually define property?
[00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:49.980]   And there are, of course, different definitions.
[00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:55.660]   But one of the definitions that I hear asset protection attorneys write about and talk
[00:42:55.660 --> 00:43:00.700]   about is that you can think of property as a bundle of rights.
[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:02.100]   It's certain rights.
[00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:07.220]   And so what you can do, what you try to do, is to unbundle the rights.
[00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:09.420]   Typically we hold all the rights ourselves.
[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:18.700]   But if you can unbundle the rights of property, you can keep the rights that give you the
[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:25.300]   beneficial use and enjoyment of property while moving the ownership rights over into a protected
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:26.300]   entity.
[00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:28.100]   So simple example.
[00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:29.100]   Your car.
[00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:32.500]   What rights of property do you have in your car?
[00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:36.120]   Well, the two biggest, most important ones would be right of ownership, the right to
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:40.900]   sell it to somebody, to own it, and then the right to drive it.
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:44.500]   But you don't have to hold both of those things personally.
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:51.180]   You can move your car, can be owned by a business that you own, and then you can just simply
[00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:52.500]   have the right to drive it.
[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:56.660]   It doesn't change anything about your personal rights in the property because a business
[00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:57.660]   owns it.
[00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:01.780]   So a lot of asset protection planning strategies, that's the basis of what you're doing.
[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:05.180]   In my example about trading, let's say that you're actively involved in stock trading.
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:11.660]   Well, you can establish a trading company that allows you to continue having ownership
[00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:14.820]   of those assets, sorry, control over those assets.
[00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:19.140]   You can choose the investment decisions that are made in that trading entity.
[00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:22.260]   But now the ownership of those assets has been moved to a company.
[00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:28.540]   And so a claim against you will also then have to go to the assets of that LLC.
[00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:31.980]   And in the assets of that LLC, if you set things up properly, you don't have to make
[00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:32.980]   distributions.
[00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:34.520]   You can hold the distributions inside the entity.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:41.380]   So if you think about what you're trying to protect, you can work it out, but you need
[00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:44.300]   to get legal counsel on that, competent legal counsel.
[00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:46.220]   John, you said you had two questions.
[00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:47.700]   Go quickly to the second one, please.
[00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:50.340]   Yeah, no, I appreciate that.
[00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:55.660]   I'm looking forward to talking about insurance for the asset protection because that actually
[00:44:55.660 --> 00:45:00.780]   does dovetail into my next question, which is you say that insurance is some of the cheapest
[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:06.540]   protection you can get, which is both on insurance I was thinking about and also something I've
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:09.900]   been sleeping on for years and I really ought to do it.
[00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:15.860]   And I was just kind of hoping to get reconvinced that a simple term life insurance is very
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:20.220]   cheap protection because even though it's very cheap, I don't see a whole lot of need
[00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:26.380]   for it considering my wife and I, if something was to happen to one or the other of us, we
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:30.960]   could still make do, although it would be more stressful.
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:35.580]   We just haven't seen the value in paying $1,000 or $2,000 a year for term life insurance,
[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:40.900]   even though I'm told by everybody and I think even by you in the past that it really is
[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:44.620]   cheap insurance and I haven't been able to convince myself to pull the trigger on it.
[00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:46.820]   Well, I may not be able to convince you either.
[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:52.260]   I'm sure that I'm biased just because of my personal experience as an insurance agent.
[00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:58.220]   And one of the things I've observed is people who have a certain experience, it changes
[00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:03.260]   their perspective and it's hard to, you know, physicians sometimes start to manifest all
[00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:08.180]   the symptoms of illness that their patients have, but it's not because they actually had
[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:11.460]   the illness, it's because they're around all the time and they thought they had the illness.
[00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:17.220]   So life insurance agents I'm sure have a predilection to say, "Well, you're going to die so you
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:22.040]   should have life insurance," because we file death claims where many people don't do that.
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:28.540]   Let me just give you one simple point on something like life insurance and how it can bring in
[00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:33.020]   to the world of asset protection, even just term insurance where you're not building up
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:37.520]   cash values, you're not trying to protect money that you have inside of a policy for
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:40.620]   your benefit, just term insurance.
[00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:41.620]   You may not need it.
[00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:44.620]   All right, there's a good chance that you might not need it.
[00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:50.500]   If you have enough assets that you're financially independent, then you are effectively self-insured.
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:54.860]   But what you should consider is you should ask yourself the question, "Are there risks
[00:46:54.860 --> 00:47:00.100]   that I might face that could wipe out my assets before I die?"
[00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:11.460]   And I would say two big risks here are unpaid for health costs, actually three big risks.
[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:15.140]   Number one is unpaid healthcare costs.
[00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:18.900]   Number two is unpaid long-term care costs.
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:29.340]   And number three would be unpaid personal living expenses during extensive disability
[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:31.620]   due to sickness.
[00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:35.660]   And when I look at something like term life insurance, I always think about how well that
[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:39.620]   can protect my family against risks like those.
[00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:47.620]   Now, if you have the world's best health insurance that's not connected to your job or that would
[00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:51.460]   be portable in the case of your job, and if you have enough money to be able to pay for
[00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:55.740]   that health insurance under the continuing coverage provisions of the policy if you were
[00:47:55.740 --> 00:48:00.340]   separated from your employment, then maybe all of your health insurance, your healthcare
[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:02.260]   costs would be paid for.
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:06.100]   But most of us don't have a Cadillac policy like that, or most of us don't have enough
[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:09.300]   money that we could actually pick up those premiums if we were separated from employment
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:10.980]   due to extended illness.
[00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:16.580]   And so I think it's at least reasonable to say it's possible that we might have significant
[00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:22.380]   healthcare costs from an extended illness that are not paid for by health insurance.
[00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:24.180]   Number two, long-term care.
[00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:28.540]   Most people don't have long-term care insurance and/or they don't have unlimited long-term
[00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:30.740]   care insurance policies.
[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:35.940]   And so if something happened where somebody had early onset Alzheimer's, early onset dementia,
[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:43.020]   some kind of ongoing chronic illness that led to their having substantial health costs,
[00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:49.580]   then in that situation they would have additional expenses that would drain the family assets.
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:51.720]   And then the third thing would be living expenses.
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:55.580]   If you add those first two together and then somebody faces something like an extended
[00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:59.900]   illness, it's not unreasonable to think that they would go through money pretty quickly,
[00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:06.820]   paying for living expenses and healthcare costs due to hospital care or long-term care.
[00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:09.660]   Now is that a catastrophic situation?
[00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:10.660]   Guaranteed.
[00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:11.860]   No, it's not.
[00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:15.480]   It's absolutely not a catastrophic situation, guaranteed.
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:21.180]   Somebody who's a sound and wise financial manager would find ways in that situation
[00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:22.740]   to do their very best.
[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:26.860]   And they would probably be able to leave their spouse with assets still that their spouse
[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:29.420]   would be okay in the case of their death.
[00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:35.340]   But if I were in that situation, would I feel really good about having $5 million of term
[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:37.260]   life insurance in force?
[00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:44.520]   That I knew that even if we spent every dollar on my care, every dollar on my hospital expenses,
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:48.340]   and if we took money from savings and we traveled the world to kick all our buckets off our
[00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:54.540]   bucket list before I kicked the bucket, would I feel really good knowing that my wife would
[00:49:54.540 --> 00:50:00.460]   be entitled to receive that $5 million of life insurance payout upon my death, which
[00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:03.060]   would completely replenish my estate?
[00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:08.220]   And would I feel really good about knowing that that life insurance payout would be not
[00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:12.360]   subject to the attachment of my estate's creditors?
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:18.540]   So that even if I racked up a million dollars of healthcare, of hospital bills, even if
[00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:22.900]   we racked up all kinds of credit card debt and we fell behind on our mortgage, et cetera,
[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:28.060]   that $5 million would be there to completely reset my wife's financial situation.
[00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:33.420]   And I could establish that $5 million and keep it completely free of claims of any creditors.
[00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:38.400]   And I could do that for a measly couple thousand bucks a year if I need $5 million of coverage.
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:42.140]   In my mind, that's the kind of risk reward payoff where you look at something like term
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:45.540]   life insurance and say, "Man, that's a powerful tool."
[00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:46.540]   Now do you need it?
[00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:47.540]   I don't know.
[00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:54.260]   But I got to say, that's a powerful tool and it's a lot cheaper than maintaining a trust
[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:55.260]   in the Cook Islands.
[00:50:55.260 --> 00:51:00.980]   Yeah, no, that's kind of exactly the kind of thing I was hoping to get a perspective
[00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:01.980]   on.
[00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:02.980]   I really appreciate it.
[00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:05.660]   It's a good defense of it and good pitch for it.
[00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:06.660]   So thank you.
[00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:07.660]   I appreciate it.
[00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:08.660]   My pleasure.
[00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:09.660]   All right, got two more callers on the line.
[00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:10.660]   We go now to back to Texas.
[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:11.660]   Texas, welcome to the call.
[00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:12.660]   How can I serve you today?
[00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:13.660]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:14.660]   Good morning, Joshua.
[00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:17.660]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:18.660]   Good morning.
[00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:19.660]   Go ahead.
[00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:20.660]   Hi, yes.
[00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:25.100]   I'm just listening to your recent call in about Roth IRAs.
[00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:26.100]   I have a question.
[00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:32.780]   My wife and I have been working to get out of debt, kind of following the Ramsey plan.
[00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:40.140]   And we'll be receiving a large sum of money, not large, but a lot of money in the next
[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:42.700]   month to pay off our debt.
[00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:47.300]   And so my next step is to build an emergency fund.
[00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:54.020]   Kind of my target goal was $10,000, $12,000, three to four months of expenses.
[00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:57.540]   My question is, though, I don't currently contribute to a Roth IRA.
[00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:05.940]   So my question is, can I wait until the April filing deadline to establish a Roth IRA for
[00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:15.140]   2018 and should I do that considering a limited amount of savings at this time?
[00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:17.220]   Yes.
[00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:21.260]   So if you're going to continue, which I'm not trying to dissuade you from, but if you're
[00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:26.940]   going to stay focused on paying off your debt, stay focused on your debt snowball, keep that
[00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:33.740]   same focus there for yourself of getting out of debt.
[00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:35.020]   So get out of debt.
[00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:41.500]   Now with additional money, if your major focus is, or your major goal and hope is to have
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:46.780]   that money available as an emergency fund, I think making a Roth IRA contribution is
[00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:48.900]   a great place for that money.
[00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:54.100]   But what I would do is, to be clear, I would open a Roth IRA account.
[00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:57.940]   You can choose whatever custodian you want, but of course, choose a low cost and convenient
[00:52:57.940 --> 00:53:00.260]   custodian that you want to work with.
[00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:05.620]   Make the contribution to the Roth IRA, but don't invest the money.
[00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:11.060]   Keep it in a cash account, a money market account, some kind of cash or cash equivalent
[00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:15.420]   account so that it is not subject to market risk.
[00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:17.860]   And you're living in Texas, right?
[00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:19.060]   Yes, sir.
[00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:20.060]   Okay.
[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:26.140]   So in Texas, you get the benefits of state protection for Roth IRA assets, also IRA assets
[00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:28.900]   from an asset protection standpoint.
[00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:38.300]   And yes, you can make your 2018 Roth IRA contributions anytime up until the tax filing deadline for
[00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:42.640]   your 2018 taxes, which is April 15th or thereabouts.
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:48.740]   So yes, what I would do is I would open a Roth IRA account for one for you and one for
[00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:50.940]   your wife if you don't have one open currently.
[00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:56.200]   I would make the contribution to that account and then earmark the contribution as being
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:54:03.900]   for your 2018 contribution in hopes that you can, by the end of the calendar year 2019
[00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:09.740]   or by the end of when you file your 2019 taxes, you can save additional money for your 2019
[00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:13.220]   contributions and just keep the money in cash as your emergency fund.
[00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:17.780]   And then if you need the money out, you just simply take a distribution back out.
[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:21.580]   There's no tax consequences, but work really hard, of course, not to do that.
[00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:24.480]   Work really hard, just keep it there as an emergency fund.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:25.480]   Okay.
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:33.120]   And then once I get into a better cash position, I can move that money in the Roth IRA from
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:39.440]   a money market account to equities that I want to invest in after I have a better cash
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:40.520]   position?
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:41.520]   That's right.
[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:47.000]   So whenever you reach the point at which you have enough cash to feel like you have a fully
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.480]   funded emergency fund.
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:51.640]   So let's say you reach six months of expenses.
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:57.200]   Once you have six months of expenses in cash, and that cash could be in your Roth IRA, or
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:01.000]   it could be in a savings account, or it could be in physical currency that you keep under
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.680]   your pillow, or it could be in some other place.
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:08.280]   Once you reach the point that you have your six months of expenses, then go ahead and
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:15.000]   start earmarking your investments and investing your money, investing the money that's beyond
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   that, move it from the cash account over into an investment account.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.080]   And you can do that within your Roth IRA.
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:23.480]   Okay, great.
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:24.880]   Right.
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:32.240]   And so in your calculations, you're obviously focusing primarily on having stability of
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:35.560]   the money, and you're thinking a little bit about the asset protection.
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:40.600]   But if you do start to develop cash in other sources, then you do want to make sure, since
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:46.040]   cash is lightly taxed, you only pay tax on whatever interest you're receiving, then you
[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:52.640]   do want to make sure that you do your investing, your highest growth investing in the most
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:56.780]   tax favorable account, which will be most likely your Roth IRA.
[00:55:56.780 --> 00:56:01.720]   So don't go and open a brokerage account, keep all your cash in the Roth IRA.
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:06.520]   You want to make sure your highest growth investments are in your best tax advantaged
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:07.520]   account.
[00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:10.480]   But on the way there, I see no reason for you not to use the Roth IRA, because if you
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:15.120]   don't use it by the tax filing deadline, you'll never be able to get those 2018 contributions
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:16.120]   back.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:17.400]   Go now to, let's see, what is it?
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:19.240]   The Evergreen State, State of Washington.
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:22.400]   That's your state motto, right?
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:23.400]   That is correct.
[00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:24.400]   How are you, Joshua?
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:25.400]   This is Ben.
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:26.400]   Welcome, Ben.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:27.400]   Welcome to the show.
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:28.400]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:29.400]   Thank you.
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:32.960]   Hey, I've been doing pretty well with my finances this year.
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:39.200]   I've got my 401k maxed out, and I have a little bit of cash left over.
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:43.560]   Think about buying myself a nice vehicle.
[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:50.520]   I had budgeted between $30,000 and $35,000, but a couple of days ago, you mentioned that
[00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:56.720]   instead of someone buying a new vehicle, why don't they put that towards some sort of investment
[00:56:56.720 --> 00:57:03.640]   and then have that monthly profit go toward paying for something else instead of buying
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:06.240]   a new vehicle outright with no debt.
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:12.200]   So what I was wondering, I need to get my creative juices flowing, and what type of
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:15.760]   investment could that money go into?
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:18.320]   Any type of investment that would provide you...
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:25.880]   So would you, if you had an investment of $35,000 value that was paying you out money,
[00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:31.400]   would you be comfortable with taking out a car loan or some version of that and making
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:33.440]   a monthly payment on it?
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:34.440]   No.
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:35.440]   Okay.
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:43.320]   So that's the only way that the idea that I said really works, because otherwise, you'll
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:51.880]   need to generate enough investments that you have enough money that you could just save
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:55.280]   for two or three months and then go back and buy the car that you're trying to buy.
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:58:00.480]   In my little example, let's pretend this.
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:05.200]   In your local real estate market, are there condos or something like that that you could
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:12.840]   buy in the vicinity of $35,000 or mobile homes or something like that?
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:13.840]   Mobile homes, yes.
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:18.560]   Condos, that'd be a decent down payment, but I would still have to get a mortgage after
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:19.560]   that.
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:20.560]   Right.
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:21.560]   So let's use real estate.
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:25.840]   I like to use real estate because it's more intuitive for people than dealing with dividends
[00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:30.880]   on stocks or capital gains on stocks, just because real estate is straightforward.
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:33.400]   We understand it more than we do stocks.
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:39.400]   But if you could go and you could buy a couple of mobile homes for $35,000, and if those
[00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:44.600]   mobile homes were rented out, you paid cash for them, you would look at your cashflow
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:49.320]   from those mobile homes, your rents, and of course, you need to look at your net rents
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:54.000]   after you pay your lot fees and whatever you're paying for your expenses.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:58.240]   But you would look at those net rents from your mobile homes and you would say, "Oh,
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:05.480]   look, I have here, I don't know what number to use, but I have $350 a month of net rents
[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:07.120]   from my mobile homes that I own."
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:10.880]   Let's say I could buy two mobile homes, rent them out for 500 bucks a month, $1,000 of
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:16.640]   gross rents coming in, and then by the time I pay my lot fees, rent service, any debt,
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:19.920]   if you did this with a condo and you had a mortgage, by the time you service any debt,
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:24.800]   the goal is say, "Can I create profit of $300 or $350 a month?"
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:32.040]   Then with that $350 a month profit, you go buy a car, you finance all of the $35,000
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:38.120]   of the car, and your monthly payment on that car is $350 per month.
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:43.000]   So fast forward, let's say it's a 60-month loan on the car.
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:47.840]   You use a long-term loan because you're lining it up with your cashflow, so you finance it
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:48.840]   on a 60-month loan.
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:54.240]   Well, at the end of the 60-month loan now, if all goes according to plan, then you now
[00:59:54.240 --> 01:00:02.080]   have a paid-for car and you have mobile homes that are still paying you $350 a month net
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:04.840]   profit or whatever your real estate investment is.
[01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:06.320]   That's the concept.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:10.800]   And so in an economy like the United States of America, where there is abundant access
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:15.580]   to debt capital, which is very different than many places in the world, where you can find
[01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:19.520]   all kinds of people just falling all over themselves to try to lend you money, you can
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:23.040]   set up something like that situation.
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:28.280]   And if all goes according to plan, it should work out really well because you buy an investment
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:34.140]   asset that gives you cashflow, and then instead of just putting that cashflow in the bank,
[01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:39.960]   you can then use that cashflow to buy the consumption item.
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:42.080]   Does that make sense as far as the concept?
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:48.220]   Yep, yeah, as far as the concept, that makes sense and gives me a little bit more of an
[01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:51.040]   idea of how creatively to go about this.
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:56.520]   I enjoy right now having my car paid off, no car loan, but that wouldn't really matter
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:02.560]   if I have that money coming in to pay off that long-term loan like you described.
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:03.560]   Right.
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:09.600]   So I wanted you to just recognize the key words I said were, "If all goes according
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:10.600]   to plan."
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:17.080]   And the reality is many times, the best laid plans of mice and men, blah, blah, blah.
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:19.280]   So things can go not according to plan.
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:23.960]   And so here's where you should look at your affairs and try to make sure that you're being
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:30.880]   careful, prudent, conservative, doing your very best to make sure that you'll be in good
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:35.940]   shape to not, so that your plans don't all go crazy.
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:41.480]   So first thing is you should have money, you should have additional savings on hand.
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:46.760]   Do you currently have more than $35,000 of saved money?
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:48.160]   Yes.
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.200]   Good.
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:55.960]   So if you additionally have an emergency fund or additional savings, then it's not imprudent
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:02:00.740]   for you to either spend the $35,000 on a car, nor is it imprudent for you to go and buy
[01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:03.320]   a $35,000 investment asset.
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:08.440]   Because if you over here in your savings account have another $20,000, then if your tenants
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:13.880]   don't pay or they burn the mobile home down, or you have to evict them, or tax rates are
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:18.500]   raised, whatever, all the stuff goes wrong with your investment plan, then you still
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:23.200]   have enough money where you should have enough time to make your payments on the car without
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:27.680]   things going wrong, and you should still be able to do that.
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:31.440]   Then of course, you would look at your financing and you say, "How can I finance this car in
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:33.840]   the lowest cost, lowest risk way?"
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:38.600]   So that might be going down to Toyota Financing Corporation, or it might be buying the car
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.560]   with a cash advance on a credit card.
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:45.280]   You look at that and you calculate the options, and the goal is to say, "How can I have the
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.360]   lowest cost, lowest risk loan?"
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.880]   And then you have to figure out, "What can I actually invest in?
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:51.440]   What would I actually buy?"
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:56.040]   And so I don't know if mobile homes in your area are a good investment or not, but you
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:03:01.360]   might be better served by buying a $100,000 condo, putting down a $35,000 down payment
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:07.160]   on that $100,000 condo, and you might still, if all goes according to plan, net enough
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:09.600]   from that condo to pay your car payment.
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:15.200]   But the basic goal is to say, "How can I get my investments to pay for my consumption items
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:19.240]   rather than just spending all my money on my consumption items?"
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:20.840]   Okay.
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:23.760]   That put it very clearly.
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:24.760]   Thank you.
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:25.760]   Thanks for explaining that.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:30.480]   If you will think like that, then as time goes on, your wealth can continue to grow
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:33.280]   and your consumption can continue to grow.
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:38.160]   Now you may or may not finance things.
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:40.040]   You may or may not use debt.
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:41.500]   You may or may not do that.
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:42.500]   That's up to you.
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:47.240]   But if you will think that way and always try to find your investments before your consumption
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:52.600]   items and then make your investments pay for your consumption items, then you have a lifetime
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:55.200]   of consumption items available to you.
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:04:00.920]   Because once you own that asset, pretend you can buy a condo, and that condo will pay you,
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.960]   let me wrap up the numbers.
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:09.380]   Let's say once you own a $75,000 paid-for condo, that condo should pay you enough to
[01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:13.640]   pay a car payment every single month for the rest of your life.
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:18.120]   And so you could lease a car every month for the rest of your life, always be driving a
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:23.000]   brand new car, trading it in every two or three years for a new lease payment.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:28.560]   And basically, your cars are virtually free in a sense because they're being paid for
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:30.880]   by your investment assets.
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:33.700]   That's the basic process of wealth building.
[01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:34.700]   That's what we do.
[01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:37.760]   And so you have to analyze your situation, look at your income opportunities, look at
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:40.360]   your investment opportunities, look at your business opportunities.
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:47.360]   But before you go and buy a toy, look to see, is there some way that I can use that toy
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:48.360]   to get the best deal?
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:50.960]   And then, of course, finally, I'll say this.
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:56.960]   Anytime you buy a toy or buy a consumption item, look, of course, to buy it in the most
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:02.560]   efficient way possible, get the best deal, get the lowest price, get the best financing
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:04.580]   terms, whatever you're going to do.
[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:08.640]   But then also look to say, can I make this thing make more money for me?
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:11.640]   Can I make this thing do more for me?
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:17.440]   So maybe that means with your new car, you say, well, I don't have enough money.
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:22.500]   For some people, I don't have enough money to buy a condo, but I'm going to buy a new
[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:24.360]   car or another car.
[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:29.000]   But let me make sure I'm going to go and drive this car two weekends a month for a ride share
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.040]   service and make enough to pay my car payment.
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:34.040]   Many people could do that.
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:38.440]   And it's probably the best use of those kinds of companies, like driving for Uber, Lyft,
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:39.440]   et cetera.
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:40.840]   They don't work well as full-time occupations.
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:41.840]   The pay is too low.
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:45.760]   But for somebody who wants to just simply make a car payment, they can do that.
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:51.200]   Or look at it and say, if I'm going to buy this car, how can I buy this car in a business
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:57.560]   that I've created that would allow me to depreciate it or to expense my miles in a bigger way?
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:01.920]   So to look at every way that you can to try to maximize the value of it, and when you
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:06.600]   start putting all those things together, then again, you can have a lifetime of increasing
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:11.040]   wealth and decreasing and in good solid consumption over time.
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:12.040]   That's it for today's show.
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:15.720]   If you would like to join for another Q&A show, keep an eye on the schedule that I have
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:16.720]   been publishing.
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:19.160]   I hope you'll join me in the future.
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:27.880]   And in closing, I would say, let me again, mark it to you my credit card course, radicalpersonalfinance.com/creditcardcourse.
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:32.800]   One of the things that the way that this applies to the call that we've just heard is how do
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:34.240]   you finance the car?
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:41.880]   And one of the benefits of a credit card is you have a fairly low payment in terms as
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:46.100]   compared to the actual value of the debt.
[01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:54.560]   And so your monthly payment on a credit card balance is 1% of, usually it's 1% of the total
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:58.720]   value of the loan plus the previous month's interest payment.
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:05.000]   And so sometimes you can use a credit card payment and get lower payments on debt, which
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.200]   can help you if you are in a situation where everything's not going well.
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:12.920]   So there are numbers that would be too big.
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:15.360]   I don't know what Ben's income is.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:21.520]   I don't know what those scenarios are, but I wouldn't be scared to buy a car using credit
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:27.520]   cards because it gives me more wiggle room sometimes than a car payment does.
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:32.240]   It'll be easier for me to adjust, pay less on my credit card payment sometimes than it
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:33.960]   would be on a car payment.
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:37.440]   So that's the kind of application that you could use with the concepts that I've talked
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:40.800]   about in the credit card course.
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:44.920]   Or additionally, you could use credit cards as a form of backup financing so you have
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:49.120]   more wiggle room if your tenant did move out and if they burned down your mobile home in
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:51.220]   those situations.
[01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:55.480]   If you ever take out financing, you always want to think about how to make sure that
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:59.160]   if everything goes wrong, the loss is not catastrophic.
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:03.040]   If everything goes wrong with your investment, if everything goes wrong with your car, how
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:06.760]   do I make sure that I have plenty of wiggle room so I can solve those problems and have
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:08.440]   room to work my way back?
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:12.200]   And part of that involves making sure that if you borrow money, you borrow it in the
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:13.560]   most intelligent way.
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:14.840]   So understand how credit cards work.
