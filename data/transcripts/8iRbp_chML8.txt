[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Welcome back to the podcast on this Friday.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Pastor John is back with us in the studio,
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   and no theme runs through your writing and speaking
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   more consistently than the truth that God is most glorified in us
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   when we are most satisfied in Him.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   It's the Watchword of Christian Hedonism.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   And now you've written this new book,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   "Come, Lord Jesus, Meditations on the Second Coming of Christ."
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   It's a beautiful book. I have it in hand.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   And today I want to hear what you learned during the process.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   You've said many times that you make discoveries as you write.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Back in APJ3, the third episode we ever did, you said,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   "Writing for me has become a way of seeing."
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   And then later in APJ613, another episode on writing, you said,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   "Writing is a way the mind can start seeing clearly
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   what was before a fuzzy tangle of thoughts."
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   And then, of course, in APJ1196 on book writing,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   an episode we did on book writing,
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   you said that for yourself, writing a book is to watch a book
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   slowly come to life as, "The writing itself becomes a way of seeing."
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   So as you write more, you see more.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   So as you wrote this new book on the Second Coming of Christ,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   what did you see more clearly?
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   What discoveries stand out?
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   And particularly, did you make any new key discoveries
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   about how Christian hedonism echoes in the Second Coming?
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Well, the discovery, the key discovery of the connection
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   between Christian hedonism and the Second Coming
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   happened a long time ago, not while I was writing the book.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   It happened way back when I was first trying to understand
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   the relationship between God's centeredness and God's love for us.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   As soon as I read in seminary Edward's book,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Jonathan Edward's book, "The End for Which God Created the World,"
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   I began to see everywhere in Scripture statements to the effect
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   that God does everything for his namesake or for his glory.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   And that's what I mean by God's God-centeredness,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   doing things for his own namesake.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   He predestined salvation for his glory, Ephesians 1:5.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   He created the world for his glory, Isaiah 40, 37.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   He guided the history of Israel for his glory, Jeremiah 13, 11.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   He sent Christ into the world for his glory, Romans 15, 9.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   He forgives sin now for his glory, 1 John 2, 12.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   He sanctifies his people for his glory, 2 Thessalonians 2, 12.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   And then I asked, "Is that true for the Second Coming?"
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I asked that a long time ago.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   And the answer Paul gives in 2 Thessalonians 7-10 is simply amazing
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   because it not only shows that Jesus is coming back for his own glory,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   but it does so in a way that is an answer to the question,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   "Well, how is Christ's self-exaltation at the Second Coming
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   really an act of love for his people?"
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   We usually think self-exaltation and love are opposites.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   How does that work at the Second Coming?
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And here's—let me read Paul's answer.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   "He will grant relief to you who are afflicted as well as to us.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   When the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   they will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might."
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   And here comes the key phrase.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   "When he comes on that day to be glorified in his saints."
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   So pause here before I finish the sentence.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Jesus is coming back to be glorified in his saints.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   That's what I mean when I say that he is self-exalting.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   There is the self-exaltation of Christ.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   He's coming back to be exalted.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   He's coming back to be glorified.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   His aim in coming is that he be exalted, glorified.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   That is his purpose in coming, according to that verse.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   And it would be easy to show that this is, of course,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   the same as God's aim to be glorified in all that he does
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   because God is sending Christ back so that as the Son is glorified,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   the Father would be glorified in him.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   And then comes the essentially Christian hedonist twist in verse 10.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   "When he comes on that day to be glorified in his saints
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   and to be marveled at among all who have believed."
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   So he's coming to be glorified in the saints
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   and to be marveled at among the saints.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   And I ask, are those distinct, like ham and eggs,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   like the ham of being glorified and the eggs of being marveled at?
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Or are they not distinct, but like jewel and diamond,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   or like celebrating and clapping?
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   A diamond is a jewel.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Clapping is a way we celebrate something.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   And when he comes on that day to be glorified and to be marveled at,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   my understanding is these two acts, to be glorified, to be marveled at,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   these two acts of the believers at the coming of Christ
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   are not distinct like ham and eggs.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Being marveled at is the way Christ will be glorified when he comes.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   He's glorified by being marveled at.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Now let's think about that
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   because this is right at the heart of Christian hedonism.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   What is marveling?
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   What's marveling?
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Another word for marveling is being amazed.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Amazement and marveling are not thoughts.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   They're not thoughts.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   They're emotions.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   If you see something marvelous and you feel nothing,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   you're not marveling.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   I don't care what you think.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   If you see something amazing and you don't feel any amazement,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   you're not amazed.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Marveling is a feeling.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Being amazed is a feeling, not a mere thought.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Well, what kind of feeling is it?
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   It's a good feeling.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   People pursue amazement.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   They pursue marveling.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   That's why we go to the mountains and the canyons.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   That's why we get out of the city lights so that we can see the stars.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   People pay money to be amazed, to marvel.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   It's a good feeling.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   It's a desirable feeling.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   It's a species of pleasure, joy, gladness, satisfaction.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   And you see where that leaves us.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   2 Thessalonians 1:10, "When he comes on that day to be glorified and to be marveled at,"
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   that is, he's coming to be glorified in us by our marveling at him,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   he will be glorified in us when we experience the satisfaction of marveling at him in his coming.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   It's pure Christian hedonism.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   It's the way God designed the universe.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   He will get glory.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   That's why he made everything.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   He will get glory.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   He will get glory and we will get the joy.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   And by our getting the joy in his glory, he will get the glory from our joy,
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   which is the answer to the question, "Now, how is it loving for God to be so God-centered?
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   How is it loving for Christ to be so Christ-exalting?"
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   And the answer is Christ is not Christ-exalting at our expense.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   He is Christ-exalting through our joy.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   The way he maximizes his glory is by maximizing our joy in that glory.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   He magnifies the radiance of his glory by multiplying the marveling of people in that glory.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   The more we marvel, the more he shines.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   The more we marvel, the happier we are.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   It's a form of happiness.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   This is love.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Right at the heart of the design of the universe is love.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   So, yes, I did see a relationship between the second coming and Christian hedonism,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   and it goes to the very heart of God's purposes and ways in creation and redemption and consummation in the world.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Christ is coming on that day to be glorified in his saints and to be marveled at among all who have believed,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   which takes us back to the verse from which the whole book sprang, namely 2 Timothy 4, 8,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   which says, "Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me and not only to me, but to all who have loved his appearing."
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   And that love is a desiring love.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   It's a cherishing love, a treasuring love, a longing love.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   It's the kind of love that wants the beloved.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   And what the discovery of Christian hedonism at the second coming does is simply add another reason,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   an amazing reason, for us to love the Lord's appearing.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   And that's my prayer for myself and why I wrote the book.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   That second Thessalonians 1, 10 passage appears two times in Desiring God, your book.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   2 Timothy 4, 8 doesn't appear in Desiring God.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Was that text something that kind of grew on you over the years?
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Do you remember?
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Oh, yeah. Just a couple of years ago.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Okay.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   I wasn't—I don't recall ever stopping.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   I mean, maybe I did, and I just don't remember, but stopping and saying,
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   "That's big. That's a foundation for a book."
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   But two years ago, that's exactly what happened.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Got it.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   I had thought, "A book on the second coming, I think, is needed.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   There's not enough thought about that, not enough affection for it."
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   But I didn't have any place to hang it.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   And when I saw that, I said, "Okay, that's it. That's it."
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Yeah, it's incredible how God sort of waits for the right time for a text to kind of stand out, right?
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Yep, that's exactly right.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Yeah. Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Come, Lord Jesus, Meditations on the Second Coming of Christ.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   The new book is beautiful.
