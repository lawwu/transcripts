[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   On today's podcast episode/audio file I'm going to do something that I can't ever remember
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   doing before.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.760]   I'm going to release one of my deleted episodes.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.340]   I'm going to record an introduction here and then I'm going to append to this introduction
[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:28.000]   a full podcast episode which was and is one of my deleted podcast episodes.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.960]   Does it all make sense in just a moment?
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.480]   Frequently, very frequently I would estimate that probably I create, I record probably
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.640]   20 to 40% more podcast episodes than you ever hear.
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.920]   I will frequently sit down, I'll record a podcast episode, I'll record something on
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:53.960]   a topic and I will much of the time get 30 or 45 minutes into it and then I'll just stop.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.320]   Frequently I'll record a whole episode and then just sit on it for a day or two thinking
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.100]   about it and then decide, "You know what, that's not something that I'm going to release
[00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.760]   to the show."
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.280]   Sometimes I'll be able to go back and I'll rework it a few times and I'll release the
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.360]   third or fourth version of it where I was able to communicate more clearly.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.480]   Sometimes I just simply never release an episode.
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.120]   I think that's normal for most artists.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.640]   I've met novelists, most of whom have some story sketched outlines of books they may
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.720]   never write but they sketched out some basic plot ideas or they have an unfinished manuscript
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.360]   or artists who have ideas that they've maybe sketched out on paper but they haven't actually
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.240]   followed through with the full work.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.520]   I don't expect it to be anything different.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.280]   I consider it a great privilege for you to be listening to me and I want to deliver my
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.040]   very best content.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.560]   If I had to be live on the radio every single day, then I would simply go live on the radio
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.840]   and do the very best I can in that format.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.720]   But with a podcast, I have the opportunity for some introspection, some more careful
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.720]   conversations.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.800]   I have the opportunity to try again if I don't quite get it right.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.240]   And so I will frequently create an episode and then just simply pause or try a few times.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:17.200]   Usually the reasons for this is that number one, I am often not as focused as I want to
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.200]   be.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.600]   I'm very sensitive to try to stay very focused on the topic and sometimes I go down a few
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.520]   too many rabbit trails, tell a few too many stories, make a few too many illusions, introduce
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.680]   a few too many clauses like I'm doing right now and I think, "No, I should have been more
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.040]   direct, clearer, more succinct with what I want to say."
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.000]   And so I'll go back and I'll cut out some of the filler fluff and I will then release
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   it that way.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And I find it easier.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.880]   I don't edit post-recording, but I do edit pre-recording.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.120]   I try to create a clear outline of what I want to say and then simply say it.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.480]   Another reason though is I'll touch on topics that are difficult, topics that are controversial,
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.000]   topics that are charged with emotional energy.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.200]   And sometimes when I'm talking about those topics, I'll be working my way through them
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.720]   and then I'll just simply get to the end of the show and I'll say, "I don't want to deal
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.560]   with the controversy that's going to be created by this.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.320]   I don't want to deal with the feedback."
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.800]   And when I deal with those subjects, I try to deal with them in a fairly thorough manner,
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.800]   doing my best to anticipate the rebuttals or objections that I'm likely to receive because
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.480]   I want to answer those things up front so that my audience can understand the likely
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.720]   objections and rebuttals.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.000]   But sometimes I don't feel like I do a good enough job with that.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.780]   And so the audio file that I deleted that I'm going to append to what you're listening
[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.680]   to now is one of those.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.960]   And it's a podcast that I created in response to a little bit of recent controversy that
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.120]   I unintentionally wandered into.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:02.260]   Specifically, I said in passing on a previous episode, I said that some people are taking
[00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:11.340]   a drug usually known as an anti-parasite drug called ivermectin prophylactically as a potential
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:19.240]   preventive medicine or as a treatment for symptoms related to a COVID-19 infection.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.600]   That was the comment that I made in passing.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.720]   And it slipped out because it is true.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.600]   It is an accurate truth.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.980]   And then after the podcast went live, I started to receive feedback from people.
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.920]   And this is, by the way, quite the controversial subject.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.560]   It's not a small unknown subject.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.220]   And I didn't really intend to wander into it because I consider conversations like that
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.880]   to be outside of the scope of radical personal finance.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.560]   I'm trying to stay focused on finance.
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.480]   And the episode itself was somewhat ancillary.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.640]   I'm talking about the pandemic related to the economy.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.200]   I'm talking about freedom, etc.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.600]   The question is, does this really relate to personal finance?
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.440]   And that was one where I think it relates, but I believe I owe it to my audience because
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.600]   this is the big thing that's affecting all of our lives.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.640]   It's affecting where I live, where you go on vacation, our money, stock market, all
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.680]   this stuff.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.680]   It's affecting it.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.280]   And so I thought, I'll go ahead and release it.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.280]   And I didn't want to get mired down into a controversy on medical stuff that I'm simply
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.400]   not qualified to address.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.120]   I don't have the interest in talking through publicly.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.600]   So after the feedback came in from audience, some of it public, I received responses on
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.680]   Twitter, I received responses privately, several responses.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.660]   And I thought, you know what, usually my experience is when someone takes the time to sit down
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.700]   and comment on something, there's usually at least 10 times as many people who are thinking
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.700]   about it.
[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.960]   And I'll often address, if I get enough comments, I'll often address a controversy or correct
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.920]   something that I've misstated in a show, something like that.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.260]   And so this was one of those.
[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.520]   But after the fact, I just said, you know what, I don't want to get involved in this
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.720]   controversy and so I deleted it.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.680]   Well over the past few days, the controversy continued.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.440]   People talking about it, people commenting on it, etc.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.800]   And so I released this audio file in a conversation in the Radical Personal Finance Community
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.080]   Facebook group, which of course, if you're on Facebook, you should join.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.160]   Go to Facebook.com, search Radical Personal Finance Community Facebook group and you'll
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.160]   find us.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.720]   Just search Radical Personal Finance and you'll find it there.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.960]   And several listeners said, "Hey Joshua, this is actually really great.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:19.960]   I really enjoyed this.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.760]   This was an excellent episode and I think you should have released it."
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.160]   So after considering it for a couple of days, I've decided to do that.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.280]   But I want to give you this preamble and I want to comment on a couple of issues in addition
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:37.080]   to what I said in that particular podcast episode.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:46.740]   So in essence, I am addressing the Ivermectin controversy in that I mentioned, but I'm trying
[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.280]   to tie it in this podcast episode.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.240]   I'm trying to tie it to finance.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:57.720]   And much of the show is talking about the nature of expertise and the nature of managing
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.480]   information as a non-expert.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:08.680]   And I present to you some mental models that I use to manage information as a non-expert
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:15.640]   and how I'm trying to play both sides to acknowledge my lack of expertise, but also play both sides.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.680]   You'll hear me talk about that in the audio file to come.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.260]   And I believe that this is very useful, right?
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.560]   Because we're living in the information age and our skills of managing that information
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.880]   are important, especially in a world where the information is coming faster than ever
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.160]   before.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.240]   But I had to talk extensively about the Ivermectin controversy so you understood the backstory
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:40.000]   of that particular topic.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Why is this important to me?
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.120]   Why am I talking about it?
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:48.120]   Well, right now we are suffering through, or I guess I should simply say we are living
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:54.680]   through a time in which expertise is being tested.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.040]   We see this all over the place.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:03.400]   And I'm personally very sensitive to this question because of my own expertise in a
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.160]   very narrow field.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.840]   We could divide on this topic many people into two camps.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:15.080]   There are those who simply have as a personal philosophy, trust the experts.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.320]   Be confident in what the experts have to say, trust the experts.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:24.200]   And if you ask them for their opinion on a subject, their opinions will largely reflect
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:29.800]   the consensus of the expert class to which they have been exposed.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.360]   On the other hand, there are those who see themselves as contrarians.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.520]   There are those who see themselves as those who don't trust the experts, who believe that
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:44.360]   the experts are unreliable, untrustworthy, perhaps malintentioned, part of a greater
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.360]   conspiracy.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.520]   And so their automatic gut reaction is to not trust the experts and rather to trust
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.300]   anybody who says anything against the experts.
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:59.340]   And both sides of these, as I see it, both of these positions are very flawed because
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:04.240]   you're easily manipulated by others who wish to manipulate you.
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:11.160]   On the one hand, you're easily manipulated by somebody who comes with the veneer of expertise,
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.760]   somebody who puts on a white lab coat or somebody who looks intelligent or has all the right
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:16.760]   credentials.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:23.480]   That person can manipulate you using an appeal to authority and demonstrate by virtue of
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:28.640]   their expertise that you should believe them and then you do what they say without actually
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.600]   having seen the fact that that expertise is actually true.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:37.840]   But then the other side is also quite dangerous, that you can be manipulated by those who prey
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:44.480]   upon your distrust of experts, who prey upon your distrust of the consensus opinion.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:49.400]   And it's quite scary to see how easily people can be manipulated when they adopt a contrarian
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.400]   viewpoint.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.920]   And so what happens is they don't necessarily walk away from all leadership.
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:10:00.040]   Rather they walk away from the official leaders and they become easily swayed prey for those
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.160]   who designate themselves the contrarian unofficial leaders.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.880]   And both of these I see are dangerous.
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:11.080]   And I'm personally very sensitive to this because of my expertise in the financial space,
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.520]   but I've been on all sides of that.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.940]   Let me share my story.
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:22.480]   When I was younger, I was conditioned by the mainstream information on finance.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:27.600]   I got my start in personal finance going to Barnes and Noble and the library getting books.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:32.760]   And by the time somebody has gotten through the filters of a book publisher and or gotten
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:37.240]   onto the shelves of Barnes and Noble and the library, most of the time that person is an
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.000]   expert reflecting consensus opinion.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.720]   So I got my start in mainstream finance and this awakened an interest in me in finance
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.860]   specifically.
[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:52.000]   But then by nature, I'm the kind of person who's often attracted to the contrarian viewpoint.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.040]   And so I found the contrarians and I was really persuaded of those contrarians, the people
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:01.560]   who had that personality of it's us against the man and I've got the better solution.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.400]   And I started to consume their work and this started to create in me perspectives and opinions
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.220]   that were by nature contrarian.
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:14.240]   And so very quickly, my personal finance trust went very low and I distrusted the expert
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.320]   class in the world of personal finance.
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.800]   You've heard me say, I thought brokers are out to make you broker.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.800]   I can do better on my own.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.080]   I can invest better on my own.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.080]   I'm a contrarian.
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.080]   I saw myself in that light.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.480]   Then through a series of circumstances, I joined the expert class.
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.400]   I went through the traditional model.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.480]   I went through the traditional career pathway.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:37.960]   I went through the traditional training and I learned the intelligence behind the expert
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.480]   class.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:46.340]   And then when I was a part of the expert class, I kind of laughed at some of the ignorance
[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:51.340]   that I would see revealed in the contrarians perspectives and the contrarians opinions.
[00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:56.040]   And I thought of myself as smarter than other people because I knew something.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:00.800]   But what I also then was exposed to is the fact that the expert class is not morally
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.360]   pure.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:07.720]   A lot of times, many of the contrarians, even if they weren't exactly right in the specific
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.980]   thing they were putting their finger on, they were often directionally right.
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:18.520]   But we as the expert class would lock our shields together, join ranks and create a
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:24.720]   cartel trying to shun the non-expert class while knowing that we had a little bit of
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.020]   rot in our midst.
[00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:30.720]   And I always wanted kind of a morally pure perspective.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.880]   I wanted to have this sense of certainty that, "Hey, I'm on the right team and my opinions
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:35.880]   are the right ones."
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.520]   I've always craved that in many regards.
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:43.900]   And so when I left the expert class and became part of the independent media space here on
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.520]   radical personal finance, it was a great relief.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:51.440]   But then what was so remarkable to me was watching how it took me years to systematically
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:56.840]   identify and then undo the conditioning that I had experienced by being part of the expert
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:57.840]   class.
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.240]   Still, to this day, if someone says, "I'm going to fire my..."
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:05.440]   If someone says a negative comment about financial advisors, generally, I have this thing rise
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.360]   up in my heart where I'm like, "Wait a second.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.360]   Hold on.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.360]   Hold on.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.360]   I've been a financial advisor.
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.360]   Don't criticize us.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.360]   We're not worthy of the criticism."
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.000]   And yet, in many cases, we are worthy of the criticism.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.560]   And so over the years as I've dealt with these things, I have noticed the parallels between
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:27.680]   my expert class and the expert classes of others, including the expert classes of people
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:33.900]   like medical professionals or other skilled industries where there is a knowledge component
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:34.900]   to the work.
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:41.260]   And I've realized that the truth is different in different contexts.
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.000]   It's not necessarily in the middle.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.720]   Sometimes the middle seems appealing because you're trying to balance both sides, but the
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.240]   middle is not in and of itself true.
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:53.560]   You got to find the truth, but it's different in different expressions and often takes time
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.480]   for that truth to emerge.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.920]   And so what can happen is the consensus can change over time.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:03.680]   And in the fullness of time, I believe that we're coming more and more towards things
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:08.120]   that are true, but that in-between ground is often difficult to see and it's difficult
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.600]   to navigate.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:15.160]   And so in this audio file, I was trying to articulate some of the models that I've developed
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:21.840]   to try to deal with that, especially in areas where I am not an expert, such as the medical
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.360]   field.
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:28.200]   I'm an interested layman, but I'm acutely aware of the fact that I'm not competent enough
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:33.800]   to discuss these things in the way that a trained medical professional does.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:39.840]   But I'm also acutely aware and sensitive to how the contrarian perspective has a lot of
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.240]   strength to it.
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:45.360]   And it annoys me when medical professionals don't do a better job listening, just like
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:49.920]   financial advisors don't do a better job listening when they should.
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.480]   And so that was what I was trying to target.
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.360]   Now, ultimately I deleted it because I felt this is too ancillary to the topic of personal
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:59.080]   finance, but you be the judge of that.
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.080]   You're still listening.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:05.920]   Obviously you're interested and you always have the right of veto by simply hitting pause
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.280]   or moving on with your time.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.000]   That's your right as a human being.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.120]   So I'm releasing this.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:15.880]   But I want to make one other point before I include the podcast episode.
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.360]   Actually two other points.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:24.240]   On the topic of coercion, I don't think that I have been particularly radical in my opinions
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.360]   on the coronavirus pandemic.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:32.960]   I was among those who were warning quite early because I have always been sensitive to the
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:39.800]   global disastrous possibilities created by a viral pandemic.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:45.100]   And being a long-time prepper, I have focused on this as being a major risk.
[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:49.260]   And so I was more sensitive than most to the risks.
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:55.080]   And I believe that caution was warranted and is warranted along the way.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:59.040]   It's hard for me to see how caution is not warranted when you're dealing with people's
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.040]   lives.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:07.400]   And I've had one, two, three friends personally die from COVID.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:14.120]   And so it sobers you when you deal with that and you recognize, hey, this is an important
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.120]   factor.
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:24.600]   I've not been a radical kind of anti-protester, but I am finding myself increasingly radicalized
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.440]   over the past weeks and months.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.880]   And the reason for that has to do with coercion, which is what I was talking about in the original
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.840]   podcast where I mentioned passing ivermectin.
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.360]   I was talking about coercion.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:41.560]   And I am very concerned any time coercion comes into play because I believe that coercing
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:46.800]   people into doing something is very rarely the right solution.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.280]   I'm not 100% opposed to coercion.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.640]   I believe there is a time and a place for coercion.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:56.640]   But it's very rarely the right solution.
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:03.200]   And even if it is the right solution, coercion is usually an indication that something else
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.840]   is very wrong.
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:07.680]   Something else is very much out of line.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:13.600]   I always think of my children because they're the ones over whom I have coercive power.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:18.360]   When I coerce my child into doing something, let's say that I see my child out in the middle
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.120]   of a street and I look down the road and there's a car.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.940]   I am going to coerce my child off that street.
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:28.760]   I will run over, I will pick up my child, and I will physically force him out of the
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:33.680]   street because the consequences of my not doing so are so extreme.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:41.680]   But that in and of itself, the fact that I have to do that is a sign of my lack of proper
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:47.000]   forethought, lack of proper planning and preparation as a parent.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.840]   The fact that I have to resort to coercion is a very large negative mark against my parenting.
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:58.320]   What I should have done is I should have known that these streets are dangerous for children.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:03.440]   I should have in the first place been thoughtful about where my child is physically located.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.480]   I should have been thoughtful about making sure that my child is properly supervised.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:11.520]   I should have been thoughtful and I should have worked ahead to make sure that my child
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.920]   is trained to look both ways before crossing the street.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:18.200]   I should have been thoughtful and made sure that my child is trained from a very early
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:23.120]   age to stay back from the street, that he's not allowed to run after his ball in the street.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:27.280]   If his ball goes in the street, he must come and get me because he doesn't know the danger.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:31.160]   I should have been thoughtful in making sure that my child, if incapable of doing this
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:36.160]   safely, was locked inside the house and that the locks were of such a type and height that
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.600]   my child can't manipulate.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.880]   I should have been thoughtful and made sure there was a physical barrier preventing him
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.420]   from going into the street.
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:47.760]   At every stage, the fact that my child is in the street is an indictment of my previous
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.520]   forethought and my skills as a parent.
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:57.600]   And so while coercion is necessary and proper in that circumstance, it is an indictment
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:02.800]   of my improper prior planning and preparation for that moment.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.080]   It should never have reached that point.
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.880]   Now obviously that's an obvious example, but there are many things in life that are not
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:09.880]   so clear.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.320]   And so you say, "Is coercion warranted in other things?"
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:19.400]   And again, I'm not 100% opposed to coercion, but I take coercion as a major warning sign
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.360]   that I am failing somewhere.
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:27.600]   If I have to force my child to do his or her schoolwork, if I have to force him to do something,
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:33.400]   then that's an indication that I am failing somewhere because coercion is not a reliable
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.400]   tool.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.500]   Now that's when dealing with a child.
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.100]   What about with an adult?
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:42.900]   What if I'm dealing with another sentient human being, a rational, sane person, a person
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:48.560]   who is not clinically insane, and I am forcing coercion?
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.080]   When should coercion be employed?
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:59.500]   The times when coercion, force, violence should be employed are very rare, and they involve
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:06.720]   the threats to life of another person, threats to health and to life, which is, I think,
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.920]   the best argument that people have to coerce things like vaccination.
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:15.280]   The problem is that when you look throughout history and you study the history of coercion,
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:22.680]   it is far easier to find abundant examples of when people have used coercion, believing
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:28.000]   themselves to be on, as we would say in today's world, the right side of history, and yet
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:34.600]   when history looks back and judges with an unemotional frame, you see that that coercion
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:43.680]   was either not warranted at all, led to very poor results, or created a very slippery slope
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:48.180]   that then went into something else that was far more destructive.
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:53.460]   And so anytime coercion against another human being is used, it should be the kind of thing
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:56.260]   that sends up major red flags.
[00:20:56.260 --> 00:21:02.000]   The clacks and bells in your heart should be ringing, saying, "Warning, warning, something
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.080]   is seriously wrong here.
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:11.560]   Is this the kind of thing that I need to use this very, very, very valuable tool for because
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.120]   this tool is very destructive?
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:18.760]   Is this the right time, the right place, and the right tool for this thing?"
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:26.360]   Now we can debate that, but when I see coercion massively increasing on this particular topic
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:35.720]   of forced vaccinations, then it makes me very suspicious that something is deeply wrong.
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:42.760]   And while I'm not going to be the one who wades in ignorantly and says, "Well, this
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:47.640]   is this, this," I'm going to be very, very cautious, which was why I was originally talking
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.640]   about it, is freedom.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.360]   And I said, "I don't think it's the end of the world.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.400]   I think we're okay.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.480]   I think this is going to pass through.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.920]   To me, a lot of the stuff makes sense."
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.960]   And that was, we should be very careful of coercion.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:07.400]   And the more I see coercion used without very strong justification, the more that I get
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:14.320]   very, very nervous because we can see historically that that is a very difficult thing.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:19.040]   But this relationship, right, acknowledging expertise, being thoughtful and careful, it's
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.080]   a big deal.
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:24.280]   We need to be very, very careful with how we utilize this.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:30.080]   Now, the final reason why I deleted this episode is just simply that we're dealing in an area
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.080]   that's very serious.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.640]   And I make abundantly clear in the audio file that you're about to hear that I don't know
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:41.440]   whether ivermectin or any drug or any vitamin or anything is effective and helpful.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:45.760]   I really think I'm pretty fair on this, that I don't know, but I give you my mental models
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:46.960]   for being aware of it.
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:51.920]   But there is genuine, and in this show, you'll hear me, I read the FDA's comments on the
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.360]   subject.
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:23:01.600]   But I balance the FDA's comments against other versions of other countries' FDA's, FSDA's,
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.000]   federal administrations of their drugs.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.720]   And it's not, in my opinion, quite as clear cut.
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.160]   And so I try to figure out how to deal with it.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:14.360]   But please, we're dealing with quite literal life and death and sickness here in many regards.
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.240]   And so it's a very important topic.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:22.360]   And I'm trying to give you some mental models that I use that I believe are useful and helpful
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:27.040]   while specifically abstaining from commenting on the medical issues.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:33.160]   And while I believe you are fully entitled to have an opinion on medical issues for yourself
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.760]   and for those that you care about, and you should have an opinion, when you go and you
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:42.000]   teach someone else, or you take it upon yourself to go and to share with someone else what
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.440]   they should or shouldn't do, that's a very, very heavy load.
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:50.200]   Anyone who teaches is always held to a heavier standard, and rightly so.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:55.000]   Because it's one thing for you to have control and autonomy over your own body and your own
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.680]   affairs and that of your family.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:59.160]   It's another thing for you to influence other people.
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.160]   And so all who teach are held to a higher standard.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.200]   They're judged by a higher standard.
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:10.680]   So I'm trying to present these models in an appropriate way without walking, you know,
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:14.900]   without getting out of my lane, without going into places where I can't comment on.
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:23.780]   So with that preamble and with that warning, here is the now undeleted episode of the show
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:30.140]   from early last week, covering this controversy and presenting my mental models of how I deal
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:36.400]   with information that is constantly new, how I deal with information that is in controversy,
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:42.740]   and how I think about specifically the management and the actions associated with that information.
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:43.740]   Enjoy.
[00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:49.780]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:53.460]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:56.700]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:00.380]   My name is Joshua Sheets, and today I want to share with you a few mental models that
[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:04.300]   I use to do my very best.
[00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:11.100]   I'll seek to use humble, thoughtful language, to do my very best to be successful in the
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.020]   information age.
[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.620]   You and I are living in the information age.
[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:19.380]   I'm not sure what the current, the next age is going to be, but I think we're still in
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.300]   the information age.
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:25.940]   And what it means is that information runs the world.
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:30.880]   Access to information is a key secret to success.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:36.100]   Those who control information flows are very much those who are in control of what's happening
[00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:37.360]   in the world.
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:41.380]   And so in order for us to be successful in the information age, we need to have some
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:47.540]   models that we can use reliably again and again to help us to move closer towards our
[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:48.880]   goals.
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:54.140]   If you apply this overall lens that we're living in the information age to so many modern
[00:25:54.140 --> 00:26:00.700]   debates, modern arguments, modern controversies, then you will understand more and more about
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.980]   why the world works the way that it does today.
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.480]   It has not always been that way.
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:11.180]   The information age is not, has not been the same throughout every time in human history.
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:16.980]   But at the moment, many of the debates that we are involved in relate to this transition,
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:19.720]   this fact that we are in the information age.
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:24.820]   Think about everything from censorship or fighting about who's right and who's data,
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:30.020]   you know, fake news, alternative facts, all of this arguments, all of these arguments
[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:32.140]   relate to information.
[00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:37.660]   And what has happened is that we find ourselves living, most of us, no, we find ourselves
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:46.900]   living, all of us, in a society that is exceedingly poorly equipped to properly assimilate information,
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:52.820]   search for information, acquire information, analyze that information, study it, and draw
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:57.540]   meaningful actions from that information.
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:04.660]   What you need to remember is that most of our fellow citizens were conditioned to function
[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:08.780]   ineffectively in the industrial age.
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:15.140]   This is the whole basis of how school was developed and why it looks the way that we,
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:18.020]   the way that it has for the last few centuries.
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:24.300]   Our fellow citizens have been conditioned from the very first few years of their life
[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:30.300]   to sit quietly in a seat, to listen to what is said from the front of the classroom, to
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:37.660]   read and regurgitate verbatim the approved sources selected by the teachers and administrators
[00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:42.660]   under whom they studied, and to make sure that their opinions fall within an acceptable
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:45.500]   range of opinions.
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:48.720]   Write what we tell you to write, regurgitate it back to us.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:53.580]   That is the world, the milieu in which the majority of our fellow citizens have been
[00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:54.580]   raised.
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:59.260]   Well, now we don't find ourselves in an industrial age anymore, we find ourselves in the information
[00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:07.700]   age, and thus we are exposed on a daily basis to the perils of our population having been
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.980]   prepared for a world that no longer exists.
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:19.260]   And we find ourselves in an uncomfortable transition period that's very difficult and
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:25.260]   filled with strife as our population around transitions itself to the world that does
[00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:26.260]   exist.
[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:31.380]   Now, I believe that this will happen, but we are in that very painful in-between period
[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:36.500]   in which it is very slowly happening and very painfully happening all around us.
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:41.860]   Now, this is a lens in which I view the world, and to me it makes a lot of sense.
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:48.220]   And I see daily confirmation of the usefulness of this lens when I scroll through my Facebook
[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:53.560]   feed or I read the essays or look at the controversies of the day, and you see that the majority
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:57.780]   of people are locked in a – they are living in a world in which they are unequipped to
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:04.180]   handle the massive increase in information, and it needs a significantly higher set of
[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:09.400]   skills, again, to acquire the information that's needed, etc.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:16.100]   And so I've been working on this, I want you to be working on this, and I'm not an
[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:22.100]   expert at it, but I do my very best to continue the process of growth and learning and become
[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:23.600]   an expert at it.
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:28.700]   And in that process, I have developed a few mental models that I steadily rely on to try
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:33.620]   to help me process and effectively analyze information.
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:39.340]   I have the unique benefit of being on the record with my analysis.
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:43.100]   I try to speak my thoughts to you.
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:49.980]   I try to use a flow of reasoning, a flow of argument, so that you can follow them.
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:55.860]   That way, if you like something I have to say, you know how I got there, and you can
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:58.820]   decide whether you agree with it or not.
[00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:03.900]   And on the other hand, if I'm wrong about something that I have to say, then you can
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:07.820]   identify the error in my logical argument.
[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:11.300]   This is one reason why I'm well-suited to the longer-form content that you find here
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:12.300]   on Radical Personal Finance.
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:17.660]   I try to tell you, this is what I think is true, and here is why I think it is true,
[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:22.740]   so that you can follow me and either say, "I agree with Joshua," or "I disagree with
[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:25.260]   Joshua, and here's where I think he goes wrong."
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:26.780]   And then we all win.
[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:29.420]   And doing this for yourself is something that I want you to do.
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:32.180]   And again, I want to share some mental models.
[00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:37.660]   Now I'm inspired to do this show as a result of a few pieces of feedback from the previous
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:39.100]   episode.
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:44.100]   And in that previous episode, I shared with you what I think is going to happen with the
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.780]   coronavirus pandemic.
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:51.860]   I talked about freedom in the United States related to forced vaccination, and I wanted
[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:54.580]   to share with you what I think will happen.
[00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:59.860]   The summary statement is that I think we are six to 18 months away from the end of the
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:07.740]   pandemic, unless a very powerful new variant of this particular disease emerges.
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:13.900]   I think that we're very close to the end of all of this hoopla about the pandemic.
[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:19.260]   I don't use that word to minimize the impact of the pandemic, just meaning that I think
[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:20.980]   that we're close to the end.
[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:23.140]   And I've given my arguments as to why.
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:28.620]   Put simply, they are, number one, we understand very clearly at this point in time who is
[00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:33.060]   most affected by this virus and how the virus is most likely to affect them.
[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:39.460]   We understand that, speaking generally, coronavirus as a serious condition affects the older and
[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:42.940]   sicker people, not younger and healthier people.
[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:48.220]   Those people are infected and pass the infection along, but they don't generally receive serious
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:50.540]   symptoms in the vast majority of cases.
[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:57.300]   And this is quite freeing because a significant portion of the population is able to go about
[00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:05.140]   their daily lives without worrying about being a severe case of coronavirus.
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:10.140]   The second argument that I made is that we have developed and are continuing to develop
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:15.900]   better and better therapeutics, better ways of treating sick people so that we can minimize
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:20.620]   the worst end case scenarios that result in somebody dying in the intensive care unit.
[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:27.660]   Rather, we can treat them as outpatients and/or we can provide just simply, I forget the medical
[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:31.140]   word for it, but just the basic care that they need to deal with the sickness in their
[00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:32.680]   home and then move on.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:37.000]   There does still continue to be significant numbers of concerns with so-called long COVID,
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.860]   but people are studying and making progress on that as well.
[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:46.380]   And then the third off-ramp that I described is the development of preventative treatments
[00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:47.700]   and/or vaccinations.
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:55.040]   So here we understand that number one, the impact of natural immunity is very, very high.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:33:01.160]   People who have been previously infected with a natural expression of COVID retain very
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:05.400]   high levels of antibodies for a significant amount of time and thus are well protected
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.980]   from a second bout with the disease.
[00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:11.940]   And in addition, many of the vaccinations around the world are proving themselves to
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:18.340]   be quite effective, at the very least, at minimizing the most extreme medical events.
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:22.180]   And while they may or may not be minimizing the number of people who are infected and/or
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:30.500]   the transmission of the disease, at least they are minimizing the hardest medical, the
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:35.380]   worst medical cases for those who are fully vaccinated.
[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:41.940]   And in addition, that we are finding that the short-term data that we have on vaccination
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:45.500]   so far appears to be quite good in terms of the safety of those vaccines.
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:52.100]   And so this is influencing more and more of an uptake of the vaccines on a global basis.
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:57.300]   So in addition, I think that people see this and recognize, and regardless of where the
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:04.580]   government authorities are in their codes, once people see and recognize this data, they
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:07.940]   are generally simply deciding to move on with their lives.
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:12.420]   And this is putting tremendous political pressure on those governments that are still deciding
[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:17.420]   to put significant restrictions on society.
[00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:22.140]   That was my argument in about three minutes that I presented in the previous episode.
[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:29.880]   However, during that episode, I said a vulgar, unpermitted word.
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:34.620]   That word begins with I and ends with vermectin, ivermectin.
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:40.700]   And I mentioned in passing when I was discussing the development of therapeutics and/or preventative
[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:47.300]   treatments, I mentioned that some people are taking ivermectin as a prophylactic with an
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:52.080]   attempt to minimize the severity of a COVID infection.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:56.180]   And one of my listeners wrote to me, well, several of my listeners wrote to me in various
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:59.460]   formats, Twitter, Facebook, email, etc.
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:01.620]   Which by the way, the best way to do all this stuff is just with Twitter.
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:03.340]   Follow me on Twitter @JoshuaSheets.
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:05.660]   Interact with me there publicly.
[00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:09.660]   I only occasionally go into the DMs, but interact with me there publicly and I'll answer your
[00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:11.260]   stuff there as long as you're not annoying.
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:17.100]   I block people who are obnoxious and annoying, but if you, I don't mind disagreements as
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:20.520]   long as you are respectful in your tone.
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:26.300]   So Sarah writes to me and she writes this, quote, "Whatever media rabbit hole you've
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:30.540]   gone down, please stop.
[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:34.220]   Ivermectin isn't people medicine.
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:40.140]   Your research of the science is clearly flawed.
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:46.500]   Your analysis drips of self-reinforcing politics.
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:48.860]   I listen to your podcast weekly.
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:50.100]   I've been a patron.
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:51.100]   I'm disappointed."
[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:52.100]   End quote.
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:59.820]   Now I thought this was an interesting topic and while I really hate these debates on medical
[00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:04.340]   treatments, I hate the debates because they're so dumb.
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:09.700]   They have this level of tribal identity regarding, "Do you believe in Ivermectin?" or "Do you
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:12.740]   believe in hydroxychloroquine?" or "Do you believe in vaccines?"
[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:18.060]   It's so dumb, the whole stupid tribalism that has emerged about this.
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:23.220]   So I despise these debates, but I consider this to be a useful case study for us to talk
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:29.860]   about some of these mental models of how do we deal with information, how do we analyze
[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:34.620]   it, and how do we decide our personal approach to it and what we're actually going to do.
[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:39.980]   I'm going to use briefly the backstory of Ivermectin just to inform you on it, how I
[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:46.060]   understand the facts to be, and then I'm going to primarily use financial examples because
[00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:50.340]   I believe that if you have these mental models in your head and if you use them, you will
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:53.460]   get better financial results.
[00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:59.700]   So I need a few minutes to explain my understanding of the Ivermectin debate to which Sarah is
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:09.900]   alluding here and the current status of this particular drug with regard to COVID-19 treatment.
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:15.460]   I need to begin with a disclaimer, which is not inserted for any kind of just random regard.
[00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:16.460]   It's real.
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:18.740]   I do not know.
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:28.460]   I genuinely do not know if Ivermectin is useful in the treatment of a disease of specifically
[00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:29.460]   COVID-19.
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:35.020]   Of course, it's useful in other treatment of other diseases, but I do not know if Ivermectin
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:39.740]   is useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:45.740]   I will tell you why I am okay with not knowing and what I have done or what I will do or
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:53.460]   would do, even though I do not know what is actually true about that particular question.
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:56.620]   Basically, I'm going to tell you, I don't know, but I'm going to try to share with you
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:38:03.100]   why I don't think it matters in this situation, whether I do or don't know.
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:04.940]   Let's begin with a little bit of backstory.
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:13.200]   When COVID-19 first came on the scene, it was shrouded in lack of information.
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:20.640]   We understood that supposedly the virus came from a wet seafood market in China in the
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:28.880]   province of Wuhan, just a block or two away from this level four infectious disease facility,
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:34.060]   and it emerged and seemingly came from, again, one of these wet markets.
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:37.060]   And then it infected people and it spread across China.
[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:41.740]   Then of course it was perhaps spreading across the world, but the information on it was quite
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:43.100]   shrouded in mystery.
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.140]   We didn't know what the markers of it were.
[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:46.340]   We didn't know how it worked.
[00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:47.820]   We didn't know anything about it.
[00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:50.020]   And so very quickly we started to gather information.
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:54.300]   Again, in the early days, all the information came from China, which was by definition suspect
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:59.800]   because of their long history of lying to the world on anything related to these topics
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.860]   or anything else.
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:06.420]   And so we had to wait until we could get information from outside of China.
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:09.680]   And the information that was gathered was trying to figure out what is this disease,
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:12.100]   how does it work, how transmissible is it, right?
[00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:15.300]   So we had the fog of lack of information.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:22.080]   We didn't know is this disease transmissible as an aerosol or is it droplets?
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.260]   How is it actually being transmitted?
[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:26.260]   We didn't know how infectious people were.
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:29.020]   We didn't understand the incubation period very much.
[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:34.580]   We didn't know all of the symptoms and we didn't understand exactly how to treat those
[00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:36.560]   symptoms along the way.
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:41.360]   And so thus the whole medical establishment all around the world went to work to try to
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:46.840]   find answers to these questions and try to identify how can we treat this.
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:51.860]   And along the way, different treatments were tried, different things were done along the
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:57.280]   way to try to figure out what treatments were effective.
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:02.700]   Now in the United States, this particular topic became very highly politicized and it
[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.600]   became extremely tribal.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:08.000]   I think most notably, now it was this way from the very beginning, right?
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.040]   In the very beginning, it was Republicans who were saying, "Hey, we need to be careful
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.040]   of this."
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.520]   And then all of the Democrats were saying, "No, that's ridiculous.
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:17.520]   You're just fear-mongering.
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:20.840]   It's just the flu and you should go out and march in the streets of New York and you should
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:22.080]   go out and do all the stuff."
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:25.720]   And so it became super, super political from the very beginning.
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:28.200]   Then it became racism, right?
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:32.080]   Because shutting down the borders and it's racist and you're trying to close us off to
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:38.720]   Asia and it's called the China virus and we're increasing harassment on Asians by calling
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:39.760]   it the China virus.
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.780]   And so that led to more of it.
[00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:45.600]   Then President Trump said, "We're going to develop a vaccine super fast."
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:49.120]   And all of the lefties said, "Well, I would never trust that vaccine that President Trump
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:50.120]   developed.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:52.440]   Who's going to actually take that?"
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:56.800]   Then President Trump talked about hydroxychloroquine, right?
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:01.460]   There were some indications that this cheap and widely available drug might have some
[00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:04.680]   effect on treatment of coronavirus.
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:09.520]   This became this great big debate and argument because some doctors said that, "Hey, we think
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:10.880]   that this drug is helpful."
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:13.560]   Other doctors said, "No, we don't think it is helpful."
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:17.160]   President Trump said, "I think it's really good and really helpful."
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:21.160]   But then that poisoned the well and everyone was upset about it.
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:26.280]   Well, hydroxychloroquine faded into the background and we moved on to various more controversies
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:28.000]   and there were all the controversies about the masks, etc.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.640]   So it became this massive arguments about what do we do, what do we not do all along
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:34.640]   the way.
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:38.840]   Well, perhaps a year or so ago, maybe a little less, I don't remember, we started to hear
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:46.520]   indications of a drug called ivermectin being used by people for the treatment of coronavirus.
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:51.840]   But once again, I think perhaps even tainted by the hydroxychloroquine saga, this particular
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:56.020]   drug, especially in the United States, became quickly controversial.
[00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:59.480]   And what my international listeners need to understand is that the United States has this
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:08.980]   really weird, very, very restrictive system related to drugs where all kinds of, basically
[00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:15.220]   virtually all drugs except coffee and alcohol and some mild pain relievers have to be dispensed
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:17.080]   with a prescription.
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:22.280]   This is very different than many other countries where even very powerful antibiotics are available
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:23.320]   without a prescription.
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:24.640]   You can just simply go and buy them.
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.760]   In the United States, it's not that way.
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:31.200]   And so you have to involve your doctor in purchasing these different things.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:34.440]   And so the news started to come out that, hey, there's this drug called ivermectin that
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:36.600]   may be helpful and it's being studied.
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:42.220]   Well, where we are today is that this has been a subject of considerable debate, lots
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:43.220]   and lots of debate.
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:49.400]   If you survey much of the news media in the West, you will see that ivermectin is called
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.540]   a hoax, right?
[00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:53.640]   The use of ivermectin is considered to be a hoax.
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.900]   BBC just did an article in England.
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:43:00.360]   You can find dramatic articles all across the US American media of saying, hey, the
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.160]   use of ivermectin is a hoax.
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:05.000]   It's not the same everywhere and you have to look at those things for yourself.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:12.520]   I think this really came to a head, what was it, a month or two ago when Joe Rogan was
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:18.520]   diagnosed with coronavirus and he came out a few days after his diagnosis and he talked
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:22.320]   about how he'd had one really rough day, but he basically beat all the rough symptoms of
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:23.320]   COVID.
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:27.160]   And he talked about his treatment protocol, which included, among a few other treatments,
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:29.200]   included ivermectin.
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:34.760]   And man, the US American media went crazy and there were story after story saying, no
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:42.480]   exaggeration, that Joe Rogan took horse dewormer for his disease, horse dewormer.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:43.960]   Now was that accurate?
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:45.440]   Well, of course it was not accurate.
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.440]   It was stupid.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.440]   It was a flat out hoax.
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:48.440]   It was a lie.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:52.360]   It was fake news that Joe Rogan took horse dewormer.
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:58.860]   But this was alleged because ivermectin not only has been used for many years in humans,
[00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:04.400]   but has also been used very effectively as an anti-parasite treatment in horses and other
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:05.520]   animals.
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:12.080]   And so it's commonly found in, it is the active substance in this horse dewormer, this horse
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:17.120]   paste that you can get to dose your horses with and many other animals as well.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:18.720]   And so why was this the case?
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:25.480]   Well, because of the weird system in the United States of restricted access via prescription,
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:30.720]   people couldn't find ivermectin tablets on the shelf with the human variety.
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:36.200]   And so many people found that they could quickly go and they could buy horse dewormer, so-called
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:41.360]   horse paste, of which the active ingredient is ivermectin, and they could take that and
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:47.600]   have the usefulness of this particular drug for them and their families.
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:51.320]   So that was the basic argument.
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:56.820]   So this is not that controversial of a thing, right?
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:02.740]   So one of the things that for years, I teach preparedness, I've been involved in the preparedness
[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:08.500]   movement for my entire life, and one of the things that people who are preparing for an
[00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:13.760]   uncertain future often want to stockpile is medical supplies.
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:19.000]   When you recognize that if you are in danger, medically speaking, you might need to have
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.400]   your own supply of medical supplies, you go out and you stock up on the things that you
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:24.760]   might need.
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:27.840]   And so this may be as simple as having a first aid kit in your car.
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:32.400]   It may be as simple as putting in a deep supply of bandages or rubber gloves or face masks
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:37.180]   or hydrogen peroxide or alcohol, et cetera.
[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:38.600]   Some people take it much farther, right?
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:41.480]   Some people go and buy a suturing kit.
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:45.860]   The idea is, hey, I might not know how to sew somebody up, but if I've got some of these
[00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:49.480]   medical instruments, perhaps there's a friend of mine who's a nurse or a doctor who may
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:50.480]   know how to do that.
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:55.800]   And so I'll stockpile some of the equipment and the ability to keep it sanitized, sterile
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.860]   I mean, when I need it.
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:01.480]   And so one of the major challenges in the United States, though, is how do I get my
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:04.800]   hands on basic antibiotics?
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:09.720]   Because there very well could come a time when perhaps supply chains are disrupted,
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:15.760]   when perhaps the medical system is overrun, and I might need some basic antibiotics, even
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:18.580]   for a relatively mundane injury.
[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:22.000]   And antibiotics could potentially save my life or a family member's life, but they're
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.120]   not available.
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:25.440]   I can't get my doctor on the phone.
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:27.360]   The pharmacy is sold out.
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:30.680]   The pharmacy is shut down because the city has been looted.
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:34.440]   The pharmacy isn't allowed to sell it to me without a license because blah, blah, blah,
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:35.440]   whatever reason.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.400]   So how can I stock up on antibiotics?
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:42.600]   So in this case, there are three basic pathways to be able to stock up on your own personal
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:45.500]   home supply of antibiotics.
[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:48.800]   Pathway number one is ask your doctor for a prescription.
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:51.080]   And so you explain to your doctor, "Hey, I'd like to stock up on this.
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:52.300]   Would you be willing to do it?"
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:53.760]   And some people are able to do that.
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.400]   Much of the time, though, that fails.
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:47:00.720]   Pathway number two is to either go to a country where you can get these available and just
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:04.840]   bring them in with you or go to a place where the culture is different.
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:09.400]   So here, very commonly, for example, in Latin America, all throughout Central America, antibiotics
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:10.840]   are not a controlled substance.
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:12.680]   You can just walk into a pharmacy.
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:19.240]   The pharmacist in most of these countries is a doctor or functions like a doctor and
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:23.860]   is involved in actually helping to -- it's not just somebody who fills a prescription
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:29.140]   for you, but rather is somebody who is helping you to diagnose your needs and give you kind
[00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:30.320]   of frontline care.
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:34.020]   And then you can just simply buy antibiotics.
[00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:36.920]   And so I've done this routinely throughout Latin America.
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:39.800]   You just go and you buy antibiotics when you need it.
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:45.840]   And then number three -- sorry, in the United States, right, you may go to the Hispanic
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:51.320]   part of town and go to the Hispanic pharmacy and you'll find that the Mexican guy -- or
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:55.140]   the local drugstore, local corner store, and you'll find that the Mexican guy there behind
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:58.640]   the counter is just happy to sell you the antibiotics and you can stock up that way.
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:00.400]   So that's a good solution as well.
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:09.160]   The third solution that people rely upon is antibiotics created for and marketed to owners
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:11.120]   of animals.
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:16.080]   In the United States, their veterinarians and veterinary supply houses are able to create
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:18.860]   the antibiotics for the treatment of animals.
[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:24.740]   And especially in the area of fish antibiotics and bird antibiotics, you have good formulations
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:28.800]   of the antibiotics in their pure form that people can buy.
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.960]   And you can buy them without a prescription.
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:36.680]   And so this is the best way for you to purchase basic antibiotics for yourself to stock up
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:37.680]   on.
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:42.240]   So you need to buy them and then you need to make sure that you have information and
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:46.520]   literature on appropriate dosing so that you can figure out how to convert your bottle
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:52.420]   of fish antibiotics into human -- proper human doses based upon whatever it is that you're
[00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:53.920]   trying to treat.
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:56.320]   Now I don't -- I personally don't like antibiotics.
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:57.440]   I don't want to take them.
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:04.360]   I take them -- I think that what seems to be obvious is that there are many parts and
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:10.400]   many times in the U.S. population that we have consumed too many antibiotics.
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:16.960]   We have killed our gut bacteria unnecessarily and this has led to poorer health.
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:23.360]   And that many times these antibiotics have been abused and thus even many diseases themselves
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:28.640]   are becoming stronger and more able to resist antibiotics.
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:30.520]   I don't think that's particularly controversial.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:31.520]   That's my opinion.
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:34.720]   And so I don't like antibiotics.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:39.980]   And if I'm prescribed them, I ask questions and then if the doctor convinces me, "No,
[00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:41.240]   you really need this," then I'm going to take it.
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:45.080]   And of course you should always do the full course of antibiotics, take it properly as
[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:46.800]   it's prescribed and do the whole thing.
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:49.440]   But the point is I don't like to take pills.
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:50.440]   I don't like to take any medicine.
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:51.600]   I don't like to take any pills.
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:53.240]   I don't like antibiotics.
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:56.800]   But for years I have stocked up on antibiotics.
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:01.200]   And the reason why is very simple.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:06.800]   There could be a situation in which I might need some antibiotics to save my life or someone
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:11.920]   else's life and I might not be able to get them at that time.
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:17.640]   And so I would rather put in place the insurance policy of having some very basic antibiotics
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:25.560]   in my home stored medical supplies so that if my child had an infected wound or something
[00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:29.680]   like that, I would have something to treat it with if I can't get to the hospital and
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:31.560]   actually get a proper treatment.
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:37.680]   So to me it makes all the sense in the world to use antibiotics as they are intended in
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:42.280]   that kind of scenario and to be prepared for it because that might happen.
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:47.760]   So this is the same basic principle that people have applied to horse paste.
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:55.600]   They found out, "Hey, ivermectin could potentially be a useful drug for me and horse paste has
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:51:01.920]   it, so let me go and get some in case I can't get it because I know that the horse paste
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:02.920]   is available.
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:05.160]   I may or may not be able to get a prescription for ivermectin.
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:10.320]   I may or may not be able to get my hands on ivermectin, but I know that the horse paste
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:13.840]   is there, so let me go and get it."
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:16.080]   So this became quite the controversy in the United States.
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:21.200]   Joe Rogan was accused many times of having taken horse dewormer and you can see here
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:27.400]   in Sarah's argument to me here that when she says this statement, again let me reread
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:35.680]   you what she said, "Joshua, whatever media rabbit hole you've gone down, please stop.
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:38.000]   Ivermectin isn't people medicine."
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.680]   Again I repeat, ivermectin isn't people medicine.
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:44.540]   Now is that true?
[00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:49.360]   Is it true that ivermectin isn't people medicine?
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:53.320]   As far as I'm concerned, it's obviously entirely false.
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:54.840]   It's an ignorant statement.
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:52:00.640]   It's my understanding that ivermectin has been at least, the number I heard was 3.7
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:06.440]   billion doses of ivermectin prescribed and taken around the world throughout its history.
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:10.600]   It's my understanding that the guy who invented it received a major prize for having invented
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:14.520]   it and that it's considered to be a miracle drug.
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:19.680]   And so that in and of itself is a completely flawed thing.
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:22.520]   You cannot say ivermectin isn't people medicine.
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:26.480]   It's an FDA approved drug for its particular application.
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:32.560]   The makers of the drug both originally claimed, well they've changed recently, originally
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:38.640]   claimed that it had very, very few side effects, it was very, very safe, etc. until it started
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:42.440]   being used for COVID-19 and then they came out and said, "Well we're not so sure."
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:46.280]   But what is remarkable about this drug is that this drug is off patent.
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:50.400]   So thus it is very cheap and it is widely available around the world, which is why people
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:54.040]   were buying horse paste as a way of getting their hands upon it.
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:55.280]   Now what does all this matter?
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:56.840]   This is just backstory.
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:01.160]   And what I've thus far done is I believe I've made factual statements.
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:05.120]   I don't think that there's anything that I have said in the last 20 minutes or so talking
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:10.480]   about this that is not a simple matter of factual record.
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:14.320]   So here is the next question.
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:20.920]   Is ivermectin an effective treatment of COVID-19?
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:28.240]   Or is ivermectin something that people should take as a prophylactic against COVID-19?
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:32.700]   And here is where we move away from fact into speculation.
[00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:39.240]   But we need to do a good job of absorbing information related to this particular topic.
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:42.500]   Now I'll briefly discuss what I understand the information to be.
[00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:49.720]   First of all, in the United States, the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration, warns against
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:54.960]   taking ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19.
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:54:00.880]   They specifically say, "You should not take it, and we do not think that it is effective."
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:06.600]   I will read you from the FDA fact sheet at FDA.gov, quoting, "Here's what you need to
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:07.880]   know about ivermectin.
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:08.880]   1.
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:13.440]   The FDA has not authorized or approved ivermectin for use in preventing or treating COVID-19
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:15.160]   in humans or animals.
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:18.920]   Ivermectin is approved for human use to treat infections caused by some parasitic worms
[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:21.600]   and head lice and skin conditions like rosacea.
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:22.600]   2.
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:27.560]   The currently available data do not show ivermectin is effective against COVID-19.
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:32.280]   Clinical trials assessing ivermectin tablets for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:34.680]   in people are ongoing.
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:35.680]   3.
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:38.280]   Taking large doses of ivermectin is dangerous.
[00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:39.280]   4.
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:42.320]   If your healthcare provider writes you an ivermectin prescription, fill it through a
[00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:46.040]   legitimate source such as a pharmacy and take it exactly as prescribed.
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:47.080]   5.
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:51.120]   Never use medications intended for animals on yourself or other people.
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:54.800]   Animal ivermectin products are very different from those approved for humans.
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:55:01.320]   Use of animal ivermectin for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 in humans is dangerous."
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:05.600]   And you can go on and understand more of what they have said.
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:13.600]   So the question is, has the FDA here said that ivermectin is not an effective treatment
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:16.800]   of COVID-19?
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:18.200]   Answer is no.
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:24.280]   The FDA has said we have not authorized or approved ivermectin for this use and currently
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:29.000]   available data do not show that ivermectin is effective against COVID-19.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:33.040]   Clinical trials assessing ivermectin tablets for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:34.400]   are ongoing.
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:39.680]   And so we move out of a realm of facts and we move into speculation.
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:43.400]   Now we could contrast the FDA results.
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:48.080]   Probably the best story to contrast it would be what happened in India.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:53.960]   India, if you'll remember, some months ago had a massive surge of COVID-19.
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:58.440]   And in a nation with a billion people, that massive surge was indeed massive.
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:03.560]   We saw news article after news article and video of just heartbreaking scenes from across
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:09.400]   the Indian subcontinent with hospitals full and people dying outside on the streets waiting
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:13.160]   to get in and complete lack of oxygen, etc.
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:22.360]   But then the Indian rates, the rates of infection with COVID-19 had a massive decline, an absolute
[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:24.120]   massive decline.
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:30.040]   And the emergency went from acute crisis to just the kind of the normal ongoing of some
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:32.480]   people infected, some people dying, some people treated.
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:35.660]   And this just massive decline in the rate of infection.
[00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:37.800]   And so you ask, oh, wait a second, what happened?
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:38.800]   What happened?
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:39.800]   Was it vaccination?
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:44.680]   Well, although vaccination rates increased in India, it didn't seem to be vaccination
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:51.480]   because the vaccination rates didn't increase as quickly as some other options.
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:53.120]   Was it some other factor, right?
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:54.120]   Was it seasonal?
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:56.440]   There are many factors that could have it, right?
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:58.600]   Maybe there were more people infected than you knew.
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:00.800]   And so people were reaching natural immunity.
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:02.400]   All of these are good hypotheses.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:07.480]   And I'm sure dozens more that should be tested properly with good data analysis.
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:14.960]   But many people noticed that India had started to send out what they called home medical
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:16.400]   kits.
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:20.600]   And these home medical kits had a number of different things.
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:28.200]   First, they had fairly normal things like face masks, hand sanitizer, alcohol wipes
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:29.200]   and gloves.
[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:31.000]   That's not particularly controversial.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:38.040]   They also include some tools for self-medical monitoring, such as a pulse oximeter and a
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:42.560]   thermometer so that people could figure out how much oxygen was in their blood and measure
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:45.040]   their own personal temperature.
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:46.200]   But what else did they include?
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:56.800]   Well, they included vitamin C tablets, vitamin D tablets, multivitamin tablets with zinc,
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:04.000]   ivermectin, doxycycline, and paracetamol.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.400]   And they gave instructions for people for this use.
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:11.720]   And then they followed up with a regimen of reporting of people calling in and basically
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:15.720]   physicians and government workers from afar monitoring their temperature.
[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:20.000]   So they would be active in monitoring their temperature, monitoring their oxygen levels,
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   et cetera.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:24.080]   But they also gave these drugs and these vitamins.
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:27.260]   So the question here is what happened, right?
[00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:34.520]   There is no proof at the moment that specifically ivermectin caused this massive decrease in
[00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:35.520]   sickness.
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:37.920]   That's unproven.
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:39.040]   It's not known.
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:42.980]   But what is interesting is that all of these substances, this was what the Indian government
[00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:45.080]   chose to send in a home medical kit.
[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:50.760]   And there has been compelling evidence for these things improving results throughout
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:52.400]   the pandemic.
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:57.960]   The vitamin D, the consumption of vitamin D has been since the very early days.
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:03.280]   I've been taking supplementary vitamin D and doing my best to get extra sunshine since
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:06.400]   I don't know how long, but in excess of a year.
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:10.600]   And then making sure that my family take excess vitamin D. Now, will that make sure that I
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:11.880]   don't get COVID?
[00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:16.040]   I don't know of anyone that would say it, but there has seemed to be a good correlation
[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:21.640]   between people with proper vitamin D levels and better, easier cases of COVID.
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:23.920]   And similar things with vitamin C, et cetera.
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:28.200]   And ivermectin is one of those things that might fall into that space.
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:29.880]   And so you have a war of data, right?
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:31.040]   Who is to say, right?
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:35.560]   The FDA says this certain thing, but here we have this other thing from the Indian government.
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:37.880]   Now there's more controversy around the world.
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:41.560]   These are not the only two governments that are involved in this, but you see other governments
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:42.560]   following suit.
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:47.520]   There are a number of Latin American countries that are following suit, sending out these
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:53.160]   home kits and encouraging people to take these drugs and these vitamins to potentially treat
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:54.520]   their symptoms.
[00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:57.920]   But then you have other governments saying, no, you shouldn't do this.
[00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:59.580]   And so that's where we are.
[00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:02.000]   We don't know is the point.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   What do we have?
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:08.360]   Well, we have a lot of anecdotal information, anecdotes that show that, hey, you know what?
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:09.880]   This might be the case.
[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:12.800]   Now, is ivermectin dangerous?
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:15.840]   And if you're wondering when I'm going to get to the money, I promise you in just a
[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:19.920]   moment, but this is important because I'm using this non-financial thing and then I'm
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.840]   going to take it to financial topics.
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:23.200]   Is ivermectin dangerous?
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:29.920]   The FDA says without question that ivermectin can be dangerous if taking in large doses,
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:30.920]   right?
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:34.600]   So they say here, taking large doses of ivermectin is dangerous.
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:38.600]   Now as I've followed this particular argument, I've come across a number of people who talk
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:39.600]   about it.
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.780]   And so let me read you an interesting Twitter thread.
[01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:47.120]   This particular Twitter thread comes from Mark Urema, who according to his unverified
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:54.680]   Twitter profile with 1,220 followers, is the medical director of AHS Poison and Drug Information
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:58.360]   Services from Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:02.560]   He's the section chief of clinical pharmacology and toxicology.
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:04.760]   So Mark says this.
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:12.860]   He's talking about the calls that they are receiving to their poison hotline on ivermectin.
[01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:18.860]   I will read you verbatim, quoting from his tweet thread from 10 days ago, October 5.
[01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:21.660]   He says a thread on some ivermectin poison center calls.
[01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:25.300]   One, took ivermectin horse paste, not vaccinated.
[01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:27.980]   Patient is sure they have COVID, but not tested.
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:30.140]   Feels weird in head, tightness in ears.
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:35.140]   Two, went to use hand sanitizer, but instead used ivermectin lotion in an alcohol base.
[01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:41.340]   Three, children received COVID, parent giving ivermectin afterwards to "prevent negative
[01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:42.900]   reaction to the vaccine."
[01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:46.980]   Four, friend overdosed on ivermectin, now has blurred vision.
[01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:51.780]   Five, patient taking ivermectin prophylaxis, now has nausea and vomiting.
[01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:53.420]   Wife is COVID positive.
[01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:58.260]   Six, patient with COVID pneumonia, O2 sats dropping, has been taking ivermectin for the
[01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:01.700]   past two days, 17,000 UGKG total dose.
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:06.340]   Seven, took ivermectin as COVID prophylaxis, unknown amount ivermectin ingested.
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:09.180]   Currently has GI, upset, vomiting, also drowsy.
[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:13.060]   Eight, family member told patient to take horse ivermectin over a few days for COVID
[01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:15.900]   prophylaxis, took all at once in error.
[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:17.820]   Has nausea, dizzy, floaters in eyes.
[01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:23.540]   Nine, patient COVID positive, family doc prescribed ivermectin, now low blood pressure and saturations,
[01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:26.460]   dehydrated, DX equals COVID, pneumonia.
[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:30.580]   The bottom line from the available, reliable, well-done scientific data is that ivermectin
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:32.780]   does not work for COVID-19.
[01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:36.540]   Reputable scientific groups from around the world have concluded this.
[01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:38.140]   End of tweet thread.
[01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:41.700]   So here are nine responses.
[01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:44.060]   Now here's my question for you, think carefully.
[01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:57.100]   What do these nine stories tell you about the safety and efficacy of ivermectin?
[01:02:57.100 --> 01:03:00.200]   The answer is exactly nothing.
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:01.200]   Exactly nothing.
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.200]   Why?
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:11.000]   Well, these are anecdotal reports of calls from a poison center and we don't know anything
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.460]   about any other ongoing factors.
[01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:20.340]   For example, when I drink too much coffee, I get dizzy and feel weird.
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:27.100]   So it could be that taking ivermectin horse paste causes someone to feel weird in the
[01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:28.500]   head and have tightness in the ears.
[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:31.780]   It could also be that someone took ivermectin horse paste and a lot of coffee like I have
[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:35.980]   done, not meaning not the coffee, not the horse paste.
[01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:40.780]   And so you look at it and you say, okay, well, what do I do?
[01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:42.440]   The answer is it doesn't tell you anything.
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:45.760]   Now contrast that with another anecdote.
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:47.460]   This is from a personal friend of mine.
[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:52.580]   I will read you this anecdote the way that this particular guy wrote it because I think
[01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:54.140]   it is interesting.
[01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:58.180]   So this guy was, he and his wife both had COVID.
[01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:04.820]   His wife was in an extremely serious case of COVID, was in the hospital for weeks and
[01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:06.560]   was at death's door.
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:10.220]   And somebody asked him, what made the answer?
[01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:11.340]   What saved your wife's life?
[01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:13.740]   Now from this guy's answer, I'll just read it to you.
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:19.980]   He says, the answer, a host of anti-inflammatory supplements, the three amino acids which prompt
[01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:26.900]   intracellular growth of glutathione, which COVID strips from your cells, hyperbaric chamber,
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:32.820]   quercetin, NAC, and ivermectin, all of which have a high degree of healing at very low
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:38.620]   cost and if recognized by the CDC and the FDA would then gut the legal foundation for
[01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:41.980]   the EUA that allows these vaccines, blah, blah, blah.
[01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:45.300]   Last October, my wife was in a full-blown cytokine storm.
[01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:50.500]   Our doctor later told us that every one of his patients that went into such a storm died,
[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:52.580]   except for my wife.
[01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:58.100]   The difference, humanly speaking, our son-in-law had put together a regimen of anti-inflammatory
[01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:04.580]   supplements that were smuggled into the hospital and topically applied to her by our daughters.
[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:07.900]   I was on another floor of the hospital with COVID myself.
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:11.140]   I continued these applications after I recovered.
[01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:15.340]   One side effect of these supplements for my wife, after losing most of her hair due to
[01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:20.380]   COVID, it has grown back fuller than before and with a natural curl that her mother hasn't
[01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:22.860]   seen since she was two years old.
[01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:26.940]   A friend recently complimented her on her beautiful perm and was stunned to learn it
[01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:27.940]   wasn't.
[01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:31.340]   We are taking many of these supplements prophylactically now.
[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:32.340]   And he continues.
[01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:38.180]   He says, "I lost my father-in-law and nearly lost my wife due to COVID.
[01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:43.740]   What enrages me is that when our doctor prescribed NAC and healed a woman from COVID-19 and she
[01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:48.540]   was discharged from the hospital two days later, the medical corporation fired him.
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:53.020]   Worse, no one prescribed ivermectin to my father-in-law nor my wife.
[01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:56.620]   There are far more effective and low-cost therapies that have very high efficacy rates
[01:05:56.620 --> 01:06:02.940]   that the medical system and the government are refusing to acknowledge nor promote."
[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:06.380]   Now what should you take from that?
[01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:08.140]   This is an absolute anecdote.
[01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:10.940]   It's an anecdote.
[01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:13.140]   Now here's my question.
[01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:15.900]   Are anecdotes wrong?
[01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:22.300]   Well, if we assume the truthfulness of the anecdote, an anecdote is not wrong.
[01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:24.900]   An anecdote can be very, very useful.
[01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:31.220]   And in your life, you have made many, many decisions based upon anecdotes.
[01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:36.540]   You've had a friend of yours who was successful and said to you, "You should go to college."
[01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:38.260]   So you went to college.
[01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:41.300]   Or you had someone that said, "You would like this country," and you went to the country.
[01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:43.700]   I mean, I don't want to give...
[01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:45.580]   The examples are so mundane.
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:49.860]   And you've had lots of anecdotes and you've taken action off of those anecdotes and have
[01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:51.740]   benefited from them.
[01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:54.580]   But those anecdotes are not proof.
[01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:59.220]   Those anecdotes are potentially evidence, but they need to be carefully understood.
[01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:04.360]   And you need to analyze and say, "What's actually happening here?"
[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:09.260]   But you will deal with those anecdotes differently at different times of your life.
[01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:21.180]   Now again, I do not know whether or not ivermectin is a useful treatment for COVID.
[01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:23.220]   I don't know.
[01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:26.780]   I have read some of the analyses.
[01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:29.460]   I have read many of the articles.
[01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:34.860]   And it is my current opinion that there seems like there could be compelling evidence for
[01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:43.620]   its use in some way, possibly prophylactically, possibly later after the fact.
[01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:47.340]   There's some people studying, is ivermectin useful in treating some of the effects of
[01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:53.100]   long COVID, for those who've had bad results with coronavirus and significant ongoing thing,
[01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:54.220]   is there some way?
[01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:57.620]   And I've read some of the analysis as to why it might work.
[01:07:57.620 --> 01:08:02.220]   But what I have learned from the financial industry is to be very thoughtful about how
[01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:04.640]   I approach this information.
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:09.540]   So I do not know whether or not ivermectin works.
[01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:17.740]   But I will tell you this, I have access to ivermectin.
[01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:26.100]   And if I am diagnosed with COVID, I will immediately deeply research and think again about the data
[01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:30.540]   to try to figure out whether or not I should use it.
[01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:34.780]   And I am inclined to say that I probably would.
[01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:36.500]   Why?
[01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:40.420]   Well here's my first mental model, and this is the meat of what I want to talk to you
[01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:42.460]   about, the first mental model.
[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:50.060]   My first mental model for virtually all decisions is play both sides if possible.
[01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:54.000]   Don't commit until necessary, play both sides until possible.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:01.260]   So when I come up to a piece of data, an argument, a set of facts, a scenario, I always ask myself,
[01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:06.500]   not do I think this is true or not, but I ask myself first, what would I do if this
[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:08.820]   were true?
[01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:14.060]   What would I do if this were true?
[01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:17.220]   And I think about what I would do if this were true.
[01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:23.220]   Then I ask myself, what would I do if this were not true?
[01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:25.980]   What would I do if this were not true?
[01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:27.760]   And like those lists.
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:35.860]   Then I consider the costs of both of those and ask myself if I can just simply act as
[01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:39.420]   if it were true and act as if it were not true and put the relevant things in place.
[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:46.700]   So for example, you can go today to an online pharmacy, there are many of these available
[01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:52.300]   such as alldaychemist.com, and you can purchase for yourself 12 milligram tablets of Ivermectin
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:10:00.460]   for a current cost of, for 30 tablets is $57.50, right, they're $1.67 per tablet.
[01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:06.180]   You can also look and find out that the Indian government sent for their home kits, that
[01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:11.580]   they sent out a package, again, the actual numbers, they sent out paracetamol tablets,
[01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:15.980]   vitamin C tablets, multivitamin tablets with zinc, vitamin D tablets, and they sent out
[01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:21.940]   12 milligram tablets of Ivermectin for a total of 10 tablets and they gave the appropriate
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:23.220]   use protocol.
[01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:28.060]   And so you could purchase 10 milligram tablets, sorry, 10, 12 milligram tablets of Ivermectin
[01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:33.340]   and you could put those in a box and you could create for yourself your own kit with regards
[01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:39.700]   to like the Indian government in one of the states sent out to about 200 million people
[01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:47.700]   living in that state that seemed to possibly have had a good timing result with the decline
[01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:48.700]   of the case.
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:52.300]   And you could buy those and you could put them in your cabinet in case somebody was
[01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:59.140]   associated with, in case somebody was diagnosed with coronavirus.
[01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:03.660]   Now does that mean that those things are effective or not effective?
[01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:05.420]   The answer is you don't need to know.
[01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:08.140]   And so what I look at as I say, is Ivermectin effective?
[01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:10.340]   I say, what would I do if it were true?
[01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:14.020]   The answer is I would buy some and I would have some and I would put together my own
[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:15.020]   kit if it were true.
[01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:17.820]   And I asked myself, what's the cost of doing that?
[01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:18.820]   $50.
[01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:21.700]   What would I do if this were not true?
[01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:26.660]   Well, what I would do if this were not true is I would not take this drug that's a parasite,
[01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:27.780]   an anti-parasite drug.
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:31.980]   I would not take it for an unapproved use of the FDA and I would put it aside.
[01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:32.980]   What would I do if it were true?
[01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:33.980]   I would take the drug.
[01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:36.140]   What would I do if it were not true?
[01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:37.580]   I would not take the drug.
[01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:39.880]   And then you can go down and you can say, well, what are the side effects?
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:43.640]   Are there side effects of taking the 12 milligram tablets of Ivermectin?
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:44.940]   You should research that.
[01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:47.640]   And there's good data to understand about that.
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:50.500]   So what I would first do is I would say, I'm going to play both sides.
[01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:54.420]   I'm going to accumulate the things that I would need because after all, if this is true,
[01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:57.020]   this drug might go into shortfall, et cetera.
[01:11:57.020 --> 01:12:00.020]   And you can do this systematically with all of the things that you hear about.
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:04.980]   For example, you might hear anecdotally that, hey, so-and-so prescribed NAC.
[01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:09.260]   And all of a sudden people are buying NAC and then magically NAC is banned from Amazon.
[01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:10.260]   Huh.
[01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:11.860]   That's strange.
[01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:14.900]   And you might decide that people are completely wrong and completely crazy.
[01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:19.180]   But what will happen is that you will be completely out of luck if it turns out that those people
[01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:21.100]   are right.
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:26.780]   And so if you play both sides of the argument and you prepare yourself and you buy something
[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:29.540]   and you have something, you have the ability to benefit.
[01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:32.420]   Now let's go to financial world.
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:34.860]   Ask you a question.
[01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:39.180]   Is Bitcoin a good investment?
[01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:40.180]   Think about that.
[01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:46.060]   Is Bitcoin a good investment?
[01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:48.500]   Answer should be, I'm not so sure.
[01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:49.500]   Right.
[01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:51.660]   I'm not so sure.
[01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:56.440]   But there is absolutely nothing that has outperformed Bitcoin in the last decade.
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:59.320]   And while I don't know what the long-term future holds, I don't know what will be the
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:04.100]   verdict of history, it's pretty remarkable these anecdotal results that we've received
[01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:07.980]   of Bitcoin and how it's growing and growing and how there's lots of smart, intelligent,
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:12.060]   good business people that are changing their tune and getting into it.
[01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:15.460]   And so how could you have played Bitcoin from the very beginning?
[01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:18.900]   Well you could have said, I'm going to wait for the data to be in, all of the data to
[01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:19.900]   be in.
[01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:24.500]   You could have said, like I did for many years, yeah, you know what, a lot of questions with
[01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:27.540]   it, it would harm my self-image if I were associated with that because I'm a financial
[01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:30.700]   advisor and after all financial advisors, you know, we don't want to get involved with
[01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:34.260]   those speculative things and after all I can't make any money selling Bitcoin so why would
[01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:35.960]   I spend any time reading about it?
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:39.160]   You might warn people against it and you might turn around and recognize later, you know
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:43.240]   what, it would have been easier if I just bought a Bitcoin.
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:48.280]   There is not a single one of us who, if we had just gone and dumped a little bit of money
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:54.480]   into Bitcoin when we first heard about it, would not be very, very wealthy today and
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:59.000]   thankfully many of my listeners did that and are.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.120]   Now meanwhile the entire financial industry, sorry, I almost said medical industry, the
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:08.400]   entire financial industry has ignored it and has dismissed it.
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:15.160]   The US Federal Trade Commission, who is that, Consumer Protection Agency, the CPB, right,
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:18.920]   the Consumer Protection Board hasn't come out and said, yes, you definitely should protect
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:20.320]   yourself against Bitcoin.
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:23.080]   You had to be an early adopter to go out and get it.
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:26.120]   So what would have been the risk of playing Bitcoin?
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:27.560]   How could you have played both sides?
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:30.000]   Well you could have said, what would I do if this is true?
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.400]   What's the cost of doing that?
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:36.040]   So if you thought fundamentally that Bitcoin or whatever the next thing is, gold coins
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:38.800]   or whatever, you could have said, what's the cost of doing that and what would I do if
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:39.800]   this were not true?
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:41.160]   What's the cost of not doing it?
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:45.520]   And I think if you do that, you realize that you can do things for low costs and the potential
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:50.000]   impact of those things, the loss of those things is not that big of a deal as long as
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.840]   you're thoughtful about doing it.
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:57.200]   So by definition, I think it's crazy not to have at this point in time, given the anecdotal
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:03.160]   evidence that is being studied in a more rigorous way, I think it's crazy not to spend 50 bucks
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:11.160]   on a drug that might do something and then not have it available and then you make your
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:12.160]   decision when you need to.
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:13.280]   That's going to be the next thing, right?
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:18.080]   So you play both sides in your game and you say, what would I do if this were true?
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:19.280]   What would I do if this were not true?
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:25.400]   And if the price of actually acting as if it were true is relatively low, then just
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:28.040]   simply do it, right?
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:29.080]   Do it.
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:30.980]   Go out and try it.
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:34.120]   If you can handle the downside of the price, go and do it.
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:39.600]   I can spend 50 bucks on an unproven drug and at least I would know that I've got 12 milligram
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:41.360]   tablets rather than horse paste.
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:45.280]   I can easily spend 50 bucks and never notice it and you can too.
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:50.480]   And then if a couple months from now it turns out that it's true, then hey, at least I've
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:51.800]   got my own supply of this stuff.
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:55.920]   If it turns out in a couple of months from now that it's not true and the data indicates
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:57.960]   that it's not true, oh, no big deal.
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:58.960]   I wasted 50 bucks.
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:02.920]   I'll put it aside and maybe at some point my dog will get worms and I'll ask my veterinarian
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:07.960]   if I can just give him my human pills instead of whatever paste, you know, I'll give it
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:10.960]   someone with a horse and say, stick this in your horse's gullet and then make use of the
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:12.560]   drug.
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:14.960]   It's not that big of a deal is the point.
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:19.240]   And so what happens is people get so emotionally invested into issues and like, I've got to
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:24.760]   prove myself to be right and I'm telling you, this is simply pride and there's no need for
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:25.960]   it.
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:30.200]   This is what I did with Bitcoin and I talked about in that episode where I'd explained,
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:31.200]   right?
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:36.760]   I was so proud about being right that I didn't simply take simple action that would have
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:40.160]   resulted in my being rich.
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:44.400]   And at the end of the day, you come back and you say, well, would I rather have been right
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:45.920]   or rich?
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:49.560]   And then what happens is you go on again and again down this path and you're like, I'm
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:50.560]   going to be right.
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:51.560]   I'm going to prove them all right.
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:55.480]   I'm convinced that hydroxychloroquine is the answer to all of our ills or I'm convinced
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:56.840]   that hydroxychloroquine is a scam.
[01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:59.720]   And in the end, it doesn't matter.
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:04.440]   If I had gotten COVID back then and I was dying, I would be happy for them to try all
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:05.920]   kinds of experimental drugs.
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:06.920]   I'm fine, right?
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:12.000]   It's like if you're given a, if I'm given a diagnosis and the doctor says it's terminal,
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.320]   then I'm going to go and I'm going to collect every possible option that I can.
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:19.800]   I'm going to think about whether or not I should do the proposed treatment.
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:21.400]   I'm going to think about every alternative treatment.
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:24.440]   I'm probably going to do all of the above.
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:27.080]   And who knows what works, but all I care about is the results.
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:30.960]   But you spend so much time trying to be right, trying to say, I got this figured out.
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:34.920]   And the only people that need to worry about it are the actual researchers.
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:36.920]   Let the researchers do their job.
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:39.220]   Let those people work their way through it.
[01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:42.680]   Letting you focus on just simply doing what's useful.
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:44.280]   Don't worry about being right.
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:45.880]   Worry about being rich.
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:48.240]   Don't worry about being right about ivermectin.
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:52.720]   Worry about beating COVID and have a closet full of all the stuff.
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:56.520]   And that's where, like when the COVID treatments, is there any downside to doing vitamin, to
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:58.080]   taking excess vitamin D?
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:01.560]   As long as you're following a reasonable suggestion, the answer is no.
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:04.920]   It's my understanding that many people are highly deficient in vitamin D and that could
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:07.320]   potentially be a problem in many cases.
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:11.680]   So going to Costco and grabbing a bottle of vitamin D and popping a couple of capsules
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:15.780]   in your mouth is just cheap insurance with virtually no downside.
[01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:19.380]   Most vitamins, there's just no downside, even to megadoses.
[01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:20.960]   Not medical advice, check with your doctor.
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:23.020]   Some people have differentiating equations.
[01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:28.540]   But there's just no, right, taking some extra vitamin C and vitamin D, et cetera, and going
[01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:31.980]   outside and getting sunshine and running and all that stuff.
[01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:32.980]   There's no downside.
[01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:35.980]   And yet that has a big potential upside.
[01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:38.620]   So the mental model is play both sides when possible.
[01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:43.020]   And you can do this on the small level and you can do this on the macro level.
[01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:47.220]   One example I use a lot of times is with a question of global warming.
[01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:49.700]   Sorry, human-caused climate change.
[01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:56.060]   And I always ask people the question, are you absolutely sure that your opinion on global
[01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:59.500]   warming is absolutely correct?
[01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:05.840]   I cannot understand how anybody would answer that question in an absolute yes.
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:11.740]   When you understand the variables and the underlying data, when you understand all of
[01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:17.820]   the underlying arguments and you understand how new these models are and all of the garbage
[01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:22.220]   that could potentially be going in, that could potentially be creating garbage out, it's
[01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:27.100]   so difficult for me to believe that anybody could be with absolute certainty on the question
[01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:29.940]   on either side of it.
[01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:30.940]   My answer is simpler.
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:36.480]   I look at it and I say, what would I do if I were absolutely convinced that the earth
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:40.140]   was rising at potentially a catastrophic rate?
[01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:41.140]   What would I do?
[01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:45.080]   Then I ask myself, what would I do if I weren't convinced of it?
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.300]   And I make a list of those things.
[01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:51.540]   And then all the things that I can do that I think would protect me in that scenario,
[01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:52.540]   I do.
[01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:56.900]   All the things that I don't do, that I'm not willing to do, too high of a price, I put
[01:19:56.900 --> 01:20:01.180]   it aside and I come back to it later when the evidence is clearer.
[01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:06.300]   So you know, give me an example, just a practical example.
[01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:07.300]   I'm trying again to use non-medical.
[01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:11.260]   Because to me, I think that if you see this, it makes your decision simpler.
[01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:16.220]   What would I do if I were convinced that sea levels were rising dramatically and there
[01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:19.020]   was a potential for massive floods?
[01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:22.700]   Well, the first thing I would do is I would want to have access to be able to live in
[01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:24.820]   a place where that's not a problem.
[01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:32.020]   Now, being a US citizen, I have easy access to many places that would benefit from a few
[01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:35.580]   degree increase in the global climate temperatures.
[01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:40.140]   So I can say, well, maybe I should buy a little house in Maine, or at least have the ability
[01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:44.940]   to go buy a house in Maine later.
[01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:46.740]   So the first thing is done there.
[01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:47.740]   What would I do?
[01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:51.860]   Well, I'd be happy to recycle, be happy to drive less if that makes a difference.
[01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:56.940]   I might not be willing to fly less, like I'm not, but I might be willing to make greener
[01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:59.260]   decisions to the point where they are happy.
[01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:02.940]   We all have a list that we might be able to and willing to do.
[01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:04.900]   Well, what am I not willing to do?
[01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:09.340]   I'm not willing to not live in Florida at the moment because of the potential for rising
[01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:10.500]   sea temperatures.
[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:13.460]   So I make that decision, and let me come back in a few years.
[01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:16.540]   Let me give a couple of years, see what happens in the meantime.
[01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:20.780]   I don't have to make the big decisions that the leader of a country has to make, you know,
[01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:23.860]   or the president of some international council.
[01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:25.700]   They got a much more difficult job than I do.
[01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:27.620]   I don't have to be convinced one way or the other.
[01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:32.340]   I don't have to make this my cause that I'm going to save the world from climate change.
[01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:34.780]   I just say, what would I do if this were true?
[01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:35.780]   What's the cost of doing that?
[01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:36.780]   Am I willing to do it?
[01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:38.140]   What would I do if this were not true?
[01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:39.140]   What's the cost of doing that?
[01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:40.700]   Am I willing to do that?
[01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:42.540]   And then make the adjustment.
[01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:44.500]   Then come back in the future.
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:47.420]   So prepare in advance is the step.
[01:21:47.420 --> 01:21:52.300]   Prepare in advance, take the actions if possible, and then research and analyze when action
[01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:54.300]   is needed.
[01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:56.380]   So back to my little ivermectin thing.
[01:21:56.380 --> 01:21:58.300]   I told you you can get ivermectin.
[01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:03.200]   You can get vitamin D, you can get vitamin C, you can get paracetamol, you can get doxycycline.
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:07.500]   So maybe you put together a little kit like the Indian government sent out that anecdotally
[01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:13.260]   seemed like it may have been one of the factors that aligned with this decrease in COVID severity
[01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:15.860]   and decrease in hospitalizations, a massive decrease in it.
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:16.860]   But we don't know.
[01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:17.860]   What would I not do?
[01:22:17.860 --> 01:22:22.980]   Well, I wouldn't take it unless I needed to and more evidence emerged.
[01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:28.340]   And I would research that and analyze it afresh when action is needed.
[01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:31.120]   Let's use hydroxychloroquine because that's less current.
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:35.220]   Maybe you went out and you bought yourself hydroxychloroquine and you stuck it in your
[01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:36.660]   cabinet.
[01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:39.660]   Then I would come up to it and you would say, "Hey, I'm sick.
[01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:41.180]   I've got a COVID diagnosis.
[01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:43.420]   Should I take this stuff?"
[01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:44.740]   Well that's when you research it.
[01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:48.220]   And then you say, "What's the latest data?
[01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:49.220]   What's the analysis?
[01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:51.620]   Let me look at the papers, try to get an idea of it.
[01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:53.340]   Talk to some knowledgeable professionals."
[01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:57.380]   That's when you make your decision is when you actually have to make a decision.
[01:22:57.380 --> 01:23:00.280]   Now taking it prophylactically is different.
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:03.340]   But when you're researching it, that's when you do a self-assessment, right?
[01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:04.660]   What are the risk factors?
[01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:06.540]   What are the risk factors of my taking this?
[01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:09.100]   What are the risk factors of my not taking it?
[01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:15.860]   There are people right now dying every day who have been fully doubly vaccinated, but
[01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:18.340]   they're dying.
[01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:24.100]   Far fewer than if they weren't doubly vaccinated, but they are happening.
[01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:26.340]   So the risk is not zero.
[01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:28.620]   And so then you look and you say, "Am I willing to take this drug?"
[01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:31.260]   It's kind of how I am with even simple things, right?
[01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:32.740]   I don't like to take painkillers.
[01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:33.740]   I don't want to do it.
[01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:35.980]   I don't want extra drugs in my body.
[01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:40.420]   But the risk of my taking a painkiller is pretty low if I really need it.
[01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:42.740]   And so I'm just going to take it.
[01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:43.740]   It's not that big a deal.
[01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:45.620]   So I hope I'm not oversimplifying it.
[01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:51.740]   The point is that prepare in advance, play both sides, and then only research and analyze
[01:23:51.740 --> 01:24:00.820]   and commit using the best available data when it's actually necessary for you to do so.
[01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:02.220]   That's my play both sides mental model.
[01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:03.860]   I hope you find it useful.
[01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:09.180]   What I have found is that every time I've done it, I've just gone out and bought something.
[01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:13.780]   Gone out and bought a whole life insurance policy, bought a stock, bought a mutual fund,
[01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:20.780]   opened an IRA, bought Bitcoin, bought an NFT.
[01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:25.340]   Every time I do this, I wind up putting myself in a situation where I'm more knowledgeable
[01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:26.840]   from the process.
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:31.500]   And so instead of sitting back and crossing my arms and trying to be right, I get involved
[01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:36.900]   and I actually learn what's happening based upon actually doing it.
[01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:38.700]   Based upon actually doing it.
[01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:39.700]   Next.
[01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:42.340]   What's the next one?
[01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:48.740]   Consider the sources of your information very, very carefully.
[01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:53.380]   Let's assume that nobody has ulterior motives.
[01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:58.020]   Let's assume that everyone has the best of intentions, the best of motives.
[01:24:58.020 --> 01:25:02.620]   Your doctor has the best of intentions, your financial advisor has the best of intentions,
[01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:04.820]   the best of motives all across the board.
[01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:06.140]   Nobody is trying to swindle you.
[01:25:06.140 --> 01:25:07.420]   Nobody is trying to do anything wrong.
[01:25:07.420 --> 01:25:09.820]   Assume the best.
[01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:18.420]   The average professional practitioner has exactly zero involvement with any actual cutting
[01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:21.500]   edge research.
[01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:27.860]   When I was a financial advisor, a highly credentialed, fully licensed financial advisor, making my
[01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:37.860]   living, giving financial advice, I had no involvement whatsoever with any cutting edge
[01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:45.980]   research and I was no more qualified to comment on it than any other layperson.
[01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:47.500]   Why?
[01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:50.340]   Well because we all have a certain business model.
[01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:53.460]   When I was a financial advisor, my business model was simple.
[01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:58.140]   Sell insurance, sell investments, manage money, do financial plans.
[01:25:58.140 --> 01:25:59.700]   That's what I did.
[01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:02.740]   Sell life insurance, sell disability insurance, sell long term care insurance.
[01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:07.980]   Prior to ACA I sold health insurance.
[01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:15.660]   Sell 529s, Roth IRAs, sell annuities, bring assets over, roll over 401ks, manage money,
[01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:18.020]   do financial plans, prospect for new customers.
[01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:19.020]   That was the business model.
[01:26:19.020 --> 01:26:21.540]   That was it.
[01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:26.940]   I had an interest in a lot of things, but I had no more qualifications than anybody
[01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:31.500]   else to actually say what the future was.
[01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:36.260]   I had a little bit more exposure and familiarity with the language, but I didn't have any more
[01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:43.420]   qualifications to actually sit down and read a study, to read a white paper on Bitcoin.
[01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:45.580]   And so for years I gave the same basic advice.
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:46.580]   What was it?
[01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:51.220]   It was a repeating of advice that sounded good to me.
[01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:55.380]   It was a repeating of, "Hey, this makes sense to me and so let me share this with other
[01:26:55.380 --> 01:26:57.100]   people."
[01:26:57.100 --> 01:26:58.500]   Now I was well-intentioned.
[01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:01.300]   I was honest.
[01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:05.300]   And at least with regard to the example I'm using here with Bitcoin, I was profoundly
[01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:07.700]   wrong.
[01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:10.620]   Profoundly wrong.
[01:27:10.620 --> 01:27:15.900]   Now compare that to any other area of your life.
[01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:23.580]   Your average health professional probably, with the exception of personal interests,
[01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:27.540]   probably is just simply not qualified to answer any of these questions.
[01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:34.260]   Here's my example of what I would ask a medical professional.
[01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:38.740]   And I think this is a reasonable question.
[01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:39.980]   What can I do?
[01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:47.580]   In addition to getting vaccinated, in addition to washing my hands, in addition to wearing
[01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:50.780]   a mask, okay, let's just grant all those.
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:58.980]   What can I do to improve my experience with COVID so that if and when I get COVID I have
[01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:02.580]   an easier time of it?
[01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:09.020]   I think a question like that should reveal a lot about someone.
[01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:12.700]   By the way, there's lots of financial versions of this that you can ask a financial advisor.
[01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:19.100]   To your financial advisor, let's assume that I wanted to get 15% per year every year.
[01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:23.100]   How could I do that?
[01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:28.580]   If a financial advisor doesn't have an answer to that, they're not in the game.
[01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:30.100]   They're not in the game.
[01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:32.580]   And you accept it.
[01:28:32.580 --> 01:28:38.780]   So this is one of my major issues with watching the health stuff is that what advice have
[01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:44.300]   you received from the US CDC, the people that are paid to deliver this stuff, what advice
[01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:51.540]   have you received from the US CDC to help, possibly help, improve your experience with
[01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:52.540]   coronavirus?
[01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:57.420]   Well, you're told wear a mask, but first you were told don't wear a mask, then you were
[01:28:57.420 --> 01:29:02.860]   told do wear a mask, then don't wear a mask, then do wear a mask.
[01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:06.740]   And then when you dig into that, well, they lied to you again and again and again and
[01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:07.740]   again.
[01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:09.580]   Okay, so let's set aside the mask thing.
[01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:10.580]   Wash your hands.
[01:29:10.580 --> 01:29:14.380]   Okay, I'll wash my hands.
[01:29:14.380 --> 01:29:15.820]   Get a vaccine.
[01:29:15.820 --> 01:29:17.060]   Okay.
[01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:19.540]   What else can I do?
[01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:26.780]   The US medical system is utterly incompetent at helping people build good health.
[01:29:26.780 --> 01:29:32.140]   Now, there are exceptions, sure, but on the whole, the system is absolutely failing people.
[01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:33.500]   I don't understand.
[01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:34.500]   Maybe I'm ignorant.
[01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:42.020]   I wholeheartedly concede that that might be the case, but I'm not aware of the US medical
[01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:45.740]   establishment coming out and saying, "Hey, you probably should make sure that you check
[01:29:45.740 --> 01:29:48.180]   your vitamin D levels."
[01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:53.660]   That seems like the very most basic thing that is not that controversial, and yet they
[01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:54.660]   don't do it.
[01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:55.660]   Why not?
[01:29:55.660 --> 01:29:57.100]   Well, there could be various reasons, right?
[01:29:57.100 --> 01:29:58.100]   You can go hardcore conspiracy.
[01:29:58.100 --> 01:30:00.620]   You could say, "Well, then maybe there's not enough data."
[01:30:00.620 --> 01:30:03.860]   But what's the harm of your taking vitamin D?
[01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:06.060]   Having some zinc supplementation.
[01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:07.540]   What's the harm of trying ivermectin?
[01:30:07.540 --> 01:30:09.300]   Now, they can't do it, and that's the point, right?
[01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:12.020]   They can't be involved in cutting-edge stuff.
[01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:16.060]   The US financial system and the financial advice system, on the whole, is utterly incompetent
[01:30:16.060 --> 01:30:17.260]   at helping people build wealth.
[01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:19.260]   They don't know how to do it.
[01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:21.860]   They don't have a clue.
[01:30:21.860 --> 01:30:28.180]   Your average financial advisor does not have an answer of how to build wealth other than
[01:30:28.180 --> 01:30:32.740]   save some money, lower your taxes, and buy mutual funds.
[01:30:32.740 --> 01:30:34.020]   That's it.
[01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:35.020]   Why?
[01:30:35.020 --> 01:30:38.220]   Well, because that's what they have been trained by, and that's what they see.
[01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:42.260]   That's the world of opportunity, and everything is put through that lens.
[01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:47.820]   You have to go to a different world if you want different advice.
[01:30:47.820 --> 01:30:50.100]   Understand how the game is rigged.
[01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:57.180]   Understand who controls the game, and consider your sources very, very carefully.
[01:30:57.180 --> 01:31:02.420]   Understand where you can go for the best information, or at least the best examples.
[01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:07.300]   One of the reasons I started Radical Personal Finance was I came to realize that, as a financial
[01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:11.180]   advisor, I wasn't very good at helping people get wealthy.
[01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:13.420]   I was good at helping wealthy people stay wealthy.
[01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:17.700]   I was good at helping people save some money, but I wasn't good at helping people get wealthy.
[01:31:17.700 --> 01:31:20.780]   Where can you go for information on actually how to get wealthy?
[01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:24.400]   You often find it, paradoxically, in the anecdotes.
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:28.380]   You go to a billionaire, and you say, "How did this billionaire become a billionaire?"
[01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:31.820]   You go to somebody who's deeply in debt, and who gets out of debt, and you say, "How did
[01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:36.160]   this guy get from deeply out of debt to becoming debt-free?"
[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:42.300]   Over the years, I've found that those things are far more helpful than the mainstream advice.
[01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:45.380]   The mainstream, by way of analogy, what's the mainstream advice?
[01:31:45.380 --> 01:31:50.380]   Well, the mainstream advice in financial planning is pay your bills on time, put money in your
[01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:56.540]   401(k) and your IRA, and buy life insurance.
[01:31:56.540 --> 01:31:57.540]   Is there anything wrong with that?
[01:31:57.540 --> 01:31:58.540]   No, it's not.
[01:31:58.540 --> 01:32:00.140]   But does that get people unstuck?
[01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:01.460]   Does that get people out of debt?
[01:32:01.460 --> 01:32:02.460]   No.
[01:32:02.460 --> 01:32:03.460]   So where do you see results?
[01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:05.500]   Well, you could go to Dave Ramsey, right?
[01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:06.500]   "Hardcore!
[01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:07.500]   Go hardcore and get out of debt."
[01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:09.220]   Well, we're getting results here.
[01:32:09.220 --> 01:32:12.180]   But Dave says things that are clearly wrong, right?
[01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:17.900]   Dave says, "Ignore the interest rates on your debt and pay them off from smallest to largest."
[01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:18.900]   Clearly wrong.
[01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:24.940]   Except Dave has helped more people pay off debt than any other human alive.
[01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:27.140]   I can't back the state up.
[01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:29.860]   I can't prove that, but it's a lot, right?
[01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:34.900]   So you say, "Well, it's clearly wrong, but it clearly works."
[01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:37.780]   And so many times I've heard this advice, right?
[01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:41.220]   You sit and you talk with anybody who understands math and you say, "Yeah, you got to pay off
[01:32:41.220 --> 01:32:43.900]   your highest interest rate debt first."
[01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:50.300]   And yet Dave, with paying off lowest amount first, has helped more people pay off debt
[01:32:50.300 --> 01:32:53.860]   than I think anybody else alive.
[01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:55.660]   Or you say, "Well, what else can you do?"
[01:32:55.660 --> 01:32:58.940]   And you find some guy who gets out of debt by—this is a guy I had on the show years
[01:32:58.940 --> 01:33:01.980]   ago—by flipping washing machines on Craigslist.
[01:33:01.980 --> 01:33:02.980]   That's amazing!
[01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:08.060]   And you start to see, look, you too can flip washing machines on Craigslist.
[01:33:08.060 --> 01:33:10.140]   And so these stories are often very good.
[01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:13.080]   So go into the health space, right?
[01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:14.940]   Who are the people who are really useful?
[01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:19.260]   Well, the 500-pound guy who turns into the 170-pound guy.
[01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:24.420]   He often can teach more than the doctor who's 30 pounds overweight.
[01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:29.220]   Or the guy who had all kinds of debilitating issues and Crohn's disease and this autoimmune
[01:33:29.220 --> 01:33:33.180]   thing and that problem and says, "Look, I did all this stuff and now it's all in the
[01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:34.180]   background."
[01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:37.420]   Now, can the medical guys prove it?
[01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:38.860]   Often not.
[01:33:38.860 --> 01:33:40.700]   Or they're still arguing about what goes with it.
[01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:44.280]   But then somebody will hear it and they'll say, "I tried it and look, it fixed my problems
[01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:46.000]   too."
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.520]   So I wouldn't say, "Here, the filters are important."
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:50.520]   Does that prove that this is the case?
[01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:51.520]   No, it doesn't, right?
[01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:55.000]   There's no substitute for good double-blind study, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.100]   There's no substitute for that.
[01:33:57.100 --> 01:34:00.660]   But a lot of times that stuff takes too long.
[01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:04.540]   It takes too long for that to develop and you need answers.
[01:34:04.540 --> 01:34:09.320]   So if I'm sick in the hospital with COVID and I'm in a cytokine storm, I hope that people
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:13.800]   will come in and rub whatever those things were on my body in addition to everything,
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:19.080]   all the other treatments that I'm getting because I'll try anything if it'll help me.
[01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:22.560]   And here's what I've noticed about radical personal finance listeners.
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:25.560]   There's a big difference between those who listen to the show and those who listen to
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:27.000]   the show who take action.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.680]   I routinely speak with consulting clients who say, "Yeah, you know, you did this show
[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:36.680]   with so-and-so and I went and I bought his course and I did his thing and now I got rich."
[01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:39.800]   Or "You did the show about the thing and I went and researched it and I put all my money
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:42.280]   in it and look, I got rich and thank you."
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:45.760]   And I'm thinking, "Man, I didn't even do that, right?
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:51.340]   I didn't even go and take the course and do the thing and you did it and it worked."
[01:34:51.340 --> 01:34:57.380]   So if you understand the risks of certain things and you move yourself into a bias for
[01:34:57.380 --> 01:35:02.200]   action, I think that's the proper mindset to have.
[01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:03.200]   Study what you're doing.
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:04.320]   Don't be a fool, right?
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:09.840]   Don't pump a bottle of horse dewormer down your face.
[01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:13.600]   Understand the risks of what you're doing, but be the kind of person who doesn't just
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:16.760]   sit back and say, "I'm going to wait for everyone to agree."
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:21.800]   Because by the time everyone agrees, you're old and fat and dead, right?
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:26.840]   There are people who still think that eating a low-fat diet is the key to good health.
[01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:31.360]   Those people are also 75 years old and in terrible health because they've been eating
[01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:35.000]   a low-fat diet their entire life as that was the key to it.
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:38.320]   And when you look at like the medical stuff and you see how excruciatingly slow and how
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:43.080]   fundamentally wrong the opinion is, there's still people that think that eggs are unhealthy.
[01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:48.020]   There's people that believe that meat is bad for you, a lot of them.
[01:35:48.020 --> 01:35:51.920]   There's people that believe that chiropractic care is a scam.
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:57.160]   And what happens is these people live on the thrill of being right.
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:36:00.840]   They live on the thrill of it and they never admit they're wrong.
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:02.640]   They just love to be right.
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:04.080]   I have been one of them.
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:07.280]   That's how I recognize it.
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:09.140]   It doesn't serve you.
[01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:14.060]   Be the kind of person who takes action and who tries everything as long as the results
[01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:17.320]   are or as long as the risks are reasonable.
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:23.080]   All right, give me an example.
[01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:24.360]   Acupuncture.
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:28.760]   I personally think acupuncture is probably a scam.
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:31.120]   I've read all the debunking of the natural health stuff.
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:33.560]   I've read all the anti-chiropractic stuff.
[01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:35.640]   I've read all the stuff.
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:39.680]   I think it's probably a scam.
[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:41.480]   Meaning acupuncture, not chiropractic care.
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:45.280]   I think chiropractic care is vital.
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:48.320]   Then my wife and I were expecting one of our children.
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:52.880]   The estimated due date was about three or four or five days in the rear.
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:57.400]   And as with all things, we said we're going to do anything possible that might possibly
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:36:58.480]   work.
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:00.280]   So what did we do?
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:02.520]   We ate spicy food.
[01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:05.780]   Do I think spicy food induces childbirth?
[01:37:05.780 --> 01:37:06.780]   Probably not.
[01:37:06.780 --> 01:37:08.660]   I think that's probably an old wives tale.
[01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:09.660]   Probably not.
[01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:14.200]   But there's no downside to eating lots of spicy food.
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:15.280]   We had lots of sex.
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:17.520]   Do I think sex induces childbirth?
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:19.400]   That makes sense that maybe so.
[01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:22.580]   But regardless, there's no downside, only upside.
[01:37:22.580 --> 01:37:24.800]   So let's do that.
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:26.840]   Go to chiropractic care.
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:30.720]   Do I think chiropractic care and a good adjustment by someone who's trained in those techniques
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:37.360]   for pregnant mothers and children, do I think that that is going to induce childbirth?
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:38.600]   Maybe.
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:41.320]   But we sort of tried it because there's no downside.
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:44.000]   And then with this particular child, we went and did acupuncture.
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.940]   Do I think acupuncture actually helps?
[01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:48.960]   I'm pretty skeptical.
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:51.000]   But we went ahead and did acupuncture.
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:55.040]   And a couple days later, maybe a day or two later, we had a baby.
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:38:03.100]   Now which of those things was the cause for the child coming when the baby came?
[01:38:03.100 --> 01:38:05.360]   Could potentially have been none of them.
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:09.240]   Just that her body had decided this is the appropriate gestational period for this particular
[01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:11.400]   child and it's time to have the baby.
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:14.080]   Or it could have been influenced by all those other things.
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:16.600]   And so you see the, hopefully you see the point.
[01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:18.340]   Any one of those could have been important.
[01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:19.640]   Maybe it was the whole thing.
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:24.200]   But if you're the kind of person who says, "Hey, downside risk of this is pretty low.
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:25.320]   Can we do it?"
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:30.560]   What happens is you get results and you can't prove why you got results.
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:36.180]   But a lot of time that anecdotal evidence, there's some real power in it.
[01:38:36.180 --> 01:38:39.840]   Make your own risk reward decisions with the best information you have at the time that
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:43.640]   you have to make those decisions.
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:45.280]   Stay current.
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:50.240]   Get the best current information when you actually need to make the decisions.
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:52.320]   That's when you go looking for the information.
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:54.000]   Just in time learning.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.320]   Learning and saying, "Hey, you know what?
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:57.120]   I need to make this decision now.
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:01.640]   That's when I'm going to go and learn about it."
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:09.920]   Finally, understand that the past is not the present.
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:10.920]   Past is not the present.
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:16.120]   And the past does not determine the present or the future.
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:17.120]   What do I mean?
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:21.600]   A lot of times people make this fundamental error where they say, "Hey, this has happened
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:22.600]   in the past.
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:24.840]   This is the way things were in the past."
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:27.960]   And they extrapolate that automatically to the future and think that that's somehow an
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:28.960]   argument.
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:31.760]   And it's simply not.
[01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:38.640]   Think for example about what was the last war that the United States of America won?
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:39.640]   World War II.
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:42.480]   That was the last time that the United States of America won a war.
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:44.600]   You could argue, "Well, maybe Desert Storm.
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:47.080]   I don't count it as a war."
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:51.000]   For a variety of reasons, the United States no longer seems to declare a war.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:54.440]   But you could say, "Okay, maybe they won the Desert Storm battle."
[01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:56.720]   But think the last time the United States won a war.
[01:39:56.720 --> 01:39:58.800]   World War II.
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:02.120]   Now since World War II, the United States of America has lived under this halo that
[01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:05.380]   we're the most mighty military empire on earth.
[01:40:05.380 --> 01:40:08.320]   Whatever we do, we win.
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:11.840]   We spend more money on a military than the next eight countries combined, or whatever
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:16.380]   the actual number is.
[01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:21.260]   Did that mean that the United States won the war in Afghanistan?
[01:40:21.260 --> 01:40:23.580]   No.
[01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:29.260]   Just like the Korean War and the Vietnam War and Desert Storm, sort of, kind of, and the
[01:40:29.260 --> 01:40:34.140]   war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan was soundly lost.
[01:40:34.140 --> 01:40:37.700]   So did the past determine the future?
[01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:40.660]   You can't make an argument, "Well, look, the United States won World War II, so therefore
[01:40:40.660 --> 01:40:41.660]   we win the next one."
[01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:42.660]   Why not?
[01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:44.980]   Because everything is its own situation.
[01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:48.400]   Now you can study the past and you can try to understand, what was it?
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:51.300]   Why did these things work?
[01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:56.120]   But you can't automatically predict the future based upon those.
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:57.300]   So what can you do?
[01:40:57.300 --> 01:40:59.300]   Well, recognize that the future is open.
[01:40:59.300 --> 01:41:04.360]   So for example, back in the financial space, the techniques and the tools that worked to
[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:10.200]   build wealth during the 19th century didn't necessarily work in the 20th century.
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:12.220]   Some of them did, some of them didn't.
[01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:17.540]   The things that worked in the 20th century might or might not work in the 21st century.
[01:41:17.540 --> 01:41:21.740]   Some might work and some might not work.
[01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:26.780]   So you need to understand the past and be informed by it, but always keep your mind
[01:41:26.780 --> 01:41:30.960]   open to the fact that the future might be different.
[01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:35.960]   Up until coronavirus, the coronavirus vaccines, we'd had a famously difficult time creating
[01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:38.960]   vaccines for viruses, right?
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:41.780]   And so there are many people that said, "We'll never create a successful vaccine for the
[01:41:41.780 --> 01:41:43.720]   coronavirus, get over it."
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:45.220]   Were those people right?
[01:41:45.220 --> 01:41:48.200]   No, they were wrong.
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:49.200]   What made the difference?
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:52.920]   I don't know, but there was a difference.
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:42:00.920]   Now by extension, flip side of it, maybe taking a measles vaccine is a great idea.
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:05.300]   That doesn't automatically mean that taking a coronavirus vaccine is a great idea.
[01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:07.200]   You have to look at each thing by itself.
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:09.520]   And so what can you do as a person?
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:12.520]   I think the best mental model here is to say, "I'm going to be open.
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:14.800]   I'm going to be open to follow the data.
[01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:17.640]   I'm going to be open to listening to the anecdotes.
[01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:19.200]   I'm going to be open to thinking.
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:21.280]   I'm going to be informed by the past.
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:27.080]   I'm going to try to play both sides when I can, do what I'm capable of, and then just
[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:31.520]   try to make the best decisions for me right now at the moment with the evidence that I
[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:34.080]   have available."
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:35.080]   Things change.
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:36.080]   Data changes.
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:37.320]   The science changes.
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:38.520]   Things change.
[01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:39.520]   Stay current.
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:43.480]   I said final thing, and then I realized I forgot this last thing.
[01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:48.520]   Pay careful attention to who is talking to you and what their vested interests are.
[01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:51.520]   It's probably good to assume that a lot of people are lying to you when they prove themselves
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:54.880]   to have lied to you again and again and again.
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:59.520]   But stay current and think about it.
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:02.800]   When you see, think about what the interests are.
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:05.800]   For example, who is reporting the news to you and what interest do they have?
[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:11.880]   Well, the people that are reporting the news to you have a product that they sell, and
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:16.280]   that product is eyeballs.
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:21.000]   So the way that they get eyeballs is controversy.
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.520]   Anything that can happen to bring eyeballs allows more ad revenue.
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:26.520]   Controversy sells.
[01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:31.440]   So that's where, when you think about the Ivermectin horse dewormer stuff, it's so stupid,
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:32.440]   right?
[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:36.440]   I saw this comment on Twitter, not originally with me, but I love the saying.
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:43.200]   Calling Ivermectin horse dewormer is like calling water engine coolant.
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:44.920]   Sorry.
[01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:53.400]   Calling Ivermectin horse dewormer is like calling water engine coolant.
[01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:55.160]   Is water used for engine coolant?
[01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:56.160]   Absolutely.
[01:43:56.160 --> 01:43:57.880]   Is Ivermectin used for horse dewormer?
[01:43:57.880 --> 01:43:58.960]   Absolutely.
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:06.080]   But to say that somehow you're being honest in saying that Ivermectin is horse dewormer,
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:09.200]   and that's what Joe Rogan took, is absurd.
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:10.720]   Absolutely absurd.
[01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:13.160]   But yet, what happened?
[01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:16.080]   What happened yesterday, the last day or two, right?
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:21.760]   Dr. Sanjay Gupta went on Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan pressed him on this, and even just recently
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:25.760]   now Don Lemon is interviewing Sanjay Gupta and saying it's not a lie to say that Ivermectin
[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:26.760]   is a horse dewormer.
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:27.760]   Right?
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:28.760]   It's not a lie.
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:29.760]   It's not a lie.
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:30.920]   It's not a lie about it.
[01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:31.920]   See through this stuff.
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:32.920]   Okay?
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:33.920]   Who is reporting the news to you?
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:34.920]   What interest do they have?
[01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:36.680]   Who's reporting the stuff to you?
[01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:37.680]   What interest do they have?
[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:40.120]   And you have to learn to feed through it.
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:42.280]   In conclusion, we live in an information age.
[01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:43.280]   Okay?
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:45.400]   All of us are going to have to enhance our skills.
[01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:48.240]   When you fall for a hoax, study why you fell for it.
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:49.760]   We're all going to do it.
[01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:50.840]   Okay?
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:55.560]   It won't surprise me at all if six months from now we discover that, you know what,
[01:44:55.560 --> 01:45:02.200]   Ivermectin was totally useless and all of the indications that we had for its usefulness,
[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:04.680]   potentially usefulness, yeah, it was wrong.
[01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:07.360]   It was totally useless.
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:10.720]   Maybe a year from now we'll say vitamin D was totally useless.
[01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:11.720]   Maybe so.
[01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:12.720]   Okay?
[01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:14.200]   I'm going to be okay with that.
[01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:16.680]   So ask yourself, why did I get it wrong?
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:21.760]   Now on the flip side, if you fell for a hoax like Ivermectin is not people medicine, or
[01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:26.840]   if you fell for a hoax like Ivermectin is horse dewormer, then ask yourself, why did
[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:29.160]   I fall for a hoax?
[01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:31.320]   Why did I not understand that?
[01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:32.320]   Now what else?
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:36.360]   If you fell for a hoax like all you need to do is put money in your Roth IRA and you're
[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:38.800]   going to be good, yeah, not going to work.
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:40.560]   Why did I fall for that?
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:48.960]   If you fell for a hoax like Bitcoin, you know, Bitcoin has no value, why did I fall for that?
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:53.040]   Gold coins are a waste of money, nobody should invest in gold, they should only buy stocks.
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:54.040]   Why?
[01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:58.240]   And I think if you'll develop this curious personality and test things, refrain from
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:02.280]   trying to be right all the time and just try things.
[01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:06.720]   Being right all the time is a very draining position to have to hold because you're arguing
[01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:09.560]   with everybody all the time.
[01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:15.880]   Be curious, be curious, be interested and be the kind of person willing to take action,
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:19.000]   not the kind of person just going around trying to be right.
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.920]   As a former Mr. Right, those are my thoughts.
[01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:22.960]   Thank you for listening.
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:25.200]   If you think I'm wrong about something, I would love to hear from you.
