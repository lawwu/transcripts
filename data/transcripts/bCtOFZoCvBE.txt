[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   - So let me ask you about automation.
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.600]   That's been a part of public discourse recently.
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.200]   What's your view on the impact of automation?
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.640]   Of whether we're talking about AI
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.320]   or more basic forms of automation on the economy
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.520]   in the short term and the long term?
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.120]   Do you have concerns about it as some do?
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.760]   Or do you think it's overblown?
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.880]   - It's not overblown, I mean, it's a giant thing.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.680]   It'll come at us in a very big way in the future.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.840]   We're right at the edge of even really accelerating it.
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.120]   It's had a big impact and it will have a big impact.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.800]   And it's a two-edged sword
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.800]   because it'll have tremendous benefits.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.980]   And at the same time, it has profound benefits
[00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.820]   in employment and distributions of wealth.
[00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.560]   Because the way I think about it is,
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.920]   there are certain things human beings can do.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.240]   And over time, we've evolved to go
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.740]   to almost higher and higher levels.
[00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.680]   And now we're almost like we're at this level.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.760]   It used to be your labor and you would then do your labor
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.320]   and okay, we can get past the labor.
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.560]   We got tractors and things and you go up, up, up, up, up.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.680]   And we're up over here.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.160]   And up to the point in our minds where, okay,
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.440]   anything related to mental processing,
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.920]   the computer can probably do better and we can find that.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.280]   And so other than almost inventing,
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.820]   you're at a point where the machines
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.040]   and the automation will probably do it better.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.200]   And that's accelerating and that's a force.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.860]   And that's a force for the good.
[00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.860]   And at the same time, what it does is it displaces people
[00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.160]   in terms of employment and changes
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.600]   and it produces wealth gaps and all of that.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.640]   So I think the real issue is that that has to be viewed
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.520]   as a national emergency.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.000]   In other words, I think the wealth gap, the income gap,
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.620]   the opportunity gap, all of those things,
[00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.360]   that force is creating the problems
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.320]   that we're having today.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.480]   A lot of the problems, the great polarity,
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.440]   the disenfranchised, not equal,
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.160]   not anything approaching equality of education,
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.000]   all of these problems, a lot of problems
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.760]   are coming as a result of that.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.880]   And so it needs to be viewed really
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.880]   as an emergency situation in which there's a good work,
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.760]   good plan worked out for how to deal with that effectively
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.520]   so that it's dealt with effectively.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.000]   So because it's good for the average,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.800]   it's good for the impact, but it's not good for everyone
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.320]   and it creates that polarity.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.160]   So it's gotta be dealt with.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.400]   - Yeah, and you've talked about the American dream
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.080]   and that that's something that all people
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.440]   should have an opportunity for
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.040]   and that we need to reform capitalism
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.720]   to give that opportunity for everyone.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.720]   Let me ask on one of the ideas in terms of safety nets
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.240]   that support that kind of opportunity,
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.400]   there's been a lot of discussion
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.120]   of universal basic income amongst people.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.520]   So there's Andrew Yang, who's running on that,
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.240]   he's a political candidate running for president
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.840]   on the idea of universal basic income.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.240]   What do you think about that?
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.000]   Giving $1,000 or some amount of money to everybody
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.680]   as a way to give them the padding,
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.720]   the freedom to sort of take leaps,
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.560]   to take the call for adventure,
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.120]   to take the crazy pursuits?
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.520]   - Before I get right into my thoughts
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.840]   on universal basic income,
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.840]   I wanna start with the notion that opportunity,
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.120]   education, development, creating equality
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.560]   so that people say there's equal opportunity
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.080]   and is the most important thing.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.440]   And then to find out what is the amount,
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.320]   how are you going to provide that?
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.320]   How do you get the money into a public school system?
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.960]   How do you get the teaching?
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.960]   The fleshing out that plan to create equal opportunity
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:33.000]   in all of its various forms is the most pressing thing to do.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.560]   And so that is that.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.680]   - The opportunity, the most important one
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.760]   you're kind of implying is the earlier the better.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.800]   Sort of like opportunity, so education.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.160]   So in the early development of a human being
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.440]   is when you should have the equal opportunities.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.440]   That's the most important.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.260]   - Right.
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.600]   In the first phase of your life,
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.200]   which goes from birth until you're on your own
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.800]   and you're an adult and you're now out there
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.040]   and you deal with early childhood development, okay,
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.360]   and you take the brain and you say what's important?
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.720]   The child care, okay,
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.800]   like it makes a world of difference, for example,
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.840]   if you have good parents who are trying to think about
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.440]   instilling the stability in a non-traumatic environment
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.120]   to provide them, so I would say the good guidance
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.160]   that normally comes from parents
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.840]   and the good education that they're receiving
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:36.560]   are the most important things in that person's development.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.720]   The ability to be able to be prepared to go out there
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.120]   and then to go into a market
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.220]   that's an equal opportunity job market,
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.360]   to be able to then go into that kind of market
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.160]   is a system that creates not only fairness,
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.340]   anything else is not fair,
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.520]   and then in addition to that,
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.760]   it also is a more effective economic system
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.080]   because the consequences of not doing that
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.100]   to a society are devastating.
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.960]   If you look at what the difference in outcomes
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.320]   for somebody who completes high school
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.920]   or doesn't complete high school
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.240]   or does each one of those state changes
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.920]   and you look at what that means in terms of
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.480]   their costs to society, not only themselves,
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.080]   but their cost and incarceration costs
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.880]   and crimes and all of those things,
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.120]   it's economically better for the society
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.120]   and it's fairer if they can get those particular things.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.140]   Once they have those things,
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.640]   then you move on to other things,
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.540]   but yes, from birth all the way through that process,
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:47.180]   anything less than that is bad,
[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.300]   is a tragedy and so on.
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.780]   So that's what I, yeah,
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.020]   those are the things that I'm estimating.
[00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.780]   So what I would want above all else is to provide that.
[00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.140]   So with that in mind,
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.280]   now we'll talk about universal basic income.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.720]   - Start with that, now we can talk about UBI.
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.360]   - Right, because you have to have that.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.500]   Now the question is what's the best way to provide that?
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.800]   So when I look at UBI,
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.320]   I really think is what is going to happen
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.800]   with that $1,000?
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.800]   And will that $1,000 come from another program?
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.840]   Does that come from an early childhood
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.640]   developmental program?
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.640]   Who are you giving the $1,000 to
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.120]   and what will they do for that?
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.140]   - $1,000.
[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.340]   I mean, like my reaction would be,
[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.500]   I think it's a great thing that everybody
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.220]   should have almost $1,000 in their bank and so on.
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.120]   But when do they get to make decisions or who's the parent?
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.460]   A lot of times you can give $1,000 to somebody
[00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.220]   and it could have a negative result.
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.260]   It can have, you know,
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.780]   they can use that money detrimentally,
[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.540]   not just productively.
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.360]   And if that money's coming away
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.900]   from some of those other things
[00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.900]   that are gonna produce the things I want,
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.260]   and you're shifted to, let's say,
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:00.820]   to come in and give a check,
[00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.980]   doesn't mean its outcomes are going to be good
[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.540]   in providing those things that I think
[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.940]   are so fundamental important.
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.980]   If it was just everybody can have $1,000 and use it,
[00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.380]   so when the time comes-- - Use it well.
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.660]   - And use it well, that would be really, really good
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.020]   because it's almost like everybody,
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:20.100]   you'd wish everybody could have $1,000 worth of wiggle room
[00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.060]   in their lives, okay?
[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.380]   And I think that would be great.
[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.440]   I love that.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.780]   But I wanna make sure that these other things
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:29.820]   that are taken care of,
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.780]   so if it comes out of that budget,
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.540]   and I don't want it to come out of that budget
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:36.420]   that's gonna be doing those things,
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.260]   and so you have to figure it out.
[00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.900]   - And you have a certain skepticism
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.380]   that human nature will use,
[00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.860]   may not always, in fact, frequently may not use
[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.060]   that $1,000 for the optimal,
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.380]   to support the optimal trajectory.
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.180]   - Some will and some won't.
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.760]   One of the big advantages of universal basic income
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.040]   is that if you put it in the hands,
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.780]   let's say, of parents who know how to do the right things
[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.320]   and make the right choices for their children
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.440]   'cause they're responsible,
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.240]   and you say, "I'm gonna give them $1,000 wiggle room
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.820]   "to use for the benefit of their children."
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.680]   Wow, that sounds great.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.720]   If you put it in the hands of, let's say,
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.080]   an alcoholic or drug-addicted parent
