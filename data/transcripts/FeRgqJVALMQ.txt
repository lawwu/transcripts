[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.320]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.360]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.280]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.200]   My guest today is Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.680]   Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett is a distinguished professor
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.240]   of psychology at Northeastern University.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.680]   She also holds appointments at Harvard Medical School
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.840]   and Massachusetts General Hospital,
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.920]   where she is the chief scientific officer
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.860]   of the Center of Law, Brain, and Behavior.
[00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.760]   Dr. Barrett is considered one of the top world experts
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.600]   in the study of emotions,
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.400]   and her laboratory has studied emotions using approaches
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.800]   both from the fields of psychology and neuroscience.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.320]   Indeed, today you will learn about the neural circuits
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.680]   and the psychological underpinnings of what we call emotions.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.040]   You will learn what emotions truly are
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.600]   and how to interpret different emotional states.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.520]   You will also learn how emotions relate to things
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.200]   like motivation, consciousness, and affect.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.980]   Affect is a term that refers to a more general state
[00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.840]   of brain and body that increases or decreases
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.980]   the probability that you will experience certain emotions.
[00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.360]   During today's discussion, Dr. Feldman Barrett
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.760]   also teaches us how to regulate our emotions effectively,
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.220]   as well as how to better interpret
[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.120]   the emotional states of others.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.260]   You will also learn about the powerful relationship
[00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.800]   that exists between our emotional states
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.840]   and the movement of our body.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.180]   In fact, much of today's discussion is both practical
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.620]   and will be highly informative in terms of the mechanisms
[00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.160]   underlying emotions, and it is likely to also be surprising
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.640]   to you in a number of ways.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.040]   It certainly was surprising to me.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.800]   I've been a close follower of Dr. Feldman Barrett's work
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.440]   over many years now, and have always found it
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.100]   to be tremendously informative.
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.160]   And when I say her work, I mean both her academic
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.080]   published papers, as well as her public lectures
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.360]   that she's given, and her two fabulous books
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.480]   on emotions and the brain.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.880]   The first one entitled "How Emotions Are Made,"
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.400]   and the second book, which includes information
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.440]   about emotions, but extends beyond that,
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.900]   entitled "Seven and a Half Lessons About the Brain."
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.520]   As you'll see from today's discussion,
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.860]   Dr. Feldman Barrett is not only extremely informed
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.880]   about the neuroscience and psychology of emotion,
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.520]   she's also fabulously good at teaching us that information
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.540]   in clear terms and in actionable ways.
[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.920]   You'll also notice several times she pushes back
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.720]   on my questions, in some cases even telling me
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.440]   that my questions are ill-posed.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.760]   And I have to tell you that I was absolutely delighted
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.280]   that she did that, because you'll see
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.140]   that every time she did that, it was with the clear purpose
[00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.680]   of putting more specificity on the question,
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.940]   and thereby more specificity and clarity on the answer,
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.120]   which of course she delivers.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.780]   By the end of today's discussion,
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.600]   you will have both a broad and a deep understanding
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.920]   of what emotions are, and their origins
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.360]   in our brain and body.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.780]   You will also have many practical tools
[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.600]   with which to better understand
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.880]   and navigate emotional states.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.320]   And moreover, you will have many practical tools
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.760]   in order to increase your levels of motivation
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.160]   and better understand your various states of consciousness.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.080]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.780]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.760]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.420]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.200]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.320]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.200]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.360]   Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.040]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.080]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.300]   I've spoken many times before on this podcast
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.420]   about the fact that sleep is the foundation
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.520]   of mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.520]   One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.280]   is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.880]   And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.880]   your body temperature has to drop by one to three degrees.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.280]   And in order to wake up in the morning feeling refreshed,
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.300]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.580]   by one to three degrees.
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.840]   With Eight Sleep, it's very easy to control the temperature
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.200]   of your sleeping environment.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.140]   It's a mattress cover that allows you to control
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.940]   the temperature of your sleeping environment
[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.560]   at the beginning, middle, and end of your night.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.520]   And in doing so, allow you to fall and stay deeply asleep
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.360]   throughout the night and wake up feeling extremely refreshed.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.140]   I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.480]   well over two years ago,
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.440]   and it has greatly improved the quality of my sleep.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.860]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.980]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.000]   to save up to $150 off their pod three cover.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.760]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.140]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.120]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.080]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.600]   Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.080]   and behaviors affect your health
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.800]   by giving you real-time feedback
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.920]   using a continuous glucose monitor.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.320]   One of the most important factors impacting your immediate
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.400]   and long-term health is the way that your body manages
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.240]   its blood glucose, or sometimes referred to
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.080]   as blood sugar levels.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.660]   To maintain energy and focus throughout the day,
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.420]   you want to keep your blood glucose steady
[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.420]   without big spikes or dips.
[00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.200]   Using Levels, you can monitor how different types of foods
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.040]   and different food combinations,
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.640]   as well as food timing and things like exercise,
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.240]   combine to impact your blood glucose levels.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.680]   I started using Levels a little over a year ago,
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.040]   and it gave me a lot of insight
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.680]   into how specific foods were spiking my blood sugar
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.240]   and then leaving me feeling tired
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.840]   for several hours afterwards,
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.040]   as well as how the spacing of exercise and my meals
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.080]   was impacting my overall energy.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.360]   And in doing so, it really allowed me to optimize
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.360]   how I eat, what I eat, when I exercise, and so on,
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.040]   such that my blood glucose levels and energy levels
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.600]   are stable throughout the day.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.440]   If you're interested in learning more about Levels
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.080]   and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself,
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.900]   go to levels.link/huberman.
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.780]   Right now, Levels is offering an additional
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.100]   two free months of membership.
[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.960]   Again, that's levels.link, L-I-N-K/huberman,
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.840]   to get two free months of membership.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.440]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett.
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.760]   Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett, welcome.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.440]   - Oh, it's my pleasure to be here.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.220]   - I've wanted to talk to you for a very long time.
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.960]   I'd like to talk about emotions.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.960]   I think everyone has a sense somehow of what an emotion is,
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.720]   feeling happy, feeling sad, feeling excited,
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.880]   feeling curious, perhaps, is even an emotion.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.720]   I don't know, you'll tell us.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.000]   What are the core components?
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.720]   What are the sort of macronutrients of an emotion?
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.040]   Because I know there's a debate about whether or not
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.080]   we should be talking about emotions versus states,
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.900]   but what is an emotion?
[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.440]   We all are familiar with what one feels like to us,
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.640]   but from a scientific perspective,
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.640]   how do you define an emotion?
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.440]   - Well, this is a scientist debate about this.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.880]   Nobody in the last 150 years has ever been able to agree
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.820]   on what an emotion is.
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.400]   And I think from my perspective,
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.840]   the interesting but tricky bit is that anytime you wanna
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.320]   talk about what the basic building blocks are of emotion,
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.920]   none of those basic building blocks
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.340]   are specific to emotion.
[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.400]   So for example, there are a group of scientists
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.960]   who will tell you, well, an emotion
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.960]   is a coordinated response where you have a change
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.080]   in some physical state, a change in the brain,
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.480]   a change in the physical state which leads you
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.960]   to make a particular facial expression.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.400]   So you've got physiological changes in the body,
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.800]   changes in the brain, changes in the face
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.120]   or in motor movements, okay?
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:35.040]   But that describes basically every moment of your life.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.720]   Your face is always moving in some way.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.240]   If it wasn't, you would look like an avatar basically.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.920]   So we're constantly engaged in movements
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.640]   and those movements have to be coordinated
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.680]   with the physiological changes in the body
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.760]   because whether we're in a state
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.600]   that we would conventionally call emotion or not
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.800]   because the physiology is supporting those,
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.320]   it's supporting the glucose and the oxygen
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.480]   and all the things that you need
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.040]   to make movements of your body.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.080]   And of course, all these movements
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.560]   are being coordinated by your brain.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.760]   So of course, there's a coordinated set of features
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.400]   that doesn't really describe how emotions are distinct
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.880]   from any other experience that you have.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.880]   But the claim was for a really long time
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.160]   that there would be diagnostic patterns, okay?
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.800]   So when something triggered fear,
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.120]   you would have an increase in heart rate
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:37.120]   and you would have a propensity to run away or to freeze
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.680]   or not just to fall asleep,
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.440]   although that is something animals do
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.240]   when they are faced with a predator,
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.200]   but that's not part of the Western stereotype for fear.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.080]   So that wasn't what scientists were looking for.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.920]   And also that you would make a particular facial expression,
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.800]   which was presumed to be the universal expression of fear
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.000]   where you widen your eyes and you gasp like,
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.800]   (gasps)
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.480]   that facial, set of facial movements in other cultures,
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.960]   like in Melanesian culture, for example,
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:14.440]   is a symbol of threat where you are threatening someone,
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.880]   you are threatening them with aggression basically,
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.560]   is a war face.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.200]   But in Western cultures,
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.800]   that's the face that Western scientists believed
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:28.800]   was the part of that distinctive pattern for fear.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.640]   And so the way that scientists defined emotion
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.320]   for a long time was these kind of states
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.760]   where you'd see this diagnostic ensemble of signals.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.480]   And that would mean that anytime someone showed
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.800]   one of those signals,
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.560]   they may move their face in a particular way
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.080]   or their heart increased at a particular time,
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.480]   you'd be able to diagnose them as being in a state of fear
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.640]   as opposed to a state of anger or sadness or whatever.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:03.640]   The empirical evidence just doesn't bear that out.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.000]   And so it was kind of a mystery.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   The mystery is how is it that you feel angry or sad
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:18.240]   or happy or full of gratitude or awe?
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:23.720]   How is it that you experience these moments,
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.720]   but scientists can't find a single set of physical markers
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:35.120]   that correspond with each state distinctively, right?
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.400]   That in a way that you could tell them apart.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.840]   That was a really big puzzle for a really long time.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:47.440]   - I have to ask you about this perhaps myth,
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.440]   perhaps truth about facial expressions and emotions,
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.080]   because as you were explaining the core components
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.000]   of emotions, I had to think back
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.280]   to the classic textbook images of the different faces
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:07.100]   associated with fear, with delight, with confusion,
[00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.140]   on and on.
[00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.000]   We will get to that and your opinions on that,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.480]   scientifically informed opinions, of course.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:19.480]   But there is a bit of a myth that the emotion system
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:24.020]   and the facial expression system run in both directions.
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:29.020]   For instance, people will say, if you smile,
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.660]   it's harder to feel sad or anxious.
[00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:35.540]   I can't say that's been my experience,
[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.700]   but I very well could be wrong.
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:42.700]   So we know that when people's emotional states change,
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.440]   their facial expressions often will change, right?
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.440]   If you see someone crying on the street
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.340]   versus somebody smiling really big,
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.400]   we can make some assumptions about what might be going on
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.840]   internally for them.
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:58.020]   But put simply, is it true that changing
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.680]   one's facial expression can direct shifts in the brain
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:06.760]   and body, perhaps, that change our emotional states?
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.860]   - If you'll permit me, what I would say
[00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.560]   is that your question is ill-posed.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:18.180]   So first of all, it presumes that there's an emotion system
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:21.780]   and that there's a facial expression system.
[00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:25.320]   Now, clearly there's a system for moving facial muscles,
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:30.320]   okay, but a movement is not the same as an expression.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.900]   A movement is a movement.
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:35.300]   An expression is an interpretation
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.420]   of the meaning of a movement.
[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.980]   Not all movements of the face are expressions.
[00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:45.340]   And this is a problem.
[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.880]   It's a problem in science.
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.540]   It's often the case, I think, in my experience,
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.860]   in the science of emotion, but elsewhere too,
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:58.860]   that scientists, in their efforts to make their work
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:05.100]   meaningful to people, will try to interpret their findings
[00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:11.260]   in ways that the average person would find interesting.
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.720]   Or the way that a physician would find interesting,
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.860]   or a teacher, or what have you,
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:18.000]   to be able to use this information.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.620]   But then they forget that they're actually
[00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.740]   making an interpretation and they start to refer
[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:27.760]   to their observations with the labels of interpretation.
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.620]   So facial movements are facial movements.
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:33.540]   People move their faces and those movements have meaning,
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:37.400]   but they're not always to express an internal state.
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.520]   In fact, one might think that they're very rarely
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.780]   to express an internal state.
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.640]   So I don't know that there's
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.580]   a facial expression system either.
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.700]   So there's certainly, like I said,
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.600]   there's circuitry for moving a face,
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:57.600]   but what those movements mean is highly variable.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:02.220]   And so that would be my second point,
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.820]   that where I would say,
[00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.040]   when you see someone crying on the street,
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.500]   you are not looking only at their face.
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:13.500]   You might be aware that you're focusing on their face.
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:17.220]   That might be the part of the entire sensory ensemble
[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.620]   that you are focusing your attention on.
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:23.380]   But your brain is taking in an entire ensemble of signals.
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:28.080]   As you know, it's taking in not just the movements
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.940]   of the face, the tears, or whatever,
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:33.660]   it's taking in all of the entire sensory array,
[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.200]   the sounds, the smells,
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.320]   what's going on inside your own body.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.740]   Your brain is being bombarded with signals
[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.700]   from all of those sources.
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:46.560]   And when it's making a meaning out of any signal,
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.660]   it's doing it in an ensemble of signals.
[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:53.180]   So research shows that babies' cries
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.700]   aren't acoustically specific
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.520]   to when they're tired or hungry.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:01.620]   I can show you a video without context
[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.220]   and show you someone crying,
[00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:06.020]   and you might make a judgment.
[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.480]   You might make the stereotypic judgment in the West.
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.720]   Oh, that person is sad.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.640]   And then we pan out and really,
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.360]   it's a little girl whose dad just came home
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.820]   from Iraq or something, right?
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:19.760]   So brains are always interpreting faces in context.
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:20.880]   They're making guesses.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.400]   This is something that I've talked about quite a bit,
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.140]   that we don't read movements in people.
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:29.040]   We don't read emotions in facial expressions.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.680]   We make inferences about the emotional meaning
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.620]   of facial movements.
[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.620]   And we do it in an ensemble of other signals,
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:41.060]   the context, if you will.
[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.160]   And that's really what's happening.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:48.160]   So do I think that there's feedback
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.840]   from the face to the brain?
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.000]   Sure.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.280]   I mean, there's feedback from every muscle,
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.260]   but there's this constant conversation
[00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.540]   between the brain and the body.
[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.360]   The brain is sending motor commands.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.140]   The body has sensory surfaces,
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.060]   which are sending signals back to the brain.
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:14.800]   So if the face is influencing the brain,
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.760]   it's doing so in a way that's not special.
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:22.080]   It's doing it in a way that works
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.440]   for all other parts of your body too.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.260]   And I guess what I would say,
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.440]   this is kind of a long-winded answer,
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:34.440]   but over time, your brain has learned
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:39.180]   that certain patterns of signal over time recur.
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:43.820]   And so if you're smiling,
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:48.480]   if your brain is telling your facial muscles
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.240]   to move in a particular way that looks like smiling,
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.260]   it's happening in a larger ensemble of signals.
[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.240]   And then the brain is predicting what's gonna happen next
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.180]   because it's learned over time
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:02.920]   what happens next so probabilistically.
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:07.780]   So if you think about that as cause, then sure.
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:11.660]   But it's not this simplistic kind of idea
[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:14.340]   that an emotion is triggered.
[00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:21.900]   It causes facial muscles to move in a particular way.
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.620]   And therefore, if you just pose your face
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:28.520]   in that particular arrangement,
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.000]   that will somehow feed back to the emotion system
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.320]   and change that system.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:37.320]   'Cause there is no emotion system in your brain.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:41.520]   And the causation just isn't that,
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.500]   it's not that simplistically mechanistic.
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.340]   - That makes sense to me.
[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:49.340]   I frankly never bought the idea
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:52.640]   that just smiling would make me feel happy,
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:57.000]   especially if my internal state was not one of happiness,
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.620]   like fighting the internal state.
[00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:02.000]   Also in the early 2000s, I think it was,
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.080]   there was a lot of discussion
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:06.320]   about how positioning the body in certain ways,
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.320]   taking up more space would allow people
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.600]   to feel more powerful.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.900]   And some of these studies argued
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.080]   that there were even hormonal shifts associated
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.120]   with taking up more space
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.160]   that were associated with feelings of empowerment.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.020]   And then when shrinking of oneself
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.520]   was associated with elevated cortisol states.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.420]   And as I say all this, I want to be clear
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:31.040]   that I do not take a simplistic view
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.660]   of the nervous system or endocrine system.
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:36.400]   And I don't think that you were implying that either.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.720]   Just want to make sure that anyone listening
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.800]   and watching isn't thinking that,
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.160]   for instance, that cortisol is bad.
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.700]   Cortisol is wonderful and essential.
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.000]   You just need it regulated properly.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   Or that the idea that the body and emotional states
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.340]   are inextricably linked makes a ton of sense to me.
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.640]   But the idea that you could just, you know,
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.440]   grab onto one of the nodes in the,
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.820]   now I have to be careful not to say emotion system,
[00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.000]   like position of the body,
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.080]   like being hunched over makes you depressed.
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.280]   No, that never made sense to me.
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.400]   Taking up more space makes you feel more powerful.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.600]   That doesn't, it can't be that way.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.360]   And yet we were told for about a decade through,
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.920]   especially through popular press, that this stuff was true.
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:24.460]   And so what I love about your work is that it includes
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:29.460]   a neuroanatomical, a psychological, a network perspective,
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:32.680]   that there isn't one seat of emotions and so on.
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:35.160]   So if we could go a little bit further
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.180]   into the facial expression piece for a moment.
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.780]   - Sure.
[00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.820]   - I was taught in my psychology and neuroscience textbooks,
[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.500]   'cause it was right there in front of me,
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:48.480]   that there were some core categories of facial expression
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.480]   that were universal across cultures
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.200]   that conveyed something about the internal state
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.760]   of the person, that the downward, you know,
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.300]   lips in the corner and maybe even a furrowing of the brow
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.080]   was associated with negative valence states,
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.760]   like sadness, perhaps even depression,
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:08.040]   that the opposite of upward turn corners of the mouth
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.580]   and widening of the eyes was delight and excitement.
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.840]   Some of that feels pretty true to my experience,
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:18.840]   but how do you and other serious scientists of emotions
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:24.180]   view that somewhat classic literature now?
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:28.180]   - Yeah, so I'll just say that my journey here,
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:34.040]   my scientific journey, was not one of attempting
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:39.040]   to overturn a century's worth of, are we allowed to swear?
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.620]   Bullshit, basically.
[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.240]   I mean, it's just, it's like, it's stereotype,
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.560]   it's basically Western stereotypes
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.160]   enshrined as scientific fact.
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.660]   And that sounds like a pretty harsh thing to say,
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:58.260]   but I think I pretty much stand by that at this point.
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:02.480]   But for me, when I was a graduate student,
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.420]   when I was an undergraduate in psychology
[00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.160]   and in physiology and in anthropology, you know,
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:13.060]   I also had read that Darwin said that there were
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.620]   these distinctive facial expressions
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:20.100]   that were coordinated with specific emotional states,
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.100]   the specific states of the nervous system.
[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:24.500]   This was Darwin's view.
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:28.140]   And I assumed it was correct
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:34.660]   until I started to try to use that information in the lab
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:39.100]   and everything fell apart, you know?
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:43.680]   So when you show someone in a laboratory,
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.600]   like a student or somebody from the community,
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.400]   a face, a disembodied face,
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.640]   where the person's eyes are widened in the face
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:58.000]   and they're gasping like a stereotypic fear expression,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.860]   most of the time they don't know what it is.
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:04.180]   And so I would try to use these faces
[00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.620]   and as stimuli and experiments,
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:09.540]   and they weren't working the way that they were supposed
[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:10.380]   to work.
[00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:14.700]   And there were really going all the way back
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:15.940]   to the beginning of psychology,
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.100]   there were always debates about whether or not
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:19.620]   this was actually accurate.
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.100]   And there's a really interesting story
[00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:24.140]   about how Darwin came to this idea,
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.220]   which I can tell you about,
[00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.980]   but it's not because he cared about emotion.
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:33.980]   And he was basically taking his own very Western views
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:39.080]   about emotion to make some claims about evolution actually.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:43.660]   So I have more to say about that
[00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:47.740]   and about why it's a problem to take anything
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:52.740]   that anybody said, even Darwin from 150 or so years ago
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:58.060]   or whatever it is and treat it like it's a modern text.
[00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:01.580]   He was writing at a particular time for a particular purpose
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:04.960]   and that doesn't necessarily mean that whatever he wrote
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.640]   is true, but I'll just tell you what the evidence says.
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:17.200]   That there has been in psychology a debate,
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:21.640]   really vicious debate actually for probably 50 years
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.900]   about the nature of facial expressions
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.420]   and whether they're universal
[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:27.500]   and whether there's this one-to-one correspondence
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:31.900]   between a particular face and like a facial configuration
[00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:33.380]   in a particular emotional state,
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.540]   smiling in happiness, scowling in anger,
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.880]   wrinkling your nose in disgust.
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:42.880]   And so in 2016, I think,
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:48.320]   the Association for Psychological Science tasked me
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.820]   and some other senior scientists
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:54.900]   with attempting to write a white paper,
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:58.380]   a consensus paper on what the literature actually shows.
[00:23:58.380 --> 00:23:59.740]   So what does the research actually show?
[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:01.280]   If you read all the research,
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:05.060]   can you find a pattern there?
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.740]   Does it actually reveal anything
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:09.080]   about whether or not facial expressions are universal,
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.380]   particularly for emotion?
[00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:13.060]   And the way they do this,
[00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.220]   they have a journal for this purpose
[00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:19.680]   for taking a widely held belief that is highly debated
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.980]   and bringing together a panel of experts
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.060]   who disagree with each other at the outset
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.780]   and they have to work together
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:29.160]   to see if they can come to consensus over the data.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:35.020]   And this is something that people have tried in the past.
[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:37.980]   And I mean, they're really vicious.
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:41.460]   People have been vicious with each other over this question.
[00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:46.460]   So when we brought together a group of people,
[00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:48.660]   so several people refused to serve,
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.300]   senior scientists refused to serve on this panel, but-
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:55.500]   - Out of fear of losing their funding or something?
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.260]   - You know, that's a whole other conversation
[00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:02.260]   about why certain scientists would not want to engage
[00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:07.620]   with people who disagree with them.
[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:09.460]   That's an interesting conversation to have,
[00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:12.700]   but I don't think it's as simple actually
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:17.220]   as just their careerist or they care about their money
[00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:18.820]   or funding or whatever.
[00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:19.780]   That would be an easy answer,
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:21.540]   but I don't actually think that's what's going on,
[00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.700]   but that's another sort of...
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.400]   But anyway, so there were five of us who got together,
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:30.700]   all senior scientists, all from different fields.
[00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.460]   Some of us hadn't met each other before.
[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.740]   We all knew of each other, of course.
[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:38.420]   And we met over Zoom for two and a half years.
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:41.860]   This is pre-COVID 'cause people were all over the world.
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.900]   And we read over a thousand papers.
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:49.900]   So I was the only one in this group of the five of us
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:54.900]   who my starting hypothesis was that facial movements
[00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:58.260]   are meaningful, but they're not...
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:00.260]   There's no one-to-one correspondence
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:03.520]   between a particular facial configuration
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:07.500]   like a scowl and anger.
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.660]   Not just that it would vary across cultures,
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:14.660]   but that it varies for you across situations.
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.620]   I mean, do you scowl every time you're angry?
[00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:19.580]   I don't scowl every time I'm angry.
[00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:22.340]   In fact, and I also scowl at times when I'm not angry.
[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.900]   So, and there are scientific reasons to think
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:30.900]   that the collection of facial expressions that people make
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.460]   when they're angry or when they're sad or whatever
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.140]   would be highly variable.
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.740]   So that was my starting position.
[00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:40.260]   And then there were varying four guys.
[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.460]   So there was, I just refer to them as the guys
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:43.980]   'cause it was me and four guys.
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.820]   And the guys, they all to some extent thought
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.140]   that facial expressions were universal,
[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:54.000]   but they had differing reasons for hypothesizing that.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.720]   And they also had different commitments,
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:01.920]   degrees of commitment to that position.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.180]   But we right off the bat sort of agreed
[00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:07.000]   that it didn't matter who was right.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.020]   That was just not relevant.
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:12.620]   The only thing that mattered was that we could come
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:15.460]   to the consensus over the data.
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:18.980]   And if we couldn't, we had to really pinpoint why.
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.620]   Like, so what would be the critical experiments
[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:24.220]   that would have to be done in order for us
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.260]   to come to consensus over the data?
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:30.460]   And we also agreed that we had all kinds
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:31.440]   of contingency set up.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.140]   So, you know, you've got five senior people
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:37.740]   who are all running big labs and they're investing,
[00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:40.160]   you know, upwards of three years working on a paper.
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.120]   So if we can't come to consensus, what are we gonna do?
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.200]   Are we gonna write one paper
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.000]   and sort of write about the process?
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.920]   Or are we gonna write separate papers or, you know?
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.920]   But we had all these contingencies laid out.
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.360]   But the key here I think is that we agreed
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:58.000]   that we were not gonna be adversarial about it
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.120]   'cause it didn't matter who was right.
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.140]   And in fact, if somebody had to admit they were wrong
[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.160]   and someone was gonna have to admit they were wrong,
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.180]   I mean, it turns out all of us were wrong about something,
[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:11.180]   but we were gonna be like supportive of each other
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:15.140]   and really encourage each other.
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:17.860]   Because, you know, being wrong is no one likes to be wrong,
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:21.060]   but for scientists to admit they're wrong is hard.
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:23.620]   And it's something that we should encourage each other to do
[00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:25.820]   I think more and more publicly.
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:28.820]   And I think the people who do that are really brave.
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:31.460]   And so that was my position and they all agreed.
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:34.140]   And the long story short here is that
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:39.540]   two and a half years, a thousand papers later,
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.220]   we all very reasonably came to consensus
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:45.060]   that there was no evidence for facial expressions
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:46.800]   of emotion being universal.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.900]   And that instead what there's clear evidence of
[00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:54.340]   is that facial expressions,
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.380]   the way that people move their faces
[00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:02.380]   in moments of expression is highly variable.
[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:07.700]   Meaning sometimes in anger you scowl meta-analyses,
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:11.140]   so statistical summaries of many, many, many studies,
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:15.680]   even in the West show that people scowl
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:19.440]   about 35% of the time when they're angry,
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.280]   which is more than chance.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.480]   So it gets you a good publication in, you know,
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.240]   the proceedings of the National Academy.
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.460]   But that means 65% of the time
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:31.960]   people are moving their faces in other meaningful ways.
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.200]   That's not scowling.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:38.760]   So if you actually used a scowl or even, you know,
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.880]   a scowl in blood pressure or, you know,
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.700]   just maybe not one signal, but like a couple of signals,
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.500]   but you would be wrong more than half the time.
[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.780]   You would miss more than half the cases.
[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:52.420]   And even more importantly, I think,
[00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.060]   that's the reliability question.
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:58.340]   So there's low reliability for the correspondence
[00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:01.220]   between a scowl and anger.
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:02.220]   It's above chance.
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:06.340]   So scowling is one expression of anger,
[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:08.820]   but it's certainly not the dominant one.
[00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:10.220]   And there is no dominant one.
[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:11.240]   It's just highly variable,
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.420]   depending on the situation that you're in.
[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:14.900]   So sometimes when I'm angry,
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:18.040]   I sit quietly and plot the demise of my enemy.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.600]   You know, sometimes I smile in anger.
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.320]   Sometimes I cry in anger.
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.320]   It really depends on the situation.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:30.120]   But more importantly, half of the scowls that people make
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.380]   are not related to anger.
[00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:38.120]   That means that the specificity is, again,
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.440]   higher than chance,
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:44.320]   but not that much higher than chance.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.320]   So if you see someone scowling,
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:51.020]   the chances are that they might not be angry.
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.180]   They might be concentrating really hard
[00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:55.380]   or they might have gas.
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:58.280]   I mean, there are a lot of reasons why people make a scowl.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:02.380]   And we found this for every emotion category
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:03.540]   that had ever been studied.
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:05.740]   And I want you to notice what I just did there.
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:07.980]   I'm no longer referring to an emotion
[00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:10.260]   as if it's an entity or a thing.
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.340]   So anger isn't one thing.
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:15.380]   It's a category of things, a grouping of things.
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.860]   - And if I'm not mistaken, it includes verbs, right?
[00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:22.860]   Like anger as a set of verb actions in the brain and body.
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:24.460]   - Yes. - It's a process.
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:25.620]   It's not an event. - It's a process.
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:27.020]   Exactly. It's not a noun.
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:29.800]   It's a verb and it's a process.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:34.800]   But the point is that it's a highly variable grouping
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.620]   of instances if you are talking
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:40.680]   about all instances of anger.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.480]   All instances of anger that you have ever experienced
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:48.480]   or witnessed is a highly variable grouping of instances
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.240]   that vary.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.260]   That doesn't mean they're random,
[00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:54.560]   but what the body does in anger
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.420]   depends on what the physical movements will be in anger.
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:00.060]   And that depends on the situation that you're in
[00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:02.100]   and what your goal is.
[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:06.280]   And there are ways to talk about that in neuroscience terms,
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.720]   which are a little more precise,
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:10.600]   but the important thing to understand here, I think,
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:14.300]   is that we're only talking about Western cultures now.
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:17.580]   The minute that you go outside of the West
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:20.100]   or even to the East,
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:24.540]   I mean, so there are other cultures that have been studied
[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:29.540]   like China and cultures in China and Japan and Korea,
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:33.420]   they all have access to knowledge
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:35.780]   about Western cultural practices and norms.
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:40.340]   So what happens when you go to remote cultures,
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:43.140]   which have much less access?
[00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:44.840]   So it's not like they have no access
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:47.040]   because we live in a globalized world.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:50.120]   So even hunter gatherers in Tanzania, the Hadza,
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.020]   have access to Western practices and norms,
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.300]   but much less, much less.
[00:32:55.300 --> 00:33:00.300]   And we did do that and all bets are off there.
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:05.540]   I mean, most of the time they don't even understand
[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:07.260]   or experience facial movements
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.500]   as having anything to do with emotion.
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:12.180]   - So if they saw an emoji of a smiley face,
[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:14.580]   would they just assume it was a couple,
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:16.580]   they might think it's a face
[00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:17.980]   because as we both know,
[00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:20.160]   there's some fairly hardwired brain circuitry
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:23.800]   for the two eyes and a line beneath it
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:26.180]   and something in the middle that's pseudo nose,
[00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:29.440]   that organization of just spatial features
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:32.560]   cues up face for most primates, including us.
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:33.760]   - Although it's really interesting that you say that
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:34.960]   because yes, of course that's true,
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.320]   but it's not there at birth.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.200]   What's there at birth is a preference
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.760]   for that configuration, right?
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:44.140]   So it's like there's some,
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:45.760]   and we could talk about why that's there,
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:47.200]   it's actually very controversial,
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:51.120]   but what babies, what newborns orient to,
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:54.520]   they orient to that configuration,
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.620]   but it doesn't have to be a face.
[00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:59.240]   And then very quickly they start learning faces
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.960]   because they're exposed to face.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.760]   I mean, really the first three months of life
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:05.900]   is almost like a massive continuous tutorial
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:09.960]   on what faces are because they're being fed.
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.080]   - And everyone's in your face.
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:14.000]   I saw a baby last night and you see the baby,
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.840]   some friends have an unbelievably cute baby,
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.960]   the big cheeks and there's this desire
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.840]   to see the baby smile, right?
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:21.920]   So you do the things that,
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.280]   and if the baby shows some sort of facial expression
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:27.520]   that makes it seem like it's a little bit resistant
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.960]   to what you're doing, you stop doing it,
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.380]   you change up your strategy.
[00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:33.200]   And then when baby cracks a smile,
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.100]   now I'm going to assume that the baby
[00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.400]   may or may not have been happy
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.500]   inside that little baby head.
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:43.560]   But when they do, there's a reciprocity, then we smile.
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:46.120]   And so there's a template that's very robust.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.160]   - Right, but I want you to notice though that,
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:52.960]   so first of all, I'm not saying that recognizing faces,
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.240]   a face as a face is not hardwired.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:35:00.000]   It is, but it's hardwired not by genes alone, right?
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.480]   And in fact, there's a really wonderful book
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:02.960]   called "Not by Genes Alone."
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:05.880]   Basically, there's cultural inheritance.
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:08.880]   We have the kind of nature that requires nurture.
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:12.080]   We have the kind of genes that require early learning.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.620]   We need wiring instructions from the world
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.180]   to get the rest of the information
[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:17.440]   that we need to be competent,
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.480]   culturally competent in our lives.
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:23.140]   And that starts at birth.
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:27.000]   It probably starts before birth even.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.200]   But in third trimester, there's some evidence of learning,
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.400]   fetal learning, even in the third trimester.
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:37.400]   So the point is not that people aren't hardwired
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:40.100]   for viewing faces or recognizing faces,
[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:41.900]   it's just where does that hard wiring come from?
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:43.120]   It's not by genes alone.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.480]   Genes aren't the blueprint.
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.860]   The brain is expecting certain inputs from the world
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:49.160]   and it needs that because infant brains
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.300]   are wiring themselves to their world.
[00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.300]   And part of that world is people making faces
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:54.220]   and smiling.
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:56.180]   And those people happen to also be the ones
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:59.340]   who are maintaining that baby's nervous system.
[00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:01.980]   I mean, there is reward learning, right?
[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:04.220]   Or reinforcement learning right off the bat
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:07.400]   because these are the people who keep you comfortable.
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.240]   They are the ones who feed you.
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.560]   They're the ones who help you get to sleep
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:12.480]   and so on and so forth.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.480]   And so you're gonna be very, very sensitive
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.660]   to changes in the contingencies of their behavior.
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:19.720]   Your brain as a pattern learner
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:21.460]   is just gonna learn those patterns.
[00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:26.460]   If we know that smiling is a cue for happiness,
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:29.700]   it's 'cause we've learned it.
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:33.420]   And that doesn't mean that that learning isn't hardwired.
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:37.180]   It just means that that information got into your brain
[00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:39.420]   by cultural inheritance,
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:42.760]   which is a part of evolutionary theory
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:45.640]   in the extended evolutionary synthesis,
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:49.780]   not in the original formulation
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:52.100]   that some people still kind of stick to.
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:54.840]   - As many of you know,
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.520]   I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.960]   So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.260]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:03.100]   that's designed to meet
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:05.320]   all of your foundational nutrition needs.
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:06.960]   Now, of course, I try to get enough servings
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.240]   of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:11.480]   that include vegetables and fruits every day,
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:14.140]   but oftentimes I simply can't get enough servings.
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:17.120]   But with AG1, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:18.880]   and the probiotics that I need,
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:22.040]   and it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress.
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.840]   Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG1.
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:27.380]   I have more focus and energy and I sleep better,
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:29.600]   and it also happens to taste great.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.400]   For all these reasons, whenever I'm asked,
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.180]   "If you could take just one supplement, what would it be?"
[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:35.860]   I answer, "AG1."
[00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:40.420]   If you'd like to try AG1, go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:42.020]   to claim a special offer.
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:43.780]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:46.460]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:50.660]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:54.840]   - So it's far more nuanced than it was presented to me
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:55.880]   in those textbooks,
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:58.780]   and it sounds like it was outright wrong on many dimensions.
[00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:00.300]   - Well, can I just mention one thing, though?
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:01.200]   - Please.
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.840]   - This is really serious stuff.
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.880]   Like, sometimes people think,
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:06.700]   "Well, you know, what's the big deal?"
[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:08.620]   This is such a big deal.
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:10.220]   I'll tell you why it's a big deal.
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.300]   Because in our culture,
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:16.320]   people believe that they can read mental states
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.200]   of other people by their face.
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.480]   And they believe it so much
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:23.180]   that it's enshrined in the legal system.
[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:28.620]   And there are people who lose their lives
[00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:31.380]   because juries believe
[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:36.300]   that they can read remorse or the lack of it.
[00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:38.500]   And in fact, there was just a case,
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:42.380]   you know, last year, I believe,
[00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:47.040]   where, you know, the Innocence Project got involved
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.720]   because there was a woman who was on death row.
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.740]   And what put her on death row
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:53.860]   was a police officer's claim
[00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:57.620]   that he could read her emotions
[00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:00.980]   by the comportment of her face and her body.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:05.900]   And, you know,
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:08.960]   it was possible to get a stay of execution
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:13.760]   so that she could be retried and, you know.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.540]   So I'm not saying she was guilty or not guilty.
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:19.900]   I'm just saying what put her on death row
[00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:22.300]   was evidence that would not be admissible
[00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:26.000]   in a scientific way now.
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:32.140]   And there are lots of cases where judgments are made
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:35.080]   that end up impacting people's lives
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.800]   in pretty serious ways.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.320]   So this is a really serious thing.
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:45.200]   And it's puzzling to me
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:48.720]   why it's so, it's got such traction,
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:52.720]   this idea that there are these universal expressions
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:55.520]   that we can use to read each other, you know.
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.900]   It's just not true.
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:02.060]   I mean, the science just, it's so overwhelmingly,
[00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:04.300]   I feel like, you know, scientists,
[00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:08.160]   I don't like to use the T word, you know, the F word, fact.
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.880]   You know, it's a scary word, T word, truth.
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:13.640]   But I think in this case, I feel like I can really,
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.220]   at least with a little T, I can use it.
[00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:19.920]   You probably have particular facial movements
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:23.200]   that you make on a regular basis that are tells for you.
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.320]   I know I do.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.920]   You know, my husband can look at my actions
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.040]   and he can make really decent guesses
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.620]   about what's going on for me upstairs, right?
[00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:33.860]   But that's because he's known me for 30 years,
[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:36.680]   actually 30 years today, I should just say that we
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.400]   met each other 30 years ago today.
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.560]   But he's, you know, brains are pattern learners.
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.620]   So I'm not saying that everything is random
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:43.880]   and like there's no, it's all noise.
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:47.740]   I'm saying that there just aren't these, you know,
[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:49.140]   universal templates.
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:50.480]   They just, it's not like that.
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:53.840]   And we really have to stop assuming
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.200]   that there are.
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.840]   - Well, I'm so glad that you're getting
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:58.680]   that message out there.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:02.480]   And I'm very thankful that you highlighted the seriousness
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:06.960]   of these myths that have propagated.
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:10.020]   And that's a perfect segue into what I was already
[00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:13.040]   going to ask, which is it's based on something
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.920]   that I think is in very much agreement
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:15.940]   with what you're saying.
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.920]   A previous guest on this podcast,
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:19.640]   I think it was our first guest episode,
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:22.660]   Dr. Carl Deisseroth, colleague of mine at Stanford,
[00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:26.440]   incredible bioengineer, really, you know,
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:30.060]   0.01% in his category of science,
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:33.920]   as well as a practicing psychiatrist said something
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:35.800]   which really stuck with me over the years,
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:39.020]   which I once heard him say, you know,
[00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:41.720]   we don't really know how other people feel at all.
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:45.440]   In fact, most of the time, we don't even know how we feel.
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:50.440]   And that prompted the question for me about how good
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:55.300]   or poor are we at gauging our own emotional states,
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:57.380]   and in particular, at labeling them,
[00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:59.280]   both to others and for ourselves.
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.680]   And so here's the direct question.
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:07.040]   Is language sufficient to capture
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:11.260]   this incredibly complex thing that we're calling emotions?
[00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:12.960]   So for instance, the other day I was in New York
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:15.080]   with my sister, then she left, I went out for a bit,
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:15.980]   I was having a pretty good day,
[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:17.960]   and then I returned to the place where I was staying,
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:21.760]   and I was hit with this feeling of intense loneliness.
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:24.080]   And I don't know why, and then I had a bunch of ideas
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:26.880]   about how that related to growing up,
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:29.080]   and I was gonna see friends the next day,
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:30.440]   and I'm an adult, and so I could use
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:32.800]   some top-down regulation and say,
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.560]   oh, you know, maybe I'm a little tired,
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.480]   or I didn't, 'cause I hadn't slept as well the night before.
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:38.800]   I've been pretty rested recently.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.500]   And then I actually wrote in my journal,
[00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:42.400]   I said, you know, maybe most of feeling good
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.420]   is being pretty well rested and not in any physical pain.
[00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:47.620]   That's a big part of feeling good,
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:51.320]   is the absence of fatigue and the absence of physical pain.
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:55.560]   And then I thought, wow, that's just so basic.
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:58.640]   That's like two building blocks, it's clearly insufficient.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.400]   But then I couldn't think of a word
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:03.060]   to adequately describe the emotion
[00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:04.220]   that came about an hour later
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:06.460]   when I was feeling a little bit better,
[00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:07.800]   but not completely better.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:08.640]   So was I lonely?
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:09.820]   Not really, not anymore.
[00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:10.660]   Was I sad?
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:11.500]   Not really.
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:13.640]   But, you know, as I headed out into the city,
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:16.800]   I was thinking, I don't really have a word for how I feel.
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.960]   I'm sort of okay, not great, not low.
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:22.480]   You know, and so I think that we have emotional labels,
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.540]   I certainly do, for peaks, you know,
[00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:26.540]   these peak emotional states, super happy.
[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:27.860]   I loved the time with my sister.
[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:28.700]   We do this every year.
[00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:31.740]   This was a particularly good year for us to do this,
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:33.220]   and it went really well.
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:35.340]   We were texting back and forth how great it was.
[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:36.460]   I certainly know what it feels like
[00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:39.320]   to be really down in the pits.
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:40.820]   I've got language for that.
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:43.040]   But then there's this huge range in between.
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:45.300]   And so I guess the simple question is,
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:47.760]   should we even trust language as a way
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:50.600]   to understand how we're feeling,
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:54.120]   or are there additional, if not better, signals
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:56.880]   that we should perhaps learn to elaborate
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:00.060]   our understanding of emotions with?
[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:04.140]   - So I'm gonna give you a simple answer,
[00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:07.820]   and then I'm gonna give you a more complicated answer.
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:10.580]   So the simple answer is no, language is not sufficient.
[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:12.480]   Period.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:15.680]   I think the way that you have, well,
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:17.600]   I should say one language is not sufficient.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.120]   So English is not sufficient,
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:22.680]   and probably French on its own is not sufficient,
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:25.560]   and probably Swahili on its own is not sufficient.
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:30.600]   Although it's very interesting that the states
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:35.360]   that we mark with words in each culture,
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:38.720]   some of them overlap, but a lot of them don't.
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:42.400]   And it's very, very useful to have labels
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.640]   of emotion concepts from other cultures
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:49.640]   that capture configurations or a state
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:54.700]   that we don't mark those and sort of distinctively
[00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:57.940]   pull them out as different from other states.
[00:44:57.940 --> 00:44:59.360]   - I'd love to know what some of those are.
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:02.580]   - Oh, there are, I should have brought them with me.
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:05.680]   I mean, there are some, there's a German word,
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:07.240]   which I can't remember the name of the word,
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:11.600]   but it's like the experience of someone having a face
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.680]   that deserves a punch.
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.360]   - I'm sure someone will tell us in the comments.
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.800]   Someone who knows German or spend time there,
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:20.080]   please put that word in the comments,
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:21.120]   but don't punch anybody.
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:25.580]   - Another one that's my favorite is ligut,
[00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:30.580]   which is, it's a Polynesian headhunting emotion word,
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:38.160]   and it means exuberant aggression in a group like soccer
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:46.080]   or headhunting, right, where you're basically,
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:49.320]   or I should say also in the military.
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:51.640]   So when I was listening to NPR one day,
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:53.580]   a couple of years ago, must've been more than that,
[00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:54.420]   'cause it's in my book,
[00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:56.600]   so it was probably more than seven years ago,
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:59.240]   I was listening to these guys talk,
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:04.240]   these former military personnel talk about being deployed
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:10.080]   in a war where they're with their buddies
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:13.960]   and they're basically hunting the enemy
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:19.480]   and they feel exuberant, like they're, you know,
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:23.380]   and it's not that they're happy, but it's pleasant
[00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:27.120]   and it's very intense, very high arousal, you know,
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:30.880]   and in the moment, it seemed right,
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:33.440]   and then they come back, you know,
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:35.380]   and they ask themselves, like they come back,
[00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:38.240]   and so they're now, you know, their deployment's ended,
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:39.440]   now they're back home and they're like,
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:40.380]   are my a psychopath?
[00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:42.160]   Like, I enjoy killing people, what is this about?
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:45.240]   And I was thinking, no, no, you just experienced ligut,
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.600]   and if you had a word for it,
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:49.520]   you would understand that it's a groupie feeling
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:52.960]   where you're all in it together and it's really intense,
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:57.960]   and you know, they were experiencing the intensity
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:00.640]   of having their life on the line
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:04.860]   and being responsible for their brothers, you know,
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:07.520]   and sisters in their troop, you know,
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:12.520]   so what they would realize is it's perfectly
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:16.520]   within the range of normal human variation,
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:17.640]   it's just that in English,
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.760]   we don't have a word for it really,
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:22.400]   but there are words that are concepts in other languages,
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:25.520]   right, or the other one that I like is called giggle,
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:28.320]   which is where when you see a baby who's really cute
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:30.920]   and you just wanna like, oh, you don't wanna,
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:31.760]   you don't wanna just squeeze. - I had an experience
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:34.200]   yesterday evening, the kid was so cute,
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:36.200]   there's little cheeks, they're just like jumping at you,
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:39.480]   and the parents are delightful people too,
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:40.720]   and Dave was just facing out
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:43.520]   'cause they had one of those outward-facing baby things,
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:45.440]   and it's just sort of like, yeah.
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:47.560]   - And then I think that-- - Giggle, it's called?
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.080]   - Giggle. - Giggle, oh, giggle
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:50.760]   is from the other episode that we did on pelvic health.
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:52.220]   - Yeah, well, it also has to do with babies,
[00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:54.540]   but yeah, in a different way.
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:56.720]   Or there's one in Japan, I think there's a Japanese word
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:00.600]   for the despair that you feel when you got a bad haircut.
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.680]   - Really? - Yeah, 'cause it's,
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:05.600]   I mean, it really is a different kind of feeling than,
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.440]   you know, 'cause you've gotta like wait for it to grow,
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:08.600]   you know, whatever, anyways,
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:10.120]   the point being that-- - Amazing.
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:13.440]   - Words for us mark particular states,
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:15.240]   and they're not always the states
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:18.160]   that other people in other cultures care about,
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:21.720]   but even, again, the phrasing of your question,
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:22.900]   I just want to come back to,
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:25.180]   and I'm not trying to pick at you, but--
[00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:26.020]   - Feel free.
[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:27.720]   What I love is that what you said before,
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:30.460]   when you said my question was ill-posed,
[00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:33.240]   in your, in the answer that followed,
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:35.360]   it made it very clear why,
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:39.920]   and I learned something about how the not emotion system,
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:43.920]   but the things, plural, that create emotions work.
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:45.280]   So feel free.
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:47.440]   I grew up in the same culture that you did.
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:50.840]   I'm not Canadian by birth, but in the academic culture,
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:53.280]   you know, I mean, the stuff that we take online,
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:56.440]   by the way, folks, is nothing compared to the kind of hazing
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:49:00.880]   that I experienced growing up in academic culture
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:02.340]   as it was done then.
[00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:04.920]   I don't know if it's still that way now, so feel free.
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.120]   - Yeah, I think-- - I'm tougher than I look.
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:07.400]   - Well, no, but I think my point is
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:09.040]   that I'm trying to get at here
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:11.960]   is that when we ask questions, any of us, me too,
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:13.600]   anybody asks a question,
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:15.460]   there are certain assumptions that we're making
[00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:18.640]   in order to allow us to pose the question,
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:21.040]   and sometimes what I'm taking issue with
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.320]   is not the question itself,
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:27.200]   but it's the assumptions behind the question, right?
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:30.120]   And this is a very classic thing in philosophy of science,
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:32.080]   which I know I just said the P word, philosophy,
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:33.080]   which scientists, you know,
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:34.840]   usually they roll their eyes back in their head
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:36.400]   and they'll fall over when you talk about that,
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.120]   but I think it's really important.
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:40.800]   So, you know, can language,
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:45.800]   is language sufficient to label or to gauge emotional states?
[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:49.200]   Kind of sounds like, and this is the assumption
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:51.640]   that people make, that there's a state in here
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:54.360]   called an emotion, and now I have to label it,
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:56.280]   and I have to identify it.
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:58.080]   That is not how it works.
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:01.280]   Like, that is not what your brain is doing at all,
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:04.040]   and in order to explain what I think is happening
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:06.760]   and my best available guess, you know,
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:08.600]   like based on what I understand,
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:11.240]   it's like not even remotely,
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:14.540]   that is just not a meaningful question at all.
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:17.840]   I do think words are important.
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:21.120]   I just don't think that they have to be insufficient
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:23.440]   by virtue of what the brain is actually doing,
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:25.200]   and the way that I come at this
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:27.920]   is just really different from a lot of my colleagues,
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:32.680]   so really for 100 years, at least,
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:34.040]   I hate when people say things like that,
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:35.520]   like for 100 years, but it really is,
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:37.800]   like for 100 years, at least,
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:41.760]   what psychologists and neuroscientists do or did
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:45.880]   and are still doing is they start with a folk experience,
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.640]   a folk category, a common sense experience,
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:50.760]   I feel angry, I'm making a decision,
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:52.880]   having a memory, I'm remembering something.
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:54.960]   They start with their experience,
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:56.920]   and then they go looking for the physical basis
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:51:01.200]   of that experience in the brain or in, you know, in the body.
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:04.780]   I think that's really problematic
[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:06.400]   because not everybody in the world
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:09.280]   actually uses those categories or has those experiences.
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:10.200]   - Well, a lot of that has to do
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:12.800]   with the scientific publication process.
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:14.920]   One of the most important statements I ever heard
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:16.360]   is from the late Ted Jones,
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:18.000]   one of the greatest neuroanatomists
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.640]   of probably the last 500 years,
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:24.280]   which was the following.
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:26.760]   He said, "A drug is a substance
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:29.560]   "that when injected into an animal or a person
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:31.660]   "produces a scientific paper."
[00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:34.000]   And in many ways- - That is wonderful.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.080]   - Yeah, yeah, it kind of catches you square in the face
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:39.000]   can you go, "Oh, right."
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.520]   I mean, basically every drug disrupts,
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:44.960]   if taken an hour or two before sleep,
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:48.040]   changes the amount of REM sleep that you get.
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:50.940]   So I could imagine that almost any perturbation
[00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:53.160]   of the language system, the body,
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:56.780]   the facial movement system could give you
[00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:59.600]   a quote-unquote effect that you could write a paper about,
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:02.040]   but that doesn't mean it has any semblance whatsoever
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.560]   to what's happening in the world
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:05.400]   when we or other people experience emotions.
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:06.880]   - And here's the, you know,
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:09.160]   there's so much in what you said that I just wanna,
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:10.940]   it's very exciting to talk to you.
[00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:15.120]   So the first thing I'll say is that, you know,
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:20.120]   we often will identify, we as in the, you know, people,
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:25.720]   but also scientists identify biological signals
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:32.920]   by what we believe them to mean psychologically.
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:35.980]   So serotonin is a happiness chemical.
[00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:40.320]   No, serotonin evolved as a metabolic regulator.
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:43.880]   It is a metabolic regulator and whatever it's doing,
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:47.700]   it's allowing an animal to spend resources
[00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:53.640]   when the animal's brain isn't sure
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:55.880]   there's a reward at the end of that, right?
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:58.440]   So you were saying before, you know,
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:01.120]   the absence of fatigue, the absence of discomfort,
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:03.440]   that's a pleasant feeling, right?
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:06.480]   Well, yeah, so maybe serotonin has something to do
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:08.760]   with pleasantness because it has something to do
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:10.360]   with energetics, right?
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:13.200]   Cortisol, cortisol is not a stress hormone.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:14.880]   It's not a stress hormone.
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:18.880]   I mean, it's a hormone that is secreted more
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:21.840]   when the brain believes that there is
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:23.960]   a big metabolic outlay that's required.
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:26.460]   That's what stress is basically.
[00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:28.480]   It's the brain believes there's a big metabolic outlay
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:30.160]   that's about to be required.
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:34.880]   And it matters, these kind of like little semantic tweaks,
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:38.320]   like they matter a lot because of how we do,
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:39.720]   because of how we do research.
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:43.680]   So I would say I don't start with the categories
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:46.300]   that derive from English and my own experience.
[00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:50.020]   I start with the nervous system.
[00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:55.080]   I try to learn what is the best available evidence
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:58.080]   for how that nervous system evolved,
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:01.160]   how it developed, how it's structured, right?
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:03.720]   Anatomy to me is very important.
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:08.040]   Some of my best hypotheses come from just learning
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:09.640]   the anatomy and realizing, oh, no,
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:10.680]   there's a connection there.
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:13.680]   That's direct, that should mean something.
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:17.240]   I mean, I could give you lots of examples
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:21.480]   of where we've made discoveries solely
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:24.720]   because we noticed a set of anatomical connections
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:26.600]   and we're really curious about
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:28.960]   what they might be involved with.
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:31.580]   But if you start with that premise,
[00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:33.860]   then you think about the brain,
[00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:36.960]   and I think about the brain in a really different way, right?
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:40.620]   So I don't think about the brain as a stimulus driven organ.
[00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:44.280]   I think about it more like this,
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:47.920]   that the brain is,
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:52.360]   first of all, the brain is not running a model
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:55.520]   or making inferences about the world.
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:59.520]   All the brain knows are signals
[00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:02.480]   from the sensory surfaces of its body.
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:04.500]   So your brain is modeling your retina
[00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:06.160]   and it's modeling your cochlea
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:09.120]   and it's modeling the sensory surfaces of the skin.
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:14.980]   And sure, signals hit those surfaces
[00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:17.040]   and those surfaces transduce those signals
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:18.660]   and send them up to the brain,
[00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:23.100]   but the brain only knows the body.
[00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:25.300]   And anything it knows about the world,
[00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:27.420]   it knows about the world through the body,
[00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:29.120]   through the sensory surfaces of the body.
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:32.720]   So that's the first, for me, really big important point.
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:34.840]   The second important point is that
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:36.520]   I think about the brain as being trapped
[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:40.320]   in a dark silent box called your skull.
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:43.680]   And it's so weird saying these things to you.
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:45.960]   You're so much, you're like,
[00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:49.880]   you're this really esteemed neuroscientist
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:51.400]   and here I am explaining to you
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:53.960]   how I think the brain works, it's just very-
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:55.120]   - Well, it's important for our audience,
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:56.120]   but it's also important for me,
[00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:59.560]   even though, yes, I know these facts,
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:04.560]   but I believe it's always informative to go back to.
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:07.960]   Go back to the fundamentals because we forget.
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:10.580]   Actually, I would say that someone once described,
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:12.400]   I'll call him the great,
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:14.160]   'cause he's a great visual neuroscientist,
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:15.880]   visual neuroscientist, Tony Movshin,
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:18.440]   who founded the Department of Neuroscience at NYU,
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:21.480]   once said a real intellectual is somebody
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:24.160]   that can appreciate and work with a topic
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:26.460]   at multiple levels of granularity, right?
[00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:29.780]   It's not about, and oftentimes the more expertise
[00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:31.680]   is associated with more focus on detail.
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:33.620]   So I love returning to the core basics.
[00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:36.180]   So I think it's wonderful, please continue.
[00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:38.680]   - So I think about the brain is being trapped in this box
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:42.400]   and it's receiving signals continuously
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:44.700]   from the sensory surfaces of the body,
[00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:47.660]   but those signals are the outcomes of some set of changes.
[00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:49.580]   And the brain doesn't know what the changes are.
[00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:51.260]   It doesn't know the causes of those signals,
[00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:53.920]   it just knows the outcomes, it knows the signals.
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:55.460]   That's what it's receiving.
[00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:59.000]   And so it has to guess at what the causes
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.740]   of those signals are in order to stay alive.
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:07.560]   And so that's in philosophy called an inverse problem.
[00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:11.740]   So the brain just has a massive continuous inverse problem
[00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:14.000]   that it has to deal with all the time.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   - Like it can't have, it doesn't have access
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.040]   to all the information.
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:17.880]   - No.
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:18.700]   - It's just a guessing machine.
[00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:19.740]   - It's a guessing machine.
[00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:24.260]   So for example, you know, if you hear a loud bang,
[00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:25.820]   what is that loud bang?
[00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:28.040]   Could be a car door slamming.
[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:30.320]   It could be thunder.
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:33.000]   It could be a car backfiring.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.800]   It could be a gunshot.
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:36.440]   The brain doesn't know.
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:37.960]   It has to guess.
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:41.960]   And it's not making a guess like a intellectual guess.
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:45.480]   The guess is a motor plan.
[00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:50.480]   It's a plan for changing the internal state of the body
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:54.680]   in order to support motor, skeletal motor movements.
[00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:55.760]   Do I need to run?
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:57.200]   Do I need to shut the window?
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:58.680]   Do I need to get an umbrella?
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:00.960]   Do I, you know, do I need to hold my breath
[00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:02.080]   because the car is backfired?
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:03.800]   You know, what do I need to do?
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:05.500]   So where does that plan come from?
[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:10.020]   Well, it comes from past experience,
[00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:12.880]   the experience that's been wired into the brain.
[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:17.000]   But I think that the evidence suggests
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:21.400]   that what the brain is doing is basically
[00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:27.600]   reinstating bits and pieces of past experience.
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:29.720]   So remembering,
[00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:31.840]   although we don't experience ourselves as remembering,
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:35.740]   but basically it's re-implementing ensembles of signals
[00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:41.080]   from the past that are similar to the present in some way.
[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:45.720]   Now, a bunch of things which are similar to each other
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:50.440]   in psychology is a category.
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:54.120]   So what the brain is doing is it's creating,
[00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:55.720]   it's constructing a category.
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:57.560]   And in fact, we think about the brain
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:00.280]   as a continuous category constructor.
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:04.720]   It's constructing a category of possible futures,
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:08.880]   possible outcomes, possible motor plans,
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:12.820]   and how does it know which is the right one?
[00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:14.260]   'Cause it's not just picking one.
[00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:18.320]   There's gonna be some sample that it's re-implementing,
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:20.240]   but how does it know which one?
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:21.200]   Which is the right one?
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:22.900]   'Cause there can only be one.
[00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:25.200]   - Well, I feel like in the example of a loud noise,
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:27.640]   what I immediately thought of as you were describing that
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:31.060]   is that my system would become aware of it.
[00:59:31.060 --> 00:59:31.920]   I would become aware of it.
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:34.760]   But then it's a question of, is there another loud noise?
[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:37.200]   How closely are those loud noises spaced?
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:39.520]   Is it getting louder or less loud?
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:42.160]   And then, and so a bunch of categories,
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:44.520]   it's like a bookshelf with an infinite number of books,
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:46.620]   but then with the second loud noise,
[00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:49.820]   now it's just one wing of the library.
[00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:52.360]   And then with the next thing that happens in the context,
[00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:54.360]   it starts narrowing and then pretty soon you get presented
[00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:57.860]   with the book that says the roof is about to cave in.
[00:59:57.860 --> 01:00:02.200]   - And I think your analogy there is pointing out two things.
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:07.200]   One is that really what the brain is attempting to do
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:09.280]   is to reduce uncertainty.
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:13.120]   Because uncertainty is super expensive.
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:17.600]   Now, sometimes we like deliberately cultivate uncertainty.
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:20.400]   Like we do not, we deliberately try to learn things
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.600]   we don't, that we don't know.
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:26.160]   We put ourselves in novel situations.
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.880]   We seek novelty and because it's fun and interesting
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.120]   and whatever, sure.
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:34.400]   But imagine every single waking moment of your life
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.880]   was like that, where you didn't know,
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:39.440]   you couldn't narrow things down from the library
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.720]   to the wing, to the bookshelf,
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:46.320]   to the particular shelf on that bookshelf,
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:47.440]   to the- - It'd be terrifying.
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:48.620]   - Yeah, it would be- - It'd be terrifying.
[01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:49.460]   - Yeah, it would be.
[01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:50.840]   - That's the label I would give it.
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:52.040]   It would be terrifying.
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.640]   'Cause I couldn't plan anything or do anything
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.240]   because all possibilities are open.
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:56.080]   - Right.
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:00.120]   And it's just actually metabolically unsustainable.
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:03.960]   And there are some brains that are wired
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:06.080]   in a way that they don't predict very well.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:09.200]   They don't create these categories very well.
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:11.280]   And so they're dealing with
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:16.580]   in really unbelievable amounts of uncertainty.
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:21.780]   So that's one thing, is part of what's the goal here,
[01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:23.900]   if you could say there's a goal, is to reduce uncertainty.
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:25.920]   And I'm gonna get to why this has anything to do
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.000]   with emotion in a minute,
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.420]   but I just need to set up the ground rules
[01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:34.560]   or the assumptions of what I'm working with here.
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:37.500]   So the other thing though that you pointed out,
[01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:39.000]   which I think is really important,
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.040]   is that none of this is static.
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:45.480]   It's all evolving over time, right?
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:47.480]   The signals are evolving over time.
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:51.020]   So both the signals that are constantly hitting
[01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:52.760]   the sensory surfaces of the body
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:54.280]   and making their way to the brain,
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:57.040]   but also the intrinsic signals in the brain,
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.680]   it's all changing over time.
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:01.880]   So when we talk about context, that's important.
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:05.100]   How is the brain making a decision about similarity?
[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:07.140]   Like what are the features that are similar?
[01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:11.580]   It's not just at a single snapshot in time.
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:15.360]   It's always happening dynamically over time, right?
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:19.100]   And most of the time though, you don't ask,
[01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:21.840]   you don't wait to hear a second sound.
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:24.880]   You're not deliberately attempting
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:26.740]   to figure out what the sound is.
[01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:29.660]   Your brain is just sorting it out, right?
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:32.800]   And it's sorting it out by narrowing down the possibilities.
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:36.560]   And there are some selection mechanisms in the brain
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:39.940]   that help it guess better,
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:42.680]   but also the signals coming from the world
[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:50.220]   are also helping to select which possibility is the right one.
[01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:52.500]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:55.180]   and acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker.
[01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:57.540]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:00.040]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.580]   to help you better understand your body
[01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:03.480]   and help you meet your health goals.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.800]   I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:08.120]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:10.340]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:12.920]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:14.960]   However, with a lot of blood tests out there,
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:16.840]   you get information back about blood lipids,
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:17.980]   about hormones, and so on,
[01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:20.000]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.300]   With InsideTracker, they have a personalized platform
[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:25.060]   that makes it very easy to understand your data,
[01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:26.980]   that is to understand what those lipids,
[01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:28.960]   what those hormone levels, et cetera, mean,
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:32.140]   and behavioral supplement, nutrition, and other protocols
[01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:34.940]   to adjust those numbers to bring them into the ranges
[01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:37.220]   that are ideal for your immediate and long-term health.
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:39.500]   InsideTracker's ultimate plan now includes measures
[01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:41.720]   of both ApoB and of insulin,
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:44.360]   which are key indicators of cardiovascular health
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:45.940]   and energy regulation.
[01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:47.380]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:50.180]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman

[01:03:57.700 --> 01:04:00.100]   - There's this scene that comes to mind from that movie,
[01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:01.540]   I think it was "Saving Private Ryan,"
[01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:06.540]   where the guys that are about to hit the ground on D-Day
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:12.380]   are flinching with every crack of gunfire.
[01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:16.180]   Like they're just, everything's a stimulus to move and to end
[01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:20.100]   and then some of the more seasoned soldiers
[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:24.580]   are literally having bullets whizzing by their head
[01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:27.440]   and people are dropping dead all around them
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.820]   and they're moving forward steely-eyed
[01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:31.560]   and stable and upright.
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:34.860]   And in part, we look at that and say,
[01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:36.900]   okay, they're courageous, they're seasoned,
[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:38.580]   maybe they're desensitized in certain ways,
[01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:42.300]   but actually it fits much better with the idea
[01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:43.480]   based on what you're saying,
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:44.900]   it fits much better with the idea
[01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:48.020]   that they have intimate knowledge,
[01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:50.880]   both conscious and unconscious knowledge,
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:54.360]   that something right next to them is a threat,
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:56.060]   but not a threat worth responding to.
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:56.900]   - Right, exactly.
[01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:58.440]   - But if it were headed straight for them,
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:00.100]   they would quite understand.
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:03.540]   - What I would say is that it's not,
[01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:06.460]   you know, I keep referring to things as signals
[01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:09.180]   and really I'm just, that's like my generic word
[01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:12.620]   for a quantity of energy of some sort, you know,
[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:14.540]   but your brain, my brain, every brain
[01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:18.380]   is constantly making signal, noise, like distinctions.
[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:19.400]   Do I need to care about this?
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:21.340]   Do I not need to care about this, right?
[01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:23.620]   And we have ways of learning
[01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:25.380]   and we also have ways of cueing each other.
[01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:29.920]   So, you know, humans use eye gaze to cue each other
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.820]   about what is signal and what is noise, right?
[01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:33.220]   So if you and I are sitting,
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:34.900]   let's say we were at a coffee shop
[01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:36.260]   and we were in a part of town
[01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:37.660]   that I'd never been to before
[01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:39.460]   and we were sitting having coffee
[01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:42.020]   and, you know, a loud siren went by.
[01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:45.300]   If you turned and looked, I would probably turn and look
[01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:47.460]   because you just cued me
[01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:49.120]   that that was something I need to care about.
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:52.740]   If you ignored it, I would probably ignore it
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:55.860]   because you just cued me that I didn't need to worry about it
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:56.740]   I didn't need to care
[01:05:56.740 --> 01:05:58.580]   and we're constantly doing that with each other
[01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:01.100]   and we also do it with little babies and with kids
[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:02.720]   and that's how we teach children.
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:04.140]   This is signal, this is noise.
[01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:06.540]   This you need to worry about, this you can ignore.
[01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:08.780]   And so, yeah, your description is perfect.
[01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:10.100]   So what does this have to do,
[01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:13.740]   any of this have to do with emotion?
[01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:16.540]   In order to answer that part of the question,
[01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:20.500]   I wanna say, so, okay, you've got these signals.
[01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:23.500]   The brain is like, has these electrical signals going on.
[01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:26.380]   We'll just ignore the hormonal signals for the moment
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:28.460]   'cause that's complicated, you know, one is complicated.
[01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:31.220]   So it's got all these electrical signals going on.
[01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:32.620]   When it's remembering something,
[01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:35.660]   it's just basically reinstating a pattern of signals
[01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:37.660]   and it's got these signals coming in
[01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.900]   from the sensory services.
[01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:42.660]   Okay, so what is the brain doing?
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:43.940]   It's a signal processor.
[01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:44.780]   So what is it?
[01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:45.660]   I don't mean a computer,
[01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:47.780]   I mean a signal processor in the engineering sense.
[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:50.100]   So what is it doing?
[01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:54.260]   Without getting into all the dynamics of prediction
[01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:57.100]   and you know, whatever, what the brain is doing
[01:06:57.100 --> 01:07:02.020]   is it's assembling a set of features.
[01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:04.140]   It's some of the features that it's assembling
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:07.340]   are very close in detail
[01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:10.060]   to the sensory surfaces of the body.
[01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:14.820]   So in primary visual cortex, there's a retinotopic map.
[01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:17.300]   The details there are very, very low level,
[01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:19.540]   like a line, an edge, you know,
[01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:21.860]   same thing in primary auditory cortex, right?
[01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:24.780]   It's tonotopic, so there are tones.
[01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:27.860]   But it's very, very, very low level details.
[01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:30.140]   And we might, there are many, many, many, many
[01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:31.100]   of these little features.
[01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:34.060]   So we would say it's a high dimensional array,
[01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:37.340]   lots and lots and lots and lots of features.
[01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:40.580]   And then, and let's just talk about one structure,
[01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:41.860]   just the cerebral cortex.
[01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:43.660]   Let's not worry about,
[01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:45.980]   but what I'm about to say is basically true
[01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:48.500]   of really the rest of the brain as well.
[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:52.140]   If you take the cortex off the surface,
[01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:55.780]   the cortical sheet, off that wavy, you know,
[01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:58.300]   cortical sheet, take it off the rest of the brain,
[01:07:58.300 --> 01:07:59.140]   the subcortical parts,
[01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:00.780]   and you stretch it out like a napkin,
[01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:02.940]   you can see there's a compression gradient there
[01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:05.380]   in the architecture of the neurons.
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:07.580]   So at the primary sensory areas,
[01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:10.660]   there are these tiny little pyramidal neurons
[01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:13.900]   that are representing these very low level features.
[01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:16.020]   And they feed into bigger neurons,
[01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:17.380]   which feed into bigger neurons,
[01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:19.420]   which feed into bigger neurons.
[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:24.420]   So what's happening is you've got this very detailed array
[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:27.260]   being compressed in its dimensionality
[01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:30.020]   until you get to the middle of the brain at the front,
[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:32.460]   where there are many fewer neurons,
[01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:35.820]   but they're bigger and they have many more connections.
[01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:38.700]   So it's a dimensionality reduction that's happening.
[01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:42.060]   - So just to make sure I understand correctly
[01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:43.860]   and that the audience understands,
[01:08:43.860 --> 01:08:47.860]   the physical world obviously is transformed
[01:08:47.860 --> 01:08:50.900]   by our sensory apparatus, the retina, the cochlea,
[01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:54.760]   the sensing neurons in our skin.
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:57.220]   It's physical things, mechanical pressure,
[01:08:57.220 --> 01:08:58.860]   light, photons, sound waves.
[01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:01.800]   Okay, that's translated into neural code,
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:04.060]   which is chemical and electrical.
[01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:08.460]   And those sensory inputs are fairly vast
[01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:11.980]   and they use high dimension, high dimensionality.
[01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:14.280]   So lots of different orientations of lines,
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:16.260]   even though it originates
[01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:18.360]   with just three cone photo pigments,
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:21.060]   lots of opportunity for encoding different shades of color,
[01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:23.780]   contrast, okay, and all of that.
[01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:25.140]   And so you have lots of little neurons
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:27.380]   to represent all the possibilities
[01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:29.340]   of the physical world that are occurring.
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:35.040]   But as that information is passed further up along,
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:37.340]   excuse me, I have to be careful with the use of hierarchies
[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.840]   'cause that's controversial nowadays,
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:42.700]   not for political reasons, but for accuracy reasons.
[01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:45.240]   As that information is passed along,
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:48.540]   there's more convergence
[01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:51.920]   onto a smaller number of larger neurons.
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:53.140]   So these are neurons that have access
[01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:55.680]   to a lot of information, but in coarser form.
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:59.120]   - Right, so they're low, it's like compressing an MP3,
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:01.860]   like how an MP3 compresses information, for example.
[01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:05.320]   So the cortex is representing features.
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:08.720]   So, and I represent, I'm just using that in a generic way
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:10.400]   because that's also controversial
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.700]   about exactly how is the brain, okay, but yeah.
[01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:13.540]   - But it works.
[01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:16.220]   - But for now I'm using it just in a generic way.
[01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:20.220]   So you go from lines and edges to a shape,
[01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:23.900]   like a round shape to a face, right?
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:25.120]   So you're basically,
[01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:31.340]   you're going, what's happening is there are summaries
[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:34.380]   of summaries of summaries of summaries.
[01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:35.220]   - I love that.
[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:37.120]   I hope everyone hears that
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:40.180]   'cause I've been in this field of neuroscience a long time.
[01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:42.700]   As you move along the neuroaxis
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:44.840]   from the sensory epithelium,
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:46.760]   now it sounds very nomenclature-ish,
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:48.920]   but from the surface of the skin inward,
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.720]   you're getting summaries.
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:51.560]   - Yeah.
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:53.380]   - Ascent, more and more summaries.
[01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:55.520]   I think that's so important.
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:59.480]   That's like a gazillion dollar statement
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:02.160]   for understanding of the nervous system.
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:04.840]   - But each of those points correspond
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:08.180]   to some mental feature, like a line or an edge
[01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:12.760]   or a circle or a square or a face, right?
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:17.620]   But now then when you're in the midline at the front,
[01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:19.820]   what are those features?
[01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:22.080]   Well, those features are things like,
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:24.720]   they are multimodal summaries,
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:27.100]   meaning they are summaries of the sights
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:28.680]   and sounds and smells, right?
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:32.980]   And they are lower dimensional, meaning they're coarser.
[01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:37.980]   So there are things like threat, reward, pleasure.
[01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:40.560]   I mean, really abstract.
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:41.960]   That's what abstract means.
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:44.360]   It doesn't mean that those representations
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:48.360]   have no sensory or motor meaning.
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:51.120]   It means that threat, for example,
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:55.080]   a summary can have many different patterns
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:56.420]   associated with it.
[01:11:56.420 --> 01:12:00.760]   And the brain is treating them all as equivalent.
[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:05.140]   - This to me, again, feels so, so important
[01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:08.660]   for people to understand because as I'm hearing this
[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:10.600]   and this word summaries is just ringing in my mind,
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:14.880]   it's so important because one of the core components
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:17.400]   of my experience of my emotions,
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:20.200]   'cause that's all I can really say for sure,
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:25.080]   my subjective interpretation and labeling of my own emotions
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:28.360]   is that they are pretty broad bins,
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:30.200]   like I described earlier. - They are pretty broad bins.
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:33.280]   And so that's where I was exactly where I was going.
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:37.600]   So what about the word anger?
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.720]   Where is that represented?
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:43.000]   Well, that's one of these multimodal abstractions.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.060]   In fact, anger is just a couple of phonemes.
[01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:49.160]   It's a couple of sounds, but those sounds,
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:54.160]   the sound of anger corresponds over thousands of instances
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:57.000]   that you've learned in your life
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.480]   to very different patterns of sensory motor features.
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:04.120]   That's right, because what's going on in your body
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:07.920]   during anger can vary.
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:12.160]   What way you move your face in anger can vary
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:13.080]   depending on the situation.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:16.760]   What you see someone else doing in anger can vary.
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:21.000]   And so the word anger or any word
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.960]   is actually just a multimodal summary
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:28.760]   of many, many, many, many instances
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:32.120]   which are in their sensory and motor features,
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:35.400]   the sensory and motor meaning, very different.
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:38.360]   - And it seems to me are highly constrained
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:41.020]   by developmental and cultural experience.
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:43.280]   - Absolutely. - Because just today
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:45.720]   I learned that there's a word in Japan
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:48.680]   for the feeling that one has
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:50.920]   of having gotten a haircut they don't like.
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:54.240]   There's a word in Germany
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:57.560]   that pertains to the feeling of wanting to punch someone
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:59.880]   specifically because of the look on their face.
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:02.280]   - Well, really it's more like to you
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:04.560]   it feels like they're asking to be punched in the face.
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:07.040]   - Even as you added yet more dimensionality to it.
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:09.960]   So upon learning just those things just today,
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:13.360]   there is additional dimensionality brought in
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:17.720]   such that if I were to ever want to punch somebody
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:21.200]   in the face simply because of the look on their face,
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:26.200]   that I wouldn't necessarily label that as anger alone.
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:28.460]   It now has another dimension to it.
[01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:30.560]   And so I think I'm finally,
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:32.720]   I think I'm finally starting to understand
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:36.600]   how the developmental and the cultural influences
[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:40.680]   plus the fact that language is a pretty crude descriptor
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:43.040]   for this neural process that you're describing.
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:44.760]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:48.080]   But before you use the word granularity
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:49.520]   and so I'm gonna use that word too.
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:53.400]   In fact, I've coined that phrase emotional granularity.
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:15:00.360]   This is an aside, I coined that phrase almost 30 years ago
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:03.520]   and now people study it like it's a phenomenon
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:05.520]   which is cool in a sense.
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:08.400]   But also I kind of wanna keep reminding them
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:11.680]   like that's a word that refers to a process.
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:13.720]   It's not a thing, it's a process.
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:14.820]   But the process is,
[01:15:14.820 --> 01:15:18.640]   so when the brain is a category constructor,
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:22.900]   how fine grained are the categories?
[01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:24.820]   How precise are the categories, right?
[01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:28.640]   Like if you're using, if your feature of equivalence
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:31.160]   that your brain is using is threat,
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.240]   you're in really big trouble
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:36.260]   'cause there are like a gazillion different
[01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:39.320]   sensory motor patterns that could go with threat.
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:42.440]   So your category is gonna be massive.
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:44.600]   So how does the brain figure out
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:47.620]   which of those massive number of options
[01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:52.320]   is the one to use in this instance?
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:54.080]   If on the other hand,
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:57.520]   you don't just wanna use sensory motor patterns
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:58.920]   as the features of equivalence
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:01.160]   or the features that you're using to say,
[01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:04.440]   this instance right now is similar to these past instances.
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:06.760]   If I had to search like right now,
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:08.080]   what is similar to right now?
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:10.480]   It would be me sitting across the table
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:14.520]   from somebody who has a beard and is dressed in black.
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:16.760]   And there are a lot of details there
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:18.560]   that probably don't matter, right?
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:21.840]   So you'd be searching for a specific match from the past.
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:23.760]   That's not very efficient either.
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:27.640]   So you need something in the middle.
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:31.340]   And that is to say, you need to have,
[01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:32.900]   your brain has to be able to make categories
[01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:36.840]   that are more fine grained, but not super fine grained,
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:40.160]   but they have to be more fine grained than just threat.
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:42.360]   - You wanna keep the, in the library analogy
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:43.240]   that I made earlier,
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:45.920]   you want to keep the rest of the library accessible
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:46.760]   at some level.
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:47.580]   - Yeah.
[01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:49.120]   - So you're not just staring at that one book.
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:54.120]   - But if you use the category bad, this feels bad,
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:57.440]   then your brain is basically
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:03.100]   going to be partially constructing
[01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:05.520]   an entire wing full of books,
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:08.040]   like an entire wing full of options.
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:10.220]   If you use the word angry,
[01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:14.080]   then maybe it's a bookcase.
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:16.840]   It's constructing a bookcase full of options
[01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:19.000]   and a category that's the size of a bookcase.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.540]   And if you were using the word frustrated,
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:24.380]   then maybe it's a shelf.
[01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:26.640]   The brain can learn to construct categories
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:29.960]   at different scales of generalizability.
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:34.500]   So if I'm in an instance and my brain is making a guess,
[01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:36.820]   is it drawing from past instances
[01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:39.820]   that we're associated with the word anger?
[01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:42.540]   We're associated with the word fear.
[01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:44.220]   Maybe it's some combination.
[01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:46.580]   The words are just features, they're just sounds.
[01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:48.300]   There are also all sorts of other features,
[01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:49.620]   like what was my heart doing?
[01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:52.300]   What kind of motor actions did I make?
[01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:54.740]   What did I see next?
[01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:59.160]   So the point being, what I'm trying to bring here is that
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:04.020]   it's not like your brain creates an emotional state
[01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:05.780]   and then labels it.
[01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:09.240]   What your brain is doing is creating a category
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:13.640]   of possible futures of what it's going to do next.
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:17.920]   And that state is largely determined
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:22.680]   by what the brain is remembering
[01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:25.720]   and how it's drawing from that huge population,
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:29.060]   that huge library of options,
[01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:31.260]   which books is it sampling?
[01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:34.780]   - I love this so much because it explains so much
[01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:37.620]   that frankly has been perplexing to me
[01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:39.820]   and also somewhat troubling to me.
[01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:43.660]   For instance, we hear about emotional intelligence
[01:18:43.660 --> 01:18:45.580]   and sometimes I wonder whether or not
[01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:47.940]   true emotional intelligence would be
[01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:49.520]   what you just described,
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:51.660]   the understanding of how this process works
[01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:52.980]   so that you can work with it.
[01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:54.560]   And I definitely want to talk about
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:56.120]   how one can work with this knowledge
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:58.340]   because I think it's incredibly powerful
[01:18:58.340 --> 01:19:03.340]   in its explanatory power, but also its actionable power.
[01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:06.300]   The other thing is that it's clear to me,
[01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:07.780]   just based on my experience today
[01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:09.460]   of hearing these words from other cultures
[01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:11.220]   that relate to different emotional states,
[01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:14.820]   that this system, unlike a lot of systems in the brain,
[01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:17.860]   I like to think is fairly plastic.
[01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:19.780]   Like the moment that you know
[01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:22.060]   that there are additional dimensions
[01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:24.100]   to sadness, anger, et cetera,
[01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:26.460]   there's something comforting about that.
[01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:28.720]   What's really unsettling is the idea
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:33.340]   that we have such broad bins that we would define
[01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:35.940]   a near infinite number of situations as just fear.
[01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:37.340]   That would suck.
[01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:39.220]   That's not a good existence.
[01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:42.980]   And yet I have to ask whether or not you think that
[01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:47.500]   as a species, not as a culture, but our entire species,
[01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:51.380]   whether or not we are taking the exact opposite approach
[01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:54.440]   that we're sort of moving into the emoji-ization,
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:55.280]   is that a word?
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:58.740]   Make it a word and people can assault me in the comments.
[01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:02.860]   The emoji-ization of this very rich and complex system,
[01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:05.360]   we're starting to get into this mode of like,
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:07.380]   I'm going to post an angry face and therefore,
[01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:09.240]   like, this is a bad, I'm angry at you.
[01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:10.340]   This is a bad interaction.
[01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:12.900]   We're going to, it's potentially combative.
[01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:16.420]   Or, and you know, maybe Twitter X or Instagram
[01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:20.060]   or other social media sites are kind of the epitome of this,
[01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:24.380]   where you reduce this high dimensional space in,
[01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:26.680]   you keep the sensory stimulation very high.
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:29.540]   It's movie after movie after movie and color and sound
[01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:31.720]   and people doing crazy parkour stuff
[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:34.600]   and bears eating giraffes or whatever it is,
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:36.760]   probably not bears eating giraffes, but you know what I mean?
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:38.980]   And you can see stuff that's sexual and violent
[01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:41.120]   and political and emotional and sweet.
[01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:44.040]   And then the cats are kissing the monkey and you're like,
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:45.340]   or the monkey's kissing the cat.
[01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:48.620]   And so it's high dimensionality in terms of sensory space.
[01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:49.740]   But then what do we call it?
[01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:52.600]   We're like, oh, this is an emoji.
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:54.820]   You assign an emoji, you're hearting something.
[01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:56.640]   You're giving a thumbs up or a thumbs down.
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:59.460]   So I almost feel like we're trying to,
[01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:02.200]   we're regressing to a state where we're kind of like
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:03.720]   an infant trying to figure out like what the hell
[01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:05.240]   is going on and we're saying, you know what?
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:07.640]   You get like six categories of response.
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:11.540]   When in reality, we should probably be expanding
[01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:14.120]   the number of different responses that we can have
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:15.780]   in order to accurately match the way
[01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:18.260]   that our nervous system actually works.
[01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:20.120]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:22.520]   There are many different things we could talk about
[01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:24.340]   with respect to the summary that you just gave,
[01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:27.260]   which I think is completely accurate.
[01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:30.400]   So what I would say is that if you look through
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:34.320]   even just the last, I don't know, 100 or so years,
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:39.100]   like the 19th, 20th centuries, maybe,
[01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:44.100]   you can see that the complexity of people's responses
[01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:47.880]   expands and contracts, right?
[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:50.520]   So for example, this is something that I've written
[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:55.520]   really speculatively about, but one of the things
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:22:01.080]   that I found really interesting is that authoritarianism,
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:04.560]   authoritarian thinking is the reduction of complexity
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:07.360]   to some things that are really, really simple.
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:09.680]   Like you're getting rid of all the complexity
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:14.680]   to basically these very, very coarse,
[01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:19.680]   low dimensional judgments and things become black and white.
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:23.240]   It's the avoidance of complexity
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:27.240]   so that there can be simple, single answers to things.
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:32.240]   And it happens in human culture at times,
[01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:36.880]   and then there's an expansion of complexity at times too.
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:40.440]   So what predicts that?
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:43.000]   Like what is it in the human nervous system
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.840]   or our collective human nervous,
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:47.960]   like we're just a bunch of brains attached to bodies
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:50.160]   interacting with other brains and bodies, right?
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:55.160]   So like, what is it that causes these ripples of,
[01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:56.960]   and I have some thoughts about that
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:59.160]   that are really, really, really speculative.
[01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:03.960]   But I think the other thing that's really important
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:06.040]   is that we've talked about,
[01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:08.840]   so we'll go back to our cortical sheet that we've,
[01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:11.000]   and by the way, this is just one compression gradient
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.680]   in the brain, there are others too, right?
[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:16.480]   There are at least four others that I can think of.
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:18.240]   So this is just one.
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:20.720]   But all compression gradients work the same way,
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:22.520]   which is that, now we've talked about
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:25.360]   going from the low level details,
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:27.560]   compressing to these multimodal summaries,
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:31.720]   these really like simple features that are, right?
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:36.720]   But that compression is what engineers would call lossy,
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:43.040]   meaning you lose the information, you lose the information.
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:47.560]   So when you go from lines and edges to a face,
[01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:49.800]   those neurons, they just know the face.
[01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:53.000]   They don't have, they lose what they've thrown away,
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.320]   the details they've thrown away,
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:57.120]   those details are gone for those neurons
[01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:58.320]   that are representing a face.
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:23:59.160]   - They don't have access to that.
[01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:00.920]   - They don't have access to it.
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:03.320]   So we said, well, the brain is making a guess.
[01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:06.560]   It's making a guess about what this big,
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:11.560]   very, very high dimensional soup of signals in the world
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:14.480]   and in the body, like, what do they mean, right?
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:16.320]   When the brain makes a guess,
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:20.880]   it starts with the compressed low dimensional signals.
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:26.200]   It starts with the features like anger or like threat,
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:28.800]   or it starts with these summaries,
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:33.800]   and then it has to infer or guess at every synapse,
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:38.200]   there's a guess that's being made
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:42.040]   about what the details are at the next level,
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:44.880]   because what's happening is the guess
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:47.920]   is basically the brain going from these really general things
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:51.400]   to these very specific sensory motor patterns.
[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:53.200]   It happens along the cortical sheet.
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:55.600]   It happens also down the neuroaxis,
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:59.520]   down the nerve, you know, from the cortex to the midbrain,
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:01.360]   to the brainstem, to the spinal cord.
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:05.040]   You have to go from a representation of, you know,
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:10.040]   run to the actual physical movements of muscles,
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:14.320]   spindles and, you know, angles of joints
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:15.240]   and things like that.
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:17.960]   So what you're doing is you're going in the other direction.
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:20.560]   You're adding detail, you're particularizing,
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:22.040]   and the brain is guessing.
[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:26.040]   It's guessing, well, if it's using anger
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:30.400]   as the general feature, well, which instance of anger is it?
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:35.360]   And what are the specifics that are going to happen?
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:38.280]   - And what are the, and forgive me,
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:41.680]   but what are the adaptive steps
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:43.640]   that I might take or not take?
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:46.840]   Because, I'm quoting a lot today, so forgive me,
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:49.840]   but in the words of the great Sherrington,
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:51.360]   Nobel Prize winning physiologist,
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:53.920]   the final common pathway is movement.
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:54.920]   - Is movement.
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:56.880]   - And movement is nuanced, right?
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:59.780]   Humans, I suppose, have among the greatest variety
[01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:01.400]   of different speeds and types of movement.
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:03.600]   I think about parkour, gymnastics,
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:06.520]   think about then what like a cheetah can do.
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:07.940]   Cheetahs are impressive.
[01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:10.700]   A gymnast is truly impressive in terms of the range
[01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:12.200]   of movements and speeds, et cetera.
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:15.760]   In any event, the ultimate choice
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:16.800]   that the nervous system has to make
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:19.760]   is whether or not to move, which direction,
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:22.960]   how fast, or stay still, move forward, move back.
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:24.520]   And I'll just add,
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:26.720]   'cause I'm hoping that you'll expand on this.
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:31.460]   It's been said before that ultimately the nervous system
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:35.080]   is trying to make decisions about yum, yuck, or meh.
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:37.180]   Like, am I going to move towards something?
[01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:38.460]   Am I going to move away from it?
[01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:40.060]   Or am I just going to stay put?
[01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:43.140]   - Well, that's only at the, that's a very,
[01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:45.900]   I would say that those are very low dimensional features.
[01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:47.380]   So those are those compressed features,
[01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:50.140]   but that's not the only thing the brain has to decide.
[01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:51.920]   That's just a misnomer.
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:54.160]   - Well, I can get out of this little pickle
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:56.340]   that I just put myself in by saying that I didn't say that.
[01:26:56.340 --> 01:26:57.880]   And now I won't quote who did,
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:59.600]   'cause he's a very famous neuroscientist,
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:00.880]   but he tried to reduce it all.
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:04.220]   He's at Caltech, he's not somebody who studies emotion.
[01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:05.520]   He studies the visual system.
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:09.060]   But he said that the neural circuits,
[01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:10.460]   maybe it's 'cause he studies mice,
[01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:15.260]   are essentially binned into yum, yuck, and meh outputs.
[01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:17.660]   And I've always liked it on the one hand,
[01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:19.260]   'cause threes work and it's simple,
[01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:21.420]   but rarely is the way that we describe things
[01:27:21.420 --> 01:27:22.260]   the way it actually works.
[01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:24.760]   - Yeah, so we would, in studying humans,
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:28.280]   we would say, well, that's affect, affect, that's mood.
[01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:31.520]   Or it's just like, is it, should I move towards it?
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:32.440]   Is it pleasant?
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:33.720]   Should I move away from it?
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:34.760]   Is it unpleasant?
[01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:36.640]   Or is it irrelevant, basically?
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:37.920]   I don't care.
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:39.780]   Okay, think about when you're feeling horrible.
[01:27:39.780 --> 01:27:44.100]   You just feel, you feel bad.
[01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:45.420]   What do you do?
[01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:46.260]   - You don't know it.
[01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:48.600]   - You don't know, because you don't have a plan of action.
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:53.120]   And that's ultimately, that is what those compressed
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:57.400]   like summary features, those very low course features,
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:00.700]   they have to be decompressed into details.
[01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:02.940]   Otherwise, you don't know what to do.
[01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:05.920]   So ultimately, what the brain is doing
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:10.920]   is it's sampling from the past based on similarity
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:14.480]   to the present to plan an action.
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:15.440]   And when I say action,
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:18.780]   I don't just mean skeletal motor action, like moving a limb.
[01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:21.720]   The first actions that are planned
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:25.000]   are the actions of coordinating the heart and the lungs
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:30.000]   and all of the internal actions that are required
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.760]   to support the motor, the skeletal motor movements.
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:36.380]   So your brain is making, is categorizing,
[01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:40.480]   it's creating a category and there are options there.
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:44.000]   Those options, the motor plans begin with,
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000]   should the heart beat faster?
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.160]   Should it beat slower?
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:48.760]   Does blood pressure need to go up?
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:53.720]   Should the blood vessels constrict or should they dilate?
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:56.860]   Should the breathing be deeper or more shallow?
[01:28:56.860 --> 01:29:00.500]   I mean, those are the first plans that get made.
[01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:02.000]   And then milliseconds later,
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.120]   there are the skeletal motor plans.
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:07.320]   And then your experience of the world
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:09.880]   derives from those motor plans.
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:13.400]   Those viscera motor, that is the plans for the viscera,
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:15.760]   for the internal organs and the skeletal motor.
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:18.120]   So I'm just gonna refer to them as motor.
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:20.000]   Those motor plans actually give rise
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.760]   to your experience of the world.
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:25.320]   There's not some state that exists as an emotional state,
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:27.360]   which then you apply a label to.
[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:32.360]   The label is just a set of features that are useful
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:39.280]   for generalizing from the past to the present.
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:43.480]   And the bin size or the, you know,
[01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:48.240]   of what a word refers to can change.
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:50.620]   It can change, it's different for different people
[01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:53.620]   and it can change in your lifetime.
[01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:55.560]   And you can add new bins.
[01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:57.240]   That is, you can, so for example,
[01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:59.600]   there's a concept giskinluk,
[01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:01.040]   which I probably just butchered.
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:03.340]   So if you speak Turkish, I'm sorry.
[01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:06.120]   But it's like, it has features of it,
[01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:11.120]   of like loss and like people blocking your goals.
[01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:14.760]   So we would say it's anger and sadness together.
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:16.600]   That's giskinluk, when you lose something
[01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:18.600]   and you're pissed off about it.
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:22.880]   That's a, but that's a category on its own, right?
[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:24.480]   It's just a different way of parsing
[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:27.680]   that really detailed soup.
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:31.240]   And the more words you know,
[01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:36.080]   the more, words are just useful for pointing
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:38.440]   to a set of features that are similar to each other.
[01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:41.680]   So what I mean by that is, if I say to you, Andrew,
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:43.440]   I had pizza last night for dinner.
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:48.840]   Pizza, two sounds, two syllables.
[01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:51.300]   That, those two syllables, they stand in
[01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:54.540]   for like 50 different sensory and motor features.
[01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:59.040]   'Cause I don't have to say to you, I had a food,
[01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:01.080]   I didn't have pizza last night, but let's say I did.
[01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:05.460]   I had a food that was round and flat and had sauce
[01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:08.380]   and also cheese and it had mozzarella cheese
[01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:10.260]   and also a little Parmesan cheese.
[01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:14.220]   And it had mushrooms on it and a little bit of olive.
[01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:19.220]   And that's like really, really detailed and complicated.
[01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:23.140]   But instead I can just say, I had pizza, two features,
[01:31:23.140 --> 01:31:26.500]   two sounds, two syllables, phonemes.
[01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:28.820]   And with those two phonemes,
[01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:31.580]   I have just communicated to you in your brain.
[01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:34.740]   My brain had 50 features it was representing of details.
[01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:38.400]   And now I have just communicated those to you
[01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:43.400]   or some number of them with two sounds, very efficient.
[01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:48.620]   Now, of course, you might think that I was from Chicago
[01:31:48.620 --> 01:31:51.700]   and had deep dish pizza and I'll just resist.
[01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:54.100]   I don't wanna like offend anybody from Chicago.
[01:31:54.100 --> 01:31:56.100]   - It's not pizza, I'll say it. - That's not real pizza.
[01:31:56.100 --> 01:31:57.320]   That's not real pizza.
[01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:02.900]   Right, so you could then ask me, was it,
[01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:05.180]   but you're from Chicago, is that deep dish pizza?
[01:32:05.180 --> 01:32:07.780]   And then I would say, no, no, I'm actually from Toronto,
[01:32:07.780 --> 01:32:09.040]   which is just like New York.
[01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:10.660]   And so no, it was thin crust pizza,
[01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:14.420]   which is really the only kind of pizza there is, just saying.
[01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:19.420]   But my point is that words are just stand in for,
[01:32:19.420 --> 01:32:23.620]   they're just these like low dimensional features,
[01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:26.860]   these sort of gross features that stand in for many,
[01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:28.940]   many, many, many little detailed features.
[01:32:28.940 --> 01:32:31.220]   And that's how we communicate with each other.
[01:32:31.220 --> 01:32:34.660]   - And we are constrained by what we know in our-
[01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:35.500]   - Yes.
[01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:38.260]   - And what we can say and the extent of our vocabulary.
[01:32:38.260 --> 01:32:42.780]   - And I'll just say that little babies, three months old,
[01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:46.100]   they don't speak yet and they don't understand language,
[01:32:46.100 --> 01:32:51.100]   but they can use words to learn abstract categories.
[01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:55.100]   So abstract just means that the word refers
[01:32:55.100 --> 01:32:57.560]   to many different patterns of sensory motor features.
[01:32:57.560 --> 01:33:01.380]   So the word is, or the category,
[01:33:01.380 --> 01:33:06.380]   the things that make the instances similar are a function
[01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:09.840]   or a goal, not like the sensory motor feature.
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:13.820]   So you say to a baby, very explicitly,
[01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:14.740]   'cause we're talking about three,
[01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:16.560]   four month old babies, right?
[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:20.500]   Babies can also do this implicitly too.
[01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:23.020]   But in experiments, you say to a baby,
[01:33:23.020 --> 01:33:27.060]   look, sweetie, this is a bling.
[01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:31.420]   And you put the bling down and it makes a beeping noise.
[01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:34.900]   And then you say, now this looks different,
[01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:36.540]   feels different, right?
[01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:38.300]   Smells different.
[01:33:38.300 --> 01:33:41.460]   Look, sweetie, this is a bling.
[01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:45.420]   It beeps.
[01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:50.420]   Now you take something else, which also is different.
[01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:53.680]   And you say, look, sweetie, this is a bling.
[01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:56.960]   Now the baby expects this to beep.
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:33:58.440]   - By the way, folks, just listening,
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:00.340]   Lisa just gave three examples,
[01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:03.120]   first with a pen, then a coffee mug,
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:06.700]   and then her very own watch, three very distinct objects,
[01:34:06.700 --> 01:34:09.440]   but all of which make, that are told,
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:12.300]   the baby is told make a bling sound
[01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:17.220]   and they will bin those three visually distinct objects,
[01:34:17.220 --> 01:34:19.860]   functionally distinct objects into one single bin.
[01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:21.220]   - Because they make a,
[01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:24.540]   because they are sharing a function, which is to beep.
[01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:26.620]   - I think this is so important.
[01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:31.620]   And I, and if I may, I want to ask
[01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:37.560]   whether or not we can take this incredible understanding
[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:41.880]   of emotions, 'cause that's really what we're talking about.
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:43.680]   - Well, really talking about how the brain,
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:45.140]   my version of how the brain works
[01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:49.000]   and how emotions emerge out of this system, basically.
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:53.200]   - And absolutely, you described it far better than I could.
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:57.580]   And anchor that to this concept of movement,
[01:34:57.580 --> 01:34:59.720]   that the movement is the final common path,
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:03.300]   with the understanding that the movement system,
[01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:05.060]   and forgive me, but that we have systems
[01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:06.720]   in the brain and body that allow us to move,
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:09.720]   that's for sure, systems, plural,
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:11.580]   that they run in both directions.
[01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:16.580]   In other words, how we feel what we feel our emotions
[01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:19.720]   has some bearing on the movements
[01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:22.820]   that are more or less likely for us in a given context.
[01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:26.500]   And our movements clearly can also influence
[01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:28.500]   the way that we feel internally, right?
[01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:31.300]   - Well, I mean, so if we just look
[01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:32.380]   at how things are happening,
[01:35:32.380 --> 01:35:35.320]   here's what the anatomy tells us,
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:37.180]   that when the brain makes a guess,
[01:35:37.180 --> 01:35:40.540]   that guess starts as a motor plan,
[01:35:40.540 --> 01:35:43.620]   starts as a visceral motor plan and a skeletal motor plan.
[01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:45.900]   - So heart rate changes, breathing changes,
[01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:47.500]   blood pressure changes,
[01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:49.500]   and potentially skeletal muscle movement.
[01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:52.620]   - Right, and literal copies,
[01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:56.100]   literal copies, efferent copies of those signals
[01:35:56.100 --> 01:35:59.420]   are sent to, they propagate to the sensory areas,
[01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:02.300]   telling the brain, telling those neurons,
[01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:04.480]   this is the last time we've made this,
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:07.920]   in this context, when this other stuff just happened,
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:09.920]   like this temporal context, right?
[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:14.260]   And we made these movements, here's what we saw next,
[01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:19.260]   here's what we felt next, here's what we smelled next, so.
[01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:21.980]   - Yeah, I think of this as the image that pops in my mind,
[01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:24.820]   and we should explain to people what efferents copy is,
[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:26.900]   in neuroscience and neuroanatomy,
[01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:29.900]   the connection to a structure is called an afferent
[01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:32.300]   with an A, and the connections out from a structure
[01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:34.180]   are called the efferents, but the way I was thinking-
[01:36:34.180 --> 01:36:35.860]   - It doesn't even matter, it's just basically,
[01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:38.980]   the point here is that in our experience,
[01:36:38.980 --> 01:36:42.540]   in the way, your brain conjures an experience, okay?
[01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:46.800]   And that experience is that you feel something first,
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:49.820]   you see something, you feel something, you act.
[01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:51.320]   That's not what's happening.
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:55.260]   What's happening is your brain is preparing the action first
[01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:58.420]   and the feeling, and your experience,
[01:36:58.420 --> 01:37:00.840]   comes from that action preparation.
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:04.580]   So it's a copy, it's like literally you have axons
[01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:09.240]   that are sending motor signals down the brainstem
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:13.180]   to the spinal cord, and literal copies of those axons,
[01:37:13.180 --> 01:37:17.040]   like those axons have branches, that collateral branches
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:20.240]   that just send axons other places.
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:25.240]   The same signal that is being sent to your spinal cord
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:28.660]   to move stuff in your body,
[01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:33.060]   that same signal is being sent to other neurons in the brain
[01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:36.220]   as predictions of the sensations that are gonna happen
[01:37:36.220 --> 01:37:38.020]   in a second from now, a moment from now,
[01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:39.580]   probably faster than a second,
[01:37:39.580 --> 01:37:44.020]   but in a couple of milliseconds, if you move.
[01:37:44.020 --> 01:37:46.620]   And so, yes, it is the case
[01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:49.160]   that what you feel is linked to what you do,
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:50.980]   and what you do is linked to what you feel,
[01:37:50.980 --> 01:37:54.060]   but not in this simple mechanistic way
[01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:56.620]   that neuroscientists and psychologists
[01:37:56.620 --> 01:37:59.820]   have been using forever.
[01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:04.820]   It's not like you're probed by a stimulus,
[01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:07.900]   you see something, you hear something,
[01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:10.740]   and then you process it and evaluate it,
[01:38:10.740 --> 01:38:11.920]   and then you react to it.
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:13.380]   No, that's not what's happening.
[01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:15.660]   What's actually happening under the hood
[01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:18.180]   is that based on how things are right now,
[01:38:18.180 --> 01:38:20.960]   your brain makes a guess, or some guesses,
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:24.160]   and those guesses start as motor plans,
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:27.900]   and the consequence of those motor plans
[01:38:27.900 --> 01:38:30.240]   are predicted sensations.
[01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:32.940]   And then, of course, sensory signals
[01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:34.680]   are coming from the sensory surfaces,
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:39.340]   and here's, to me, really the most mind-boggling thing
[01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:41.720]   about this whole explanation.
[01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:47.500]   If your sensory neurons in your sensory areas are already,
[01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:50.580]   so they're firing, the action potentials,
[01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:51.940]   the spiking has changed
[01:38:51.940 --> 01:38:54.480]   based on these prepared motor movements,
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:56.720]   so these are sensory predictions.
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:58.620]   And when I give talks, and on my website,
[01:38:58.620 --> 01:39:01.260]   I have some cool examples of how this works,
[01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:03.280]   you can experience it yourself.
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:07.420]   You start to experience, you hear things that aren't there,
[01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:09.940]   you feel vibrations in your chest that aren't there,
[01:39:09.940 --> 01:39:11.140]   because your brain is predicting,
[01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:12.920]   it's predicting these sensations.
[01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:15.900]   So let's say the sensations come,
[01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:17.940]   the sensory signals, I should say, let me say,
[01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:21.480]   so the sensory signals from the sensory surfaces of the body
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:22.520]   make it to the brain.
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:28.560]   If you have, if your neurons are already firing in a way
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:31.180]   to anticipate those signals,
[01:39:31.180 --> 01:39:34.140]   those signals just confirm the firing,
[01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:34.980]   and then they're done,
[01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:37.340]   they don't make it any further into the brain.
[01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:41.980]   So when you're predicting well,
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:46.980]   your experience is constructed completely by your brain.
[01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:50.020]   The signals from the sensory surfaces
[01:39:50.020 --> 01:39:52.380]   are there just to confirm,
[01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:55.780]   or to change the signals.
[01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:59.360]   So if there's things you didn't anticipate,
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:03.240]   then those errors of prediction,
[01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:05.060]   those are the signals that are propagated
[01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:06.440]   and become compressed and stuff,
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:10.140]   and we have a special name for that in science,
[01:40:10.140 --> 01:40:12.080]   we call it learning.
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:14.500]   You know, Andy Clark is a philosopher
[01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:16.660]   who writes a lot about prediction,
[01:40:16.660 --> 01:40:18.620]   predicting brain and so on,
[01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:22.100]   and he talks about normal everyday experience
[01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:25.840]   as being a controlled hallucination.
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:27.720]   - That's true. - Yeah.
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:29.040]   - I subscribe to that.
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:33.500]   It's a fairly adaptive in most circumstances,
[01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:36.300]   controlled hallucination, but it has its limitations.
[01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:39.260]   And it, I mean, what we were talking about,
[01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:41.700]   if I could be somewhat of a summary neuron,
[01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:44.260]   you can tell me if my summary is too coarse,
[01:40:44.260 --> 01:40:46.940]   is that first of all, that the neural systems
[01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:48.940]   and the brain, let's just call it the nervous system,
[01:40:48.940 --> 01:40:51.360]   'cause we're talking about brain and body,
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:52.980]   are incredibly dynamic.
[01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:55.820]   There's a bunch of inputs.
[01:40:55.820 --> 01:40:58.040]   Those inputs are incredibly elaborate.
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:40:59.280]   They get summarized.
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:01.860]   The summary prepares the body for a certain action.
[01:41:01.860 --> 01:41:04.200]   That's a motor commands, a pre-motor commands,
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:06.860]   and then some action may or may not be taken,
[01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:11.800]   but already, as soon as an action is taken or not taken,
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:14.100]   the whole state of the neural system is different.
[01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:16.900]   It's changed as a consequence of what just happened.
[01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:18.740]   Now, of course, when people hear that,
[01:41:18.740 --> 01:41:21.020]   and when I hear that, indeed, I feel like,
[01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:22.700]   wow, it's a tough system to study,
[01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:24.860]   because these are dynamical neural systems,
[01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:28.080]   and we have the technology to put people
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:32.160]   in functional scanners and look at what lights up,
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:33.000]   so to speak.
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.420]   We have the capacity to ask people
[01:41:35.420 --> 01:41:36.940]   how they feel based on questionnaires,
[01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:39.320]   but you can imagine that's incredibly crude,
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:42.300]   so then you give them Likert scales of rate from one to 10,
[01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:44.020]   how happy or sad you are,
[01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:47.620]   and so you're adding some depth and dimensionality to it,
[01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:48.860]   but it's incredibly crude.
[01:41:48.860 --> 01:41:51.180]   It's nothing like real experience,
[01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:54.500]   and if somebody is more verbal, less verbal,
[01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:56.700]   maybe they somaticize more or less.
[01:41:56.700 --> 01:41:59.780]   The example comes to mind that occasionally
[01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:01.580]   you learn from social media,
[01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:03.340]   which often I learned from social media,
[01:42:03.340 --> 01:42:05.580]   when someone once said, "I don't think in thoughts.
[01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:08.220]   I think in feels," and I thought, okay, great.
[01:42:08.220 --> 01:42:09.980]   You're probably also from Northern California,
[01:42:09.980 --> 01:42:12.360]   and then I said, "Wait, Andrew, stop being so judgmental.
[01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:13.200]   What do you mean?"
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:14.020]   And I asked, and they said,
[01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:17.340]   "I experience emotions in their mind
[01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:19.940]   first as a bodily state.
[01:42:19.940 --> 01:42:22.740]   Then the label comes much later."
[01:42:22.740 --> 01:42:24.160]   That's not how it works for me.
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:27.940]   It feels fairly more integrated, brain and body for me,
[01:42:27.940 --> 01:42:30.280]   but other people started chiming in,
[01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:32.060]   "No, I think of emotion.
[01:42:32.060 --> 01:42:35.060]   I experience emotions clearly as a verbal label.
[01:42:35.060 --> 01:42:36.780]   It's all in their head."
[01:42:36.780 --> 01:42:37.880]   And so you start to realize
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:40.220]   that we might all be encoding the world
[01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:42.820]   slightly differently or very differently,
[01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:44.020]   and it's changing in time.
[01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:48.000]   So then the question becomes what are the anchor points
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.320]   in terms of our understanding of emotions
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:52.100]   that we can work with?
[01:42:52.100 --> 01:42:55.160]   And the following questions come to mind.
[01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:58.940]   Neither you nor I are clinicians as far as I know.
[01:42:58.940 --> 01:42:59.780]   I'm certainly not.
[01:42:59.780 --> 01:43:01.060]   - I was actually trained as a clinician.
[01:43:01.060 --> 01:43:01.880]   - Oh, there you go.
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:03.000]   You're wrong again.
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:03.840]   - No, no, no.
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:07.860]   But I haven't practiced in like really gazillions of years.
[01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:10.040]   - Well, you're more than qualified
[01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:11.440]   to answer the question I'm about to ask,
[01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:16.440]   which is to me, there is a great conflict of information
[01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:20.260]   in the psychology, psychiatry,
[01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:22.940]   and let's just call it wellness and mental health space,
[01:43:22.940 --> 01:43:27.140]   which is when we are feeling lousy, like not good,
[01:43:27.140 --> 01:43:28.720]   let's put valence on it, just lousy.
[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:31.500]   I don't want, in a state that we were having an emotion
[01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:32.860]   that we don't want to have,
[01:43:32.860 --> 01:43:36.980]   there's an entire category of information that says,
[01:43:36.980 --> 01:43:39.340]   you need to feel your feelings.
[01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:40.300]   You need to feel your feelings.
[01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:41.900]   You need to acknowledge that they're there.
[01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:45.480]   You need to go into the feeling, maybe even full catharsis.
[01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:47.220]   You need to amplify the feelings
[01:43:47.220 --> 01:43:49.740]   until they quote unquote leave your body.
[01:43:49.740 --> 01:43:52.200]   After all, Steve Jobs was into scream therapy
[01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:54.700]   and he helped him expunge his anger.
[01:43:54.700 --> 01:43:55.540]   Who knows?
[01:43:55.540 --> 01:43:56.860]   You get these examples.
[01:43:56.860 --> 01:43:58.180]   He's probably the worst example
[01:43:58.180 --> 01:44:00.580]   'cause it seemed like he was angry a lot from what I hear.
[01:44:00.580 --> 01:44:03.400]   But then there's another category of thought,
[01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:06.940]   which is, no, you need to use your ability
[01:44:06.940 --> 01:44:10.820]   to top down control inhibition of the cortex
[01:44:10.820 --> 01:44:11.860]   on lower structures.
[01:44:11.860 --> 01:44:14.620]   Again, I'm deliberately using crude language here
[01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:17.240]   to say, wait, this is an emotion.
[01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:19.100]   Emotions pass.
[01:44:19.100 --> 01:44:20.500]   This is not real.
[01:44:20.500 --> 01:44:23.760]   This is just a limited set of high dimensionality stuff
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:24.720]   that's been summarized.
[01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:25.560]   And you know what?
[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:28.000]   Like, I don't need to feel this way.
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.020]   I can make myself feel differently.
[01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:31.060]   Maybe I'll go for a run.
[01:44:31.060 --> 01:44:33.300]   In fact, I always feel better after I go for a run.
[01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:35.860]   So even this question as simple as
[01:44:35.860 --> 01:44:37.800]   should we feel our feelings
[01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:41.540]   or should we not feel our feelings?
[01:44:41.540 --> 01:44:42.740]   And of course, you would hope
[01:44:42.740 --> 01:44:45.380]   that this would be answered appropriately
[01:44:45.380 --> 01:44:48.460]   such that people don't go harm other people or themselves.
[01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:50.300]   But assuming that they're not gonna harm other people
[01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:52.300]   or themselves verbally or physically,
[01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:55.540]   then you really get yourself into a bit of a pickle.
[01:44:55.540 --> 01:44:58.380]   We don't understand what to do with emotions,
[01:44:59.260 --> 01:45:00.580]   ours or other people's,
[01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:05.580]   because clearly we don't understand emotions per se.
[01:45:05.580 --> 01:45:10.100]   - So I would say I'm gonna answer your question
[01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:14.340]   and then I wanna also pick at the word,
[01:45:14.340 --> 01:45:15.980]   I wanna pick at an assumption
[01:45:15.980 --> 01:45:19.040]   because it's come up actually a couple of times
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:22.600]   and there's something super important in your descriptions
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:26.060]   that I just wanna pull out for the listeners
[01:45:26.060 --> 01:45:27.300]   'cause this thing is really important
[01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:28.940]   and you're doing it very naturally,
[01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:32.480]   but I think some people, it just bears commenting on.
[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:34.560]   So let me just deal with the question of
[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:37.500]   should we feel our feelings or use our words?
[01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:38.980]   We say to little kids, use your words,
[01:45:38.980 --> 01:45:40.740]   don't throw a tantrum.
[01:45:40.740 --> 01:45:42.540]   But then there was also this other feeling,
[01:45:42.540 --> 01:45:44.140]   oh, just feel, it's important to feel
[01:45:44.140 --> 01:45:45.940]   and you don't wanna get it, have it be pent up.
[01:45:45.940 --> 01:45:48.900]   - Or use your body and hit a pillow.
[01:45:48.900 --> 01:45:50.700]   I mean, there's scream therapy, bite the pillow,
[01:45:50.700 --> 01:45:52.820]   scream the pillow, tear the pillow.
[01:45:52.820 --> 01:45:55.660]   You can pay $5,000 for a week of doing this
[01:45:55.660 --> 01:45:57.380]   and they'll tell you you're gonna feel better at the end.
[01:45:57.380 --> 01:46:00.980]   So the answer there is it's the wrong question.
[01:46:00.980 --> 01:46:05.980]   Like flexibility is important for everything always, right?
[01:46:05.980 --> 01:46:11.860]   So first of all, you don't have emotions in your body.
[01:46:11.860 --> 01:46:14.500]   Your body doesn't keep the score, you know?
[01:46:14.500 --> 01:46:17.060]   - Yeah, great book title because it's super catchy,
[01:46:17.060 --> 01:46:19.100]   but with all due respect to I think
[01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:22.500]   the important work of van der Kolk,
[01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:26.420]   I think it oversimplified and led people to believe
[01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:28.500]   that their back pain was trauma
[01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:32.620]   and that all trauma is somaticized and it's not.
[01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:33.460]   - No, it's not.
[01:46:33.460 --> 01:46:35.380]   But I would go further and say like,
[01:46:35.380 --> 01:46:37.540]   first of all, your body does keep the score,
[01:46:37.540 --> 01:46:41.140]   your brain keeps the score, your body is the scorecard.
[01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:44.020]   That's super important.
[01:46:44.020 --> 01:46:46.700]   And he has done really important work,
[01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:49.860]   but his explanations for why things work
[01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:52.700]   is scientifically incorrect.
[01:46:52.700 --> 01:46:57.380]   It just is because we don't feel things in our bodies.
[01:46:57.380 --> 01:47:00.060]   Everything we feel, we feel in our brains.
[01:47:00.060 --> 01:47:03.020]   We don't see in our eyes, we see in our brains.
[01:47:03.020 --> 01:47:06.780]   Of course, we need our eyes, but we don't see in our eyes.
[01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:10.900]   Just like if you pinch your hand,
[01:47:10.900 --> 01:47:14.460]   take skin and pinch between two fingers,
[01:47:14.460 --> 01:47:17.100]   the skin, you don't feel that actually in your hand,
[01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:19.180]   you feel it in your brain.
[01:47:19.180 --> 01:47:22.100]   That's the magic of the brain in a sense.
[01:47:22.100 --> 01:47:27.100]   So what I would say is it depends on the situation
[01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:31.740]   and what your goal is.
[01:47:31.740 --> 01:47:35.780]   Sometimes it is useful to use your words
[01:47:35.780 --> 01:47:38.120]   and sometimes it is useful to go for a run.
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:42.100]   It just depends on what your goal is.
[01:47:42.100 --> 01:47:45.260]   - Well, both those cases that you gave,
[01:47:45.260 --> 01:47:47.400]   both those examples, excuse me,
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:50.100]   it's a way of shifting off the emotion.
[01:47:50.100 --> 01:47:51.900]   I guess what I'm asking is-
[01:47:51.900 --> 01:47:53.940]   - Well, sometimes you don't want to shift off the emotion.
[01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:58.800]   Sometimes the wisest thing to do is live in the emotion.
[01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:02.880]   That is, sometimes discomfort,
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:04.660]   sometimes when something feels bad,
[01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:06.000]   it doesn't mean something is wrong.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.300]   It just might mean that you're doing something hard.
[01:48:08.300 --> 01:48:09.140]   - Well, earlier I wrote,
[01:48:09.140 --> 01:48:11.340]   when you're talking about the broad categorization
[01:48:11.340 --> 01:48:12.860]   of emotions, I wrote down,
[01:48:12.860 --> 01:48:15.060]   simple is good when it feels good.
[01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:16.540]   I just feel really great.
[01:48:16.540 --> 01:48:18.300]   But then when things feel lousy,
[01:48:18.300 --> 01:48:19.780]   that's where nuance could be beneficial.
[01:48:19.780 --> 01:48:24.700]   - Yeah, absolutely, because emotions are recipes for action.
[01:48:24.700 --> 01:48:29.620]   When you go from feeling bad to feeling angry or sad,
[01:48:29.620 --> 01:48:31.740]   it's a recipe for action.
[01:48:31.740 --> 01:48:34.580]   And I would also say, and this is an analogy,
[01:48:34.580 --> 01:48:37.140]   but I sort of, I stand by it.
[01:48:37.140 --> 01:48:43.700]   I had major back surgery a couple of years ago
[01:48:43.700 --> 01:48:46.500]   and I know something about chronic pain.
[01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:47.980]   It's not my area of study,
[01:48:47.980 --> 01:48:51.100]   but I know something about it because I've reanalyzed
[01:48:51.100 --> 01:48:53.260]   some data sets and I've read a lot.
[01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:56.340]   So I'm not an expert, but I have ideas.
[01:48:56.340 --> 01:48:57.180]   And I thought to myself,
[01:48:57.180 --> 01:49:00.860]   well, I don't want to end up with chronic back pain.
[01:49:00.860 --> 01:49:02.860]   So what I did was I made sure,
[01:49:02.860 --> 01:49:05.260]   after I got through the first couple of weeks
[01:49:05.260 --> 01:49:08.180]   where I really needed oxycodone so that I could walk,
[01:49:08.180 --> 01:49:10.900]   I was up and walking the same day I had surgery,
[01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:12.940]   if you could call it walking as sort of a euphemism
[01:49:12.940 --> 01:49:15.140]   for like hobbling around with a walker.
[01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:18.340]   But I made sure that I felt the pain.
[01:49:18.340 --> 01:49:24.380]   That is, I dosed myself with discomfort quite deliberately
[01:49:24.380 --> 01:49:28.260]   because I wanted to make sure that,
[01:49:28.260 --> 01:49:30.740]   I'm sorry for using, you know, Cartesian language.
[01:49:30.740 --> 01:49:32.180]   I don't know how else to say this.
[01:49:32.180 --> 01:49:35.960]   I wanted my brain to be taking in the prediction error.
[01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:38.940]   I wanted my brain to feel,
[01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:45.620]   I wanted to focus attention on the changing discomfort
[01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:52.120]   over time because it meant that my body was healing
[01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:53.480]   as the discomfort got less,
[01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:56.820]   but my brain would never feel that discomfort changing
[01:49:56.820 --> 01:50:00.380]   if I took painkillers.
[01:50:00.380 --> 01:50:05.380]   And because the prediction error,
[01:50:05.380 --> 01:50:07.660]   the things that the brain doesn't predict
[01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:09.860]   are teaching signals.
[01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:12.060]   And I think it's true also in your life.
[01:50:12.060 --> 01:50:13.940]   Like sometimes you wanna feel it
[01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:16.820]   because you wanna feel the discomfort
[01:50:16.820 --> 01:50:18.660]   because it's instructive about something.
[01:50:18.660 --> 01:50:20.300]   And sometimes it's not.
[01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:22.300]   And that's, maybe that's not really an answer,
[01:50:22.300 --> 01:50:25.020]   but the only way that you can figure that out for yourself
[01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:26.220]   is to do it sometimes.
[01:50:26.220 --> 01:50:28.740]   If you're always getting rid of discomfort,
[01:50:28.740 --> 01:50:30.540]   you never know when it's useful.
[01:50:30.540 --> 01:50:32.780]   And it is useful sometimes.
[01:50:32.780 --> 01:50:35.780]   But now I wanna get to this point that I was making before.
[01:50:35.780 --> 01:50:38.380]   Like we are talking about feeling and emotion
[01:50:38.380 --> 01:50:42.340]   like they're interchangeable and they're not, right?
[01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:44.980]   So here's how I would say it.
[01:50:44.980 --> 01:50:49.980]   Your brain is always regulating your body 24/7.
[01:50:49.980 --> 01:50:53.840]   And your body is always sending sensory signals
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:57.320]   back to the brain about the sensory state of the body.
[01:50:57.320 --> 01:51:02.060]   And our nervous systems aren't wired for us to experience
[01:51:02.060 --> 01:51:07.060]   those sensory changes that are happening in the body
[01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:09.040]   in any degree of detail.
[01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:12.300]   We're just not.
[01:51:12.300 --> 01:51:13.500]   And it's a good thing.
[01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:17.820]   Like right now, as we talk here, our hearts are beating
[01:51:17.820 --> 01:51:22.180]   and our pancreas is squishing stuff out,
[01:51:22.180 --> 01:51:28.020]   liver is filtering and like oxygen concentrations
[01:51:28.020 --> 01:51:29.740]   are changing.
[01:51:29.740 --> 01:51:32.980]   Like, oh, there's a whole drama going on inside each of us
[01:51:32.980 --> 01:51:34.060]   and our listeners.
[01:51:34.060 --> 01:51:35.920]   And we're largely, we're not aware.
[01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:37.580]   And I hope our listeners aren't aware
[01:51:37.580 --> 01:51:39.020]   because if they were, they would not be listening
[01:51:39.020 --> 01:51:40.180]   to anything we were saying.
[01:51:40.180 --> 01:51:45.180]   They'd be completely enraptured or in discomfort
[01:51:45.180 --> 01:51:47.260]   at what's going on inside them.
[01:51:47.260 --> 01:51:52.400]   Instead, the brain creates a low dimensional summary,
[01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:55.320]   this gross kind of like barometer,
[01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:58.040]   which is feeling, affective feeling.
[01:51:58.040 --> 01:51:59.440]   We call it, or you could call it mood,
[01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:01.740]   but scientists call it affect with an A.
[01:52:01.740 --> 01:52:04.220]   Feeling pleasant, feeling unpleasant, feeling worked up,
[01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:07.360]   feeling calm, feeling comfortable, feeling uncomfortable.
[01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:12.360]   It's kind of a general barometer of the state of the body.
[01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:14.800]   And it's not emotion.
[01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:18.220]   That, those feelings, those features of feeling
[01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:20.300]   are features of consciousness
[01:52:20.300 --> 01:52:22.620]   because your brain is always regulating your body.
[01:52:22.620 --> 01:52:24.940]   Your body's always sending signals back to the brain.
[01:52:24.940 --> 01:52:26.940]   The brain is always representing them
[01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:28.680]   in this low dimensional way.
[01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:30.320]   Whether you're paying attention or not,
[01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:32.220]   like whether the brain is focusing,
[01:52:32.220 --> 01:52:36.300]   it's applying attention to those neurons or not.
[01:52:36.300 --> 01:52:37.680]   Those signals are there.
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:40.840]   And even when we're not emotional.
[01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:44.300]   You know, like if you're driving on the highway
[01:52:44.300 --> 01:52:47.940]   and somebody cuts you off and you think, what an asshole.
[01:52:47.940 --> 01:52:49.920]   The assholeness of that person,
[01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:53.300]   that intensity of that negative affect is,
[01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:57.020]   you experience it as a property of that person,
[01:52:57.020 --> 01:52:59.060]   but really it's coming from you.
[01:52:59.060 --> 01:53:01.340]   It's not a property of that person.
[01:53:01.340 --> 01:53:06.220]   It's, that's a feature of your experience in that moment.
[01:53:06.220 --> 01:53:09.500]   And affect is always there.
[01:53:09.500 --> 01:53:10.780]   Sometimes it's in the foreground,
[01:53:10.780 --> 01:53:13.380]   sometimes it's in the background, but it's always there.
[01:53:13.380 --> 01:53:15.820]   And it's a summary of physical things,
[01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:18.060]   which is why it helps to,
[01:53:18.060 --> 01:53:22.160]   if you take ibuprofen or Tylenol, it will reduce,
[01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:25.300]   I mean, studies show it reduces negative feeling.
[01:53:25.300 --> 01:53:27.620]   If you go for a run, if you go for a walk,
[01:53:27.620 --> 01:53:30.460]   if you shift your attention to the outside world,
[01:53:31.460 --> 01:53:34.260]   then the features that of experience
[01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:38.820]   that are derived from the inside world diminish.
[01:53:38.820 --> 01:53:41.860]   That's why going for a run helps or going for a walk helps
[01:53:41.860 --> 01:53:45.660]   or, you know, getting sleep helps, right?
[01:53:45.660 --> 01:53:47.860]   These are all things where you're changing
[01:53:47.860 --> 01:53:49.740]   the state of your body.
[01:53:49.740 --> 01:53:52.180]   And so the sensory state of your body is changing
[01:53:52.180 --> 01:53:54.460]   and so your affect changes.
[01:53:54.460 --> 01:53:58.420]   But emotions are the story that the brain tells
[01:53:58.420 --> 01:54:02.900]   about what caused the sensory signals
[01:54:02.900 --> 01:54:04.460]   that affect derives from.
[01:54:04.460 --> 01:54:06.640]   So what caused those changes?
[01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:09.060]   What do I need to do about those changes?
[01:54:09.060 --> 01:54:12.900]   That's, it's a much bigger event
[01:54:12.900 --> 01:54:15.380]   than just these features of experience,
[01:54:15.380 --> 01:54:16.900]   which are all features of consciousness,
[01:54:16.900 --> 01:54:18.640]   which are always there.
[01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:19.460]   They're always there.
[01:54:19.460 --> 01:54:23.020]   And in fact, in our culture,
[01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:29.400]   we pathologize people when they just experience
[01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:34.540]   their bodies as physical sensations and not as emotions.
[01:54:34.540 --> 01:54:38.080]   Like we say, oh, that person is somaticizing or somatizing.
[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:41.840]   They're not, they should be experiencing an emotion,
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:43.120]   but really they're, you know,
[01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:45.800]   just experiencing a stomach ache and that's bad.
[01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:47.800]   But that's actually a judgment call
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:50.000]   that is probably sometimes wrong.
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:53.260]   Sometimes it's probably better to experience a stomach ache.
[01:54:53.260 --> 01:54:55.060]   Sometimes it's more productive.
[01:54:55.060 --> 01:54:56.340]   Part of being emotionally intelligent
[01:54:56.340 --> 01:55:00.460]   is knowing when not to construct an emotion, you know?
[01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:03.640]   Like right before the COVID pandemic
[01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:05.540]   was announced officially,
[01:55:05.540 --> 01:55:10.540]   I was in New Zealand giving talks.
[01:55:10.540 --> 01:55:16.380]   And my daughter, who was in college at that time,
[01:55:16.380 --> 01:55:21.580]   was flying literally like I think less than a week
[01:55:21.820 --> 01:55:23.820]   before the pandemic was announced.
[01:55:23.820 --> 01:55:26.520]   She got on a plane and she flew to New Zealand to meet me
[01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:27.480]   because it was spring break
[01:55:27.480 --> 01:55:30.620]   and I always would bring her with me on spring break.
[01:55:30.620 --> 01:55:34.180]   And in that, and I remember really vividly,
[01:55:34.180 --> 01:55:37.660]   I was in New Zealand, there was only one case,
[01:55:37.660 --> 01:55:41.200]   one case of COVID in New Zealand at that point.
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:44.660]   And I got on the phone to my husband and I said,
[01:55:44.660 --> 01:55:49.460]   I'm experiencing a very high level of arousal
[01:55:49.460 --> 01:55:52.160]   and it's very, very unpleasant.
[01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:57.500]   Now, my husband knows me very well.
[01:55:57.500 --> 01:56:00.720]   And he said, yeah, there's a lot of uncertainty.
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:02.460]   And I said, I know.
[01:56:02.460 --> 01:56:04.420]   Now, he didn't say to me, well, you're anxious
[01:56:04.420 --> 01:56:06.060]   and you just don't really know it.
[01:56:06.060 --> 01:56:07.380]   'Cause I wasn't anxious.
[01:56:07.380 --> 01:56:10.360]   I was feeling uncertain.
[01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:15.360]   And as you know, or maybe people know
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:17.000]   that when there's a lot of uncertainty,
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:18.580]   there's also a lot of arousal
[01:56:18.580 --> 01:56:22.060]   because the brain is attempting to learn
[01:56:22.060 --> 01:56:24.080]   and the neuromodulators that are important
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:26.420]   for learning new things happen
[01:56:26.420 --> 01:56:30.800]   to also cause a subjective sense of arousal.
[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:33.920]   And they actually also modulate your autonomic nervous system
[01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:35.360]   so your heart can beat faster and whatever.
[01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:38.840]   And our go-to explanation for what that is
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:42.160]   is to experience that arousal as anxiety.
[01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:43.960]   But I was uncertain.
[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:46.440]   And remember that how your brain,
[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:47.860]   the story it's telling itself,
[01:56:47.860 --> 01:56:50.960]   the category it's making is a plan for action.
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:53.980]   Well, what do you do in anxiety and fear?
[01:56:53.980 --> 01:56:55.820]   You freeze or you run away.
[01:56:55.820 --> 01:56:57.940]   What do you do in uncertainty?
[01:56:57.940 --> 01:57:00.620]   You forage for information.
[01:57:00.620 --> 01:57:04.460]   You tolerate the discomfort and you forage for information,
[01:57:04.460 --> 01:57:07.020]   which is what I was doing when I called and said,
[01:57:07.020 --> 01:57:07.860]   what should we do?
[01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:09.060]   Should I meet her at the airport
[01:57:09.060 --> 01:57:10.020]   and turn around and come back?
[01:57:10.020 --> 01:57:11.100]   Or should we have a vacation?
[01:57:11.100 --> 01:57:12.400]   Like, I don't really know.
[01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:15.180]   And you know, what I ended up doing
[01:57:15.180 --> 01:57:18.400]   was foraging for information for another couple of days
[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:22.160]   and then made a split second decision in the air
[01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:24.140]   when we were flying from one island to the other
[01:57:24.140 --> 01:57:26.320]   and just rerouted us and we went home.
[01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:30.060]   And then the borders closed like two days later, you know?
[01:57:30.060 --> 01:57:34.640]   But my point is that this is not just, you know,
[01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:40.300]   psychological mumbo jumbo.
[01:57:40.300 --> 01:57:43.180]   You can train yourself to experience
[01:57:44.460 --> 01:57:49.460]   your heart pounding in your chest as determination.
[01:57:49.460 --> 01:57:52.620]   When my daughter, this is all in how emotions are made,
[01:57:52.620 --> 01:57:54.460]   these examples, but they're true.
[01:57:54.460 --> 01:57:58.340]   I mean, my daughter, this book I wrote a couple of years ago,
[01:57:58.340 --> 01:57:59.620]   when my daughter was 12 years old,
[01:57:59.620 --> 01:58:01.940]   she was testing for a black belt in karate.
[01:58:01.940 --> 01:58:04.700]   She was five feet tall, not even.
[01:58:04.700 --> 01:58:07.860]   And she was testing against these like massively large
[01:58:07.860 --> 01:58:11.840]   adolescent boys, okay, who were like a foot taller than her.
[01:58:12.860 --> 01:58:17.420]   And her sensei, who was a 10th degree black belt,
[01:58:17.420 --> 01:58:20.380]   didn't say to her, "Don't be afraid."
[01:58:20.380 --> 01:58:23.720]   He said, "Get your butterflies flying in formation."
[01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:26.900]   And I was like, in rapture, I was like,
[01:58:26.900 --> 01:58:29.260]   "Oh my God, this guy is totally brilliant."
[01:58:29.260 --> 01:58:34.260]   That is the best, you know, meaning to give to arousal
[01:58:34.260 --> 01:58:40.020]   that changes the meaning of it.
[01:58:40.940 --> 01:58:43.280]   What you do when you create an emotion
[01:58:43.280 --> 01:58:48.280]   is you're giving meaning to those affective feelings.
[01:58:48.280 --> 01:58:53.460]   And you have more control than you might think
[01:58:53.460 --> 01:58:54.980]   in how you do that.
[01:58:54.980 --> 01:58:57.560]   You can do it by changing the physical state
[01:58:57.560 --> 01:58:59.320]   that gives rise to those feelings,
[01:58:59.320 --> 01:59:02.280]   but you can also change it by learning more,
[01:59:02.280 --> 01:59:03.540]   how to make more categories
[01:59:03.540 --> 01:59:06.260]   and how to make them more fluidly
[01:59:06.260 --> 01:59:08.960]   so that you do something different.
[01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:13.340]   And it's not that things will necessarily feel
[01:59:13.340 --> 01:59:18.100]   any more unpleasant or any less or any more pleasant.
[01:59:18.100 --> 01:59:23.100]   It's that the feeling becomes a source of wisdom.
[01:59:23.100 --> 01:59:26.840]   It's a cue to do something different.
[01:59:26.840 --> 01:59:30.940]   - There's a case where I absolutely believe
[01:59:30.940 --> 01:59:35.940]   that knowledge about how emotions and affect
[01:59:37.380 --> 01:59:39.360]   and states of the brain and body work,
[01:59:39.360 --> 01:59:41.040]   which is what you're beautifully describing
[01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:46.040]   for people today, is extremely useful in and of itself.
[01:59:46.040 --> 01:59:50.820]   And I think, frankly, it's a refreshing
[01:59:50.820 --> 01:59:53.740]   and welcome departure from a lot of the conversations
[01:59:53.740 --> 01:59:55.260]   that we normally have on this podcast,
[01:59:55.260 --> 01:59:57.660]   where, you know, we talk a lot about protocols,
[01:59:57.660 --> 01:59:59.940]   we talk about tools, things that people can do,
[01:59:59.940 --> 02:00:01.980]   ways they can implement the knowledge.
[02:00:01.980 --> 02:00:05.480]   And here, this is certainly one of those cases as well,
[02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:10.480]   but it's a beautiful one and a very important one
[02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:14.800]   where the knowledge itself,
[02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:18.360]   just the knowledge of additional words for different states.
[02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:21.520]   I love the example of putting butterflies into formation
[02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:25.060]   because inherent to that is that you're not trying
[02:00:25.060 --> 02:00:28.260]   to get rid of the butterflies, quite the opposite.
[02:00:28.260 --> 02:00:30.100]   You're deploying them in certain ways.
[02:00:30.100 --> 02:00:32.520]   And there's an action step and a psychological step there,
[02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:35.980]   of course that's required, but that it isn't, you know,
[02:00:35.980 --> 02:00:37.880]   view morning sunlight for an average of 10 minutes
[02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:39.000]   to set your circadian rhythm,
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.300]   which is something that I say over and over again,
[02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:42.540]   I'll go into the grave saying that,
[02:00:42.540 --> 02:00:43.860]   they'll probably put a window over my grave
[02:00:43.860 --> 02:00:45.620]   so sunlight can get in at this point,
[02:00:45.620 --> 02:00:47.060]   but which would be fine with me.
[02:00:47.060 --> 02:00:51.340]   But in any case, knowledge is power,
[02:00:51.340 --> 02:00:54.300]   is something that we hear, but it's not always true.
[02:00:54.300 --> 02:00:56.260]   Often it's knowledge is power,
[02:00:56.260 --> 02:00:59.200]   but you need to do X, Y, and Z in a certain order.
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:00.800]   But here, what you've provided
[02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:04.120]   and you're continuing to provide is knowledge
[02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:09.120]   that people can use that real estate within their brain.
[02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:11.740]   I'm deliberately not giving it a name
[02:01:11.740 --> 02:01:13.660]   because it's distributed real estate
[02:01:13.660 --> 02:01:16.900]   that allows them to take an unpleasant feeling
[02:01:16.900 --> 02:01:20.700]   and work with it, that it has more dimensionality
[02:01:20.700 --> 02:01:22.360]   than we probably realize.
[02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:25.940]   That's becoming clear to me that rarely,
[02:01:25.940 --> 02:01:28.340]   if ever is there less dimensionality.
[02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:31.100]   You can always give it more dimensionality
[02:01:31.100 --> 02:01:32.740]   by just shifting your attention.
[02:01:32.740 --> 02:01:34.580]   And you can practice this really.
[02:01:34.580 --> 02:01:37.580]   There's a story that I tell about when I,
[02:01:37.580 --> 02:01:40.740]   the brief moment when I tried to learn how to paint.
[02:01:40.740 --> 02:01:43.860]   And so there's an object like a cup
[02:01:43.860 --> 02:01:45.540]   and you have this three-dimensional object
[02:01:45.540 --> 02:01:48.300]   and you want to render it on a two-dimensional canvas.
[02:01:48.300 --> 02:01:51.140]   So you could just try to draw the cup
[02:01:51.140 --> 02:01:55.760]   and then what you get is a pretty shitty looking cup.
[02:01:57.580 --> 02:02:00.940]   But what a realist painter will teach you to do
[02:02:00.940 --> 02:02:03.580]   is to take the cup and to break it apart
[02:02:03.580 --> 02:02:05.760]   into pieces of light.
[02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:08.520]   And then what you try to paint are the pieces of light.
[02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:10.520]   So you're transferring, your first what you're doing
[02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:15.460]   is you're taking this very low dimensional course object
[02:02:15.460 --> 02:02:17.080]   called a cup and you're breaking it
[02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:19.260]   into tiny little pieces of light.
[02:02:19.260 --> 02:02:20.460]   - Which is what the visual system does.
[02:02:20.460 --> 02:02:21.820]   - Which is what the visual system does.
[02:02:21.820 --> 02:02:22.700]   And so what you're doing
[02:02:22.700 --> 02:02:25.220]   is you're categorizing it differently
[02:02:25.220 --> 02:02:27.940]   in order to emphasize the features
[02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:29.700]   that are more high dimensional,
[02:02:29.700 --> 02:02:31.380]   that are in there, right?
[02:02:31.380 --> 02:02:33.780]   They're in there, in the brain.
[02:02:33.780 --> 02:02:36.140]   But you can, but what you're doing essentially
[02:02:36.140 --> 02:02:38.380]   is you're having the brain,
[02:02:38.380 --> 02:02:40.260]   your brain is applying attention
[02:02:40.260 --> 02:02:43.940]   to basically focus more on those details.
[02:02:43.940 --> 02:02:46.540]   And then you transfer the details
[02:02:46.540 --> 02:02:49.400]   on to the two-dimensional canvas.
[02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:53.180]   And what you get is a pretty decent looking
[02:02:53.180 --> 02:02:57.380]   three-dimensional cup on a two-dimensional canvas,
[02:02:57.380 --> 02:03:00.180]   unless you're me and then it still looks shitty.
[02:03:00.180 --> 02:03:05.400]   And so maybe I'll take it up again sometime in the future.
[02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:06.820]   But my point is that you can do that
[02:03:06.820 --> 02:03:09.640]   with your own sensory condition of your body.
[02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:13.240]   In emotion, you can deliberately focus on
[02:03:13.240 --> 02:03:16.560]   what your heart is doing to the best of your ability
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:17.660]   that you can sense it, right?
[02:03:17.660 --> 02:03:19.760]   Or you can deliberately focus on your breathing
[02:03:19.760 --> 02:03:21.780]   or you could deliberately focus on what your muscles
[02:03:21.780 --> 02:03:23.940]   or how tense they feel.
[02:03:23.940 --> 02:03:27.800]   You can change the dimensionality of your experience
[02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:29.800]   by the shifting of your attention.
[02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:31.620]   - Love it.
[02:03:31.620 --> 02:03:33.980]   And forgive me for giving another example,
[02:03:33.980 --> 02:03:35.820]   but I think it's one that will resonate with both of us
[02:03:35.820 --> 02:03:37.340]   and hopefully with our listeners as well,
[02:03:37.340 --> 02:03:41.220]   which is the great Oliver Sacks, neurologist and author,
[02:03:41.220 --> 02:03:45.480]   talked about and wrote about,
[02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:46.940]   he'd worked with these patients
[02:03:46.940 --> 02:03:51.460]   that either had locked-in syndrome or severe autism
[02:03:51.460 --> 02:03:53.900]   or severe Tourette's or Parkinson's.
[02:03:53.900 --> 02:03:55.980]   And, you know, most people would,
[02:03:55.980 --> 02:03:59.180]   even clinicians who specialize in those areas
[02:03:59.180 --> 02:04:00.020]   would look at those people
[02:04:00.020 --> 02:04:02.580]   and say that they're living in a diminished world.
[02:04:02.580 --> 02:04:05.820]   It's, they lack capacities that other people have
[02:04:05.820 --> 02:04:10.460]   and it's all about the absence of certain abilities.
[02:04:10.460 --> 02:04:14.100]   And then what he did eventually was incredible.
[02:04:14.100 --> 02:04:15.480]   He loved animals.
[02:04:15.480 --> 02:04:18.540]   So he would spend time thinking about
[02:04:18.540 --> 02:04:21.780]   what it would be like, for instance, to be a bat,
[02:04:21.780 --> 02:04:24.980]   hanging in the corner of a room and experience the room,
[02:04:24.980 --> 02:04:28.260]   not through vision, but mainly through echolocation.
[02:04:28.260 --> 02:04:31.220]   And he would spend a lot of time thinking about that.
[02:04:31.220 --> 02:04:33.260]   He also did a lot of drugs at one point in his career
[02:04:33.260 --> 02:04:36.020]   and then stopped because they were very destructive drugs,
[02:04:36.020 --> 02:04:38.580]   not just psychedelics, but also methamphetamines.
[02:04:38.580 --> 02:04:39.420]   So yes, he has that.
[02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:41.600]   But he eventually changed his practice
[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:45.280]   to trying to experience human emotion,
[02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:48.720]   but first think about animal sensory experience.
[02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:50.840]   And he would do that for lots of different types of animals,
[02:04:50.840 --> 02:04:53.040]   octopuses and bats and all these different things.
[02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:56.040]   And then it allowed him, in his words,
[02:04:56.040 --> 02:04:59.420]   it allowed him to then interact with patients
[02:04:59.420 --> 02:05:01.460]   in a way where he could feel,
[02:05:01.460 --> 02:05:03.400]   maybe even empathize a little bit
[02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:05.080]   with how they experienced life.
[02:05:05.080 --> 02:05:07.640]   And then he would write books about it in a way,
[02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:09.240]   and here I'm borrowing someone else's words,
[02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:14.240]   that storied these people into almost greater,
[02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:16.480]   larger than life characters.
[02:05:16.480 --> 02:05:18.440]   And now, of course, he wasn't trying to detract
[02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:19.700]   from their suffering,
[02:05:19.700 --> 02:05:21.600]   but he was trying to give people an understanding
[02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:23.680]   of what that suffering was like
[02:05:23.680 --> 02:05:26.160]   through their actual experience.
[02:05:26.160 --> 02:05:29.140]   And he did, in my opinion and the opinion of many other
[02:05:29.140 --> 02:05:32.120]   people, a masterful job in doing that.
[02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:33.600]   But it came through much in the same way
[02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:35.000]   that your art teacher said,
[02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:38.480]   pay attention to the way the changes in light
[02:05:38.480 --> 02:05:40.640]   across the object as opposed to trying
[02:05:40.640 --> 02:05:43.080]   to draw the object themselves.
[02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:46.280]   So the takeaway here that I think we're arriving at
[02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:48.320]   is that, that you've provided,
[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:53.320]   is that if we add dimensionality to our description of
[02:05:53.320 --> 02:05:57.500]   or experience of the sensory inputs,
[02:05:57.500 --> 02:06:00.540]   and there's a ton of it to reach to,
[02:06:00.540 --> 02:06:03.760]   and we maybe even come up with some new internal labels
[02:06:03.760 --> 02:06:05.880]   or language-based labels,
[02:06:05.880 --> 02:06:08.960]   that we can experience the world in much richer
[02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:10.560]   and much more adaptive ways.
[02:06:10.560 --> 02:06:11.560]   - Absolutely.
[02:06:11.560 --> 02:06:14.040]   And I love your stories,
[02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:16.880]   and I love this story in particular about Oliver Sacks,
[02:06:16.880 --> 02:06:19.960]   because it resonates with my experience
[02:06:19.960 --> 02:06:23.000]   when I was reading Ed Yong's new book.
[02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:26.760]   - Oh, at first he wrote, "We Contain Multitudes,"
[02:06:26.760 --> 02:06:28.420]   which I think won a Pulitzer.
[02:06:28.420 --> 02:06:31.200]   And then what is the recent one?
[02:06:31.200 --> 02:06:32.040]   - Right, with the animals.
[02:06:32.040 --> 02:06:32.860]   - "An Immense World."
[02:06:32.860 --> 02:06:33.700]   - "An Immense World."
[02:06:33.700 --> 02:06:35.120]   And what I was thinking was,
[02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:40.880]   first of all, it's a masterful, masterful, masterful book.
[02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:42.360]   I wish I had written that book.
[02:06:42.360 --> 02:06:43.600]   I wrote him a fan letter.
[02:06:43.600 --> 02:06:45.200]   I was like, "This is such an amazing book."
[02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:46.720]   - It's an amazing book.
[02:06:46.720 --> 02:06:50.600]   - But because he helps you experience,
[02:06:50.600 --> 02:06:54.780]   so what I wanna say is this,
[02:06:54.780 --> 02:06:56.560]   that there are all these animals
[02:06:56.560 --> 02:06:58.940]   that have different sensory surfaces than we do,
[02:06:58.940 --> 02:07:01.120]   and they can detect signals in the world
[02:07:01.120 --> 02:07:03.480]   that are not relevant to us
[02:07:03.480 --> 02:07:06.780]   because we don't have sensory surfaces for them.
[02:07:06.780 --> 02:07:09.680]   And it reminds you, first of all,
[02:07:09.680 --> 02:07:13.000]   that what you experience as reality
[02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.720]   is really not in the world alone,
[02:07:15.720 --> 02:07:17.700]   and it's not in your head alone.
[02:07:17.700 --> 02:07:20.380]   It is in the transaction between the two.
[02:07:20.380 --> 02:07:24.240]   The neurons in your brain and in your nervous system
[02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:26.160]   are also part of the reality.
[02:07:26.160 --> 02:07:29.040]   And so reality is the transaction.
[02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:31.720]   Reality are the features that are the transaction
[02:07:31.720 --> 02:07:35.640]   between signals in the world and signals in your brain.
[02:07:35.640 --> 02:07:40.640]   And the parts of the world that some other animals experience
[02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:42.960]   that we will never experience,
[02:07:42.960 --> 02:07:44.480]   they're not really part of our reality
[02:07:44.480 --> 02:07:48.860]   because they don't interact with anything that we have.
[02:07:48.860 --> 02:07:51.360]   But for those animals, it's part of their niche.
[02:07:51.360 --> 02:07:53.420]   It's part of their, you know, niche is just the word
[02:07:53.420 --> 02:07:56.440]   for the parts of the world that matter to you, basically.
[02:07:56.440 --> 02:07:59.080]   And I was thinking that if people read this book,
[02:07:59.080 --> 02:08:03.740]   and maybe it will help them have empathy
[02:08:03.740 --> 02:08:07.160]   for other people who don't have minds like theirs
[02:08:07.160 --> 02:08:11.060]   and who don't experience the world in the way that they do.
[02:08:11.060 --> 02:08:14.240]   Your description of what Oliver Sacks,
[02:08:14.240 --> 02:08:19.240]   what his actions were and his goals,
[02:08:19.240 --> 02:08:21.760]   it did occur to me that this book by Ed Yong
[02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:26.600]   would be a great tool for helping people to understand
[02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:29.560]   that the way that they experience the world,
[02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:30.520]   it might be different
[02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:32.560]   than how other people experience the world.
[02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:35.140]   And even a little bit of a window on that,
[02:08:35.140 --> 02:08:36.640]   it would be a good thing.
[02:08:36.640 --> 02:08:39.300]   - So I'd like to ask you more about this word affect.
[02:08:39.300 --> 02:08:44.680]   And then I'd like to discuss how things that we do
[02:08:44.680 --> 02:08:48.480]   or don't do might be useful for putting us
[02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:51.120]   in broad categories of affect
[02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:56.120]   so that we might experience particular arrays of emotions.
[02:08:56.120 --> 02:09:00.080]   So this is my attempt to understand affect
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:03.440]   in an effort to think about some actionable items.
[02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:05.080]   - Absolutely.
[02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:07.980]   - I love the word affect the way you described it
[02:09:07.980 --> 02:09:12.300]   as setting up a potential or a series of potentialities
[02:09:12.300 --> 02:09:15.040]   for different emotions to occur.
[02:09:15.040 --> 02:09:19.560]   I make it a point to get sunlight in my eyes in the morning
[02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:21.200]   to try and wake up my brain and body
[02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:22.600]   because indeed it does that.
[02:09:22.600 --> 02:09:26.460]   Broadly speaking, I make an effort to get good sleep at night
[02:09:26.460 --> 02:09:28.880]   because that makes everything better.
[02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:29.700]   - Absolutely.
[02:09:29.700 --> 02:09:33.240]   - When I'm not sleeping well or enough,
[02:09:33.240 --> 02:09:35.280]   it makes everything worse.
[02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:38.780]   This is non-clinical, non-nuanced language.
[02:09:38.780 --> 02:09:42.460]   But I think most people when they hear affect
[02:09:42.460 --> 02:09:46.140]   and they think about the examples I just gave,
[02:09:46.140 --> 02:09:48.840]   kind of understand like, yeah, like when a kid is tired
[02:09:48.840 --> 02:09:51.080]   or at least I'm a kid, they get cranky.
[02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:53.060]   When we're sleep deprived, we get cranky.
[02:09:53.060 --> 02:09:55.160]   Indeed, there are times when I'm sleep deprived
[02:09:55.160 --> 02:09:58.040]   and little things great on me.
[02:09:58.040 --> 02:10:01.140]   They're like a splinter just feels super annoying
[02:10:01.140 --> 02:10:03.260]   and maybe even painful.
[02:10:03.260 --> 02:10:05.880]   But when I'm well rested, things are going better.
[02:10:05.880 --> 02:10:07.680]   It's not that bad.
[02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:09.800]   So tell us more about affect
[02:10:09.800 --> 02:10:13.040]   because I think it's a really important anchor point
[02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:15.540]   for us to understand emotions in ourselves
[02:10:15.540 --> 02:10:16.520]   and other people.
[02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:20.600]   - Neuroscientists think about
[02:10:20.600 --> 02:10:25.980]   the sensory systems for touch and proprioception,
[02:10:25.980 --> 02:10:28.340]   which we call somatic sensation,
[02:10:28.340 --> 02:10:32.380]   as being in the service of motor movement,
[02:10:32.380 --> 02:10:33.780]   skeletal motor movements.
[02:10:33.780 --> 02:10:38.140]   Really, our sense of touch and even vision actually
[02:10:38.140 --> 02:10:39.820]   also works this way.
[02:10:39.820 --> 02:10:42.080]   And actually, audition does too.
[02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:46.560]   These senses actually serve the brain's ability
[02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:50.120]   to control the movements of the body.
[02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:51.780]   And the same thing is true
[02:10:53.740 --> 02:10:58.640]   for regulating the systems of the body.
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:01.880]   So brains, one of their fundamental jobs
[02:11:01.880 --> 02:11:06.880]   are to coordinate and regulate the systems inside your body,
[02:11:06.880 --> 02:11:12.120]   your heart, your lungs, your gut, all the moving parts.
[02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:16.400]   And the information, the sensory signals
[02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:20.880]   that those organs and tissues and so on
[02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:24.060]   send back to the brain, as I said before,
[02:11:24.060 --> 02:11:30.380]   those sensory signals are important
[02:11:30.380 --> 02:11:33.300]   to the brain's ability to regulate the body,
[02:11:33.300 --> 02:11:35.860]   but we don't feel them directly.
[02:11:35.860 --> 02:11:39.480]   We usually experience them as affective feelings,
[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:43.040]   these very simple physical sorts of feelings.
[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:45.160]   And then we elaborate them in various ways.
[02:11:45.160 --> 02:11:48.020]   When they get very intense, those are the moments
[02:11:48.020 --> 02:11:51.400]   when the brain creates emotion out of them.
[02:11:51.400 --> 02:11:57.500]   So the brain's regulation of the body,
[02:11:57.500 --> 02:12:00.380]   the predictive regulation of the body,
[02:12:00.380 --> 02:12:02.620]   the technical term is allostasis.
[02:12:02.620 --> 02:12:04.920]   But when I'm explaining this to the public,
[02:12:04.920 --> 02:12:06.500]   I use a metaphor.
[02:12:06.500 --> 02:12:09.100]   And all metaphors are wrong,
[02:12:09.100 --> 02:12:14.100]   but some metaphors are less wrong and useful.
[02:12:14.100 --> 02:12:15.960]   So the metaphor that I use is,
[02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:19.900]   your brain is running a budget for your body.
[02:12:19.900 --> 02:12:21.860]   And it's not budgeting money,
[02:12:21.860 --> 02:12:24.700]   it's budgeting glucose and salt and oxygen and water
[02:12:24.700 --> 02:12:28.240]   and all the nutrients that you need to stay alive and well.
[02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:32.120]   And so you can think about withdrawals from that budget,
[02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:36.540]   like burning glucose or using up oxygen.
[02:12:36.540 --> 02:12:42.980]   You can think about deposits, like sleeping and eating.
[02:12:42.980 --> 02:12:46.220]   You can think about savings.
[02:12:47.180 --> 02:12:49.560]   So when you're with a friend who you trust
[02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:51.540]   and everything you do actually
[02:12:51.540 --> 02:12:54.420]   is just slightly less metabolically expensive, right?
[02:12:54.420 --> 02:12:57.100]   And you can also think about taxes.
[02:12:57.100 --> 02:12:59.880]   Like if you are stressed, socially stressed,
[02:12:59.880 --> 02:13:02.480]   within two hours of eating a meal,
[02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:06.120]   that same meal will cost you
[02:13:06.120 --> 02:13:12.520]   the equivalent of 104 more calories in the inefficiency
[02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:15.440]   that you will metabolize it because of that stress.
[02:13:16.340 --> 02:13:18.180]   Meaning you'll burn more energy.
[02:13:18.180 --> 02:13:23.180]   - You'll be more inefficient in metabolizing the food.
[02:13:23.180 --> 02:13:28.700]   So it's as if you had eaten 104 more calories.
[02:13:28.700 --> 02:13:30.040]   - Oh, so I had it exactly backwards.
[02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:33.740]   - And so over the course of a year, that's 11 pounds.
[02:13:33.740 --> 02:13:36.460]   - So when we say that people are taxing on us.
[02:13:36.460 --> 02:13:38.060]   - Yeah, like it's literally true.
[02:13:38.060 --> 02:13:40.300]   - Their language works, their language works.
[02:13:40.300 --> 02:13:41.940]   - So the way I describe it is that
[02:13:41.940 --> 02:13:46.700]   you can think about affect as a quick and dirty summary
[02:13:46.700 --> 02:13:48.540]   of the state of your body budget.
[02:13:48.540 --> 02:13:54.700]   If things are going reasonably well,
[02:13:54.700 --> 02:13:57.740]   then you'll feel okay.
[02:13:57.740 --> 02:13:59.140]   You might even feel pleasant.
[02:13:59.140 --> 02:14:04.820]   If you're running a deficit in your body budget,
[02:14:04.820 --> 02:14:08.900]   then you're gonna feel fatigued or distressed.
[02:14:08.900 --> 02:14:11.520]   And that doesn't mean something is necessarily wrong.
[02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:13.240]   Like for example, when you exercise,
[02:14:13.240 --> 02:14:14.320]   you get to a certain point
[02:14:14.320 --> 02:14:16.620]   where you've reached your ventilatory load.
[02:14:16.620 --> 02:14:19.880]   Usually it's like 20 minutes in or 10 minutes in
[02:14:19.880 --> 02:14:22.280]   or whatever, depending on how hard you're working.
[02:14:22.280 --> 02:14:25.060]   And you start to feel unpleasant and fatigued.
[02:14:25.060 --> 02:14:26.620]   But that doesn't mean that something's wrong.
[02:14:26.620 --> 02:14:28.480]   That just means that you're working really hard
[02:14:28.480 --> 02:14:29.560]   and you have to push through it.
[02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:33.340]   And then when you drink water and you eat afterwards
[02:14:33.340 --> 02:14:34.980]   and replenish, and then you're fine, right?
[02:14:34.980 --> 02:14:35.960]   In fact, you're better.
[02:14:35.960 --> 02:14:40.560]   It's a way of building a better, stronger future you.
[02:14:41.560 --> 02:14:45.780]   So affect is basically when things,
[02:14:45.780 --> 02:14:46.940]   when you're feeling really worked up,
[02:14:46.940 --> 02:14:49.720]   it probably means that something's uncertain somewhere.
[02:14:49.720 --> 02:14:53.500]   So I just think about these as like quick and dirty ways
[02:14:53.500 --> 02:14:58.500]   of thinking about what your affect means.
[02:14:58.500 --> 02:15:03.360]   And then oftentimes, as we've said before,
[02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:05.720]   emotion regulation that is controlling emotion
[02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:07.620]   really actually is not so much about
[02:15:07.620 --> 02:15:09.220]   changing the meaning of affect.
[02:15:09.220 --> 02:15:10.800]   It's changing the affect.
[02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:17.540]   And so it's useful to understand that affect is tied
[02:15:17.540 --> 02:15:21.380]   to the state of your body.
[02:15:21.380 --> 02:15:24.220]   Or actually what it's tied to is your brain's beliefs
[02:15:24.220 --> 02:15:25.920]   about the state of your body.
[02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:28.460]   Your brain is modeling the state of the body.
[02:15:28.460 --> 02:15:31.820]   And that's interoception, that's the technical word.
[02:15:31.820 --> 02:15:35.580]   Interoception is not your awareness of your body.
[02:15:35.580 --> 02:15:37.200]   It's your brain's modeling of your body,
[02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:38.580]   what your brain believes to be true
[02:15:38.580 --> 02:15:40.880]   about the metabolic state of your body.
[02:15:40.880 --> 02:15:43.900]   And that's how I think about affect.
[02:15:43.900 --> 02:15:45.740]   That's how I think about my own affect.
[02:15:45.740 --> 02:15:50.540]   And my daughter actually who was depressed for,
[02:15:50.540 --> 02:15:54.020]   so I should say depression is like a bankrupt body budget.
[02:15:54.020 --> 02:15:56.060]   Like you just can't move.
[02:15:56.060 --> 02:15:59.500]   You feel fatigued, so fatigued that you can't move
[02:15:59.500 --> 02:16:01.700]   and you're very distressed.
[02:16:01.700 --> 02:16:02.900]   It's like bankruptcy.
[02:16:02.900 --> 02:16:06.020]   And actually, if you, I mean,
[02:16:06.020 --> 02:16:09.020]   depression is a metabolic illness.
[02:16:09.020 --> 02:16:11.380]   And if you look at the symptoms of depression,
[02:16:11.380 --> 02:16:14.240]   they really are about metabolic,
[02:16:14.240 --> 02:16:20.020]   having metabolic deficits, basically.
[02:16:20.020 --> 02:16:22.320]   - And it's interesting that one of the hallmark features
[02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:24.140]   of depression, subjectively speaking,
[02:16:24.140 --> 02:16:27.440]   is lack of positive anticipation about the future,
[02:16:27.440 --> 02:16:30.540]   which makes perfect sense from the perspective
[02:16:30.540 --> 02:16:32.620]   of a depleted brain body budget.
[02:16:32.620 --> 02:16:33.660]   - Yes, exactly.
[02:16:33.660 --> 02:16:36.220]   And you're basically, think about the fact
[02:16:36.220 --> 02:16:38.660]   that prediction error, right?
[02:16:38.660 --> 02:16:40.100]   So if you're feeling unpleasant,
[02:16:40.100 --> 02:16:42.300]   you're not gonna be anticipating pleasant things.
[02:16:42.300 --> 02:16:44.500]   And even if those things that are in the world
[02:16:44.500 --> 02:16:47.140]   could give you pleasure, you won't notice them
[02:16:47.140 --> 02:16:49.500]   because learning from prediction error,
[02:16:49.500 --> 02:16:51.820]   things that you didn't predict, is expensive.
[02:16:51.820 --> 02:16:53.860]   And if you don't have the resources,
[02:16:53.860 --> 02:16:54.700]   you're not gonna, right?
[02:16:54.700 --> 02:16:58.500]   So it's, but anyways, my daughter came up with this
[02:16:58.500 --> 02:17:02.020]   after we had this very interesting thing
[02:17:02.020 --> 02:17:04.180]   that happened to us on another trip.
[02:17:04.180 --> 02:17:07.140]   We were in Sweden because I was giving a keynote
[02:17:07.140 --> 02:17:09.460]   at the Karolinska Institute and we went,
[02:17:09.460 --> 02:17:12.340]   I took her to Sweden and this is when she was recovering
[02:17:12.340 --> 02:17:14.700]   from depression and like, you know,
[02:17:14.700 --> 02:17:19.340]   she is just one of the millions of young adults who,
[02:17:19.340 --> 02:17:21.500]   you know, adolescents and young adults
[02:17:21.500 --> 02:17:23.900]   who were experiencing depression.
[02:17:23.900 --> 02:17:28.900]   And we got to Sweden and she was very, very jet lagged.
[02:17:31.780 --> 02:17:34.380]   We both were, it was like one of these, like, you know,
[02:17:34.380 --> 02:17:38.300]   we had to like, you know, planes, trains and automobiles,
[02:17:38.300 --> 02:17:40.420]   like it was just, you know, getting there.
[02:17:40.420 --> 02:17:44.580]   And she woke up the next morning and she looked horrible.
[02:17:44.580 --> 02:17:45.420]   She felt horrible.
[02:17:45.420 --> 02:17:47.660]   It actually seemed to me like she was about to enter
[02:17:47.660 --> 02:17:49.060]   another depressive episode.
[02:17:49.060 --> 02:17:53.900]   And I said to her, I basically got her out of bed.
[02:17:53.900 --> 02:17:55.300]   I fed her a meal.
[02:17:55.300 --> 02:17:58.900]   I gave her four ibuprofen and I put her back to sleep.
[02:17:58.900 --> 02:18:01.380]   And she got up five hours later and she was absolutely fine.
[02:18:01.380 --> 02:18:03.140]   Her mood was fine.
[02:18:03.140 --> 02:18:05.980]   Now I'm not telling you that ibuprofen is the,
[02:18:05.980 --> 02:18:08.740]   an antidepressant that you should take if you're depressed.
[02:18:08.740 --> 02:18:10.460]   But what I'm telling you is that, you know,
[02:18:10.460 --> 02:18:12.340]   you said something, Andrew, that was so interesting.
[02:18:12.340 --> 02:18:14.820]   In the beginning, you said, am I fatigued?
[02:18:14.820 --> 02:18:16.660]   Does my body, do I have pain somewhere?
[02:18:16.660 --> 02:18:17.700]   Is my body hurt?
[02:18:17.700 --> 02:18:19.420]   You know, these are, well, right.
[02:18:19.420 --> 02:18:23.860]   When basically what she was having was she was fatigued
[02:18:23.860 --> 02:18:25.860]   and she was having what I would call,
[02:18:25.860 --> 02:18:30.500]   it's called, the technical word is visceral nociception,
[02:18:30.500 --> 02:18:34.020]   which means her stomach hurt, you know, everything hurt.
[02:18:34.020 --> 02:18:36.020]   And sure, you know, her muscles probably hurt too,
[02:18:36.020 --> 02:18:37.620]   but it was really her innards.
[02:18:37.620 --> 02:18:39.820]   Really, she just was distressed.
[02:18:39.820 --> 02:18:44.220]   And the ibuprofen helped her get back to sleep
[02:18:44.220 --> 02:18:45.460]   and then she slept and she got up
[02:18:45.460 --> 02:18:46.860]   and she was completely fine.
[02:18:46.860 --> 02:18:49.180]   And then we walked around Stockholm for the rest of the day
[02:18:49.180 --> 02:18:50.620]   talking about this experience,
[02:18:50.620 --> 02:18:53.220]   which for her was like flipping on a light switch.
[02:18:53.220 --> 02:18:54.700]   You know, "How Emotions Are Made,"
[02:18:54.700 --> 02:18:58.540]   this book that I referred to, I wrote that book for her.
[02:18:58.540 --> 02:19:00.460]   I wrote that book for her, but also for me,
[02:19:00.460 --> 02:19:03.700]   because it was a way of putting down on paper
[02:19:03.700 --> 02:19:06.420]   all the things that I wanted her to know.
[02:19:06.420 --> 02:19:08.060]   And then I thought other people
[02:19:08.060 --> 02:19:09.780]   should know about their kids, you know,
[02:19:09.780 --> 02:19:12.300]   and maybe even their kids could read it.
[02:19:12.300 --> 02:19:14.980]   But what she did with that was she came up
[02:19:14.980 --> 02:19:19.100]   with a new concept called the emotional flu.
[02:19:19.100 --> 02:19:23.300]   And the emotional flu is when you're having
[02:19:23.300 --> 02:19:27.060]   a bad body budgeting day and you're just like,
[02:19:27.060 --> 02:19:28.580]   you didn't get enough sleep maybe,
[02:19:28.580 --> 02:19:33.060]   or there's some stress at work or at school
[02:19:33.060 --> 02:19:35.020]   that you can't get rid of otherwise.
[02:19:35.020 --> 02:19:36.100]   My husband likes to say,
[02:19:36.100 --> 02:19:40.020]   "Well, other people's opinions of you
[02:19:40.020 --> 02:19:42.820]   are just electrical activity in somebody's head,"
[02:19:42.820 --> 02:19:43.900]   which I love.
[02:19:43.900 --> 02:19:45.620]   Like that's just another way of categorizing it.
[02:19:45.620 --> 02:19:48.380]   It's sort of like taking apart the cup
[02:19:48.380 --> 02:19:49.900]   into pieces of light, right?
[02:19:49.900 --> 02:19:52.500]   And so whatever, there are just these moments
[02:19:52.500 --> 02:19:55.660]   where you feel depleted and you could use that.
[02:19:55.660 --> 02:19:59.500]   I mean, we usually, we often use affect
[02:19:59.500 --> 02:20:03.180]   as a indicator of how the world is.
[02:20:03.180 --> 02:20:04.180]   You know, if I feel bad,
[02:20:04.180 --> 02:20:06.700]   something must be wrong in the world,
[02:20:06.700 --> 02:20:09.220]   but you have to resist that sometimes
[02:20:09.220 --> 02:20:11.260]   because sometimes there's nothing wrong in the world.
[02:20:11.260 --> 02:20:12.660]   It's just that you didn't get enough sleep
[02:20:12.660 --> 02:20:16.300]   or you need to have a little bit more protein,
[02:20:16.300 --> 02:20:18.060]   or maybe you haven't gone for a walk
[02:20:18.060 --> 02:20:19.420]   and you're stiff or whatever.
[02:20:19.420 --> 02:20:20.820]   You need to do some stretching.
[02:20:20.820 --> 02:20:22.020]   - Are those, sorry to interrupt,
[02:20:22.020 --> 02:20:23.660]   but I think people are going to want to anchor
[02:20:23.660 --> 02:20:27.660]   to a few of these positive steps that they can take
[02:20:27.660 --> 02:20:29.620]   to, I don't want to say replenish,
[02:20:29.620 --> 02:20:32.980]   but to shift affect in positive directions,
[02:20:32.980 --> 02:20:36.100]   sleep, movement, nutrition.
[02:20:36.100 --> 02:20:37.740]   And I've heard you say before
[02:20:37.740 --> 02:20:41.260]   that we are essentially amino acid foraging machines.
[02:20:41.260 --> 02:20:42.660]   So I noticed you said protein.
[02:20:42.660 --> 02:20:44.540]   You didn't say you need a bagel.
[02:20:44.540 --> 02:20:46.740]   You said protein.
[02:20:46.740 --> 02:20:48.020]   We could go down that rabbit hole.
[02:20:48.020 --> 02:20:49.900]   Maybe we do, maybe we don't.
[02:20:49.900 --> 02:20:53.140]   But I want to use this also just as a quick opportunity
[02:20:53.140 --> 02:20:55.460]   to say, as you're saying all this,
[02:20:55.460 --> 02:20:59.460]   one can immediately understand why alcohol
[02:20:59.460 --> 02:21:03.020]   and drugs of abuse are both so compelling, right?
[02:21:03.020 --> 02:21:04.420]   You're not feeling well.
[02:21:04.420 --> 02:21:06.340]   So you're feeling tired.
[02:21:06.340 --> 02:21:08.740]   Take a stimulant that releases dopamine and epinephrine,
[02:21:08.740 --> 02:21:12.660]   but you're taxing your already taxed body budget
[02:21:12.660 --> 02:21:16.000]   in a way that then puts you in a more depleted state later.
[02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.340]   Or alcohol, like you feel lousy.
[02:21:18.340 --> 02:21:19.540]   Alcohol never did this for me,
[02:21:19.540 --> 02:21:21.900]   but friends I have who are recovered alcoholics
[02:21:21.900 --> 02:21:23.820]   will tell me that it was like a magic elixir.
[02:21:23.820 --> 02:21:25.900]   It made them feel right.
[02:21:25.900 --> 02:21:27.140]   That's their language.
[02:21:27.140 --> 02:21:29.020]   But then of course there's a price to pay later
[02:21:29.020 --> 02:21:30.460]   because then it drops your baseline
[02:21:30.460 --> 02:21:31.540]   below where it was initially.
[02:21:31.540 --> 02:21:34.700]   - Absolutely, 110%.
[02:21:34.700 --> 02:21:39.600]   But I just also want to say that so is serotonin.
[02:21:39.600 --> 02:21:42.900]   Like so are SSRIs maybe.
[02:21:42.900 --> 02:21:47.000]   And when I say maybe, what I mean by that is
[02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.300]   if you really have a metabolic problem,
[02:21:49.300 --> 02:21:51.320]   like say something's wrong with your mitochondria
[02:21:51.320 --> 02:21:53.220]   or you're recovering from an illness
[02:21:53.220 --> 02:21:56.340]   and you know, or there's just some metabolic problem
[02:21:56.340 --> 02:21:59.940]   in your body, that metabolic problem is real.
[02:21:59.940 --> 02:22:04.660]   If you start to feel unpleasant, you will,
[02:22:04.660 --> 02:22:06.580]   I mean, feel unpleasant, it will feel,
[02:22:06.580 --> 02:22:08.300]   your mood will be negative.
[02:22:08.300 --> 02:22:11.180]   If you start taking serotonin,
[02:22:11.180 --> 02:22:15.320]   if you start taking SSRIs which will leave more serotonin
[02:22:15.320 --> 02:22:20.320]   in the synapses of your neurons before it's taken up again,
[02:22:21.080 --> 02:22:23.340]   that will juice the system.
[02:22:23.340 --> 02:22:26.300]   You will be able to spend, you'll be able to move,
[02:22:26.300 --> 02:22:30.500]   you'll feel like you have more energy for a while.
[02:22:30.500 --> 02:22:34.020]   But your nervous system is a complex system
[02:22:34.020 --> 02:22:36.380]   and so it's gonna make adjustments elsewhere
[02:22:36.380 --> 02:22:40.100]   to try to deal with that budgeting problem.
[02:22:40.100 --> 02:22:44.300]   So exactly what happens when you take drugs of abuse
[02:22:44.300 --> 02:22:46.500]   and what happens on the short term
[02:22:46.500 --> 02:22:48.940]   can happen for some people with SSRIs
[02:22:48.940 --> 02:22:51.800]   on the longer term where at first it starts to work
[02:22:51.800 --> 02:22:55.120]   and then it stops working and you start to gain weight
[02:22:55.120 --> 02:22:58.200]   and you know, because your metabolism is slowing
[02:22:58.200 --> 02:22:59.600]   because your brain is attempting to deal
[02:22:59.600 --> 02:23:02.200]   with that budgeting problem.
[02:23:02.200 --> 02:23:05.640]   So it really matters what the, you know, what the source is.
[02:23:05.640 --> 02:23:07.400]   It could be that your brain believes
[02:23:07.400 --> 02:23:10.160]   you have a budgeting problem, but there really isn't one.
[02:23:10.160 --> 02:23:12.280]   It could be that there really is one.
[02:23:12.280 --> 02:23:15.000]   These things matter to how you treat it.
[02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:19.220]   - One thing to just mention about SSRIs
[02:23:19.220 --> 02:23:21.800]   and I unfortunately, for reasons of confidentiality,
[02:23:21.800 --> 02:23:23.440]   I can't cite the source on this,
[02:23:23.440 --> 02:23:25.840]   but let me just say that somebody who's highly informed
[02:23:25.840 --> 02:23:29.320]   in the landscape of pharmaceutical treatments
[02:23:29.320 --> 02:23:33.500]   for psychiatric challenges has told me
[02:23:33.500 --> 02:23:36.420]   that there's an emerging theory among psychiatrists,
[02:23:36.420 --> 02:23:38.100]   it's kind of a collective emerging theory
[02:23:38.100 --> 02:23:42.220]   that one of the reasons why nowadays you hear
[02:23:42.220 --> 02:23:44.660]   about so-called treatment resistant depression,
[02:23:44.660 --> 02:23:47.860]   but you did not hear about so-called treatment
[02:23:47.860 --> 02:23:51.520]   resistant depression prior to the advent of SSRIs
[02:23:51.520 --> 02:23:53.600]   is that there's a growing body of thought
[02:23:53.600 --> 02:23:57.120]   in the psychiatric community that SSRIs may over time,
[02:23:57.120 --> 02:24:00.660]   as you're pointing out, deplete the very neural systems
[02:24:00.660 --> 02:24:02.600]   that subserve enhanced mood.
[02:24:02.600 --> 02:24:04.980]   So it's different than a drug of abuse
[02:24:04.980 --> 02:24:06.360]   that gives you a very acute effect
[02:24:06.360 --> 02:24:09.320]   like methamphetamine or cocaine or alcohol,
[02:24:09.320 --> 02:24:12.800]   but that over time you may actually be pulling
[02:24:12.800 --> 02:24:15.720]   the very neural circuits and neurochemicals
[02:24:15.720 --> 02:24:18.160]   that would allow for positive affect
[02:24:18.160 --> 02:24:21.940]   deeper and deeper into the trenches, so to speak.
[02:24:21.940 --> 02:24:23.700]   And so there's a growing number of people
[02:24:23.700 --> 02:24:26.460]   who simply don't respond to the drugs any longer
[02:24:26.460 --> 02:24:27.380]   or other treatments.
[02:24:27.380 --> 02:24:29.760]   - Right, so I wasn't trying to say the mechanism is the same,
[02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:31.960]   I was basically saying the theme is the same.
[02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:33.180]   - And I'm agreeing with you.
[02:24:33.180 --> 02:24:35.600]   - What happens over the short term with drugs of abuse
[02:24:35.600 --> 02:24:38.020]   happens over the longer term with, for some people,
[02:24:38.020 --> 02:24:40.880]   with SSRIs because it hasn't been recognized yet
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:45.880]   that at the basis, depression is a metabolic problem.
[02:24:45.880 --> 02:24:49.840]   And when you have a metabolic problem like diabetes
[02:24:49.840 --> 02:24:53.860]   or obesity or heart disease,
[02:24:53.860 --> 02:24:56.240]   it's not that that causes depression,
[02:24:56.240 --> 02:24:59.080]   it's that there's a common problem,
[02:24:59.080 --> 02:25:02.360]   which is that somewhere in this very complex system
[02:25:02.360 --> 02:25:05.600]   of your metabolism, there's a drag
[02:25:05.600 --> 02:25:08.320]   and it produces negative mood.
[02:25:08.320 --> 02:25:10.160]   And that's how you experience it.
[02:25:10.160 --> 02:25:12.080]   Sometimes it's good not to turn,
[02:25:12.080 --> 02:25:16.680]   it's productive not to turn that negative affect
[02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:18.720]   into an emotion.
[02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:22.040]   Sometimes, you know, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
[02:25:22.040 --> 02:25:25.440]   Sometimes you just need to deal with the affective problem
[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:28.200]   by dealing with your physical state.
[02:25:28.200 --> 02:25:29.960]   And that's the tricky bit,
[02:25:29.960 --> 02:25:32.880]   is knowing when is affect telling you
[02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:34.440]   something is wrong with the world?
[02:25:34.440 --> 02:25:36.680]   And when is it telling you that there's something wrong
[02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:39.040]   with your physical state that you need to attend to?
[02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:41.240]   - I think everything to me at least
[02:25:41.240 --> 02:25:45.440]   starts with a good night's sleep on a consistent basis.
[02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:50.440]   And every psychiatric challenge and indeed suicide itself
[02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:53.600]   seems to be associated with and often preceded
[02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:58.460]   by challenges in sleeping, changes in circadian rhythm.
[02:25:58.460 --> 02:26:00.440]   So I think that's why to me,
[02:26:00.440 --> 02:26:02.680]   sleep is the foundation of mental health and physical health.
[02:26:02.680 --> 02:26:03.640]   - Yep, absolutely.
[02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:05.240]   And so when I tell people, when they say,
[02:26:05.240 --> 02:26:06.080]   "Well, what can I do?"
[02:26:06.080 --> 02:26:09.360]   It's like, well, if there's only one thing that you could pick
[02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:12.460]   I would say get a good night's sleep on a regular basis.
[02:26:12.460 --> 02:26:14.940]   If you could pick two more, I would say eat healthfully,
[02:26:14.940 --> 02:26:17.020]   like stop eating pseudo food.
[02:26:17.020 --> 02:26:18.880]   Don't get me wrong, like I love French fries.
[02:26:18.880 --> 02:26:19.880]   I love French fries.
[02:26:19.880 --> 02:26:21.840]   They're like, that's like God's most perfect food.
[02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:22.920]   I mean, really.
[02:26:22.920 --> 02:26:27.920]   But eat healthfully, like eat real food and get exercise.
[02:26:27.920 --> 02:26:30.920]   And if you do those three things,
[02:26:30.920 --> 02:26:32.840]   I know I sound like a mother
[02:26:32.840 --> 02:26:35.480]   and so feel free to roll your eyes at me,
[02:26:35.480 --> 02:26:38.720]   but as a neuroscientist, those are the actually,
[02:26:38.720 --> 02:26:40.640]   before you start with all the, you know,
[02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:43.720]   mentalizing Jedi tricks, you could just start with this
[02:26:43.720 --> 02:26:45.960]   and that would actually take you pretty far.
[02:26:45.960 --> 02:26:50.580]   - And that will resonate very well with our audience.
[02:26:50.580 --> 02:26:55.080]   The basics of sleep, exercise, food, sunlight
[02:26:55.080 --> 02:26:57.560]   and social connection are the ones that we just anchor.
[02:26:57.560 --> 02:27:01.120]   Those five are the ones that we just keep returning to
[02:27:01.120 --> 02:27:02.120]   over and over again.
[02:27:02.120 --> 02:27:05.520]   And I think people will say, oh, it's just simple motherly
[02:27:05.520 --> 02:27:08.960]   advice, but I think that those five things,
[02:27:08.960 --> 02:27:11.160]   even just the one thing around sleep,
[02:27:11.160 --> 02:27:13.560]   there's some work that's required to get that done.
[02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:16.320]   So it's not as simple, the categories are simple,
[02:27:16.320 --> 02:27:20.320]   but the work that's required to get great sleep
[02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:22.660]   as often as one can on a consistent basis,
[02:27:22.660 --> 02:27:26.220]   if you're raising kids, have a career, live in the world,
[02:27:26.220 --> 02:27:27.160]   there's a lot there.
[02:27:27.160 --> 02:27:29.840]   And so that's where I think there's an elaboration
[02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:32.480]   of things and one needs to learn to be flexible,
[02:27:32.480 --> 02:27:34.160]   like when you're traveling, how do you do that?
[02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:37.000]   When, you know, friends are visiting, how do you do that?
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.560]   When weather's off and so on.
[02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:41.240]   The relationship piece is something-
[02:27:41.240 --> 02:27:43.640]   - I was just going to say, I'm so glad you mentioned that.
[02:27:43.640 --> 02:27:44.480]   I'm so glad you mentioned that.
[02:27:44.480 --> 02:27:45.800]   - Because you've said before,
[02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:47.660]   and this was another one of those moments,
[02:27:47.660 --> 02:27:50.300]   I listened to you, I've listened to as many of your podcasts
[02:27:50.300 --> 02:27:52.660]   as I possibly can, but I think it was the first
[02:27:52.660 --> 02:27:55.640]   or the second one with Lex Friedman, where you said,
[02:27:55.640 --> 02:27:59.040]   you know, we are regulating each other's nervous systems.
[02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:00.760]   And I will never forget that.
[02:28:00.760 --> 02:28:04.820]   And, you know, I imagine that you married your husband
[02:28:04.820 --> 02:28:06.000]   for a number of different reasons,
[02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:11.000]   but when people pair up with romantic partners,
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.360]   with friends, with coworkers,
[02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:17.520]   the ideal situation is one in which we are not taxed,
[02:28:17.520 --> 02:28:21.920]   where maybe even people, and just being around them
[02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:24.640]   or just knowing that they are in our lives
[02:28:24.640 --> 02:28:26.920]   provides a sort of deposit to-
[02:28:26.920 --> 02:28:27.880]   - Yeah, it's a savings.
[02:28:27.880 --> 02:28:28.880]   It provides a savings. - It's a savings.
[02:28:28.880 --> 02:28:29.720]   - For sure.
[02:28:29.720 --> 02:28:32.200]   - And then I think that's a lot of what emotional resonance,
[02:28:32.200 --> 02:28:35.920]   to put kind of pop language on it, is all about.
[02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:36.980]   Who feels good to be around,
[02:28:36.980 --> 02:28:37.820]   who doesn't feel good to be around.
[02:28:37.820 --> 02:28:40.340]   - Yeah, I would say the best thing
[02:28:40.340 --> 02:28:44.640]   for a human nervous system is another human.
[02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:47.380]   And the worst thing for a human nervous system
[02:28:47.380 --> 02:28:49.320]   is also another human.
[02:28:49.320 --> 02:28:51.840]   And so you really want to be around the people
[02:28:51.840 --> 02:28:55.640]   who make you the best version of yourself that you could be.
[02:28:55.640 --> 02:28:58.740]   And that doesn't mean that you always get a savings.
[02:28:58.740 --> 02:29:02.480]   Like sometimes you're taking care of that person.
[02:29:02.480 --> 02:29:07.160]   And so you're absorbing some of their burden, right?
[02:29:07.160 --> 02:29:08.940]   And vice versa.
[02:29:08.940 --> 02:29:13.940]   But I would say the research on social isolation
[02:29:13.940 --> 02:29:17.560]   and loneliness and so on shows us that,
[02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:19.400]   well, along with research on synchrony,
[02:29:19.400 --> 02:29:22.120]   and there's just a whole bunch of research to suggest
[02:29:22.120 --> 02:29:26.040]   that we are the caretakers of each other's nervous systems.
[02:29:26.040 --> 02:29:28.320]   And it doesn't matter what your opinion is.
[02:29:28.320 --> 02:29:29.620]   Like it doesn't, you know, it just,
[02:29:29.620 --> 02:29:32.280]   but we just, that's how we evolved as a species.
[02:29:32.280 --> 02:29:33.980]   And so you get to decide
[02:29:33.980 --> 02:29:37.320]   what kind of a person are you going to be?
[02:29:37.320 --> 02:29:42.260]   You know, are you going to be a savings
[02:29:42.260 --> 02:29:43.620]   or are you going to be a tax?
[02:29:43.620 --> 02:29:45.480]   - And in general, it seems that people who decide
[02:29:45.480 --> 02:29:49.280]   that they're going to be a savings tend to,
[02:29:49.280 --> 02:29:52.540]   because people gravitate towards that and want more of that.
[02:29:52.540 --> 02:29:54.640]   And hopefully would provide that also.
[02:29:54.640 --> 02:29:56.400]   I mean, I think the reciprocity piece here
[02:29:56.400 --> 02:29:58.280]   feels really, really strong.
[02:29:58.280 --> 02:30:00.520]   - Well, that's a really interesting thing
[02:30:00.520 --> 02:30:02.280]   about the synchrony work, right?
[02:30:02.280 --> 02:30:04.360]   So there's work that if you research,
[02:30:04.360 --> 02:30:05.360]   that if you put people together
[02:30:05.360 --> 02:30:06.360]   who don't even know each other,
[02:30:06.360 --> 02:30:09.440]   but if they like each other and they have a sense of trust,
[02:30:09.440 --> 02:30:10.760]   even after a couple of minutes,
[02:30:10.760 --> 02:30:12.820]   they start to synchronize their physical signals.
[02:30:12.820 --> 02:30:15.280]   Their heart rate starts to synchronize,
[02:30:15.280 --> 02:30:16.840]   their movements start to synchronize,
[02:30:16.840 --> 02:30:18.160]   their heart rate probably synchronizes
[02:30:18.160 --> 02:30:21.000]   'cause their breathing starts to synchronize, right?
[02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.620]   And it's really interesting to see what you typically see
[02:30:23.620 --> 02:30:26.320]   is that who is pacing and who is leading.
[02:30:26.320 --> 02:30:27.820]   Like one person is the leader
[02:30:27.820 --> 02:30:29.960]   and then the other person is the pacer.
[02:30:29.960 --> 02:30:33.160]   And I got that language from when I learned hypnosis,
[02:30:33.160 --> 02:30:34.000]   by the way.
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:37.620]   But it switches back and forth, like who's the leader.
[02:30:37.620 --> 02:30:40.480]   Like in a good, what we say good,
[02:30:40.480 --> 02:30:43.720]   like in an interaction that looks productive,
[02:30:43.720 --> 02:30:47.040]   it's switching all the time who is pacing
[02:30:47.040 --> 02:30:48.200]   and who is leading.
[02:30:48.200 --> 02:30:53.200]   It's not that always one person is in charge,
[02:30:53.200 --> 02:30:55.360]   so to speak, physiologically speaking.
[02:30:55.360 --> 02:30:57.840]   We did a series recently on mental health with Paul Conte,
[02:30:57.840 --> 02:31:01.320]   who's a psychiatrist and the word narcissism
[02:31:01.320 --> 02:31:02.280]   came up a few times
[02:31:02.280 --> 02:31:04.240]   because people have a lot of questions about that.
[02:31:04.240 --> 02:31:07.920]   And he emphasized that narcissists are not confident.
[02:31:07.920 --> 02:31:11.120]   They operate from a place of a deficit of pleasure.
[02:31:11.120 --> 02:31:13.280]   It's never enough and an intense envy,
[02:31:13.280 --> 02:31:14.640]   although that's not how they present
[02:31:14.640 --> 02:31:19.080]   and they're often usually not aware of it themselves,
[02:31:19.080 --> 02:31:21.540]   but it's what leads healthy people to feel
[02:31:21.540 --> 02:31:23.460]   as if the interactions with those people,
[02:31:23.460 --> 02:31:26.880]   narcissists often can be very compelling in the moment,
[02:31:26.880 --> 02:31:28.680]   but they feel very taxed afterwards
[02:31:28.680 --> 02:31:31.040]   and kind of confused by what happened.
[02:31:31.040 --> 02:31:34.980]   And it sounds like it ties back to this lack of synchrony.
[02:31:34.980 --> 02:31:37.600]   On the positive side of things,
[02:31:37.600 --> 02:31:41.160]   it's also clear from what you just said
[02:31:41.160 --> 02:31:45.420]   that when people regulate each other's nervous systems
[02:31:45.420 --> 02:31:47.680]   in a way where people are making little deposits
[02:31:47.680 --> 02:31:49.560]   and providing savings for each other,
[02:31:49.560 --> 02:31:51.440]   or maybe things are just neutral,
[02:31:51.440 --> 02:31:54.660]   that those nervous systems are then in a position
[02:31:54.660 --> 02:31:56.780]   to pay attention to other things too
[02:31:56.780 --> 02:31:59.340]   and not just try and work out the dynamics.
[02:31:59.340 --> 02:32:00.260]   - Oh, for sure.
[02:32:00.260 --> 02:32:02.040]   Oh, and that's very true at work.
[02:32:02.040 --> 02:32:04.140]   So there's research showing that,
[02:32:04.140 --> 02:32:07.080]   especially in the creativity sector,
[02:32:07.080 --> 02:32:09.580]   innovation sector of the economy,
[02:32:09.580 --> 02:32:12.860]   the best predictor of performance on the job
[02:32:12.860 --> 02:32:15.240]   is the extent to which people feel,
[02:32:15.240 --> 02:32:16.900]   I mean, after you account for sleep
[02:32:16.900 --> 02:32:19.860]   and watering and sleeping and feeding, right?
[02:32:19.860 --> 02:32:23.760]   Like the best predictor is the amount of trust
[02:32:23.760 --> 02:32:28.100]   that you have in your team and in your managers.
[02:32:28.100 --> 02:32:29.760]   Because if the world is predictable,
[02:32:29.760 --> 02:32:31.560]   it could still be, things could be hard.
[02:32:31.560 --> 02:32:33.360]   But even when things are unpredictable,
[02:32:33.360 --> 02:32:35.620]   you have people who have your back.
[02:32:35.620 --> 02:32:39.260]   And so basically what you're doing is you're,
[02:32:39.260 --> 02:32:44.300]   they're making deposits or savings,
[02:32:44.300 --> 02:32:46.460]   they're causing savings in each other's body budgets
[02:32:46.460 --> 02:32:49.780]   so their resources can be spent on the harder things,
[02:32:49.780 --> 02:32:54.140]   which is failing and having to pick yourself back up
[02:32:54.140 --> 02:32:56.460]   and try again, which is partly what you do
[02:32:56.460 --> 02:32:58.020]   when you're an innovator.
[02:32:58.020 --> 02:33:01.020]   So I think that there's also research to show
[02:33:01.020 --> 02:33:02.920]   that in your personal life,
[02:33:02.920 --> 02:33:06.580]   when you do random acts of kindness for people
[02:33:06.580 --> 02:33:08.820]   or when you're kind, in general,
[02:33:08.820 --> 02:33:13.380]   you derive also a body budgeting benefit from that.
[02:33:13.380 --> 02:33:17.020]   So for a while, I had a friend
[02:33:17.020 --> 02:33:21.020]   who we would meet each other for lunch once a month
[02:33:21.020 --> 02:33:23.660]   and we would take turns paying.
[02:33:23.660 --> 02:33:26.320]   I mean, we could both pay for ourselves,
[02:33:26.320 --> 02:33:28.820]   but we kind of got a double hit.
[02:33:28.820 --> 02:33:30.140]   He paid for me one month
[02:33:30.140 --> 02:33:32.340]   and then I would pay for him one month.
[02:33:32.340 --> 02:33:37.340]   So we get the double hit of being kind to someone else
[02:33:37.340 --> 02:33:43.180]   and also they got the benefit of someone being kind to them.
[02:33:44.140 --> 02:33:47.380]   And I'll just say, I think kindness is a,
[02:33:47.380 --> 02:33:50.380]   I don't know that we have so many conversations
[02:33:50.380 --> 02:33:51.980]   about that in our culture right now,
[02:33:51.980 --> 02:33:56.340]   but I think kindness is very, very underrated
[02:33:56.340 --> 02:34:00.380]   and should be, you know, like when I feel like shit,
[02:34:00.380 --> 02:34:05.380]   I bake bread for my neighbor who's in his 70s,
[02:34:05.380 --> 02:34:07.260]   him and his wife.
[02:34:07.260 --> 02:34:10.920]   That's what I do when I'm not feeling good.
[02:34:10.920 --> 02:34:14.460]   And you know, I mean, after I've taken care of the physical,
[02:34:14.460 --> 02:34:17.080]   the possible physical causes.
[02:34:17.080 --> 02:34:19.660]   And then I feel great because he's always so,
[02:34:19.660 --> 02:34:23.600]   he's always so grateful
[02:34:23.600 --> 02:34:26.400]   and then I felt like I made his day better.
[02:34:26.400 --> 02:34:28.160]   And then also he helps me in other ways,
[02:34:28.160 --> 02:34:29.880]   like with my garden and stuff,
[02:34:29.880 --> 02:34:31.460]   'cause he's just like a master gardener.
[02:34:31.460 --> 02:34:34.040]   And so I feel like we have this relationship
[02:34:34.040 --> 02:34:36.060]   where we help each other.
[02:34:36.060 --> 02:34:38.720]   And I know it sounds really sappy,
[02:34:38.720 --> 02:34:43.720]   but, and even though all the research backs up
[02:34:43.720 --> 02:34:47.580]   what I'm saying, it doesn't quite describe the feeling
[02:34:47.580 --> 02:34:50.360]   of when someone is just really happy
[02:34:50.360 --> 02:34:52.460]   because you just gave them a little surprise
[02:34:52.460 --> 02:34:54.260]   and they're, you know, like that's,
[02:34:54.260 --> 02:34:56.340]   there's just some juice in that, I think.
[02:34:56.340 --> 02:34:59.360]   - On some culture out there, there's a word for that.
[02:34:59.360 --> 02:35:00.540]   - I'm sure there is. - And someone will tell us.
[02:35:00.540 --> 02:35:02.340]   - I'm sure there is, I'm sure there is.
[02:35:02.340 --> 02:35:04.940]   - Well, I have to say,
[02:35:06.360 --> 02:35:09.380]   I've thoroughly enjoyed this conversation.
[02:35:09.380 --> 02:35:10.220]   - Oh, me too.
[02:35:10.220 --> 02:35:12.600]   - I've been looking forward to it for a long time.
[02:35:12.600 --> 02:35:16.960]   And you've provided us with a really broad arc,
[02:35:16.960 --> 02:35:21.040]   but also a deep dive into not just how emotions are made,
[02:35:21.040 --> 02:35:24.960]   not just about affect, but as you mentioned earlier,
[02:35:24.960 --> 02:35:26.980]   you know, really how the nervous system works.
[02:35:26.980 --> 02:35:31.980]   And I am certain in fact that our audience is taking this in
[02:35:31.980 --> 02:35:35.160]   and realizing that that knowledge is incredibly powerful.
[02:35:35.160 --> 02:35:36.960]   The addition of nuance,
[02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:41.640]   both to language and to sort of self-reflection states
[02:35:41.640 --> 02:35:44.800]   as extremely valuable.
[02:35:44.800 --> 02:35:47.100]   Oftentimes when one gets into a conversation
[02:35:47.100 --> 02:35:49.240]   that has some level of reductionism
[02:35:49.240 --> 02:35:51.700]   and you get into nomenclature and things like that,
[02:35:51.700 --> 02:35:53.320]   it can really pull away
[02:35:53.320 --> 02:35:55.200]   from the real life experience of something.
[02:35:55.200 --> 02:35:56.700]   But this is exactly the opposite.
[02:35:56.700 --> 02:35:58.500]   What you've done for us today
[02:35:58.500 --> 02:36:01.480]   is you've provided such a rich array of information
[02:36:01.480 --> 02:36:05.680]   that adds richness and depth to the real life experience.
[02:36:05.680 --> 02:36:08.720]   And that is really invaluable.
[02:36:08.720 --> 02:36:12.440]   So on behalf of myself and all the listeners
[02:36:12.440 --> 02:36:14.080]   and the people watching this,
[02:36:14.080 --> 02:36:17.120]   I want to say thank you for today's discussion.
[02:36:17.120 --> 02:36:18.940]   Thank you for the books you've written,
[02:36:18.940 --> 02:36:22.040]   which we've provided links to in the show note captions.
[02:36:22.040 --> 02:36:24.160]   Thanks for showing up on social media
[02:36:24.160 --> 02:36:28.080]   despite the challenges that exist there.
[02:36:28.080 --> 02:36:30.980]   Sometimes you always handle yourself so well there
[02:36:30.980 --> 02:36:32.040]   and we will refer people
[02:36:32.040 --> 02:36:34.920]   to your excellent social media accounts as well.
[02:36:34.920 --> 02:36:36.400]   And just for all the work that you're doing
[02:36:36.400 --> 02:36:37.440]   and that your laboratory
[02:36:37.440 --> 02:36:39.640]   and you're now director of various things
[02:36:39.640 --> 02:36:41.740]   and relate to AI and more,
[02:36:41.740 --> 02:36:43.720]   and we'll talk about this hopefully in future episodes,
[02:36:43.720 --> 02:36:48.720]   but just a really enormous thank you.
[02:36:48.720 --> 02:36:49.600]   - Thank you.
[02:36:49.600 --> 02:36:52.460]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[02:36:52.460 --> 02:36:54.880]   about the psychology and neuroscience of emotions
[02:36:54.880 --> 02:36:57.000]   with Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett.

[02:37:23.860 --> 02:37:26.180]   please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[02:37:26.180 --> 02:37:28.000]   I do read all the comments.
[02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.680]   Not on today's episode, but on many previous episodes
[02:37:30.680 --> 02:37:33.460]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements.
[02:37:33.460 --> 02:37:35.640]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:37:35.640 --> 02:37:37.640]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:37:37.640 --> 02:37:39.040]   for things like improving sleep,
[02:37:39.040 --> 02:37:40.960]   for hormone support, and for focus.
[02:37:40.960 --> 02:37:42.180]   If you'd like to see the supplements
[02:37:42.180 --> 02:37:43.880]   discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:37:43.880 --> 02:37:46.520]   you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S,
[02:37:46.520 --> 02:37:49.400]   so livemomentus.com/huberman.
[02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:51.600]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:37:51.600 --> 02:37:53.640]   I am Huberman Lab on all platforms.
[02:37:53.640 --> 02:37:56.240]   So that's Instagram, Twitter, now called X,
[02:37:56.240 --> 02:37:58.280]   Facebook, LinkedIn, and Threads.
[02:37:58.280 --> 02:37:59.520]   And at all those places,
[02:37:59.520 --> 02:38:01.880]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:38:01.880 --> 02:38:03.400]   some of which overlap with the content
[02:38:03.400 --> 02:38:04.520]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:38:04.520 --> 02:38:06.480]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:38:06.480 --> 02:38:08.320]   covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:38:08.320 --> 02:38:11.800]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:38:11.800 --> 02:38:13.200]   And if you haven't already subscribed
[02:38:13.200 --> 02:38:15.880]   to our zero-cost neural network newsletter,
[02:38:15.880 --> 02:38:18.280]   the neural network newsletter is a monthly newsletter
[02:38:18.280 --> 02:38:19.800]   that includes podcast summaries
[02:38:19.800 --> 02:38:22.340]   as well as toolkits in the form of protocol.
[02:38:22.340 --> 02:38:24.720]   So these are short PDFs that list out
[02:38:24.720 --> 02:38:26.560]   the specific things that one could do
[02:38:26.560 --> 02:38:29.880]   in order to, for example, improve sleep, improve learning,
[02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:31.440]   regulate dopamine.
[02:38:31.440 --> 02:38:34.120]   We have toolkits and protocols that relate to fitness
[02:38:34.120 --> 02:38:36.440]   from our fitness episodes and much, much more.
[02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:39.360]   To sign up, simply go to HubermanLab.com,
[02:38:39.360 --> 02:38:42.040]   click on the newsletter tab at the top of the site,
[02:38:42.040 --> 02:38:45.040]   and then enter your email and click subscribe.
[02:38:45.040 --> 02:38:47.040]   I want to point out that we do not share your email
[02:38:47.040 --> 02:38:48.160]   with anybody, and again,
[02:38:48.160 --> 02:38:50.360]   the newsletter is completely zero cost.
[02:38:50.360 --> 02:38:52.880]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion
[02:38:52.880 --> 02:38:54.920]   with Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett.
[02:38:54.920 --> 02:38:57.080]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:38:57.080 --> 02:38:58.920]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:38:58.920 --> 02:39:01.500]   [upbeat music]
[02:39:01.500 --> 02:39:04.080]   (upbeat music)
