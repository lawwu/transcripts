[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - What is your intuition why an intelligence explosion
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   is not possible?
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.400]   Like taking the scientific,
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.500]   all the scientific revolutions,
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.360]   why can't we slightly accelerate that process?
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.480]   - So you can absolutely accelerate
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.420]   any problem-solving process.
[00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.000]   So recursive search improvement
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.920]   is absolutely a real thing.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.160]   But what happens with recursively self-improving system
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.980]   is typically not explosion
[00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.800]   because no system exists in isolation.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.920]   And so tweaking one part of the system
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.160]   means that suddenly another part of the system
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.480]   becomes a bottleneck.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.080]   And if you look at science, for instance,
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.100]   which is clearly recursively self-improving,
[00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.340]   clearly a problem-solving system,
[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.280]   scientific progress is not actually exploding.
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.800]   If you look at science,
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.760]   what you see is the picture of a system
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.080]   that is consuming an exponentially
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.800]   increasing amount of resources.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.240]   But it's having a linear output
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.280]   in terms of scientific progress.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.240]   And maybe that will seem like a very strong claim.
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.440]   Many people are actually saying that,
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.820]   scientific progress is exponential.
[00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.400]   But when they're claiming this,
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.680]   they're actually looking at indicators
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.600]   of resource consumptions,
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.360]   resource consumption by science.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.920]   For instance, the number of papers being published,
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.220]   the number of patents being filed and so on,
[00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.840]   which are just completely correlated
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.720]   with how many people are working on science today.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.920]   So it's actually an indicator of resource consumption.
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.440]   But what you should look at is the output,
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.320]   is progress in terms of the knowledge that science generates
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.920]   in terms of the scope and significance
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.800]   of the problems that we solve.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.000]   And some people have actually been trying to measure that.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.400]   Like Michael Nielsen, for instance.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.200]   He had a very nice paper,
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.000]   I think that was last year about it.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.600]   So his approach to measure scientific progress
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.600]   was to look at the timeline of scientific discoveries
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.400]   over the past, you know, 100, 150 years.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.640]   And for each major discovery,
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.640]   ask a panel of experts to rate
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.040]   the significance of the discovery.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.880]   And if the output of science as an institution
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.880]   were exponential, you would expect the temporal density
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.400]   of significance to go up exponentially,
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.240]   maybe because there's a faster rate of discoveries,
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.240]   maybe because the discoveries are, you know,
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.200]   increasingly more important.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.120]   And what actually happens if you plot
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.320]   this temporal density of significance
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.600]   measured in this way,
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.800]   is that you see very much a flat graph.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.880]   You see a flat graph across all disciplines,
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.000]   across physics, biology, medicine, and so on.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.560]   And it actually makes a lot of sense if you think about it,
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.280]   because think about the progress of physics
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.240]   110 years ago, right?
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.320]   It was a time of crazy change.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.240]   Think about the progress of technology,
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.640]   you know, 170 years ago,
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.640]   when we started having, you know,
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.840]   replacing horses with cars,
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.280]   when we started having electricity and so on.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.800]   It was a time of incredible change.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.920]   And today is also a time of very, very fast change,
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.360]   but it would be an unfair characterization
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.880]   to say that today technology and science
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.240]   are moving way faster than they did 50 years ago,
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.680]   100 years ago.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.520]   And if you do try to
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.440]   rigorously plot the temporal density of
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.360]   the significance, yeah, of significance,
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.680]   of significance, sorry,
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.040]   you do see very flat curves.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.880]   - That's fascinating.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.080]   - And you can check out the paper that Michael Nielsen
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.280]   had about this idea.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.280]   And so the way I interpret it is,
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.720]   as you make progress,
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.440]   you know, in a given field
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.360]   or in a given subfield of science,
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.920]   it becomes exponentially more difficult
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.680]   to make further progress.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.240]   Like the very first person to work on information theory,
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.720]   if you enter a new field,
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.160]   and it's still the very early years,
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.400]   there's a lot of low hanging fruit you can pick.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.240]   - That's right, yeah.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.200]   - But the next generation of researchers
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.560]   is gonna have to dig much harder actually
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.440]   to make smaller discoveries,
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.880]   a probably larger number of smaller discoveries.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.880]   And to achieve the same amount of impact,
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.760]   you're gonna need a much greater headcount.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.280]   And that's exactly the picture you're seeing with science,
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.000]   is that the number of scientists and engineers
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.800]   is in fact increasing exponentially.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.640]   The amount of computational resources
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.280]   that are available to science
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.120]   is increasing exponentially and so on.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.840]   So the resource consumption of science is exponential,
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.440]   but the output in terms of progress,
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.240]   in terms of significance is linear.
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.320]   And the reason why is because,
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.240]   and even though science is recursively self-improving,
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.680]   meaning that scientific progress
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.440]   turns into technological progress,
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.160]   which in turn helps science.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.520]   If you look at computers, for instance,
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.720]   our products of science and computers
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.760]   are tremendously useful in speeding up science.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.960]   The internet, same thing.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.920]   The internet is a technology that's made possible
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.680]   by very recent scientific advances.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.640]   And itself, because it enables scientists to network,
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.760]   to communicate, to exchange papers and ideas much faster,
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.680]   it is a way to speed up scientific progress.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.800]   So even though you're looking at
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.680]   a recursively self-improving system,
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.320]   it is consuming exponentially more resources
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.320]   to produce the same amounts of problem solving very much.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.360]   - So that's a fascinating way to paint it.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.720]   And certainly that holds for the deep learning community.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.560]   Right?
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.320]   If you look at the temporal, what did you call it?
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.480]   The temporal density of significant ideas.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.160]   If you look at in deep learning,
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.200]   I think, I'd have to think about that,
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.280]   but if you really look at significant ideas
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.640]   in deep learning, they might even be decreasing.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.640]   - So I do believe the per paper significance is decreasing,
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.600]   but the amount of papers is still today
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.680]   exponentially increasing.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.120]   So I think if you look at an aggregate,
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.760]   my guess is that you would see a linear progress.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.080]   If you were to sum the significance of all papers,
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.880]   you would see a roughly linear progress.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.880]   And in my opinion, it is not a coincidence
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.080]   that you're seeing linear progress in science,
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.960]   despite exponential resource consumption.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.560]   I think the resource consumption
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.560]   is dynamically adjusting itself to maintain linear progress
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.800]   because we as a community expect linear progress,
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.520]   meaning that if we start investing less
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.600]   and seeing less progress,
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.000]   it means that suddenly there are some lower hanging fruits
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.040]   that become available
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.720]   and someone's gonna step up and pick them.
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:14.560]   So it's very much like a market for discoveries and ideas.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.000]   - But there's another fundamental part
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.080]   which you're highlighting,
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.880]   which is the hypothesis that science
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.400]   or like the space of ideas,
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.440]   any one path you travel down,
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.360]   it gets exponentially more difficult
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.000]   to develop new ideas.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.880]   In your sense, is that's gonna hold
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.760]   across our mysterious universe?
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.560]   - Yes, well, exponential progress
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.720]   triggers exponential friction.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.680]   So that if you tweak one part of the system,
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.040]   suddenly some other part becomes a bottleneck.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:53.120]   For instance, let's say you develop some device
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.400]   that measures its own acceleration
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.920]   and then it has some engine
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.040]   and it outputs even more acceleration
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.600]   in proportion of its own acceleration
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.560]   and you drop it somewhere.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.440]   It's not gonna reach infinite speed
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.120]   because it exists in a certain context.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.240]   So the air around it is gonna generate friction
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.520]   and it's gonna block it at some top speed.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.680]   And even if you were to consider the broader context
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.040]   and lift the bottleneck there,
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.480]   like the bottleneck of friction,
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.360]   then some other part of the system
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.600]   would start stepping in
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.360]   and creating exponential friction,
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.160]   maybe the speed of flight or whatever.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.160]   And this definitely holds true
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.200]   when you look at the problem solving algorithm
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.400]   that is being run by science as an institution,
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.960]   science as a system.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.280]   As you make more and more progress,
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.080]   despite having this recursive self-improvement component,
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.640]   you are encountering exponential friction.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.800]   Like the more researchers you have
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.800]   working on different ideas,
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.200]   the more overhead you have
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.360]   in terms of communication across researchers.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.360]   If you look at, you were mentioning quantum mechanics,
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.200]   right?
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.120]   Well, if you want to start making significant discoveries
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.920]   today, significant progress in quantum mechanics,
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.280]   there is an amount of knowledge you have to ingest,
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.360]   which is huge.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.800]   So there's a very large overhead
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.480]   to even start to contribute.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.960]   There's a large amount of overhead
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.320]   to synchronize across researchers and so on.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.680]   And of course, the significant practical experiments
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.120]   are going to require exponentially expensive equipment
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:34.440]   because the easier ones have already been run, right?
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:39.760]   - So in your senses, there's no way escaping,
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.640]   there's no way of escaping this kind of friction
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.720]   with artificial intelligence systems.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.720]   - Yeah, no, I think science is a very good way
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.760]   to model what would happen with a superhuman
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.960]   or a recursive release of improving AI.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.000]   - That's your sense, I mean, the-
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.160]   - That's my intuition.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.880]   It's not like a mathematical proof of anything.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.920]   That's not my point.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.600]   Like I'm not trying to prove anything.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.040]   I'm just trying to make an argument
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.320]   to question the narrative of intelligence explosion,
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.000]   which is quite a dominant narrative.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.960]   And you do get a lot of pushback if you go against it.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.400]   Because, so for many people, right,
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.320]   AI is not just a subfield of computer science.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.120]   It's more like a belief system.
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.760]   Like this belief that the world is headed towards an event,
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.960]   the singularity, past which, you know,
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:36.240]   AI will become, will go exponential very much
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.720]   and the world will be transformed
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.080]   and humans will become obsolete.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.000]   And if you go against this narrative,
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   because it is not really a scientific argument,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.120]   but more of a belief system,
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.400]   it is part of the identity of many people.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.720]   If you go against this narrative,
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.520]   it's like you're attacking the identity
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.680]   of people who believe in it.
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.360]   It's almost like saying God doesn't exist or something.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.480]   - Right.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.160]   - So you do get a lot of pushback
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.920]   if you try to question these ideas.
