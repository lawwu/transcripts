[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:30.500]   and now you are earning a lot.
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:30.500]   You might be older.
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:30.500]   Older employees are generally much more expensive than younger employees.
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:30.500]   Now, if you're expensive, recognize that you've got a target on your back. And the question is, do you justify your salary? That's the next thing to pay attention to. Is there a clear connection for you between your cost and your salary?
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:30.500]   Is there a clear connection for you between your cost and your salary?
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:30.500]   Is there a clear connection for you between your cost and your salary?

[00:12:30.500 --> 00:13:00.520]  ,
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:00.520]   If you're working on commission, I like working in sales, sales people are usually going to be the last to be laid off because sales people are what's going to drive the revenue for the company. If you're laying off your sales people as a team, you are probably in pretty rough straits.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:00.520]   If you're laying off your sales people as a team, you are probably in pretty rough straits.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:00.520]   If you're laying off your sales people as a team, you are probably in pretty rough straits.

[00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:30.540]   The question is, can you demonstrate a connection between your cost and your salary?
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:30.540]   The question is, can you demonstrate a connection between your cost and your salary?
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:30.540]   The question is, can you demonstrate a connection between your cost and your salary?

[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:30.580]   And then they'll be able to do it as well as you can?
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:30.580]   Or are you very specialized?
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:30.580]   If you're a commodity, then one of the challenges, you can only really compete based on price.
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:30.580]   And sometimes, you can only really compete based on price.
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:30.580]   And sometimes, you can only really compete based on price.

[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:30.660]   You've got to be making your boss money.
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:30.660]   You've got to be making your boss money.
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:30.660]   Otherwise, you're done.
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:30.660]   Now, if you're not making your boss money,
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:30.660]   You might skate by for a little bit.
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:30.660]   But over time, the market will expose it.
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:30.660]   A competitor will come by who is making more money, is more profitable, and costs will be driven down.
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:30.660]   Then all of a sudden, your bosses are going through and trying to figure out where they can cut costs.
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:30.660]   So the key is to be thinking like an entrepreneur, thinking like a business owner, no matter the size of the organization or company that you're involved in.
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:30.660]   So the key is to be thinking like an entrepreneur, thinking like a business owner, no matter the size of the organization or company that you're involved in.
[00:16:30.700 --> 00:17:00.680]  ,
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:00.680]   I think there are three major aspects to this.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:00.680]   Number one, you have to look at the overall growth and success of your industry.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:00.680]   Number one, you have to look at the overall growth and success of your industry.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:00.680]   Number one, you have to look at the overall growth and success of your industry.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:00.680]   Number one, you have to look at the overall growth and success of your industry.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:00.680]   Number one, you have to look at the overall growth and success of your industry.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:00.680]   Number one, you have to look at the overall growth and success of your industry.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:00.680]   And then you have to look at the overall growth and success of your industry.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:00.680]   And then you have to look at the overall growth and success of your industry.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:00.680]   And then you have to look at the overall growth and success of your industry. And then you have to look at the overall growth and success of your industry.
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:06.460]   Number two, you need to look at the overall growth and success of your company within your industry.
[00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:13.980]   And then number three, you need to look at the overall position, growth and success of you within your company.
[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.880]   And all of these are important.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:21.460]   If your industry is doing well, then there's going to be less pressure on your job.
[00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:24.440]   A rising tide raises all boats.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:30.700]   So if money is flowing within an industry and profits are high, there's usually going to be less of a focus in most companies.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:30.700]   It's going to be less of a focus in most companies.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:30.700]   It's going to be less of a focus in most companies.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:30.700]   It's going to be less of a focus in most companies.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:30.700]   It's going to be less of a focus in most companies.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:30.700]   It's going to be less of a focus in most companies.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:30.700]   It's going to be less of a focus in most companies.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:18:00.720]  , but it's when the focus on cutting costs grows that the spotlight comes to bear on the employee roster to try to figure out where can we trim costs.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:00.720]   If the industry is struggling but the company is doing well, then there's going to be less pressure.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:00.720]   So company matters as well. But when the pressure comes to bear, you need to be well established within your company. And so always practicing the principle of beginning with the end in mind, figuring out what the
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:00.720]   company is doing and what the company is doing.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:00.720]   So if the industry is struggling but the principle of beginning with the end in mind, figuring out what the company is doing, then you're going to be well established within your company.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:00.720]   I think that's going to be well established within your company.
[00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:30.740]   The ultimate effect is that we want and then going back and looking at the cause.
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:30.740]   Here's how we reverse engineer this process.
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:30.740]   We know what the goal is.
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:30.740]   We know what the goal is.
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:30.740]   And so now we know to figure out what's the path to the goal.
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:30.740]   And in the context of this show, the goal is I don't want to get fired.
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:30.740]   I don't want to get laid off in the next recession.
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:30.740]   So in order not to be fired or laid off in the next recession, then you need to be a valuable employee contributing more to the company than you cost.
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:30.740]   So in order not to be fired or laid off in the next recession, then you need to be a valuable employee contributing more to the company than you cost.
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:30.740]   So in order not to be fired or laid off in the next recession, then you need to be a valuable employee contributing more to the company than you cost.
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:30.740]   I think that's a good employee.

Because the key is to be in that top tier, that top 20% if we're going to use a Pareto distribution as a good measuring stick. You want to be positioned well within a company. Now, in order for your company not to have mass layoffs in the next recession, which could affect you and your coworkers, then your company needs to, at a minimum, be profitable and functioning. And if at all possible, your company needs to be leading the industry.

[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:53.160]   So you don't have to feel bad about competing with them because it's not a zero-sum game.

[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:25.740]   Well, let's start with a simple one, the thing that you can control.
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:25.740]   Consider focusing on simply outworking everybody.
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:25.740]   If you can outwork your fellow employees, that will help you to stand out.
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:25.740]   Now, the good news is this isn't actually that tough.
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:25.740]   Now, the good news is this isn't actually that tough.
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:25.740]   Depending on what statistics you use,
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:25.740]   Now, the good news is this isn't actually that tough.
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:25.740]   Now, the good news is this isn't actually that tough.
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:25.740]   Now, the good news is this isn't actually that tough.

[00:30:55.960 --> 00:31:25.940]  ,
[00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:25.940]   That equals five hundred extra hours of work.
[00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:25.940]   Now divide that back into the six hours of work that most of your peers and coworkers are actually doing in a day

[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:55.960]   Well what else could you do?
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:32:25.980]   I think you could do something like this

[00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:25.980]   That's a good idea

[00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:25.980]   These hours start to add up which is why I'm demonstrating it to you
[00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:25.980]   If you work through lunch that's five days per week you have 250 extra hours per year or a total of 41 extra full work days or 8 full weeks on your competition now even if you only work through lunch say
