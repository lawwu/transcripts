[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.600]   Pastor John, assuming someone is persuaded by the previous podcast, in
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:16.680]   episode 104, that God can will that sin be without himself sinning, how does that
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.000]   conviction then bring comfort to a Christian?
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:29.720]   The truth of God's sovereignty over sin, my sin, the world's sin, and over all the
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:38.200]   evil in the world, creates a problem for some people. In the end, for those who rest in
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:45.200]   it, see it in the Bible, believe that God is their Father through Jesus Christ, for
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:56.720]   them, for me, we find this doctrine to be of enormous comfort, enormous helpfulness
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:04.680]   in the face of the worst things in the world, because, a couple of reasons. If he's not
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:14.520]   there and things are happening random, then we are the victim of meaninglessness to the
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.920]   core of all things. And I know there are people who would rather live with that than live
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:28.560]   with a God of purposefulness, but I wouldn't. I believe that far deeper hope is given to
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.800]   those who've lost loved ones and to those who are struck down with some terrible calamity.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:43.960]   Far deeper hope is given to say, "This was not meaningless. This will prove to do something
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:51.120]   beyond all your imagination for your good if you will trust the living God and receive
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.440]   his Son as your Lord and Savior." That's the first thing. The second thing is, just in
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:11.840]   principle, if God is so weak or so evil or so foolish that he cannot cause an earthquake
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:20.040]   not to happen or a plane not to fly into the side of a building, then his weakness or his
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:28.580]   ignorance or his malevolence will never be a comfort to me in all the challenges that
[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:37.920]   I face in life. In other words, by getting God off the hook of causality, we hang ourselves
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:46.920]   on helplessness. And so I think if people will stay with this God, meditate long and
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.360]   hard, see his face in the face of Jesus Christ, loving them and dying for them, they will
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.040]   in the end find that his sovereignty is one of the sweetest comforts they have ever known.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.560]   Thank you, Pastor John. And for more of Pastor John's personal testimony to the comfort of
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.160]   God's sovereignty in the midst of personal trials, see his book, The Pleasures of God,
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.520]   chapter 2, and especially the final subsection on pages 58 and 59 of the 2012 edition. At
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.520]   DesiringGod.org, you'll find thousands of other free resources from John Piper. I'm
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.280]   your host, Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.780]   [END]
[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:28.780]   1. The Pleasures of God. Or, as John Piper put it, "The Pleasures of God." I'm not sure. I'm just saying.
