[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   In our culture today, it appears that children are increasingly given the free
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   choice to develop as men or women. There's an assumption that personal
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   manhood or womanhood is a choice that will necessarily emerge in the child and
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   in their personal choices. Pastor John, in a young girl developing towards
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   biblical womanhood or in a young boy developing towards biblical manhood, how
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   much of this development should be influenced by godly parents?
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   All of it. All of it. Children, obey your parents in everything, in everything,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   for this pleases the Lord. Colossians 3:20. Which, if you just flip that around
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   and ask, "Now what does that imply for parents?" If the Bible says to our
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   children, "Obey your parents in everything." Okay, now parents, what does that
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   imply for you? That implies you better know your Bible, you better know culture
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   enough so that you can give in everything counsel and guidance to these children
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   so that they can fulfill without sinning the biblical mandate to obey you in
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   everything. Deuteronomy 11, "You shall teach all these words of mine to your
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   children, talking of them when you're sitting in your house and walking by the
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   way and lying down and rising up. Write them on your doorposts and put them on
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   your gates." That is a description of pervasive, word-saturated guidance and
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   inspiration and encouragement for our children. No thought of laissez-faire,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   let them grow up and discover what's right and wrong for themselves. They will
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   be influenced by somebody, and God calls parents to love their children enough to
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   shape them. And I don't know how many parents think of the Great Commission,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   the latter half of it, with regard to their children, but I have thought of it,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   where Jesus says, "Go make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit." Then he adds, "Teaching them to observe
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   all things." It doesn't say, "Teaching them to know all things." That's implied.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   It says, "Observe, do." "Teaching them to observe all things." Now, if that's true
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   for the nations, every unbeliever we lead to Christ among the nations, we're
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   supposed to help them by teaching to do all Jesus commanded. All right, Mom and
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Dad, are you doing that? All that he commanded, all that Jesus commanded, are
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   you building that into your sons and daughters? And he said things like, Jesus
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   said things like, when the Pharisees came and said, "Is it lawful for a man to
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   divorce his wife for any cause?" He said, "Haven't you read that he who created
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   them from the beginning made them male and female?" And said, "Therefore a man
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   shall leave his mother and father and hold his wife, and the two shall become
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   one flesh." So they're no longer two, but one, and what God has joined together,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   "Don't let man put asunder." How you doing, Dad? How you doing, Mom? Are you
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   explaining male and female as Jesus meant it to your kids? Are you explaining one
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   flesh in husband and wife? Are you explaining leaving and cleaving? Are you
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   explaining let them not separate? Are you putting all these things into their
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   hearts? So my answer, Tony, is absolutely yes. Parents are to be involved in
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   shaping the sexuality of our children, and maybe the last thing I should say is
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   that we all know, don't we, this is best done by modeling. What those children see
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   in a mom and in a dad is, I don't know what percent, let's just say 90% of them
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   becoming healthy male and healthy female. Learning how to be a man in relation to
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   a woman, being a woman in relation to a man. They're watching, they're watching.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   They'll listen to your devotions and all your teachings, but they're watching all
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   the time. And so the biggest challenge for a mom and a dad is to enact the
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   magnificent drama of Christ and the Church in Ephesians 5:25. Wives, be
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   subject, taking your cues from the Church, and husbands, love taking your cues from
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Christ, so that the children are watching Christ love the Church, and the Church
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   love Christ, and seeing that beautiful drama enacted out. That's what will make
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   healthy, sexually healthy kids, I think.
