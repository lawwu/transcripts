[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120]   of Intermediate Biblical Counseling.
[00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.140]   It's a great joy to meet together with you
[00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.080]   on this online class.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.480]   And we trust that you're doing well in the Lord
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.720]   and that you're rejoicing in the goodness
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.520]   of our Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.320]   We are here on a Valentine's Day
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.720]   and my wife is here with me and we're broadcasting live
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.540]   and just a joy to meet with you all.
[00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.520]   We hope that you've been enriched
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.760]   and blessed by the study of God's word.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.000]   And tonight we're gonna be looking at a very important topic
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.240]   and that is a biblical theology of emotions.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.920]   This is one of the harder exam questions
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.800]   in the counseling exams of ACBC training.
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.540]   It is one of the questions that does not have
[00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.480]   a corresponding lecture in the year one training.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.320]   And it is also a topic that really requires
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.200]   some thought and reflection both from
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.900]   what the scriptures teach and also from our ministry
[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.120]   to people every day in the church.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.420]   And I do pray that our study tonight will help us
[00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.640]   to think through a much needed subject
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.760]   in the biblical counseling training
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.940]   and then just a subject that's necessary
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.520]   for each of us to think through in our own lives.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.220]   What is the place of emotions
[00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.520]   in the Christian's spiritual life?
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.120]   It's a subject that hasn't received the treatment
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.120]   that it ought to or the focus that it ought to in the church
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.480]   and I hope tonight's session will be a small pebble
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.480]   in a giant ocean that will perhaps move us toward
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.080]   a step further in our understanding of this important topic.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.800]   So tonight we're looking at a biblical theology of emotions
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.800]   and I'm so glad that you've joined us for this time.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.380]   Just a brief word before I open in prayer.
[00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.360]   I was reflecting on this importance of this subject,
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.460]   biblical theology of emotions.
[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.280]   An important topic for the simple reason
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.800]   that we all have emotions.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.480]   I trust you will agree with that.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.480]   Some of us may be more prone to expressing intense emotions
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.840]   than others.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.840]   Some of us are more reserved in our emotional expressions
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.720]   but all of us have emotions, emotions of joy,
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.640]   emotions of grief, emotions of affection,
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.920]   even emotions of relief, of gladness,
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.440]   of disillusionment, disappointment.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.980]   Consider that anger, hatred, bitterness, resentment,
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.620]   fear, anxiety, and worry can all to some degree
[00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.620]   be classified under the category of emotions,
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.060]   which means that a number of counseling issues
[00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.420]   do relate to the emotional life of our counselees.
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.220]   You and I know that people make emotional decisions.
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.460]   That's why they say never go to the grocery store
[00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.100]   when you're hungry.
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.740]   You will make an emotional decision,
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.040]   not a rational decision.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.760]   And we also know that there are some counseling meetings,
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.760]   many counseling meetings that do get very emotional.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.220]   And you wanna be equipped to know how to handle
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.220]   those expressions of emotion in counseling ministry.
[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.920]   And then just not even how it relates to counseling ministry
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.860]   but just processing the everyday events of life.
[00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.660]   I believe that the Christian life
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.380]   is a life that is filled with emotions.
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.220]   Paul described it as sorrowful,
[00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.220]   yet always rejoicing in 2 Corinthians 6, verse 10.
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.780]   We rejoice with those who rejoice
[00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.500]   and we weep with those who weep.
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.160]   And sometimes you feel like you're on
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.760]   an emotional rollercoaster in the Christian life.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.160]   I know I feel that way as a pastor.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.200]   I was sharing just this past Wednesday
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.440]   at our church staff meeting,
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.920]   that I feel something of the emotional rollercoaster
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.320]   of pastoral ministry.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.760]   On one hand, you're rejoicing with a couple
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.420]   over the birth of their baby,
[00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.420]   or you're rejoicing with a couple at a wedding
[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.140]   or a birthday, and on the other hand,
[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:55.140]   you are weeping at a funeral or in a hospital.
[00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.200]   You're just rejoicing and you're weeping.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.140]   And sometimes those emotional highs and emotional lows,
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.200]   if you will, come within 24 hours of each other.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.500]   And it's just the Christian life
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.920]   that if you're rejoicing with those who rejoice
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.500]   and weeping with those who weep,
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.460]   then there is a bit of an emotional rollercoaster
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.840]   in church ministry.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.840]   And my former professor at the Master Seminary,
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.340]   who's also a pastor here in Riverside,
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.420]   Milton Vincent, used to say to us,
[00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.420]   "Embrace the emotional rollercoaster of being a pastor."
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.620]   That is the stuff of life.
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.100]   That's what it means to be most fully alive
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.180]   is to be experiencing these emotions
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.180]   alongside those whom you love in the church.
[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.020]   And that is indeed so much of life
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.860]   is just experiencing emotions.
[00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.740]   So we need a category for that.
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.280]   We need to understand what the Bible says about emotions.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.320]   We need to understand something of the complexity
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.320]   of the emotional life of the Christian,
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.980]   sorrowful yet always rejoicing.
[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.500]   Paul said, which means that the emotional life
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.620]   of the Christian is not a single note.
[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.560]   It's not staccato.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.100]   If it was a piano piece,
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.300]   it would not just be one chord being played over and over.
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.580]   But the Christian's emotional life is a little bit more
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.580]   like a symphony where there are various melodies
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.180]   and themes being played interwoven
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:49.180]   and all moving toward a beautiful melody
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.740]   in the end as the Lord orchestrates
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.100]   all of these things in our lives.
[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.620]   So this indeed is just so much of life.
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.300]   And I hope that this teaching will help us
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.660]   handle that in a biblical manner.
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:03.860]   So let's pray together.
[00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.020]   Let us devote our time to the Lord
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.460]   and ask God to bless our time.
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.740]   Father, thank you so much for our time around your word
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.540]   and for each of the brothers and sisters in Christ
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.140]   who have joined us in this online class.
[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.500]   We thank you for Christ and his shed blood
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.660]   and his glorious resurrection from the grave.
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.740]   And we thank you for the Spirit's work in our lives
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.260]   to make us more like your son.
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:37.140]   We thank you that Jesus experienced genuine human emotions
[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.200]   in his earthly incarnation.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:46.200]   He was the perfect man, and yet he experienced emotions.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:52.140]   He wept at the grave site of Lazarus.
[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:56.540]   He was a man of sorrows, well acquainted with grief,
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:01.540]   and yet he also obeyed you, the Father,
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.540]   for the joy that was set before him.
[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:09.500]   And we just pray that we might learn to handle this topic
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.640]   in a wise manner.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.020]   Give us wisdom, Lord.
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:17.020]   Help us to not be overly simplistic
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.840]   in our handling of this topic.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.420]   Make us wise counselors, we pray,
[00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.760]   that we might be able to come alongside others
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.420]   and give help and hope to those in need.
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.900]   So we pray all this in Jesus' name.
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:30.740]   Amen.
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:36.220]   - Okay, we are looking at counseling exam number three
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.420]   tonight, and the question is this.
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:42.040]   Provide a biblical theology of emotions.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.900]   What role should a counselor allow emotions
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.460]   to play in counseling?
[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.580]   How can one tell the difference between sinful emotions
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.940]   and righteous emotions?
[00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:54.660]   And how would you use scripture
[00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:59.300]   to help a counselee change improper emotions?
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.220]   So that is a bit of a handful of a question there.
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.660]   As you can see, you could break that question down
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.420]   into four parts.
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.620]   What is a biblical theology of emotions?
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.900]   Which, just explaining that part of the exam
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:19.620]   will take a large portion of your essay.
[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.500]   What role should a counselor allow emotions
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.060]   to play in counseling?
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:30.060]   And so how would you handle emotions in a counseling session
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:34.260]   talking through the difference between sinful emotions
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.740]   and righteous emotions?
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:39.320]   We'll talk a little bit about that in our session tonight.
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.900]   And then how would you use scripture
[00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:45.820]   to help a counselee change improper emotions?
[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.160]   That's really a four-part question.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.940]   You can go about it in a number of different ways,
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.820]   but I would say that the first part,
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:58.540]   providing a biblical theology of emotions
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:03.540]   should take at least a half to two-thirds of your essay,
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.160]   and just walking through some of the points
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.840]   that we'll look at tonight.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.980]   And then the rest of the essay can move
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:14.940]   toward some application points that are highlighted
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.820]   by the next three parts of the question.
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.220]   So just trying to break down this question.
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.180]   There's a lot there.
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.120]   It's really a four-part question,
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.560]   but the first part of the question
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.100]   providing a biblical theology of emotion
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:32.100]   should occupy a large portion of your time and attention.
[00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:37.380]   As I mentioned, this is one of the harder questions
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.760]   in the year two training
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:42.520]   because we have not had a lecture on this in year one,
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:47.060]   but it is a subject that is very important.
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:50.180]   So if you look at page one of your handout,
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.420]   I have some recommended resources for you to look at there.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.480]   We have, first of all, Sam Williams,
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.040]   an excellent article toward a theology of emotions,
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.720]   which was printed in the Southern Baptist
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.000]   Journal of Theology,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.080]   and that's available online for free.
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:12.240]   I've emailed that to you in a Dropbox handout.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.760]   You can star that resource.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.560]   That really is the one resource that if you learn
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.880]   and if you master,
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.020]   you really shouldn't need much more
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.020]   than that article in writing this essay.
[00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:30.160]   Dr. Williams is a biblical counseling professor
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.520]   at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary,
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.520]   and he has written a very good essay on that topic.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.800]   I wanna commend that to you.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.800]   He does spend a lot of time in that article
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.360]   trying to make the distinctions between feelings,
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.540]   affections, and emotions.
[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.880]   Just don't get bogged down in that discussion.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.960]   I think that's a necessary discussion,
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.040]   but not one that is really pertinent
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.340]   or at the heart of the essay that you're writing.
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.720]   So don't get lost in the discussion
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.420]   of trying to distinguish feelings,
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.280]   affections, and emotions.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.280]   You can take that under the broad category of emotions
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.920]   and look to the rest of the article
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.520]   for some help on this topic.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.860]   Just an excellent work.
[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.400]   I wanna commend that to you.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.600]   I've given you Jeff Forey's chapter
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.680]   in the book "Christ-Centered Biblical Counseling"
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.520]   as a reference.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.640]   That's chapter 27 in that book.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.240]   The chapter is entitled
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.060]   "A Biblical Understanding and Treatment of Emotions."
[00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:40.400]   If you need one chapter
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.880]   that does an overview of this subject,
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.680]   I would recommend Jeff Forey's chapter
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:49.000]   in "Christ-Centered Biblical Counseling."
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.800]   And then you have really an excellent work
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.380]   I would highly recommend
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.660]   if you want further study on this topic.
[00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:02.660]   Dr. Brian Borgman is a pastor in Nevada.
[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:06.540]   I believe he pastors near Las Vegas,
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:09.540]   and I have listened to his material for years.
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.020]   He is an excellent and faithful,
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.300]   diligent student of scripture,
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:19.420]   and he has spoken at a few biblical counseling conferences.
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.900]   You'll find some of his materials
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:26.360]   up at the ibcd.org website.
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.420]   And just everything he does is very well done.
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.620]   So I commend his teaching ministry to you.
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.580]   And he has a book out that's entitled
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:39.820]   "Feelings and Faith, Cultivating Godly Emotions
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.660]   in the Christian Life."
[00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:46.820]   I would encourage you to make the study of emotions
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.940]   a lifelong study,
[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:52.740]   and that's one book that you will want to read
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:56.340]   and seek to learn more from,
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:00.940]   "Feelings and Faith, Cultivating Godly Emotions."
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:05.340]   By the way, Dr. Borgman does have, I think,
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:09.380]   a few lectures on the subject of emotions.
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.700]   If you want to listen to it on audio,
[00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:15.540]   he has a few lectures at the ibcd.org website.
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.360]   You can look that up under resources
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.780]   and do a search on his name and find that there.
[00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:26.100]   Wayne Grudem has a couple of good sections
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.300]   in "Systematic Theology"
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.460]   that relates to the subject of emotions,
[00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.760]   especially the two pages
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:35.380]   on the subject of God's impassibility.
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.580]   You will want to have a basic understanding
[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.860]   of what the doctrine of,
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.980]   or the teaching of impassibility holds,
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:48.060]   and then why Grudem does not affirm
[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:51.780]   the teaching on God's impassibility.
[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:54.600]   I do not affirm that teaching as well.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.960]   The doctrine of impassibility basically teaches
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.680]   that God is not subject to passions or emotions,
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.840]   that emotions you see in scriptures
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.200]   are not genuine emotions,
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.620]   but they are anthropomorphisms.
[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:14.620]   They are descriptions of God in a human analogy,
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:17.520]   but they are not describing genuine emotions.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.600]   And Grudem talks about in those two pages
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.820]   of how he does not affirm God's,
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:26.680]   the teaching that God is God's impassibility.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.780]   And so you just want to be aware of that discussion.
[00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.680]   I think it relates to the subject of emotions,
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.760]   as we'll see a little bit more tonight.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.200]   Those are two pages that you'll want to read
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.920]   and just have a basic working knowledge of.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.800]   My dear wife, Mina, wrote a very good essay
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.820]   on the subject of emotions.
[00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.320]   It's entitled "A Biblical Understanding of Emotions."
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.520]   This is from her training
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:54.760]   on the Master's of Biblical Counseling program
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.900]   at the Master's University.
[00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.960]   And that is an unpublished document,
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.900]   but I have put that in your hands in the Dropbox link.
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:06.180]   A very good summary of the subject of emotions
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:09.980]   with some good applications for counselors.
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:13.020]   So please do use that resource.
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.660]   We've made that available to you.
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:18.520]   And then some articles, B.B. Warfield's
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.460]   "The Emotional Life of Our Lord"
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:24.940]   is helpful in thinking through the subject of emotions
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:29.380]   in relation to the incarnation of Jesus Christ.
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:31.940]   We see in the life of Christ in the gospel records
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.460]   that Jesus wept, Jesus felt compassion,
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.320]   Jesus felt righteous anger,
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:42.700]   Jesus' sweat drops of blood in the Garden of Gethsemane.
[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:47.060]   So if Jesus was and is the perfect man
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:52.580]   and he expressed and experienced genuine emotion,
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:55.660]   then we have to conclude that emotions
[00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:59.660]   in and of themselves are not sinful.
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:04.100]   Jesus was not like a Vulcan in the Star Trek TV show.
[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:07.820]   He was not just pure logic.
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:10.140]   He experienced genuine emotions,
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.480]   but those emotions were appropriate
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:17.280]   to the context in which he was in.
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:21.660]   Think about it, Jesus Christ, the perfect man,
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:25.140]   had a full emotional life
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.620]   that was perfectly holy and righteous.
[00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:32.380]   And B.B. Warfield talks through that in his article,
[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.140]   "The Emotional Life of Our Lord,"
[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:38.100]   and that is available for free on the World Wide Web.
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:43.020]   David Powelson has a couple of good articles on this topic.
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.540]   Anything by David Powelson is worth reading
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.160]   and thinking through.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.260]   And in fact, in one of his articles,
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:53.580]   he pleads for more people to write on this subject.
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.900]   He says, "We just need more publications.
[00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:59.180]   "We need more people to think about what the Bible says
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:02.780]   "about emotions and then apply that wisely
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:06.300]   "and skillfully to the Christian life."
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:11.300]   And he has done a great job in setting us up for this study.
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:15.260]   And then a last subject or last article
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:19.180]   that I've placed in the Dropbox is Bruce Ware's article
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:23.380]   from back in 1986, where he contends from scripture
[00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:27.220]   that God is a personal being with genuine emotions.
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:30.100]   That article is a little academic,
[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.520]   but it's well worth your time if you wanna be read
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.860]   and be challenged a little bit on this subject.
[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:40.620]   He holds to the view that the biblical descriptions
[00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:45.620]   of God rejoicing, God being grieved,
[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.620]   God having compassion,
[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:51.500]   that these are not mere anthropomorphisms.
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.860]   They're not just human analogies.
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:58.860]   They are describing real emotions that God is experiencing.
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:04.300]   And you can look through his article
[00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:06.480]   for some further discussion on that subject,
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.920]   but it's well worth your time.
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.580]   And if you want more of an academic defense
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:15.760]   of the truth that God is a person with genuine emotions,
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.820]   you might want to work through that journal article.
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.580]   So just a number of good resources.
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:21.700]   You don't need to read them all.
[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:26.700]   I just wanna give you a sense of the breadth of this subject
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:31.400]   and whet your appetite for further study.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:36.400]   If you want one resource, please read Sam Williams' work
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.780]   on "Toward a Theology of Emotion,"
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:43.060]   and then the rest can be supplementary reading.
[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:47.540]   But again, a lifetime of learning awaits us on this subject,
[00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:51.060]   and I hope that this will be a good introduction
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:52.580]   to the topic.
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:55.860]   With that said, let me move to page two of your class notes.
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.980]   And again, let me prime the pump
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:02.160]   in emphasizing the importance of this topic.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.540]   Sam Williams writes this,
[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:06.340]   "Whether we are conscious of it or not,
[00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.820]   we have theories and operating principles about emotion.
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.420]   It should be no surprise that when scripture
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.260]   does not inform our thinking,
[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.460]   especially about a matter such as emotion,
[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.540]   which is so much a part of the nature of persons,
[00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:20.800]   something else will.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.580]   Unfortunately, contemporary evangelicals
[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:28.940]   have paid little attention to the development of a theology
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.460]   or biblical anthropology of the emotions,
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:34.300]   affections, and feelings.
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.140]   As a result, when the emotions are addressed,
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:41.500]   personal opinion, denominational or cultural prejudices,
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:45.000]   and pop psychology are the dominant voices.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.340]   Even worse, these voices are rarely questioned
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.180]   or justified with biblical warrant.
[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:51.980]   We seem to function as if scripture
[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:55.240]   is silent on these matters."
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:21:00.240]   I think this is true and a helpful observation.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.900]   I can't tell you how many times as a pastor
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.060]   that a Christian has talked to me in the church
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:12.060]   and expressed sorrow or grief or pain or disappointment,
[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:17.680]   and then appear to feel guilty over the emotions
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.120]   that they were experiencing.
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.760]   As if to say, "I'm a Christian,
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.160]   and I believe the word of God,
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:28.660]   and so I shouldn't be experiencing these emotions.
[00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:30.320]   I should be able to get over this.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.360]   I should be able to move past this.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.920]   I shouldn't be feeling these emotions."
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.160]   And it's my privilege as a pastor
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:44.100]   to reassure this beloved Christian
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:47.180]   that what you are feeling is normal.
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.860]   We are emotional beings.
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:54.860]   You shouldn't feel guilty over feeling genuine emotions.
[00:21:54.860 --> 00:22:01.380]   If Jesus felt sorrow, then so should we at certain points.
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:05.340]   In fact, it would be sinful not to feel sorrow
[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:10.340]   or to feel grief or pain in certain situations.
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:15.080]   I've also counseled in situations
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:20.080]   where the counseling issue is an absence of emotion.
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:25.160]   Just a dear believer in Christ saying,
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.480]   "Pastor, I haven't felt emotion about Jesus
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:33.240]   or about worship or about the Bible or my spiritual life.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:37.420]   I haven't felt emotion in months or even years.
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.080]   I'm an emotional blank.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.640]   I know I should be feeling something
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.520]   when I read the Bible or when I pray
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.380]   or when I join in Sunday morning worship service
[00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:49.400]   and sing these songs, but I feel nothing.
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:54.060]   Can you help me think through this topic?"
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:57.480]   And that is a more common struggle than you might think.
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:01.200]   It's a real struggle for people in the church.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:05.960]   And so we just need to wisely think through this topic.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.080]   And I think the lack, as Williams calls it,
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:13.560]   the lack of a development of a theology of the emotions
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:18.560]   is not helpful for us in ministering to real people.
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:23.140]   I've also observed that Christians
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:26.500]   want to move straight to the emotion of joy.
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.640]   It's almost as if we're uncomfortable
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:33.800]   with sorrow or we're uncomfortable with righteous anger
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.080]   or even the emotion of jealousy,
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.280]   the emotion of compassion, mercy,
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.640]   feeling the pain of others.
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:46.000]   We are uncomfortable with these other aspects
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.840]   of the emotional life of the Christian.
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.280]   And we want to shortcut that process
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:54.160]   and move straight to joy.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:00.040]   And I have even been in situations
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:04.800]   where I've thought that it's appropriate
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:08.100]   for us to feel a little more complexity of emotions
[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.240]   and just hit the simple note of,
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.480]   you just need to have pure joy all the time
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.480]   really doesn't capture the full teaching
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.540]   of what scripture says on this topic.
[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:23.880]   David Powelson, as I mentioned,
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:26.080]   has called for further reflection on the study.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.040]   He says, "There is no fundamental disconnect
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.840]   "between the emotional life of our Lord
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.620]   "and the emotional lives of every believer
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:34.960]   "and unbeliever in the Lord
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:39.320]   "before whom every knee must someday bow."
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:42.520]   He's saying there that if God is a person
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.640]   with genuine emotions, if Jesus Christ,
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:49.640]   the perfect man had perfect emotions,
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.140]   then so we must understand and embrace the fact
[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:56.320]   that we are emotional beings.
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:59.400]   He continues that every careless word is weighed.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:04.240]   Religious affections are a subset of affections in general
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:08.440]   and all affections are religious.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:13.440]   All human creatures worship, love, trust, fear,
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.980]   believe, take refuge, value, hope, and seek
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:19.760]   in either the right way or the wrong way.
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:23.840]   All human creatures get angry, joyful, sorrowful,
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:28.400]   guilty, jealous, fearful, loving, anxious, driven,
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:32.200]   confident, despondent, amorous, or hopeful
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.580]   in either the right way or the wrong way.
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:39.120]   Fire and smoke cannot be separated.
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.200]   The study of wetness and the study of water
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.360]   cannot be kept apart.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:47.240]   Causes cannot be dismembered from effects.
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.400]   Human life is about God and Christ
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.520]   and dare we say the converse,
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:55.380]   God and Christ is about human life.
[00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:57.360]   So you get the idea.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.560]   When you read Palestine, you get challenged
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:04.080]   to think through the fullness of what the Bible says
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:04.980]   on a certain subject.
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.680]   He has a way of poking us and prodding us
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.840]   into thinking that maybe you haven't thought
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:14.360]   through this subject in its full complexity
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:18.980]   and that all is a very hopeful and helpful prodding.
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.920]   What he's saying here is that we must think theologically
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.080]   about our emotions.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.820]   We must understand the incarnation
[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:31.720]   and the emotional life of Christ
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.520]   and then tie that understanding
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:37.920]   into our own experience of emotion.
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.560]   And then Brian Borgman says this,
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:43.360]   "It is only when we gain a biblical perspective
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.500]   "on this significant part of our humanity
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.320]   "that we can begin to grow
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.040]   "and put the mind and the emotions
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.920]   "and the will in the right positions.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.080]   "As we learn to understand
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.240]   "and handle our emotions biblically,
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:59.700]   "we begin to mature in new ways.
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:03.200]   "My pastoral experience has taught me
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.860]   "that a biblical understanding of the emotions
[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:07.580]   "and the application of these truths
[00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:12.580]   "can become a virtual greenhouse
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:17.680]   "for spiritual growth and maturity."
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.560]   I love that statement.
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.560]   And I'm going to get emotional
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.440]   speaking on this subject of emotions
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:28.000]   because I think that is why this topic is so important
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.820]   and so crucial for biblical counselors
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:33.860]   to understand this topic.
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:38.560]   When you handle the subject of emotions biblically,
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:42.640]   wisely, pastorally, carefully,
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:46.440]   and then relate to your counselees with wisdom
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.740]   and with grace,
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:49.880]   what you do is you provide for them
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.760]   what Borgman calls a spiritual greenhouse
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:57.640]   where they can actually begin to grow in ways
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:02.600]   that they had not experienced previously
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:06.000]   in their Christian life.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.240]   I think one work that has helped me so much
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.160]   to think through the subject of emotions
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.600]   was the landmark work by John Piper, "Desiring God,"
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:18.080]   which is in itself a reflection
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.320]   on the work of Jonathan Edwards,
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.520]   "The Religious Affections,"
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:24.680]   just talking about the place of affection
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.440]   or emotion in the Christian life.
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.000]   And I remember as a new Christian
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.640]   hearing John Piper preach on the subject
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:35.160]   of the religious affections for the very first time,
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:38.960]   and I had never heard someone emphasize
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:42.000]   the importance of affection and emotion
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.280]   and desiring the Lord and eating of God's word
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.120]   in a way where your full heart and affections
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:52.080]   and emotions are engaged in that study.
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:56.080]   I had never seen that subject emphasized before.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.440]   And I do remember growing in ways
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.700]   that I had not previously
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.500]   when I began to understand what the Bible said
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:07.040]   on this topic, that the joy and grief
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.480]   and compassion and mercy and even jealousy,
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:13.680]   as Paul talks about his jealousy for the church,
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.880]   that they would be presented to Christ
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.920]   in purity and in fidelity,
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.360]   that all of that understanding
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:22.880]   of the emotional life of the Christian
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:26.200]   did begin to pay dividends in my spiritual life,
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.960]   and I pray that that would continue.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.480]   And I think that's what Borgman's teaching here,
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:34.400]   that when you handle the subject wisely and biblically,
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:38.520]   you open up new avenues for a counselee
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:42.680]   and even your own life for you to grow in Christ.
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:47.280]   And I think that's why this topic is so important.
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.320]   By the way, if you meet Brian Borgman,
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.500]   he's not what you call a touchy-feely guy.
[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:52.760]   You might think that, oh, reading that,
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:54.760]   he's one of these guys who's always just like
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:58.160]   really emotional all the time and touchy-feely.
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:00.160]   And you find, this guy's a straight shooter.
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:04.840]   He is one of the most faithful biblical expositors
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:09.320]   and teachers that I have listened to,
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.480]   and he just isn't the personality type
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.840]   that you might think,
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:14.920]   but he's just being straight with the word of God
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.600]   and saying, if we wanna be faithful with the word of God,
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:22.600]   we have to understand what the Bible says about emotion.
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.920]   Moving on here, dear friends,
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.000]   have you noticed that the Bible is not hesitant
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.560]   to address our emotional lives?
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:33.240]   Christ claims authority over our emotions,
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:36.400]   and the Bible has no problems with calling us
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:40.720]   to have godly emotions in the Lord.
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.160]   Psalm 66, verse one.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.320]   "Shout for joy to God, all the earth.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.780]   "Sing the glory of his name.
[00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:49.340]   "Give to him glorious praise.
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.200]   "Say to God, how awesome are your deeds.
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.780]   "So great is your power
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:55.820]   "that your enemies come cringing to you.
[00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:59.060]   "All the earth worships you and sings praises to you.
[00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:01.240]   "They sing praises to your name."
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:04.260]   This is a call not only to engage in worship,
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.580]   but to experience the emotions
[00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:08.680]   that are appropriate to worship,
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:14.580]   which is the joyful celebration of the greatness of God.
[00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:20.440]   We are to joyfully sing the praises of his name.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.880]   We'll talk about this a little bit,
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.160]   but part of the distortion of sin in our lives
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:28.080]   is that we rejoice in things we ought to be sorrowful over.
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.880]   We are sorrowful things that we ought to rejoice in.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:35.240]   And so our emotional lives are kind of twisted
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:39.220]   where we're finding joy in things we ought to grieve over.
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.800]   And as scripture says in our society,
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.880]   we glory in our shame.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.240]   And another way that you see
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:50.480]   that our emotional lives are affected by sin
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.720]   is that we don't feel the intensity of emotions
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.480]   that are appropriate to the subject at hand.
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.800]   We have large emotions about things
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:03.500]   we should have small emotion over,
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:08.060]   and we have very small emotion over things
[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:10.560]   that we ought to experience lots of emotion over.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:16.920]   We get so excited about the Super Bowl,
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.960]   or the NBA finals,
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.660]   or our team winning a certain championship,
[00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:23.960]   or the Olympics.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.240]   And it's fine to rejoice in those things,
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:30.840]   but they are limited achievements.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:33.740]   The problem is not that we find joy
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:36.160]   in these types of things,
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.240]   it's that we have so much emotion
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.920]   over things that are of limited value,
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.400]   and we have such small emotion
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.360]   over things that have ultimate value.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:51.440]   And I think the Psalms are calling for the exact reverse.
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.040]   Shout for joy to God, all the earth.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.400]   Sing the glory of his name.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.080]   Have you ever been there where sometimes
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.220]   I'm in a Sunday morning worship service,
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:01.060]   and I'm praying,
[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:06.060]   Lord, help me to experience the appropriate emotions
[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.920]   that would respond to the truth
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.400]   that we're talking about,
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:13.480]   or to engage in the singing of the church.
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.360]   I ought to feel some emotions.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.260]   And I do get concerned in my own spiritual life,
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:21.740]   if I can go weeks and Sunday after Sunday,
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:27.840]   and come to worship service and not feel any emotion,
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:31.660]   then I start to get concerned over the state of my soul.
[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:37.760]   I don't think that we are emotional experiences
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:44.040]   or the end all be all in the Christian life.
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:47.440]   I'm not advocating from some point of view
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.920]   that says you need to whip yourself
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.200]   into an emotional frenzy
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.640]   in order to have a genuine worship experience.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.780]   We know that that's not true.
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:34:00.380]   But if I can feel zero emotion,
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:03.680]   week after week after week,
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:07.920]   after the truth of God is being proclaimed in my life,
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.040]   and the glory of God and the glory of Christ
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:13.440]   is being taught and proclaimed and being prayed over,
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.760]   and I can feel nothing for weeks.
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.660]   And I get very concerned about
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:20.560]   what's going on with my soul.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:26.960]   That there is a place for emotion in life and worship.
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:30.920]   And you see that in Psalm 66, verse one.
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:34.420]   Psalm 100, verse one,
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.520]   "Make a joyful noise, the Lord all the earth,
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.020]   "serve the Lord with gladness,
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:40.640]   "come into his presence with singing,
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:42.900]   "know that the Lord, he is God.
[00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:45.660]   "It is he who made us and we are his.
[00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:49.260]   "We are his people and the sheep of his pasture.
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:50.740]   "Enter his gates with thanksgiving
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:53.820]   "and his courts with praise, give thanks to him.
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.580]   "Bless his name for the Lord is good.
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:58.420]   "His steadfast love endures forever
[00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:03.060]   "and his faithfulness to all generations."
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:06.800]   It's hard to read that passage
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:09.660]   without responding with emotion,
[00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:12.740]   to know that the steadfast love of the Lord endures forever,
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:16.220]   to know that you are loved eternally
[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:21.940]   and that God's loving kindness will never leave you.
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:24.100]   And so we're called not only to sing with joy,
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:27.440]   we're called to serve with joy.
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:31.220]   And then you have in the scriptures,
[00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:35.020]   the emotion of sorrow being demonstrated
[00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:38.460]   by godly men like the prophet Jeremiah,
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.460]   who ministered in the days before Judah's captivity.
[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:46.420]   Jerusalem was about to be conquered
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:48.700]   by the Babylonian empire
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:51.460]   and the people will be taken captive.
[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:54.060]   The temple will be destroyed.
[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:56.740]   Jeremiah sees the impending captivity of his people.
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:59.220]   And he says in Jeremiah four, verse 19,
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:01.840]   "My anguish, my anguish, I writhe in pain
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.220]   "or the walls of my heart.
[00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:04.720]   "My heart is beating wildly.
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.280]   "I cannot keep silent for I hear the sound of the trumpet,
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.460]   "the alarm of war."
[00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:14.460]   Friends, these are emotions
[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:19.300]   that are appropriate to the circumstances.
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:20.420]   Would you agree
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:28.260]   that it is wrong to laugh out loud
[00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:32.340]   at the saddest part of a funeral service?
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:36.680]   Would you agree that that would be a wrong emotion,
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:39.300]   that that would be even sinful
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:41.980]   to express that type of emotion
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:44.460]   in the context in which you are in?
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:47.100]   Would you agree at the same time
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:50.300]   that it would be wrong to weep with sorrow
[00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:54.260]   and put ashes over your head at someone's wedding?
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:37:01.140]   It is not that joy is always right or sorrow is always wrong.
[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:05.460]   It is that our emotions are meant to respond
[00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:08.740]   to the circumstances we find ourselves in.
[00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:13.460]   And Jeremiah would have been wrong
[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:17.420]   to look at the impending doom of his people,
[00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:20.420]   the exile of his people into Babylon
[00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:24.980]   and to feel no emotion, to feel indifference,
[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:29.980]   to not weep at the events which were about to take place
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:33.300]   would have been wrong for Jeremiah.
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.620]   So he talks, he has an appropriate emotion
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:39.180]   in the context of what he was dealing with
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:41.300]   and he feels anguish.
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:49.060]   When a counselee is weeping in front of me
[00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:51.820]   because of the burden of his sin
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:56.380]   or because of the consequences of his sin,
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:00.340]   because of the devastation of what has happened
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:01.460]   that due to his sin,
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:06.460]   he has lost a number of things that is precious to him
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:09.620]   that is not the right time for me to crack a joke.
[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:13.820]   That is not the right time for me
[00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:16.860]   to make light of the situation.
[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:24.420]   We need emotions that are appropriate to the circumstances.
[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:31.380]   And even Paul felt this sorrow in his emotional life
[00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:33.660]   where he said in Romans 9 verse one,
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:36.060]   I'm speaking the truth in Christ, I'm not lying.
[00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:37.580]   My conscience bears to be witnessed
[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:40.740]   in the Holy Spirit that I have great sorrow
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:42.780]   and unceasing anguish in my heart.
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:47.780]   He lamented over the unbelief of the people of Israel.
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:54.300]   I feel this burden and I think I'm justified biblically
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:59.300]   to feel this burden of so many beloved church members
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:01.540]   who have unsaved family members
[00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:03.460]   or maybe even unsaved children
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:06.900]   and even just week after week, they come and they ask,
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:09.420]   can you pray for my loved one?
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:12.460]   That my loved one would be saved and know Christ.
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:20.300]   And I would be wrong as a pastor not to feel that burden,
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:24.740]   not to feel indifference or to not respond
[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:27.380]   with some type of emotion to the burdens
[00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:31.660]   that people are carrying in the church.
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:34.940]   And so this was Paul.
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:39.060]   I have great sorrow, unceasing anguish in my heart.
[00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:42.060]   This is the same Paul who said to the Philippian church,
[00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:43.380]   rejoice in the Lord always.
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.460]   And again, I say rejoice.
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:51.660]   There was a complexity to even Paul's emotional life
[00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:55.300]   where he could say both things at the same time
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:40:01.260]   that we should exalt in the hope of the glory of God.
[00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:04.500]   At the same time, we feel this great burden
[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:07.940]   that loved ones we know are saved.
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:14.700]   So the Bible has no problems addressing our emotions.
[00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:16.980]   If you look at page three of your handout,
[00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:21.980]   let me walk through a biblical theology of emotions.
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:24.820]   And these would just be some points
[00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:27.860]   you will want to highlight.
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:31.500]   As you talk through a biblical theology of emotions.
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:35.020]   So how do we summarize just the breadth
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:38.060]   of what scripture says on this subject?
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:41.700]   And let's talk through some theological foundations
[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:44.460]   for understanding our emotions.
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:47.180]   We begin with a simple observation in letter A
[00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:52.180]   that God is a personal being with genuine emotions.
[00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:56.460]   God is a personal being with emotions.
[00:40:56.460 --> 00:41:00.180]   A number of passages clearly demonstrate this.
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:02.220]   Genesis six, verse five.
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:05.500]   The Lord saw the wickedness of man was great in the earth
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:08.800]   and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.540]   was only evil continually.
[00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:13.860]   And the Lord regretted that he had made man on the earth
[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:17.780]   and it grieved him to his heart.
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:23.060]   You will note here that grief is an appropriate response
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:26.500]   to the sinfulness of this world.
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:32.660]   The grief of God described in this passage
[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:37.500]   is absolutely and perfectly holy.
[00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:44.140]   And so we see that grief over people's sin
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:48.440]   is an appropriate response
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:52.380]   and that God grieved over the sinfulness of man.
[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:56.180]   Exodus 20, verse five, part of the 10 commandments.
[00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.080]   You shall not bow down to them or serve them
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.220]   for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:03.100]   visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children
[00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:06.620]   to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me.
[00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:09.460]   You say, well, isn't jealousy bad?
[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:10.980]   Isn't jealousy wrong?
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:13.420]   Well, it depends on the context, doesn't it?
[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:18.980]   Is it wrong for a husband to be jealous
[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:22.140]   for his wife's affections?
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:26.760]   We would say it's not wrong for a husband to be jealous
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:31.260]   that his wife love him and him alone.
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:35.540]   If you were to go into a marriage counseling situation,
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:37.820]   and let's say in this counseling situation,
[00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:42.020]   the wife is being unfaithful, she is in adultery,
[00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:44.340]   and you're talking in this counseling session
[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:47.060]   and you find that the husband, he doesn't care,
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:50.980]   he has no emotions, he feels no jealousy,
[00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:53.200]   he's indifferent to her unfaithfulness,
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:55.280]   you would say there is something wrong
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:57.180]   with this husband's response.
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:59.700]   He ought to be feeling some kind of emotion
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:03.960]   because he ought to be jealous for his wife's affections.
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:07.860]   That is an appropriate emotion to be feeling
[00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:12.860]   due to the exclusivity of the marriage relationship.
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:15.180]   So jealousy can be appropriate.
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:19.420]   And here the Lord says, I am a jealous God,
[00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:22.860]   that God does not tolerate his people
[00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:26.740]   dividing their affections between the true worship
[00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:28.980]   of the Lord and the worship of idols.
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:32.300]   And we see that throughout both the Old Testament
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:33.800]   and New Testament.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:38.500]   I love Isaiah 49 verse 15.
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:41.260]   The Lord says, can a woman forget her nursing child
[00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:46.260]   that she should have no compassion on the son of her womb?
[00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:52.220]   Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you.
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:57.420]   What mother does not feel this way towards her children?
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:02.900]   When they hurt, she hurts.
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:06.240]   When they are in pain, she is in pain.
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:11.180]   We have seen this type of motherhood
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:14.260]   demonstrated in so many different ways.
[00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:18.220]   And the Lord says, this is what my love is like
[00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:19.280]   for my people.
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:26.020]   Can a woman forget her nursing child?
[00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:28.940]   So the Lord has moved with compassion
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:33.060]   for those who are his.
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:35.300]   Isaiah 62 verse five, for as a young man
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:38.100]   marries a young woman, so shall your sons marry you.
[00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:40.620]   And as a bridegroom rejoices over the bride,
[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:45.020]   so shall your God rejoice over you.
[00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:46.100]   Just think about that.
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:47.460]   Every time you go to a wedding,
[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:52.460]   you see the groom's face light up with excitement
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:55.780]   as his bride walks down the aisle.
[00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:58.140]   So the Lord says, that is the description
[00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:02.780]   of my joy over my people.
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:06.460]   Just amazing description of the emotions
[00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:08.820]   of the Lord, Zephaniah three verse 17.
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:10.820]   The Lord your God is in your midst,
[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:13.420]   a mighty one who will save.
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:17.460]   He will rejoice over you with gladness.
[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:19.500]   He will quiet you by his love.
[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:22.720]   He will exalt over you with loud singing.
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:26.620]   The Lord is challenging me in his word,
[00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:30.940]   and I believe he would challenge all of us as well,
[00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:32.880]   because I think my default understanding
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:36.900]   of my relationship with the Lord is sort of that,
[00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:41.900]   because of Jesus, he kind of barely tolerates me.
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:46.700]   He won't cast me out, but when I come to him,
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:50.540]   he says, okay, you can have a relationship with me,
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:54.620]   but a sort of like a displeased father
[00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:58.540]   who allows his son into the home,
[00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:00.820]   but does not have the warm embrace
[00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:03.660]   that's being described in these texts.
[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:05.060]   And the Lord has been challenging me
[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:09.800]   that that is not how he relates to his people,
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:16.140]   that he is filled with compassion and mercy,
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:20.620]   and he rejoices over his people.
[00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:22.460]   And that's the Old Testament description
[00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:25.360]   of the emotions of the Lord.
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:26.680]   You get to the gospel records,
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:29.980]   you see the full emotional life of Christ.
[00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:32.620]   We don't have time to fully develop this,
[00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:36.420]   but perfect humanity, perfect deity joined in one person,
[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:37.860]   the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:41.180]   And you see the emotions of Christ
[00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:42.520]   in his earthly incarnation,
[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:44.660]   that he was grieved at the hardness of the heart
[00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:46.900]   of the people in Mark 3, verse 5.
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:51.900]   He had compassion upon the crowd in Mark 6, verse 34.
[00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:56.700]   We see the emotions of the Holy Spirit
[00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:58.900]   in Ephesians 4, verse 30.
[00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:01.520]   Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:04.800]   by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:07.580]   So the issue is that some have said
[00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:09.700]   that these portrayals of the emotions of God
[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:12.360]   are merely anthropomorphisms.
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:16.900]   The term anthropomorphic simply means language
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:19.180]   which describes God in human terms.
[00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:21.860]   So for example, in the Old Testament,
[00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:25.100]   the scriptures describe the Lord having hands,
[00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:27.380]   eyes, ears, and mouth,
[00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:31.100]   and that is before the incarnation of Christ.
[00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:35.060]   So those descriptions cannot refer to God's physical body.
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:39.320]   God is spirit, John 4, verse 24 says.
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:44.080]   And so the Lord does not literally have hands, eyes, ears,
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:48.480]   and a mouth, but that language describes God in human terms.
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:51.360]   They are anthropomorphisms.
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:53.280]   They describe God in human terms
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:55.500]   so that we might better understand him.
[00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:58.400]   And some have said that these descriptions
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:03.400]   of the emotions of God are merely anthropomorphisms,
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:05.920]   that God doesn't really have emotions,
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:10.920]   but this is just language that helps us understand God.
[00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:13.820]   And again, Bruce Ware's article
[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:18.820]   in the Journal of Evangelical Theology Society,
[00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:24.480]   Theological Society, does an academic treatment of the fact
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:28.880]   that these texts really should be taken at face value
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:33.100]   when they describe genuine emotions.
[00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:35.820]   Brian Borgman has said this,
[00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:38.520]   that the unambiguous biblical portrayal of God
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:42.220]   is that he has absolute capacity to feel
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:45.020]   and has perfectly holy emotions.
[00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:47.860]   In the history of systematic theology,
[00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:50.440]   the mind and will of God have often been the focus,
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:52.640]   but the Bible speaks of God's heart,
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:54.960]   his emotions and feelings.
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:58.760]   Some circles deny that God actually has emotions.
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:02.000]   This is called the doctrine of divine impassibility.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.360]   However, the sheer weight of biblical evidence
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:06.680]   demands that we see God as a being
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:11.000]   who has real emotions and feels intensely.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.820]   So Borgman as well does not affirm
[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:16.900]   the teaching of impassibility,
[00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:20.820]   neither does Grudem and neither do I.
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:27.100]   God has real emotions, perfectly holy.
[00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:33.340]   When the Lord feels jealousy, it is holy emotion.
[00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:36.980]   When the Lord feels joy, it is holy joy.
[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:41.540]   As I mentioned, because of our sin,
[00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:46.140]   we rejoice in things we have no business rejoicing over.
[00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:51.160]   We celebrate the things that we ought to grieve in
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:55.320]   We find trivial things to be fascinating
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:50:00.320]   and we find ultimate and glorious things to be quite boring.
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:05.600]   That is because of the effect of sin on our emotions
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:08.080]   and these things ought not to be so,
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:14.240]   but God always has perfectly holy emotions.
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:16.240]   Just one quote there by Greg Nichols.
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:21.240]   He has an article that is posted on the blog there,
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:27.080]   but he is quoted by Borgman in the work "Feelings and Faith".
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:30.120]   And he says that God's emotivity,
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:31.760]   which is just a noun meaning
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:34.220]   the capacity of having emotions.
[00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:36.980]   God's emotivity is his supreme capacity
[00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:39.840]   to act responsibly and cessationally
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:43.520]   to feel pure and principled affections of love and hate,
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:46.520]   joy and grief, pleasure and anger and peace
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:50.480]   in accord with his supreme spiritual and simple being
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:53.140]   and impeccable virtue.
[00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:56.680]   And there's some other statements there
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:58.200]   that I will commend to you.
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:03.200]   Let me move to page number four for the sake of time here,
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:07.800]   letter B, as we have covered that God is a personal being
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:11.720]   with emotions, we also see here that man is made
[00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:13.620]   in the image of God.
[00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:18.960]   Four key passages there, Genesis 1, 27,
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:23.960]   also Genesis 5 and Genesis 9 and James chapter 3.
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:27.760]   But those passages teach us that man is made
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:29.040]   in the likeness of God.
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:33.120]   So if God is a personal being with genuine emotions,
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:35.400]   we are made in the image and likeness of God,
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:40.400]   therefore we are emotional beings as well.
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:46.320]   And there is nothing intrinsically wrong with our emotions.
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:52.240]   So we make the note there that stoicism
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:56.120]   is not the highest ideal for a Christian.
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:52:00.680]   Stoicism is the idea that the highest good is seen
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:02.560]   in the endurance of pain and hardship
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:05.700]   without a display of emotions.
[00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:09.040]   We want to just make the biblical statement here
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:14.040]   that for the Christian stoicism is not the highest ideal.
[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:19.580]   John MacArthur talks about this,
[00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:21.720]   I believe in one of his blog posts,
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:26.120]   but he talks about the idea that stoicism teaches
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:29.040]   that you wanna come to the point of total indifference.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:32.760]   You just basically wanna say, I don't care about anything.
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:35.960]   You just go through your life saying,
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:37.720]   I don't care about this, I don't care about that,
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:40.960]   you're just unmoved with emotion.
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:45.960]   And we believe that stoicism is not the ideal.
[00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:53.120]   Man and his capacity for emotions was declared
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:58.120]   to be very good in Genesis chapter one.
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:03.840]   And the richness of biblical language testifies
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:06.080]   to the central place emotions have
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:09.540]   in a person's spiritual life.
[00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:15.160]   Just a note here on skipping the Lamentations passage
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:16.980]   for a moment at the bottom of your handout there.
[00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:18.180]   It's almost a shame to do that,
[00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:22.880]   but I'm gonna be pressed for time here.
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:28.200]   Skipping to 2 Corinthians 11 verse two on your handout,
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:31.980]   and just noting Paul's emotions
[00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:34.460]   for the people he ministered to.
[00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:35.820]   Don't be afraid of this.
[00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:38.820]   As a counselor, you will have genuine emotions
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:40.540]   for the people you counsel.
[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:42.860]   And don't be afraid of that.
[00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:44.380]   2 Corinthians 11 verse two.
[00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:49.020]   I feel a divine jealousy for you
[00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:52.020]   since I betrothed you to one husband
[00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:55.100]   to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.
[00:53:55.100 --> 00:54:00.580]   Don't be afraid of the words to feel.
[00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:04.880]   Those are biblical words as you see in this text.
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:09.540]   Don't be afraid to feel that in your heart,
[00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:12.580]   how you want this person you're walking with
[00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:14.140]   to overcome their sin.
[00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:15.720]   You want them to be holy.
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:19.100]   You want them to love Christ.
[00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:21.760]   Don't be afraid to express that
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:24.180]   to the people you minister to.
[00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:26.300]   And when believers went astray,
[00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:27.960]   Paul felt that in his heart.
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:31.040]   You hear him say in the book of Galatians,
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:33.440]   so foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you.
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:36.360]   You even hear him say in that epistle
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:38.380]   that I'm perplexed about you.
[00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:42.940]   That he felt emotions that were appropriate
[00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:46.520]   to the situation that the people going astray
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:51.520]   from fidelity to Christ was met with genuine emotion
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:54.600]   from the apostle Paul.
[00:54:56.700 --> 00:55:00.660]   And as I mentioned, I feel some of that
[00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:03.660]   and I have to as a pastor.
[00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:08.180]   Just joy whenever you hear somebody grow
[00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:11.900]   that this person grew or this person came to Christ
[00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:17.820]   and then perplexity, pain over hearing of someone
[00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:23.120]   go astray or maybe a marriage that is,
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:27.280]   needs reconciliation or a child who is rebellious.
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:30.660]   I think that's just New Testament ministry.
[00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:34.260]   Let me move to page five of your handout.
[00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:36.940]   Letter C, and this is again under the category
[00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:39.540]   of a biblical theology of emotions.
[00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:43.440]   We note that the image of God was distorted at the fall.
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:46.540]   So the bottom line is this.
[00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:49.180]   I'll get right to the chase here.
[00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:52.380]   The fall of man into sin in Genesis chapter three
[00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:57.000]   does not remove our capacity to feel emotion.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.220]   We're still emotional beings.
[00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:02.340]   It does not erase the image of God,
[00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:04.040]   which is stamped on our souls.
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:07.940]   What the fall of man into sin did
[00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:10.480]   is not remove the image of God in us,
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:13.660]   but the fall distorted that image.
[00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:18.580]   We still have emotion, but our emotional life is twisted.
[00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:20.580]   Our emotions are misplaced.
[00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:24.920]   Our emotions do not rightly correspond to the context
[00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:28.020]   that we are in due to our sin.
[00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:31.020]   We get really excited about a piece of chicken
[00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:32.700]   at a restaurant.
[00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:35.100]   Oh, this chicken is so good.
[00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:36.940]   It's so glorious.
[00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:39.620]   And we are emotionally disengaged
[00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:42.820]   when it comes to the glories of God in Christ
[00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:45.960]   as found in the scriptures.
[00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:52.900]   That is the distortion of the image of God in us.
[00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:54.480]   We still have emotions,
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:59.480]   but those emotions register in all the wrong ways.
[00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:04.260]   As Jeff Forey has written immediately
[00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:05.780]   upon eating the forbidden fruit,
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:09.460]   Adam and Eve experienced the fallout of disobedience,
[00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:12.980]   embarrassment, shame, vulnerability, fear,
[00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:14.540]   even a form of irritation.
[00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:15.780]   God's design remains,
[00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:19.820]   but it is experienced in a twisted and painful way,
[00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:22.740]   which is conveyed by the new emotional experiences
[00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:26.240]   Adam and Eve had after their sin.
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:27.380]   Before the fall,
[00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:29.020]   emotions would have functioned in ways
[00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:30.920]   that supported God honoring living.
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:32.960]   Since the fall, they have functioned in ways
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:37.500]   that reflect sinner's desire to be independent of God.
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:41.260]   The Puritan Thomas Boston put it even more plainly.
[00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:44.140]   He said the natural man's affections
[00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:46.340]   are wretchedly misplaced.
[00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:49.700]   He is a spiritual monster.
[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:52.500]   His heart is where his feet should be fixed on the earth.
[00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:55.720]   His heels are lifted up against heaven,
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:58.420]   which his heart should be set on.
[00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:01.740]   His face is towards hell, his back towards heaven,
[00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:03.420]   and therefore God calls him to turn.
[00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:05.020]   And here it is.
[00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:08.420]   Friends, this is the description of America today.
[00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:12.100]   Boston says he loves what he should hate
[00:58:13.460 --> 00:58:16.360]   and hates what he should love.
[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:21.180]   Joys in what he ought to mourn for
[00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:24.380]   and mourns for what he should rejoice in.
[00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:29.780]   Glories in his shame and is ashamed of his glory,
[00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:32.300]   abhors what he should desire
[00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:36.320]   and desires what he should abhor.
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:43.440]   That is most of cable TV today, I'm afraid to say.
[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:48.920]   And that's many commercials at the very least.
[00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:53.440]   You know what they say, buy this car,
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:55.520]   use the shampoo, go to this restaurant,
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:58.900]   and you will experience ultimate joy and satisfaction.
[00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:06.360]   When the truth is that only Christ
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:11.160]   will give that type of joy and satisfaction.
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:14.320]   We love what we should hate.
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:16.000]   We hate what we should love.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:20.680]   We find ultimate joy over things of limited value,
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:22.600]   or we seek that ultimate joy,
[00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:24.660]   and we find ourselves to be disappointed.
[00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:28.680]   Borgman says, like a Picasso painting,
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:31.700]   all our parts are distorted out of place,
[00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:33.680]   backwards and usually dark.
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:35.920]   The biblical portrait of us
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:38.020]   and our fallen state is unflattering.
[00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:40.040]   The proper relationship of the emotions,
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:42.400]   the will into the mind is twisted.
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:44.620]   It is out of order and out of proportion.
[00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:47.500]   We resemble a circuit board that at one time
[00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:49.560]   functioned properly and reliably
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:52.140]   with all the components perfectly integrated.
[00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:56.360]   But since the fall, instead of our charges
[00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:57.420]   following the right paths,
[00:59:57.420 --> 00:59:58.680]   they deviate because of sin
[00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:00.600]   and cause serious malfunctions.
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:03.960]   The sad reality is that we are serious train wrecks.
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:07.960]   Our emotions can be downright toxic.
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:15.160]   I think of several times when I've done marital counseling.
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:19.960]   The wife is there in tears,
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:24.160]   weeping over the hurt and over the pain
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:27.820]   that's been experienced in the marriage.
[01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:33.760]   The husband is there emotionally unmoved, callous
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:37.400]   for the pain of his wife.
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:41.800]   And I just wanna see, don't you see your wife?
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:46.240]   Don't you see her in tears here?
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:49.300]   I'm not saying who's right, I'm not saying who's wrong,
[01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:52.820]   but can't you just start by acknowledging her pain?
[01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:59.040]   But you see friends, sin blinds the mind.
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:04.240]   Sin distorts the emotions.
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:08.320]   It is sin that causes that husband to be so wrapped up
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:13.200]   in his own thoughts, in his own world,
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:16.080]   that he cannot register the proper emotions
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:20.160]   that are appropriate to his wife being in so much pain.
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:24.620]   That husband ought to feel something and he feels nothing.
[01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:32.040]   And so that is the effect of sin upon our emotions,
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:35.960]   that the image of God was distorted at the fall.
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.460]   We're still emotional beings,
[01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:41.960]   but we do not feel as we ought to feel.
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:44.440]   So what is the hope for fallen individuals?
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:49.440]   Well, letter D is that in Christ, we are as Forrey writes,
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:55.160]   redeemed emotional beings who can pursue
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:57.320]   and cultivate godly emotions.
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.400]   Praise the Lord for that.
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:04.840]   We are saved through the blood of Christ and in Christ,
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:07.280]   through his life, death and resurrection,
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:10.280]   the image of God is being restored in us.
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:11.860]   We are progressively being conformed
[01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:14.180]   to the likeness of Christ.
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:16.420]   And as we become more like Christ,
[01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:19.800]   our emotional lives are transformed.
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:25.080]   We begin to experience godly emotion.
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:29.980]   Emotions can be classified as righteous
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:31.960]   or unrighteous in scripture.
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:35.580]   Joy is commanded as a righteous emotion
[01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:38.560]   in Philippians 4, verse four, but joy is unrighteous
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:42.840]   when you rejoice in evil, 1 Corinthians 13, verse six.
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:47.820]   Sorrow is righteous when we grieve over sin,
[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:49.460]   James 4, verse nine.
[01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:53.220]   However, sorrow is not righteous when we grieve
[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:57.980]   as those who have no hope, 1 Thessalonians 4, verse 13.
[01:02:57.980 --> 01:03:03.540]   Believers are commanded to have compassion
[01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:06.100]   toward one another, Colossians 3, verse 12.
[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:11.680]   We are called to move with feeling
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:14.960]   toward others in the body of Christ.
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:18.160]   And to close one's heart to another believer
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:21.420]   is unrighteous and outside the will of God.
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:25.220]   So we are redeemed emotional beings
[01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:27.720]   who can pursue and cultivate godly emotions,
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.880]   joy, sorrow, jealousy, fear, hope, compassion,
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:36.880]   grief, and pain, all of these emotions are restored in us
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:40.760]   and they register rightly and appropriately
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:44.540]   as we are made to be more like Christ.
[01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:52.360]   So let me end on the last page here
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:56.920]   with some practical applications for counseling.
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:01.520]   And I'm just gonna take five minutes and walk through this.
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:03.960]   This is just fresh for my own thinking.
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:05.800]   I just reflected on this topic
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:10.120]   and just want to continue to learn and grow
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:13.680]   and become a better Christian, become a better counselor,
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:17.320]   but just some practical ways that we can apply this teaching
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.800]   in our lives and ministry.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.240]   I would encourage you, first of all,
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:23.380]   to become emotionally wise.
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:26.940]   Ask God for wisdom.
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:31.280]   Develop a robust understanding
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:33.680]   of the biblical teaching on emotions
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:38.080]   and then ask God for wisdom and applying that
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:40.060]   to your ministry with people.
[01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:45.680]   Sometimes you really have to be discerning
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:48.880]   and just understanding what is this counseling going through
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:53.920]   and what are the emotions that this person is experiencing.
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:57.600]   Just being sensitive to that is helpful
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:00.040]   in counseling ministry.
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:05.280]   Number two, grow in your ability to rejoice
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.840]   with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep.
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:10.980]   I understand that's easier for some than for others.
[01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:17.320]   I understand that some of us are just more wired
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:21.480]   to be compassionate and to experience emotions with others
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:24.600]   and others of us are just more emotionally reserved,
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:27.240]   but ultimately I would just plead with all of us
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:30.640]   that learning to enter into the emotional life
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:34.580]   of other people is a matter of being more like Christ.
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:38.480]   It is not whether you have a certain personality
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:40.520]   or you have another personality.
[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:43.800]   Being compassionate is becoming more like Christ.
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:46.620]   Being merciful is being like Christ.
[01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:51.720]   And so let Christ-likeness be the standard
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:56.720]   and wherever you are in terms of how God has made you,
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:59.600]   ask God to help you to become more like Christ.
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:03.300]   I've prayed this in my own life as a counselor.
[01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:09.520]   Lord, I should be feeling sorrow and I'm not, help me.
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:15.040]   Give me emotions that are appropriate to this person's pain
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:17.600]   or I ought to be feeling joy and I'm not.
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:20.400]   Help me, give me emotions
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:23.300]   that are appropriate to this situation.
[01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:26.900]   Number three, as Milton Vincent has said,
[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:29.460]   embrace the emotional rollercoaster.
[01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:31.900]   It is the stuff of life.
[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:35.000]   You are most alive, you're most fully alive
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   when you are engaged in the joys and the sorrows of others.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.520]   And so don't be afraid of this.
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:47.940]   It's New Testament ministry.
[01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:51.020]   Number four, take special care in developing
[01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:54.260]   a biblical understanding of grieving and sorrow.
[01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:58.760]   I just wanna plead with this in the church.
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:02.700]   Don't be in a hurry to move people past their sorrow.
[01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:06.380]   Seasons of sorrow can be long and it is true.
[01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:07.500]   There's a balance to this.
[01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.900]   We are not to grieve as those who have no hope,
[01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:14.900]   but there is an appropriate emotion of sorrow.
[01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:19.060]   And so learn the language of lament
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:21.620]   as taught and modeled in the Psalms.
[01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:23.500]   I think of Proverbs 25, verse 20,
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:26.300]   which says whoever sings songs to a heavy heart
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:28.940]   is like one who takes off a garment on a cold day
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:30.860]   and like vinegar on soda.
[01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:37.420]   Counseling comes to you and pours out his or her heart
[01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:41.200]   and just going through a very difficult and distressing time
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:42.580]   and the only thing you give them
[01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:44.780]   is rejoicing the Lord always.
[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:46.420]   And again, I say rejoice.
[01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:47.380]   And if you don't do that,
[01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:49.740]   then you're on disobedience to the word of God
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:51.420]   and so you need to repent.
[01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:54.660]   Well, that's a very simplistic approach
[01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:56.140]   to that person's emotions.
[01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:57.700]   I believe we have more to say
[01:07:57.700 --> 01:08:03.580]   to capture the full teaching of the Bible on this subject.
[01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:09.260]   Number five, study the heart.
[01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:13.020]   Emotions are tied to the intellect, will and desire.
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:14.060]   As biblical counselors,
[01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:19.060]   we wanna become versed in how the Bible describes
[01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:21.220]   the dynamics of the heart.
[01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:24.180]   Ultimately, emotions are tied to a life of worship.
[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:27.540]   And so become wise in seeing how emotions
[01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:29.540]   are tied to the issues of the heart.
[01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:34.540]   And then lastly, rejoice that when we are glorified,
[01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:37.140]   we will experience perfect emotions
[01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:39.580]   which are in line with the will of God.
[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:42.060]   I'm so glad, dear friends,
[01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:44.140]   that what happens in our glorification
[01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:46.820]   when we go to heaven and we see Christ
[01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:49.220]   and we worship the lamb forever and ever
[01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:51.540]   is that God does not take us
[01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:56.020]   and he makes us into perfect Stoics
[01:08:56.020 --> 01:09:00.420]   who with Vulcan-like logic
[01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:04.820]   think with perfect rationality
[01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:08.380]   but feel nothing in heaven.
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:11.300]   I'm just so glad that that's not what the Bible says
[01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:12.260]   about heaven,
[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:18.740]   but that we will have the image of God fully restored in us
[01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:23.220]   as we are perfectly made to be like Christ.
[01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:27.500]   And therefore we will experience perfect emotions
[01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:31.020]   that are holy and righteous
[01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:34.860]   and that respond with perfect clarity
[01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:38.540]   and the right intensity to those things
[01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:42.900]   which are most glorious and most perfect.
[01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:49.500]   This is the glorious hope that we have as believers.
[01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:54.420]   And so I just commend this study to you.
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:58.580]   I pray that this teaching will just be the beginning
[01:09:58.580 --> 01:10:03.060]   of a lifetime of learning on this subject.
[01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:07.820]   I pray that you and I will become wise in this area.
[01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:12.460]   Both understanding how to handle our own emotions
[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:17.460]   and then learning to minister to others
[01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:20.860]   who are experiencing the emotions of life.
[01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:24.180]   And we pray that God will give you a wonderful
[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:27.500]   and rich ministry as you apply these teachings
[01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:30.380]   to your relationships in the body of Christ.
[01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:33.060]   Thank you so much for joining us tonight.
[01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:35.620]   It's been a joy to walk through this subject with you.
[01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:40.500]   Please do avail yourself of those resources.
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:42.420]   Sam Williams' work.
[01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:45.740]   Do take a look at the work that my wife,
[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:48.140]   my dear wife wrote on the subject of emotions.
[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:52.620]   I think she has done a good job of summarizing
[01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:56.180]   much of this teaching in a clear way.
[01:10:56.180 --> 01:11:00.820]   And may God bless the study of your word this week.
[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:03.340]   I do have, I wanna make an announcement
[01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:06.580]   about just the class scheduling.
[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:10.220]   My wife and I will be on vacation for a week.
[01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:14.100]   We're just gonna enjoy some time together.
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:17.620]   And so fortunately for us,
[01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:20.380]   and then maybe unfortunately for this class,
[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:23.340]   our vacation's gonna start on Sunday and then end on Sunday.
[01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:26.660]   So I will be unavailable to teach this class
[01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:28.180]   for the next two Sundays.
[01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:29.820]   So what we're gonna do is we're gonna take
[01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:33.820]   the next two Sundays off from a meeting together
[01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:35.100]   in this class.
[01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:40.100]   And we are gonna resume class on the first Sunday of March.
[01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:41.940]   So that's March 7th.
[01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:44.420]   That'll give you two weeks to get caught up.
[01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:48.700]   If you're a little bit behind or writing the essays,
[01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:51.300]   we hope to get you caught up by March 7th
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:52.700]   on essay number three.
[01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:55.300]   And we'll give you some time to reflect and study,
[01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:57.900]   especially on the subject of emotions.
[01:11:57.900 --> 01:12:01.180]   And then we will resume class on March 7th,
[01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:04.300]   same time at five o'clock p.m.
[01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:06.860]   And we do look forward to that time.
[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:08.900]   So thank you so much for joining us tonight.
[01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:10.980]   Let me close this in a word of prayer.
[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:12.700]   Father, thank you for the study.
[01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:18.820]   Bless it to our lives and help us to learn and to grow wise
[01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:22.380]   in light of the truths we've looked at tonight.
[01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:24.100]   Bless all my brothers and sisters here
[01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:27.340]   and gather us back together on March 7th
[01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:29.460]   as we continue to study your word.
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:32.460]   And we pray all this in Jesus name, amen.
