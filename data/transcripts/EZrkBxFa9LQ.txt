[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   tell me on the topic of learning new things you mentioned today that your
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.920]   colleagues are peeved when you spent half of half of the time learning new
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:17.640]   things uh-huh how did you how did you stand your ground I don't know just
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.420]   buddy-minded I don't know was it because you're so productive that didn't matter
[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:36.260]   no no I mean it matters I mean most of that time I was either the manager of a
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.280]   management consulting team or I was CEO of a company or whatever so like I mean
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.600]   my first two startups I wasn't exactly CEO nobody had titles I had co-founders
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:55.880]   but yeah in the end it's like this is how I do things you know so but I'm not
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.200]   gonna say it didn't create friction
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.280]   I mean I don't know what do you think Hamill like you work with me and you see
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.960]   how I jump onto totally different things when we're meant to be focused on
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:16.560]   something like um I actually don't see you I don't see you getting distracted
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.360]   that much at least for me like we're talking about apl right now when we're
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.320]   meant to actually be focused on releasing nb dev and I'm going to be
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.440]   doing the course you know it's like okay no yeah okay okay yeah like um in in
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:37.640]   hindsight it looks like it was all part of a like a genius plan how like while
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.160]   you're doing it it's like why are we doing this that's how I feel sometimes
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.440]   but then it's kind of like that thing we did with rich I don't know if you
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:56.400]   remember that with a with the GH top with with your old CEO we yeah yeah yeah
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.560]   this thing using rich yeah like we spent so much time doing that and while we're
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.480]   doing it I was like why are we you know at some point I was like I don't know if
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:12.440]   this is worth it or you know but then like you know Will mentioned that he
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.400]   started his company based upon this that project and I thought wow that that's a
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.480]   really big impact it's so like lies yeah yeah so then I just kind of learned over
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.440]   time that it actually you can pivot these things into something productive
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:38.440]   usually yeah so this this company textualized on ao well who created it
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.160]   said came out of
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.160]   ammo and I
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.280]   refactoring
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.800]   there we go still the most recent one so nobody's touched it since this rather
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:05.680]   megapia which yet basically talk rich and
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:13.800]   made it do things that we all hadn't exactly expected it to do this is quite
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.160]   funny because I think yesterday or two days ago I went to this website
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.440]   textualized that I owe and I was thinking hmm what does this do like how are they
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.640]   planning on sending it or what's the plan I mean that the website is
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.320]   beautifully designed so I thought that there must be some business entity
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:40.280]   behind it and yeah that's yeah so it's basically you know one guy although I
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.160]   think he might have he's got some funding so I think he's hired somebody to help
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:50.800]   now who loves building CLIs and so what Hamill and I showed with our GH top
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.880]   thing was that actually you can like use another tool he's created called rich to
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.800]   kind of get a long way towards building terminal user interfaces and
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:08.240]   yeah this is something it's come full circle now now that somebody's using
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:15.320]   textualized to build a notebook in the terminal that's true which is great
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:23.840]   alright so since I'm on the Mac today let me just check something if I switch
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.640]   to a different virtual screen you guys can now see my terminal is that correct
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.040]   yep okay great
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:50.960]   yeah so since I'm on the Mac I just downloaded that Jupyter kernel and I
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:05:02.200]   unzipped it in the ran install.sh and it looks like I now have a dialogue APL
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.120]   thing here so one thing that's happened since yesterday is we now have a GitHub
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.520]   repo
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.120]   which let's have a look
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:35.000]   APL study there you go so I don't have that over here so let's grab it so I'll
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.640]   go copy yeah so we've got a fast AI / APL - study and really all this in it at the
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:51.920]   moment is my notebook and so I should be able to now get clone that
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:11.880]   there we go and so I should now be able to open that good and very I should be
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:27.160]   going to run it right okay oh and then the other thing we did was we installed
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.600]   that toolbar widget thingy oh which I've actually already got here so that's
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:44.560]   good so I guess I have to go bookmarks shift Apple B okay APL
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:07:01.880]   great so let's see if I can type back tick - yep that works okay so I'm back up
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.800]   to where we were on the different computer
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:24.520]   so let's do times and divide shall we and I guess I should also run dialogue
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:35.960]   and we should also get up our help which was called dialogue language comments
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:55.200]   cool all right let's do times so at first it feels a bit weird that times
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:01.560]   and divide are actually on - and equals but then you realize that like plus
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.200]   minus times and divide are all kind of next to each other on the keyboard so
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.920]   it's not quite that weird I seem to have got used to it pretty quickly so we can
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:18.480]   do two times three and so that makes sense
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:33.040]   how did you get the APL keyboard on top of chapter notebook it's it's if you go
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:39.520]   to the forum oh I think did we discuss it yesterday I don't quite remember
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:47.920]   maybe we do it yeah but I just didn't know where to take it from yeah okay so
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:09:08.320]   specifically the steps are you area is the bookmarklet so you click here and
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:16.680]   then you as it says you drag this to your bookmarks bar is this link and then
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.400]   you go to the Jupiter webpage and you click that link in your bookmarks bar
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:41.440]   and it will appear okay and this thing is called not surprisingly time sign and
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:10:08.760]   the two forms of it okay direction and multiply obviously called times okay so
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:16.480]   obviously we can multiply a scalar by a scalar we can multiply a scalar by a
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:30.360]   list and we can multiply a list by a list and remember just because there's
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:37.000]   no space here doesn't mean this is one times two this is this list times this
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:55.240]   list so space binds more tightly that makes sense so far yep
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:18.600]   okay now monadic times is taking us into complex weld again which is fun
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:38.000]   let's see what it says direction so again we look over to the top right get
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:46.680]   it says our is the result of doing times on y y is any numeric array okay when an
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:51.240]   element of y is real the corresponding element of the result is an integer whose
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:55.120]   value indicates whether the value is negative 0 or positive so this is what
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:02.400]   we'd normally call the sine function and most languages and often in math it's
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:09.120]   called that as well and so just to check here 3.1 is positive so that returns 1
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:15.680]   negative 2 is negative so that returns negative 1 and 0 is neither so that
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:23.760]   returns 0 okay so those ones okay so this is showing us the sign which they
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:31.720]   call direction complex numbers the corresponding element is a number with
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:38.800]   the same phase but with magnitude of 1
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:48.240]   it's equivalent to this so let's find out what this does
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:13:01.880]   I think that'll give you the absolute value yeah magnitude they call it the
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:11.000]   absolute value so direction
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:30.320]   is what does that mean for complex they're going to give either I or
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:39.360]   negative I I guess we should try it is that just a regular bar
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:45.160]   see
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:56.000]   it is okay so it's actually something a bit more interesting I think this is
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.760]   gonna yeah I mean if you visualize it as a vector right it's just gonna normalize
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.120]   the vector to magnitude 1
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:14.120]   yes that's gonna require some drawing I think I just want to get up the
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:20.120]   documentation to see how to describe it magnitude of a complex number okay great
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:25.440]   so we're going to do some more complex number stuff which is cool
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:46.800]   I have a quick question yeah I think so far the gloves for monadic and dyadic
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:51.200]   are the same for all the gloves that we've looked at except for Nick and
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:56.760]   minus sign which uses a different one do you know why that is no that they're
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:01.120]   always the same always the same yeah I think what you might be getting
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:07.880]   confused about is the difference between the thing that lets you specify a
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:17.840]   negative number which is that versus the function which takes the negative of an
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:26.000]   array which is that oh that's not a function this binds more tightly than a
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.760]   function this is actually this is more like the dot here is not a function
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:37.880]   right it's part of the literal number 2.3 is it the same as the negative is not
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:47.120]   part of it's not a function it's part of the number negative 2.3 okay thanks no
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:53.080]   worries so if I do this this is not saying apply the negative function to
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:57.720]   these four things it's saying this is a list containing this negative number and
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:05.120]   this and this and this positive number so if I wanted to negate those four
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:12.000]   things I would have to do this yeah so hyphen is a function and this upper bar
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:19.240]   thing is just part of a number not a function just like dot is part of a
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:23.560]   number just like J is part of a number
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:35.960]   Jeremy so this JavaScript keyboard it gives when you hover over a symbol it
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:43.360]   gives these key bindings that work with a regular keyboard not a PL keyboard but
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:51.200]   it would be preferred to use the APL keyboard right no not at all they're the
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:57.400]   same this the difference is an APL keyboard has pictures of those letters
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:02.400]   on them but they produce the same things you still have to have the same software
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:07.960]   whatever so the only reason to have an APL physical keyboard is so that you can
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:13.000]   look at the keyboard and see them you know I got it I was thinking about the
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:20.600]   APL keyboard in Windows oh in Windows okay these things the JavaScript applet
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:24.280]   thing here it gives you other key bindings that work with the regular
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:31.640]   keyboard like you know like XX tab is for multiplication yeah oh okay so don't I
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:37.760]   suggest not using those instead use at the very bottom it says back tick -
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:44.040]   use that one because those are identical to the Windows keyboard so you just use
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:50.320]   back tick followed by the same letter you would use in the Windows keyboard and
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:58.360]   so here this one is back tick equals yeah I would ignore those tab ones okay
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:04.000]   but this also works with just a regular Windows keyboard should I be using the
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:11.920]   APL keyboard like yeah you can use the Windows APL keyboard if you want I so
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:16.320]   I'm not using that right now because I am not on Windows but be even on Windows I
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.760]   actually prefer not to use it because it takes away my control key and I like my
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:27.360]   control key yes so the back tick notation the one of them on the bottom
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:32.600]   here will be the the preferred one it's what I'm liking so far but obviously I'm
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:37.880]   very new to this so I don't take my word for it but yeah I like the back tick
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:43.800]   approach because it continues that as well that's because copy and paste and
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:53.400]   everything in the usual way yeah okay let's talk about complex numbers some
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:19:04.360]   more shall we so yeah this is one of those things I didn't really get into
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:21.840]   much University I mean I wish somebody told me how cool they are okay so the
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:27.480]   thing I guess we talked about yesterday is how we can create this like complex
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:38.840]   number plane right and so along this axis you've got the real number line and
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:54.040]   then along this axis you've got the imaginary number line okay
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:09.880]   so you can put numbers there for example here's the number 2 and here's the
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:24.960]   number minus 3i but you could also create the number here 2 plus 2i okay so
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:33.240]   that's the complex number 2 plus 2i okay there and you can think of that as a
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:39.960]   vector right it goes from the origin and it goes up to there there's another way
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:48.200]   of thinking of 2 plus 2i and that vector has a length and we can calculate its
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:56.880]   length because it is we have here a right angle triangle
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:02.480]   oh we have a right angle triangle
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:13.200]   and its height is 2 and its base is 2 so it's length here we can get from the
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:36.640]   Pythagorean theorem that makes sense so far so that is the magnitude of this
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:42.520]   complex number so the magnitude of real numbers is easy right because like what's
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:47.000]   the magnitude of this number here well it's how far away is it from the origin
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.800]   and the answer is 3 you know what's the magnitude of this number here well
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:22:01.200]   that's easy it's 1 right this one's also easy 3i what's its magnitude what's
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:07.440]   distance from the origin is also 3 right but yeah the ones where you've got a
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:16.280]   mixture of imaginary and real you have to use the Pythagorean theorem to find
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:26.240]   out their magnitude a single number which is like how big is it and if we
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:35.440]   take a number so this number the number we were dealing with here was 2 plus 2i
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:48.280]   which APL writes like this it's the same thing and they have this thing called
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:23:02.720]   direction which is basically saying take a number for example like 3 and 3 the
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:08.520]   direction of 3 is plus 1 and the direction of negative 3 is negative 1
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:13.920]   and basically what we're doing is we're taking the number 3 and dividing it by
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.480]   its magnitude
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:28.320]   and that's another way of thinking about this sine function okay so like what what
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:36.480]   do you do in for a complex number well you take the number and divide it by its
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.040]   magnitude
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:44.760]   to do the same thing and so that's going to give you something that is going to
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:57.440]   be you know around about here so it's going to be pointing it's going to be
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:03.040]   pointing in the same direction no excuse me it's going to be pointing in the same
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:10.600]   direction but it's going to be shorter and specifically we can draw this really
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.320]   important thing
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:20.880]   which is called the unit circle and the unit circle is something that has a
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:36.640]   radius of 1 right and it's centered on the origin and so the direction any time
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:43.840]   we get the direction of a real we're going to get something that points in
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:49.920]   the same direction as the original number but is actually sits on the unit
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:59.200]   circle it's like will be one does that make sense so we could try it right so
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:10.880]   so what's the square root of 8 so we could do 8 to the power of negative 2
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:29.520]   that's not right sorry you need to be one half rather okay and so we thought if
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:45.800]   we took 2j2 and divide that by 8 the power half
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:26:08.720]   we get that and if we get the direction times of 2j2 array it's the same so and
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:18.720]   rather than writing 8 times 5 what I could have written here is magnitude of
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:28.280]   2j2 because that's what magnitude means okay so
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:44.120]   does that make sense what it's doing you'll notice that like although complex
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:50.040]   numbers are about this by the square root of minus 1 we don't think about that at
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:58.320]   all right when we're doing this complex number stuff we we just treat it as a
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:03.360]   pair of numbers which therefore can represent a point in Cartesian space
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:10.440]   and therefore that can represent a vector and is that 0.7 radians like what
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:20.000]   is that value no this is a this is a complex number 0.7 j 0.7 so it's 0.7 plus
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:30.040]   0.7 i because remember 2 plus 2i is written as 2j2 in in APL so this is 0.7
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:40.400]   plus 0.7 i so it's a complex number and so it's this it's this point here it's
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:47.440]   the complex number that has the same direction as 2j2 but has a magnitude of
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:54.760]   1 and therefore it sits on the unit circle and like we really like to do
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:28:01.560]   things on the unit circle because on the unit circle if we kind of draw that out
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:14.360]   a little bit more if we stick to things that are on the unit circle so here's 1
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:32.600]   1 1 - 1 - 1 so these points are nice because you can pick any one of those
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:42.760]   points like here right and if you create that triangle then this hypotenuse here
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:48.640]   the length of it is one which is really convenient right because if you're doing
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:54.640]   like trigonometry or something right you've got like sine theta circuit OA
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:29:02.880]   equals opposite over hypotenuse well that's always one on the unit circle so
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:13.080]   we can we can delete that part entirely
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:21.720]   instead we get sine theta equals opposite you know so it's it's it's nice
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.200]   to deal with stuff it's on the unit circle things become more convenient we
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:41.360]   can ignore the whole magnitude slash hypotenuse piece entirely trigonometry
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:49.280]   coming back huh probably a lot of us haven't seen it since high school all
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:54.400]   right so what do we say about monadic times we haven't introduced magnitude
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:30:08.400]   yet so let's put that away down here for later and for now I guess we'll just say
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:35.440]   that the magnitude of 3j4 is equal to I guess we don't have a way of even doing
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:40.720]   a square root so we'll just have to kind of do it with prose so the magnitude of
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:47.640]   3j4 is equal to the square root of 3 squared plus 4 squared so that's 9 plus
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:55.000]   16 oh yeah of course 3 4 5 is a Pythagorean triple so it's basically
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:17.880]   going to be we're going to be dividing by 5 yeah so so basically three 3j4
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:42.600]   means 3 plus 4i which has a magnitude of 25 because
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:58.360]   it has a magnitude of 5 because 3 times I guess we should use this 3 times 3
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:13.220]   plus 4 times 4 equals 5 times 5
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:50.720]   so 0.6 j 0.8 represents a vector in the same direction as as 3j4 3j4
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:33:02.440]   but is a magnitude of 5 since it's
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:11.920]   3j4 divided by 5
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:23.120]   okay how's that so that's dyadic times now that does mean that we just use
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:32.680]   divide and I don't want to use anything until we've introduced it so probably do
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:38.840]   divide first and divide I think is actually a bit of an easier one
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:50.820]   okay so divide which is on the equals sign on the APL keyboard
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:34:04.960]   but yeah okay so that's quite divide sign divide sign
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:17.840]   the magnetic version called reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal reciprocal today
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:26.860]   spell that right no reciprocal recall and the dyadic version is called divided
[00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:44.600]   by divided by okay and I guess what we could do is grab all of those and paste
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:52.420]   them in here and I wonder if this works can we go find times and replace with
[00:34:52.420 --> 00:35:04.560]   divide oh lovely there we go okay so divided by is easy does anybody here not
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:08.000]   know what reciprocal does
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:24.740]   maybe we don't oh we can't do zero okay let's change system and as a side note
[00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:30.680]   I found the reciprocal to be kind of handy when I'm doing any square roots or
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:36.760]   cube roots or anything like that because then you can do rather than doing 0.5
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:47.280]   power you can do 16 to the reciprocal to the power of three reciprocal reach for
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:56.560]   example yes or cube root you could do the cube root of 8 like so yeah exactly I
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:02.320]   don't think we need the parentheses because first it does it one at a time
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:05.760]   right so it's going to do divide so this is going to be the first thing it does
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:12.960]   is divide 3 this is reciprocal of 3 and then it's going to be time power of on
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:18.800]   the left will be 8 and on the right will be reciprocal 3 which is cool so it's
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:26.920]   like function composition yes it it is which is actually a great time to talk
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:41.960]   about the hat because we've now got our four basic operators from math and so we
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:45.240]   should now talk about precedence
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:37:04.800]   and I think I want to change my headings a little bit back on a rain
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:17.360]   going to create a section called basic math operators
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:29.780]   oops
[00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:38.800]   right what have I got here I've got plus sign twice I do something weird I had
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:45.600]   it - monadic - plus sign monadic plus
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:53.240]   okay this
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:38:16.680]   dyadic plus by attic dyadic times monadic dyadic okay precedence so here
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:37.800]   is the formula 3 times 2 plus 1 okay so in regular math we would go 3 times 2
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:42.480]   first get 6 and then we'd add 1 and get 7 and there's a couple of reasons we do
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:47.440]   that the first is that times is a higher precedence than plus and even if it
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:58.440]   wasn't we go left to right so is this 7 no it's not and that's because APL makes
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:04.320]   things much simpler for us by having no concept of precedence of different
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:09.120]   functions they all have the same precedence and the rule is we always go
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:15.160]   right to left not left to right so this is the same as this
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:23.080]   and that's good because you wouldn't want to remember precedence rules for
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:27.640]   all what are these like 50 or 60 or whatever glyphs right so they all have
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:34.320]   the same precedence that doesn't mean all symbols have the same precedence
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:38.480]   we've learned of a few symbols that have different precedence so for example
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:51.720]   space right 3 plus 4 space 2 space between numbers binds more tightly because
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:55.480]   this would be better to explain like this this binds more tightly so this is
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:40:06.160]   the list 3 5 added to 4 or the array 3 5 added to 4 which is the same as that so
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:09.480]   when I say we're doing things right to left I'm only talking about functions
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:18.860]   right and remember that upper bar thing is not a function right that's part of
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:26.040]   the number and this space here is not a function that's part of this array so
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:31.080]   functions specifically you can tell something's a function because you look
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:41.280]   it up in the help and I'll tell you it's a function okay we can see here it's
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:44.660]   listed under the section called primitive functions okay so we can tell
[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:50.760]   that this is a function because in the functions part of the help most of the
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:55.560]   things up here are going to be functions as we'll learn shortly some of them are
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:59.720]   operators and the rules are different for operators but most of these of
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:06.320]   everything we've seen so far in terms of times divide plus and minus are all
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:18.240]   functions so that's the rule we go right to left so in this version here right we
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:24.040]   go right to left so okay we've got the number three now we've got three divide
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:29.360]   okay well that means the reciprocal of three and then we keep going left we
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:35.140]   come across this time this power of and it has a right-hand side and it has a
[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:40.440]   left-hand side and that's why this is eight to the power of a third so it
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:42.740]   makes sense
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:55.800]   so we could do that with a list and so remember the symbol space finds the most
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:42:03.560]   tightly so this is the list one two three multiplied by two plus one because we go
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:10.080]   right to left so we go one plus two times this list that'll be three times
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:12.920]   that list
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:24.760]   and we could also do this so this will be this list to this array two four six
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:31.720]   plus two they're all that in brackets and then multiplied by the array one two
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:39.320]   three so two plus two is four two plus four is six two plus six is eight eight
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:49.480]   times three is twenty four six times two is twelve four times one is four that
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:43:00.520]   makes sense yes so I'm not sure if that's related but that function for giving us
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:08.960]   the magnitude direction it was I think that would offer an array it still works
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:16.120]   on each component it it doesn't normalize the whole array right right
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:25.880]   basically pretty much all the functions in their normal forms work element wise
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:33.760]   like numpy does including power and reciprocal and magnitude and so forth
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:37.200]   it's a good point
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:44:02.560]   uh did you go over the power of symbol I don't know okay I thought we might do
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:13.660]   that now I think that kind of counts as a basic math operator kind of
[00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:21.680]   so
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:38.120]   yeah so let's do okay so this is confusing this is shift 8 the normal
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:44.080]   multiply sign from Python doesn't mean multiply
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:57.360]   it means exponential or power so and it's called star
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:00.420]   you
[00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:02.460]   you
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:04.500]   you
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:06.560]   you
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:08.620]   you
[00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:10.680]   you
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.740]   you
[00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:14.800]   you
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:16.860]   you
[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:18.900]   you
[00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:20.980]   you
[00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:22.980]   you
[00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:24.980]   you
[00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:26.980]   you
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:28.980]   you
[00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:35.380]   okay and dyadic
[00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:56.400]   power
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:04.400]   so exponential means e to the power of so this is e to the power of 0
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:18.080]   is 1 e to the power of 1 is 2.718 and e to the power of 2 apparently is 7.389
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:34.720]   does anybody not know what e is or want a refresher what e is a refresher would
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:43.220]   be great sure refreshers are always great sure the only reason I can do all
[00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:45.920]   these refreshers off top of my head is because I've done all this stuff with my
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:50.220]   you know my daughter and her friend recently so I can I can do math
[00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:55.460]   refreshers like this I'm ready about a month ago I couldn't because I'd
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:58.160]   forgotten everything
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:13.360]   so a the basic idea is like if you put $100 in the bank
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:22.680]   right at a hundred percent interest
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:35.920]   then after one year you'll get $200 and specifically that's your original hundred
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:53.320]   plus sorry I should say times one plus the interest and a hundred percent is a
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:48:05.160]   hundred over a hundred so it's one but the bank might not give you the whole
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:08.960]   you don't might not calculate the whole thing at the end of the year if they
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:11.520]   want to be a bit more generous they could calculate it twice they could
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:16.040]   calculate it once at six months and and again after another six months so you
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:24.020]   take your hundred dollars and after six months they would give you half of your
[00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:32.680]   interest so that's 50% so after six months you would have 150 and then at
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:36.800]   another six months they'll give you the other 50% but the other 50% is now
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:43.480]   going to be calculated on this right so this is times 1.5 and then again times
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:49:00.400]   1.5 to 25 which is 100 times 1 plus 0.5
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:09.520]   squared if they're really generous they could pay it quarterly and if they paid
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:13.440]   it quarterly then the amount of money you're going to make is a hundred times
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:17.800]   one plus actually let's do this as a fraction rather than as a decimal a
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:20.560]   quarter
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:42.600]   therefore or they could pay it daily 100 times 1 plus 1 over 365 to the 365
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:53.600]   okay so we should be able to calculate these things in APL right no promises we
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:56.180]   could give it a go
[00:49:56.180 --> 00:50:08.800]   now let's do this 100 plus 100 times 1 plus a quarter to the 4 100 times
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:23.960]   1 plus a quarter now a quarter is that it's a reciprocal of 4 1 plus a quarter
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:28.920]   okay to the power of is this
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:36.280]   and so this is going to happen first because we go right to left
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:43.840]   I should say you don't have a hundred dollars in the bank let's say you've got
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:51.680]   one dollar in the bank okay so in that case your one dollar would become two
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:55.720]   dollars if it was paid just at the end of the year or it become two dollars and
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:59.560]   twenty-five cents if it was played every six months or it become two dollars and
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:12.520]   forty-four cents if it was paid every quarter or we could do 365 5 it was paid
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:20.400]   every day it would be this number and you can see the more often it's paid the
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:28.280]   more money you're going to get right but like and this you know initially this
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:32.240]   went up pretty quickly but now it's going up pretty slowly so let's say it was
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:39.040]   paid hourly that's paid a hundred times per day
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:50.720]   and it's not really making much difference at this point a is the limit
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:56.840]   of this as this number gets really really really high
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:05.480]   so we could write that in math
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:27.040]   then we can say e is the limit as whatever X goes to infinity so as X gets
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:33.400]   really big that never hits infinity of okay and the one times we can just
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:54.240]   ignore right so it's a limit of 1 plus 1 divided by X to the power of X that
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:53:03.720]   makes sense that's a how's that radic I just remembered the definition of limit
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:09.760]   well it's something I have not seen in ages yeah I kind of say the kids loved
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:14.560]   seeing limit you know and of course they're immediately like well just get
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:19.920]   rid of it and put infinity there okay let's put infinity there one plus one
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:24.600]   divided by infinity okay kids what's one divided by infinity zero okay what's one
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:30.800]   plus zero one what's one to the power of infinity one okay so does he equal one
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:37.960]   no say okay well what do we do they're like well what about infinity minus one
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:44.640]   that's still infinity so this is our first introduction to limits and they
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:48.600]   they were just like they were partly like wow that's so cool and they were
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:54.200]   partly like never show me anything like this again this is wrong yeah it
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:54:01.840]   shouldn't happen get it out of my life but this is beautiful because like
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:06.720]   they're trying to make it concrete and somehow relates to these ideas that's
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:12.200]   amazing and they will understand it at a much deeper level than people you know
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:18.800]   just you know going through this reading theorems in in a classroom and yeah that
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:23.320]   there's something deeply disturbing about limit yeah and I guess like like the
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:28.160]   takeaway is that this is just something that people agree to right this is well
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:31.800]   I mean it's a it's it's I think it's more than just something people agree to
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:38.080]   like it's it's it's some kind of reality you know like it's it's a true it's a
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:44.040]   true thing that there exists independently about discovery of it right
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:50.720]   but how do you make the jump from something getting closer to something
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:55:00.360]   being that value that it gets closer to this is a definition this is like yeah
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:07.560]   I don't know anyway I mean I think it's really cool yeah all right so that is
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:20.280]   that is monadic monadic star and he is named after oiler I think oiler as more
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:26.640]   specifically oiler named it after himself famous blind Swiss mathematician
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:32.920]   but oiler did not discover a I don't know who did but it won't it wasn't him
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:38.960]   even though he got to name it somehow
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:47.960]   for those of you that remember calculus you know you can take the derivative of
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:52.600]   various functions for example we saw in the fast AI class that the derivative of
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:57.000]   x squared is 2x one of the things that's interesting about a is that the
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:05.840]   derivative of e to the x is e to the x it has a lot of crazy things going on with
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:16.360]   a and comes up a lot the maybe the most cool beautiful formula in the world is
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:26.320]   oilers identity which brings together a lot of the things we've seen so far
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:32.800]   and it's e to the i pi plus 1 equals 0 put another way e to the i pi equals
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:41.400]   negative 1 which is like total madness that this thing which is about circles
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:45.800]   and this thing which is about imaginary numbers and this thing which is about
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:51.320]   compound interest somehow combined to create negative one
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:57:00.320]   but that's mind blowing and so that's what that's why monadic star is e to the
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:06.080]   power of e to the power of is a pretty important thing and so we don't need a
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:12.680]   special symbol for a right because anytime you want a you just write this
[00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:23.920]   all right and then okay dyadic star is power of so 49 to the power of a half is
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:37.120]   square root of 49 5 to the power of 2 is 5 squared minus 4 square root is 2i
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:48.760]   because it's equal to minus 1 times 4 so you get the square root of minus 1 which
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:53.760]   is i times the square root of 4 which is 2 2i
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:58:02.720]   all right is that place to see yeah I think this is the first time e to the i
[00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:08.040]   pi has actually made sense to me because I did make the connection that pi is
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:11.840]   essentially like I think like a half like a half circle and radians or
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:17.320]   something yeah and so I is just that other you know I guess like the y on the
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:21.280]   plane yes all you're doing is you're just curving that around to the other
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:25.600]   side to turn it to a negative one add one on for that and I got zero yes
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:31.440]   exactly and maybe Wayne you can try to find like a really good video or
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:35.480]   something that explains that for people that have never seen that before because
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:38.880]   I think that'd be a great thing to put in there oh yeah I think there's a
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:42.520]   channel three blue one Brown may have some stuff if I see anything I'll put it
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:48.080]   up yeah ideally something that doesn't use any concepts that we haven't come
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:54.720]   across yet you know mm-hmm I keep my eye open for that yeah I mean the key thing
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:59:01.280]   around complex numbers to me I think is this idea that if you multiply it by
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:08.960]   negative one you flip something from one side of the you flip something from one
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:15.680]   side of the number line to the other on the real plane ditto if you multiply by
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:20.240]   negative one for a complex for a imaginary number it flips it to the
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:27.360]   other side of the number line but if you multiply something by I it rotates it by
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:34.400]   90 degrees you go from two to two I to negative two to negative two I back to
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:44.560]   and so yeah I think a lot of these ideas end up basically being these kind of
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:51.960]   rotations around this number plane yeah you see stuff like that all over in
[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:56.400]   engineering I think for me when I made the connection that if you look at the
[00:59:56.400 --> 01:00:01.600]   eye as kind of a shorthand for having an array of two numbers like basically
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:06.920]   just coordinates on a plane and that's just a way to kind of have that mapping
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:10.680]   to your number line all of a sudden everything else starts to fall into place
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:15.440]   and then when you're talking about magnitudes and stuff like oh wait I've
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:22.080]   seen this before as like you know magnitudes in I mean weird is it like the
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:25.080]   L2 norm or something like that it's like even if we're just having like the
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:29.360]   magnitude of like absolutely effective is the exact same thing it's likely it is
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:36.720]   well I seem put this in the chat what's this about was him can you tell us oh so
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:41.720]   it looks like the Jupiter kernel has a way of rendering I'm not to call it like
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:50.040]   function composition so if I type this into Jupiter yeah like that mm-hmm and
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:58.740]   what am I missing around this all do you mean the the parenthesis execute just
[01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:07.080]   that okay it gives us the expression tree that's beautiful okay we will come
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:13.320]   back to learning about that about that later but yeah you can basically put a
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:18.680]   bunch of functions in a row and it does interesting things if you get rid of the
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:21.260]   parenthesis
[01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:36.760]   they favor goodness me all right thanks gang enjoy the rest of your day thank
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:44.920]   you very much everybody thank you thank you bye yeah
