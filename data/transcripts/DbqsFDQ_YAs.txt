[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   If you look at like Gulf War One, Western coalition forces had like a hundred to one
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.520]   kill ratio.
[00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.760]   They had better sensors on their tanks.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.960]   They had better precision missiles, right, like GPS, and then maybe 20, 30 years of technological
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.960]   lead, right?
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.760]   And they, you know, just completely crushed them.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.440]   Superintelligence applied to sort of broad fields of R&D.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.080]   I think that could compress a century worth of technological progress into less than a
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.080]   decade.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.180]   And that means that a couple years could mean a sort of Gulf War One style advantage in
[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.040]   military affairs, including like a decisive advantage that even preempts nukes.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.400]   Suppose like, how do you find the stealth in nuclear submarines?
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.980]   So I think enormously destabilizing, enormously important for national power.
[00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.280]   If you play this picture forward, I think it is fairly unlike any other technology in
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.280]   that, you know, a couple years of lead could be utterly decisive in military competition.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.040]   I think the question is, when does the CCP and when does the sort of American national
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.920]   security establishment realize that superintelligence is going to be absolutely decisive for national
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.920]   power?
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.360]   The situation we want to be in, we could be in if we played our cards right, is a little
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.840]   bit more like, you know, the US building the atomic bomb versus the German project.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.280]   behind, you know, years behind.
