[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.960]   - Pastor John, in a recent episode on writing,
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.320]   you said this, quote, "The actual process of writing
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.240]   "is the most important portal by which new light
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.400]   "shines into your mind on a topic," end quote.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.880]   Now some friends of ours online on Twitter
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.740]   pushed back on your statement and said
[00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.440]   this may be a personality difference,
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.560]   saying that for them, the process of gaining new light
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.540]   on a topic comes most importantly from conversations
[00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.400]   that they have with others.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.280]   What do you say?
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.040]   Is this a personality difference
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.260]   and does this in any way change your original statement?
[00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.120]   - One must be so careful.
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.960]   Yes, now I'm trying to think how to make this answer
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.480]   longer than 30 seconds.
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.760]   (laughing)
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.440]   They probably wouldn't be satisfied with yes, would they?
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.240]   I have no authority to tell someone else
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.240]   that starting to write will bring more insight for them
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.280]   than having a conversation with someone, okay?
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.280]   So to be completely accurate, I could have said
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.320]   the actual process of writing is, for me, okay, for me,
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.560]   the most important portal by which new light shines
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.780]   into your mind on a topic.
[00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.040]   And as I thought about it,
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.320]   maybe there's another qualification I should have made.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.240]   Namely, I'm assuming that every strategy
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.320]   of seeking new light on any topic
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.320]   is soaked in prayer for light.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.320]   So that in one sense, prayer is the most important portal
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.920]   of new insight.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.200]   And there may be other qualifications I should have made
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.680]   or should make as well.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.080]   But, okay, having said that,
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.160]   my aim is to help writers break free
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.420]   from the paralysis of not writing
[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.400]   because they don't yet know what they think about an issue.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.520]   Okay?
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.520]   And my point is, knowing what you think about an issue
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.240]   with clarity and fullness doesn't precede writing,
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.580]   but comes from writing.
[00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.720]   That's what I'm gonna stand by.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.120]   Now, I know, I am sure, that there are some folks
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.120]   whose brains are so amazing in their capacities
[00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.560]   to hold an idea in place and look at it
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.560]   from 30 different angles and see hundreds of relationships
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.040]   between the idea and those angles
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.680]   and the relationships among the angles themselves
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.640]   that they could think something through
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.960]   and have it clear in their minds
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.840]   before they put anything on paper.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.260]   Maybe there's three of those people,
[00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.020]   like Albert Einstein.
[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.980]   And let's just say the vast majority of us,
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.380]   that is not true.
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.380]   Writing is a way the mind can start seeing clearly
[00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:40.220]   what was before a fuzzy tangle of thoughts.
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.860]   So God bless conversations.
[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.300]   Amen. Conversations.
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.300]   I have had incredibly illumining conversations
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.240]   that got me some important breakthroughs.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.040]   But here's reality for me, for me.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.120]   And I just wanna make sure people whom God is calling
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.920]   to write are giving this its due power.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.720]   After two or three flashes of insight
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.040]   come from a conversation that you would not have had
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.900]   on your own, praise God for conversations,
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.900]   writing now or not writing, what shall we do?
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.000]   Now what should we do?
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.680]   Now you've got your flashes of insight.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.680]   For me, those insights are bursting with possibilities.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.480]   So I've come away from a conversation,
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.480]   those insights are bursting with possibilities.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.920]   Those possibilities are going in 10 directions at once.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.320]   How do those possibilities flowing from those three insights
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.560]   become clear and defined and differentiated
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.940]   and interrelated and coherent?
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.120]   I know of no answer to that question but writing.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.560]   For me, and I think I'm really average in this regard,
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.560]   not exceptional, more conversations won't bring me,
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.760]   and I think most people, to this stage of clarity
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.160]   and definition and differentiation
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.560]   and interrelationship and coherence.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.240]   So sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.920]   after a conversation or after anything
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.080]   and a flash of insight is there.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.940]   And I'm lying there in bed with this insight
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.360]   that may or may not have come from a conversation
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.640]   and the implications of it are starting to pour
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.860]   and question after question is starting to come
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.400]   to my mind and I know what I have to do.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.320]   I have to turn the light on and at least reach
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.720]   for a pad of paper, which I have in the drawer
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.100]   beside my desk, and write enough to preserve that
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.600]   till the next day when I can get writing
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.560]   for clarity on the thought that seed,
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.320]   that seed will not come to fruition of illumination
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.960]   in my mind without that.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.620]   So I'll say it again.
[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.020]   Yes, we are all wired differently.
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.220]   Different experiences bring light to our minds
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.120]   in different ways, but for those of you
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.820]   who are called to write, I offer you this claim.
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:27.860]   For the vast majority of you, the confusion you feel
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.660]   over what you are supposed to say or want to say
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:37.400]   will not go away until you try to say it.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.400]   And saying it on paper preserves it and lets you go back
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.600]   and see what you thought five minutes ago.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.600]   And writing is a great way of thus seeing.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.940]   So don't let your confusion about what to write
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.420]   keep you from writing the very writing
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.220]   that blows away the confusion.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.200]   - Very good thoughts, Pastor John, thank you.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.460]   And if you have a question to send John Piper,
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.540]   or if you wanna catch up on recent episodes,
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.760]   or if you wanna listen to the most popular episodes
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.200]   of all time in this podcast series,

[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.400]   And episode number 582 was the centerpiece
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.820]   of this episode, by the way.
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.600]   You can find episode number 582 in the archive.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.600]   And for all of this, go to DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.900]   Well, maybe you are a writer,
[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.900]   or you are wondering if you are.
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.900]   Has God called you to serve the church with a pen?
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.400]   And how can I know if he has?
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.240]   I wanna ask John Piper this question tomorrow.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.080]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.620]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.200]   (upbeat music)
