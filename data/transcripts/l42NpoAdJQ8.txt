[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.400]   Daniel in London asks, "In Hebrews 8.12 it says God will remember our sins no more.
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.780]   However, in Matthew 12.36 it says we will have to give an account for every
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.940]   careless word spoken. If God remembers our sins no more, why do we have to give
[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.540]   an account? Pastor John, how do we reconcile these seemingly contradictory
[00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:30.120]   verses?" That's a good question. And let's start with the fact that there
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:41.320]   will be a judgment of believers. Let's be careful though. There is therefore now
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.400]   no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. Romans 8.1. And that "now" is
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:53.240]   very precious, right? There is now no condemnation, which means, as Jesus says,
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:59.760]   you will not come into judgment. That is, you will not have to be condemned ever.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.720]   Your sentence is over. Not guilty. Righteous before the living God. And the
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.280]   reason, of course, is because we have been united to Christ. His punishment
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.200]   became our punishment, and his resurrection became our resurrection.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.240]   We're already sitting at the right hand of God, and we have passed from death to
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.200]   life. And therefore, in that sense, we don't come into judgment. There's no
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:36.080]   condemnation. Nevertheless, clearly we're going to come into a judgment according
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.360]   to our works. Revelation 20.12 says there are books being written, and there's a
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.400]   book, the book of life, is the book in which if your name exists, you have life
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.480]   forevermore. And the books are where your works are written, and those books, I
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.640]   believe, will reveal the evidence that your name does belong in the book of
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.440]   life. But the book of life is the book of the life that was slain before the
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.680]   foundation of the world, and therefore the ground for being in the book of life
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:15.800]   is not that you've earned it or that your works merit it, but that the one who
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:24.800]   was slain is your Savior. So what then is this judgment according to
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:32.960]   works? And Paul describes it in 1 Corinthians 3. He says, "If the work that
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.480]   anyone has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward. And if
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.760]   anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:55.000]   saved only as through fire." So we lose rewards and we gain rewards according to
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.880]   whether we've built with wood, hay, or stubble, or gold, and silver, and precious
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.720]   stone. Now if that's true, if there's a rewarding and a loss of rewarding
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:14.320]   according to what we do, what in the world does it mean in the several texts
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.600]   where it says God doesn't remember our sins? Because it seems like, "Well, I've
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.680]   obviously sinned here, and those sins are going to be burned up at that moment. I'm
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.360]   going to lose reward for them." And so they were remembered at that time because
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.560]   they couldn't have any function to do that if they weren't remembered. And
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:39.640]   here's what I think it means. God's not remembering, I think, means God will
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:47.040]   never call our sins to mind. I'm replacing "call to mind" with "remember"
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:57.120]   as a ground for our condemnation. He will not call them to mind in any way that is
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.480]   destructive for us. In fact, I would go so far as to say it will always be only
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:10.960]   good for us, good for us, all things considered, if he calls them to mind this
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:17.040]   way. So that even the suffering of loss at the judgment, according to 1st
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:24.880]   Corinthians 3, 14, will be good, all things considered. So here's an analogy that
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.680]   helps me. What about we forgetting our sins? Should we forget our sins or
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:39.000]   remember our sins? Because in Philippians 3, Paul says, "Brothers, I do not consider
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.480]   that I've made it my own, but one thing I do, forgetting what lies behind and
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:51.040]   straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on." So Paul says, "I forget. I'm not
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:57.800]   paralyzed by the horrible memories of the fact that I was killing
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.600]   Christians, I was throwing them in prison, I was shaking my fist in the face of God.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:09.760]   I'm forgetting all that and I'm pressing on." However, he wrote to
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:16.760]   the Ephesians, chapter 2, "Remember that at one time you Gentiles in the flesh
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:23.600]   called the uncircumcision, remember that you were at that time separated from
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.000]   Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, strangers of the covenants of
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.960]   promise, having no hope without God in the world." Well, Paul, which is it? Are we
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.440]   supposed to remember what it was like for us before we were saved? How horrible
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.000]   that was and what horrible things we did? Or are we supposed to forget those
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.800]   things which lie behind? And I think what Paul would say is, "We forget them and we
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:59.160]   remember them according to what's good for us." When he says, "Remember them,"
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.000]   he means, "Remember them for your humbling, not for your paralysis. Remember them for
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.240]   your deeper enjoyment of grace, not because of your destruction." And I think
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.280]   probably it's the same with God. God remembers and doesn't remember. That is,
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:23.960]   he calls to mind and applies, or he doesn't call to mind, according to what's
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:31.360]   good for us and what's good for for his glory. So God is God. He is omniscient. He
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:37.440]   knows everything past, present, and future. But the not remembering is a not calling
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:43.240]   to mind for our destruction and a not calling to mind for anything except what
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.720]   would work good for us. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this
