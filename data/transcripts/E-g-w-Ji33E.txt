[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440]   Now, as you know, last Sunday at the conclusion of the service, I invited you to pray for
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.640]   the governor of California, Gavin Newsom.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:21.140]   And I did that purposely because obviously we would love to see him come to Christ.
[00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.400]   And this week, I think probably all of you know that we wrote him a letter, an open letter,
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.240]   since he is very open about advocating the things that dishonor God.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:40.720]   We are also open about calling him to faith and repentance, and we have done that.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:49.020]   And there has obviously been an amazing response to that coming from a lot of angles, but for
[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.300]   the most part, very encouraging to us.
[00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.380]   But in the light of that, I want to give you a kind of a biblical message.
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.760]   A biblical framework for confronting rulers.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.420]   Some have questioned, "Why would you do that?"
[00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.220]   And I want to show you how this is the calling of the church, as it has been for God's people
[00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.440]   throughout redemptive history.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.240]   And we need to start at the beginning.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.180]   And for us, the beginning would be then, "What is the mission of the church in the world?
[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.360]   What are we supposed to be doing here?"
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.160]   You might think that we're supposed to be providing entertainment for unbelievers, if
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.160]   you just took a look at the church superficially.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:44.080]   You might think that we're supposed to have some kind of manipulative power on the levers
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.200]   of authority and influence in the world, if you looked at the political preoccupations
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.560]   of Christians and churches.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.740]   But you would be wrong on both counts.
[00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.340]   The church exists in the world, really, with one mission.
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.140]   And that is defined for us in the Great Commission.
[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.220]   Listen to the words of our Lord Himself.
[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.100]   He defines for us our responsibility.
[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.820]   And I'll use three passages that are familiar with you.
[00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.320]   First Matthew 28:19 and 20.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:23.660]   The command to His followers is this: "Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations,
[00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.320]   baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.620]   Teaching them to keep all that I commanded you.
[00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.880]   And behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.880]   That is the Great Commission, to evangelize the nations, bringing them the gospel so that
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:50.040]   they believe, trust Christ, are baptized, start on the path of discipleship, which is
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.700]   defined as being obedient to all that the Lord has commanded.
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.300]   So we are in the business of proclaiming.
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.120]   Proclaiming the gospel by which people are saved, become disciples, and live and serve
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.540]   in obedience to God.
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.900]   That's our mission.
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:13.480]   Our Lord's words in Luke 24, verses 46 and 47 give us another angle on the same commission.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:22.780]   He said to the disciples, "It is written that Christ would suffer and rise again from
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.280]   the dead the third day, and that repentance for forgiveness
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.940]   of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all nations."
[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:41.660]   There is our commission to proclaim repentance for forgiveness of sins in His name,
[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.380]   the name of Christ.
[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:54.520]   And then there is another wording of the commission in Acts 1:8, where we read, "You will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.520]   you.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:02.200]   You shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and even to the ends of the
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.660]   earth."
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.180]   In all three commissions, we have a global responsibility: to the ends of the earth,
[00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.920]   to the end of the age, and to all nations.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:19.720]   And summing it up, it is to proclaim the gospel, the gospel of forgiveness of sins by repentance
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.500]   and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ that makes one a disciple who lives in the kingdom of
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.500]   God.
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.500]   And that is the gospel.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.600]   That is why the church is in the world.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.880]   That's what we need to be doing.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.480]   That is our whole calling.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.060]   A couple of familiar passages are important for us to understand in the light of that.
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.380]   One is in Romans, chapter 10, and you're familiar with it, but let me read a few verses from
[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.640]   Romans 10, starting in verse 13: "For whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.480]   saved."
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:01.880]   As we go preaching the gospel, we're encouraging people to call on the name of the Lord to
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.600]   be saved.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.640]   The next verse says, verse 14 of Romans 10: "How then will they call on Him in whom they
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.440]   have not believed?
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.480]   How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard?
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.300]   How will they hear without a preacher?
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.320]   How will they preach unless they are sent?
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.160]   Just as it is written, 'How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news of good
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.460]   things!'"
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.580]   However, they did not all heed the good news, for Isaiah said, "Lord, who has believed our
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.320]   report?"
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.300]   So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.100]   Fulfilling the Great Commission means we have to be sent, we have to preach, we have to
[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:51.140]   preach the gospel so that people can hear, and in hearing, believe and be saved.
[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.440]   So primarily, when we think about the Great Commission, we're talking about the preaching
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.080]   of the gospel.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.220]   That is the priority, obviously.
[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.860]   Those texts that I've just gone through make that clear.
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.680]   But there's another text that I want to add to those that is very important and belongs
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.940]   right alongside of them, and it's found in 1 Timothy, chapter 2.
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:19.400]   So turn to 1 Timothy, chapter 2, and at the beginning of that chapter, I want to read
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.300]   a number of verses down through verse 7.
[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.420]   1 Timothy 2, verses 1 through 7.
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:33.500]   "Because here is another responsibility to which the church is called.
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:43.180]   First of all," 1 Timothy 2:1, "here's the priority: 'I urge that entreaties and prayers,
[00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:51.000]   petitions and thanksgiving be made on behalf of all men.'"
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.400]   And so we are going to be pleading with God for all men.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:02.080]   In what exact sense is that prayer directed?
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.320]   For what purpose?
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.320]   Keep reading.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.840]   "For kings and all who are in authority."
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.300]   And that's shocking, and I'll comment on that in a moment.
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:17.380]   We're to be praying on behalf of all men, but the one sample group that He identifies
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:24.400]   is kings and all who are in authority, "so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.380]   in all godliness."
[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.360]   Now, the first thing we want to do is pray for the rulers.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:35.000]   If you want to live a quiet life, if you want to live a peaceful life in human society,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:43.820]   in all godliness and dignity, pray for the rulers, because so much of what a society
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:52.340]   is as we know very well is a direct result of its rulers and leaders.
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.360]   And God wants us to pray for those who rule over us.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:01.100]   Verse 3, He says, "This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior."
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.100]   Why?
[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:08.900]   "Because He desires all men, all kinds of men, to be saved and come to the knowledge
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.980]   of the truth.
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:18.000]   For there is one God and one Mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.340]   who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony given at the proper time; for this,
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.340]   I was appointed."
[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:29.540]   A preacher and an apostle.
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.820]   Now the context here is salvation.
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:42.720]   Since God desires salvation, if He desires salvation from all kinds of men, if He desires
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:52.160]   them to come to the knowledge of the truth, that is why He has provided salvation through
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.320]   the ransom of verse 6, "for all persons."
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:00.560]   So the context is salvation.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.760]   One God and only one, therefore only one true religion.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:12.300]   One Mediator and only one, the man Christ Jesus, therefore only one Savior.
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:23.420]   One ransom for all, the only ransom, and thus one gospel, one way of salvation.
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.300]   Because of God's salvation plan.
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:31.980]   And because God desires all kinds of men in all stratas and nations and tribes and
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:39.580]   tongues and peoples, as heaven will show in the book of Revelation, we are to pray for
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:50.140]   the salvation of all men, but especially for those who rule over us, because that conversion
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:55.280]   at that level changes culture dramatically.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:00.520]   But when things aren't the way you would like them to be, yes, we recognize sin has consequences.
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.640]   Yes, we recognize divine judgment is operating.
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:12.360]   But still, the promise here is that we should pray for the conversion of rulers, because
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:17.560]   it will change life as we know it.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:25.260]   Now what is fascinating about this command is the king at the time was Nero, so the apostle
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:33.120]   Paul is calling on the Christians to pray for the salvation of Nero.
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.180]   Why is that so strange?
[00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:43.020]   Because Nero was as wretched a ruler as would be possible or conceivable.
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:48.500]   He was obviously a Roman pagan of the rankest kind.
[00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:55.240]   He, for example, assassinated his own mother, who was also his lover.
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:11:03.760]   At the age of 15, he married his stepsister, then divorced her, then banished her, then
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:13.260]   had her wrists slit, and then had her suffocated; and in one last act of indignity, he decapitated
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:20.040]   her, the stepsister that once had been his wife.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:25.220]   He married another wife and murdered her by kicking her to death.
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:28.080]   He was pregnant.
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.060]   He slaughtered his nearest and dearest.
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:38.520]   He married again, only the next time he married, he married a castrated man dressed in a bridal
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:46.020]   gown in a full wedding ceremony.
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:51.320]   Nero is a name that is synonymous with degeneracy.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:55.200]   He found satisfaction in tying people up.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.200]   He was a man of the law.

[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.200]   He was a man of the law.

[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.200]   He was a man of the law.

[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.200]   He was a man of the law.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.820]   He was a man of the law.
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.960]   They killed John the Baptist for confronting them.
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:14.440]   They killed Jesus for confronting them.
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:22.820]   And here is the promise at the very commissioning of Paul to take the gospel to kings, that because
[00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:28.560]   of that he's going to suffer much.
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:34.100]   It's in a sense, from a human viewpoint, dangerous to do it because so much power resides in
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.100]   a ruler.
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:41.720]   The prophecy concerning Paul that he would take the message to kings has some interesting
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:45.120]   fulfillment if you'll take just a minute or two with me.
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.080]   Go to Acts 24.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:55.180]   In Acts 24, we find that Paul, now a prisoner, about to be shipped off to Rome where he would
[00:21:55.180 --> 00:22:02.200]   be executed under the authority of Caesar, but for this moment in the 24th chapter of
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.000]   Acts, he is still in the kingdom of God.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:14.420]   He's in the land of Israel, but he is a prisoner, and he is brought before a series of governors.
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:23.060]   The first one, chapter 24, verse 22, is Felix, and Felix had an exact knowledge about the
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:26.780]   way, which was a reference to the Christian gospel.
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:34.900]   Somehow Felix had gotten the word of the message concerning Jesus, His death, His resurrection.
[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:42.960]   So in verse 24, "Some days later, Felix arrived with Drusilla."
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:48.540]   Drusilla was an illegitimate wife, a wife of fornication and adultery who was seduced
[00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:56.020]   by a sorcerer away from her husband to become the wife of Felix.
[00:22:56.020 --> 00:23:04.320]   Felix arrives with this woman, his wife who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul and heard
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:04.800]   him speak about the gospel.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:05.800]   So he was sent for Paul, and he was sent for Felix.
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:05.800]   He was sent for Paul, and he was sent for Felix, and he was sent for Felix.
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:06.800]   And he was sent for Felix, and he was sent for Felix, and he was sent for Felix.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:07.800]   And he was sent for Felix, and he was sent for Felix.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:08.800]   And he was sent for Felix, and he was sent for Felix.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:09.800]   So Felix came and spoke about faith in Christ Jesus.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.800]   So he was sent for Paul, and he was sent for Felix.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:11.800]   So when he came and spoke about faith in Christ Jesus, if you sent for Paul, that's what you
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:12.800]   were going to hear.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.660]   Paul came and spoke about faith in Christ Jesus to Felix.
[00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:22.200]   His message is delineated in verse 25, he was discussing righteousness, self-control,
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.200]   and the judgment to come.
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.880]   Boy, that is a direct hit.
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:31.400]   Paul was talking about righteousness, God's righteous standard.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:36.060]   And then he was talking about self-control, or the issue of sin, the inability of the
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:42.900]   sinner to meet the righteous standard because he cannot overcome his sinfulness.
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:47.900]   And then he spoke about the result of that, the judgment to come.
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:51.200]   Righteousness, self-control, and judgment.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:58.760]   And the result was Felix became terrified and said, "Go away for the present, and when
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.300]   I find time, I'll submit."
[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:03.640]   "I'll summon you."
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.640]   He was terrified.
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:14.360]   He was such a lowlife that at the same time also, verse 26 says, he was hoping that money
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:17.180]   would be given him by Paul.
[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:20.800]   Part of politics, isn't it?
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:24.920]   Bribery, a wretched soul.
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:31.200]   But Paul confronted him with righteousness, sin, and judgment.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:41.580]   He was succeeded in verse 27 by the next governor, Portius Festus, and Paul goes before
[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:44.200]   him.
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.860]   Chapter 25, go down to verse 10.
[00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.760]   Paul is talking to Festus.
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:54.860]   He says, "I'm standing before Caesar's tribunal where I ought to be tried.
[00:24:54.860 --> 00:25:00.060]   I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you also very well know.
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.100]   If then I am a wrongdoer, I will not be able to do anything.
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:04.920]   If I am a wrongdoer and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die.
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:09.600]   But if none of those things is true of which these men accuse me - " the Jews were accusing
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:14.300]   him of crimes against Rome " - then no one can hand me over to them.
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:15.580]   I appeal to Caesar.
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:16.580]   I'm a Roman citizen."
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:23.200]   Then when Festus had conferred with his council, he answered, "You have appealed to Caesar.
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:28.260]   To Caesar you shall go."
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:31.000]   No doubt in the conversation with Festus.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:39.580]   Paul had another opportunity to delineate his story and even his conversion.
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:44.460]   The next ruler that he faces in chapter 26 is a man named Agrippa.
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:47.860]   Go down to verse 19.
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:53.320]   Paul is brought before this man who has the power of life and death over him if he chooses
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.940]   to exercise it.
[00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:59.740]   "So, King Agrippa, I did not prove disobedient to the heavenly vision," - he's given his
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:00.900]   testimony.
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:01.900]   "To Agrippa."
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:06.220]   He described the Damascus Road experience in the previous verses.
[00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:13.060]   "But I kept declaring both to those of Damascus first and also at Jerusalem, and then throughout
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:19.960]   all the region of Judea, and even to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, performing
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.780]   deeds appropriate to repentance."
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:29.200]   He tells Agrippa, "I've just been continually preaching the gospel of repentance and salvation
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.800]   in Christ."
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:41.520]   "For this reason, some Jews seized me in the temple and tried to put me to death."
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:47.880]   Verse 24, while Paul was saying this in his defense, Festus said in a loud voice, "Paul,
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:51.120]   you're out of your mind.
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.360]   Your great learning is driving you mad."
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:58.800]   But Paul said, "I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus.

[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.800]   I am out of my mind, most excellent Festus.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:52.800]   I am out of my mind, most excellent Festus.

[00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:57.800]   I am out of my mind, most excellent Festus.
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:58.800]   I am out of my mind, most excellent Festus.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:39:59.800]   I am out of my mind, most excellent Festus.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:00.800]   I am out of my mind, most excellent Festus.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:06.240]   In the fourth century, another famous pastor from Alexandria named Athanasius boldly defended
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:08.660]   the doctrine of Christ's deity.
[00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:16.140]   He was banished by the Roman powers for at least 17 years, but he refused to be intimidated
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:20.620]   or to compromise because of governmental pressure.
[00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:26.160]   In the fifth century, the golden-mouthed John Chrysostom, the great preacher of Constantinople,
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:30.700]   confronted the empress for her worldly sinful lifestyle.
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:36.420]   He was banished and on his way to exile, died.
[00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:41.820]   If you come up to Reformation times, you have people like Peter Waldo, John Wycliffe, and
[00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:50.100]   Jan Hus who all denounced corrupt authorities and were willing to pay with their lives.
[00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:55.280]   In 1521, Martin Luther took his stand, telling Emperor Charles V, the most powerful man in
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:00.600]   Europe, that he must repent, and that Luther would never recant.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:01.600]   "Prepare for the death of the world, and the death of the world, and the death of the
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:02.600]   world, and the death of the world, and the death of the world, and the death of the world."
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.900]   He repented, because to do so would be to go against the Word of God, which Luther would
[00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:05.900]   never do.
[00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:10.260]   As a result, Luther was declared a notorious heretic and would have been executed if they
[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:12.600]   could find him.
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:19.300]   1529, at the Diet of Speyer, a group of evangelical princes within the Holy Roman Empire wrote
[00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:26.300]   a letter of protestation in response to the emperor's attempts to outlaw the Reformation.
[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:30.500]   And because of that, they became known as Protestants.
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:35.680]   In the 1530s and '40s, the English preacher Hugh Latimer would preach before the King
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:38.740]   of England, Henry VIII, no less.
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:43.260]   On one occasion, he preached a sermon that enraged Henry with its boldness.
[00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:49.520]   The next week, Henry warned Latimer to be careful what he said, since the power of the
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:52.920]   man's life was in the hands of the king.
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:56.680]   Latimer's response was to preach with more boldness.
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:42:00.400]   In 1550, a group of Protestants.
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:07.760]   Magdeburg wrote a confession in response to the efforts of Charles V to wipe out Protestantism
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:13.480]   everywhere, and they acknowledged that they would do what is right no matter what hostility
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.680]   the government brought against them.
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:23.080]   Famously, in 1563, John Knox, the great Scottish reformer, confronted the Catholic queen of
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:30.300]   Scotland about her unbiblical marriage, and he was so powerful that she began to cry.
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:40.160]   In 1603, a thousand Puritan leaders wrote a letter to King James I, calling him to reform
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:41.240]   the Church of England.
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:47.000]   He ignored the petition and continued to persecute the Puritans.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.520]   And then in 1638, Scottish believers signed a national covenant resisting the efforts
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:55.680]   of King Charles to interfere with the church and with true worship.
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.200]   And so it's gone through history.

[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:02.160]   You can start with John the Apostle.
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:12.500]   There was another monumental conversion of someone in authority, and here is his testimony,
[01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:18.340]   1 Timothy 1:12.
[01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:21.580]   This is Paul the Apostle.
[01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:28.200]   "I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me.
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:32.580]   Because He considered me faithful, putting me into service.
[01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:39.700]   Even though I was formerly a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and a violent aggressor, yet
[01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:43.660]   I was shown mercy, because I acted ignorantly in unbelief.
[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:49.900]   And the grace of our Lord was more than abundant with the faith and love which are found in
[01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:54.040]   Christ Jesus."
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:58.200]   It is a trustworthy statement deserving full acceptance that Christ Jesus came in.
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:02.480]   "For I am a believer, and I will go forth into the world to save sinners, among whom
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:07.480]   I am foremost of all."
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:11.020]   Forget Nebuchadnezzar.
[01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:12.900]   Forget Manasseh.
[01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:16.560]   I'm the worst.
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:19.000]   I had authority.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.840]   I had authority to imprison, to slaughter Christians.
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:27.120]   I was a persecutor.
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:28.200]   I was a villain.
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:29.960]   I was a violent aggressor.
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:35.500]   I was a blasphemer.
[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:39.880]   No way could I be in the kingdom except that God showed me mercy.
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:45.640]   The grace of our Lord was more than abundant with the faith and love found in Christ Jesus.
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:49.780]   And it is a trustworthy statement deserving full acceptance that Christ Jesus came into
[01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:53.520]   the world to save sinners, among whom I am foremost of all.
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:57.020]   Yet for this reason I found mercy.
[01:05:57.020 --> 01:05:58.200]   Not so much for my sake.
[01:05:58.200 --> 01:05:59.200]   Not so much for the sake of the world.
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:06.820]   But so that in me as the foremost sinner, Jesus Christ might demonstrate His perfect
[01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:11.440]   patience as an example for those who would believe in Him for eternal life.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:12.440]   What's Paul saying?
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:18.300]   "You're never too far, because Jesus will save those who are the worst of sinners to
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:24.960]   demonstrate His perfect patience and grace with even the worst."
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:28.200]   And Paul concludes with this.
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:33.100]   The doxology, "Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory
[01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:36.100]   forever and ever.
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:39.560]   Amen."
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:45.700]   And as I said when we started, prayers of Stephen may have been part of what God used
[01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:49.480]   to save Paul.
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:55.820]   He is a man of authority, a man with power over life and death, a man representing government
[01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:58.200]   power.
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:59.200]   He was a man of grace.
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.200]   He was a man of grace.
[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:10.960]   And he was a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent aggressor and an unbeliever.
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:13.920]   And the Lord saved him.
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:14.920]   Why does He do that?
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:18.100]   Why does He save such wretched people?
[01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:22.800]   Because that's how He demonstrates His grace, right?
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:26.360]   You're never beyond that possibility.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.200]   And so that's why in chapter 2.
[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:34.660]   He says, "Pray, pray.
[01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:41.960]   Pray for kings and all who are in authority, that they may be saved."
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:46.020]   That's part of our ministry.
[01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:47.020]   Let's pray together.
[01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:56.520]   Father, we thank You again for, as we always do, the truth of Your precious Word.
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:58.200]   The message comes out at the end.
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:05.940]   As it always does, that salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone.
[01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:09.480]   No one is going to be saved by works.
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:15.600]   You're saved by grace through faith.
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:17.520]   Works isn't going to get you anywhere.
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:27.080]   But the good news is that even the worst of sinners is not beyond divine grace.
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:28.200]   They have to hear.
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:29.960]   They have to hear.
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:31.860]   And we need to continue to pray.
[01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:38.240]   So, Lord, may we be faithful to pray for those in leadership, pray for those in authority,
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:43.980]   as well as take every opportunity to proclaim the gospel to them and to all others.
[01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:47.740]   Let them know that the ransom has been paid by Christ, if they'll repent and put their
[01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:50.160]   trust in Him.
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:52.900]   This is our mission in the world.
[01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:58.200]   May the church be faithfully focused on it, we pray for Your glory.
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:58.700]   Amen.
