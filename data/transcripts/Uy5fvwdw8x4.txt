[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   you know, it might take, you know, years or decades to become, you know, an expert, like,
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.160]   in a whole field, you know, and you might be very far from that, but it really doesn't take that
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:21.040]   long to become the world expert on one particular tiny little problem, right? And, you know, so,
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.200]   so try to, you know, become the world expert on, on something, you know, you know, even something
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:37.280]   very, very narrow. So, Professor Aronson, can you tell us a bit about your early journey? You were
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.760]   a young prodigy, you graduated high school at the age of 15, got your PhD at 22. Can you tell us
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.600]   about that? Yeah, well, I didn't really graduate high school when I was 15. I got a GED from, from,
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:59.200]   from New York State. But I, I was not happy in, in high school for, for several reasons. I mean,
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:11.120]   just socially, academically, and I, I wanted to get out. And I mean, I, I had a, I was in a weird
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:22.320]   situation, because my, I went to public school in the US for, for, for, for junior high, and then
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.400]   in Pennsylvania, actually, and then my parents moved to Hong, I lived in Hong Kong for one year,
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:39.040]   because my, my, my dad was working there. And because of the, I went to an American international
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.520]   school there, but because of a mismatch between the way they fit, they did things in the US and
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:54.080]   in Hong Kong, you know, I was not able to do math, that was, that was appropriate, I guess, I, I,
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.520]   you know, I had always been sort of ahead in math. And the only way to deal with that was for me to
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:07.360]   skip a grade and skip and go to the high school. And once, once, once I had done that, that was,
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.800]   that was sort of a, you know, something flipped for me, right? That, you know, I could actually do
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.840]   this. I could get out of this environment, you know, where I really wanted to be was college,
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:33.680]   right? I wanted to be in a place where, you know, and of course, you know, I somewhat, you know, had
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.200]   an idealistic view of what college was, but, you know, but a place where ideas would matter more
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:47.280]   than popularity and where, you know, you would be able to choose what to study and advance at
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.960]   your own pace and, you know, all of these wonderful things. And, you know, so then I
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:02.400]   returned from Hong Kong to the U.S. and was in a public high school for a year. And, you know,
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.720]   as I said, I didn't like it. And, you know, and then I ran out of math to take, right? I took the
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:21.040]   AP calculus and then the, you know, my parents basically suggested to the school,
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:29.360]   well, why doesn't he just do online learning, right? And do like differential equations or
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.920]   whatever with the, you know, Stanford has this EPGY program, right? Where you can do these things.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.680]   And, you know, my parents said they would pay for it. The school said, no, that's, you know.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:55.120]   And so I sort of seized on that as my excuse. I think I had just seen a brochure for a place
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.200]   called the Clarkson School in upstate New York, which is a part of Clarkson University,
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:09.440]   but you can live there for a year and take college courses, you know, but it's for high school
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:18.640]   students, right? So I said, you know, even knowing very little about this, I think, you know, I want
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:26.160]   to give this a try. And my parents, you know, allowed me to do that. You know, we had the car
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.840]   all, you know, packed up to drive there. And while, you know, when we were about to leave,
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.720]   then finally, you know, there was one, you know, actually math teacher at my old high school,
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.360]   who was very, very good and who was, you know, trying to advocate for me. And he was like, okay,
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:49.120]   guess what, you know, I just got it so that Scott can take the EPGY program. And we said too late,
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:05:00.000]   sorry. And so I went to Clarkson and I, you know, and I generally had a very good experience there.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.600]   I mean, you know, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, socially, there were a lot of the same
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:16.000]   problems as at high school. But, you know, at least, you know, I was, you know, I was able to
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.440]   take courses that were a lot more interesting, I was able to sort of meet professors, get started
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:30.480]   doing research. And, and you apply from, you know, the idea is that after a year at this Clarkson
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.840]   program, then you apply to colleges as a freshman, but you know, but with a year of college credit.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:43.280]   So I, I did that. You know, I was, I was, you know, just very disappointed in the time at the
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.080]   time at how things turned out, because, you know, I got rejected from almost every college that I
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:55.680]   applied to, you know, I had a very weird background. But I was lucky that Cornell and Carnegie Mellon
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:02.960]   were kind enough to accept me. And so I decided to go to Cornell. But then there was one problem
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.840]   that they required a high school diploma before you could enroll there, which I didn't have.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:17.120]   And so, so we need to realize that I needed a GED from, you know, well, okay, my old high school,
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.880]   you know, oftentimes, once old high school will just give you a diploma after you've gone to
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.320]   Clarkson. My high school would not do that, because they said I was missing phys ed, I would have to,
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:34.800]   you know, spend a summer doing phys ed. But so, you know, and then New York State said,
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.320]   we can't give him a GED, because you have to be 17 to have a GED and he's 15.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:48.720]   And my mom eventually convinced them to make an exception and give me a GED. So that, so I,
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.320]   so then I went to Cornell, I mean, I've met other people who were homeschooled, who, you know,
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:59.520]   actually did things that were more radical than, than what I did. I mean, I was accelerated by
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.800]   three years, you know, that was all. And then, after I was in college, I didn't really accelerate
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.800]   anymore. Because, you know, I felt like I was, you know, in an environment, you know, where I
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:17.120]   wanted to be. And, you know, from now on, the sort of the main limitations were internal, they were,
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:23.680]   they were no longer external. Was it intimidating being in classes with people three or four years
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.880]   older than you? The truth is, you know, I would say the majority of them didn't even know that
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:37.600]   I was younger, if they knew it was like in, you know, maybe an oddity a little bit, but then they
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.080]   didn't care that much, right? I mean, because, you know, it's not like I was a 10 year old, right?
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:51.440]   I was, you know, I mean, by the time I started at Cornell, I was 16 by then. And, you know, I
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:08:01.920]   so I feel like academically, it was fine. I mean, you know, the main issue was social, right? I mean,
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:08.400]   you know, and my, my parents said, you know, warned me that, okay, you know, to skip grades
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:14.800]   is going to completely screw up my social life. And, you know, it's going to make dating, you
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:22.400]   know, incredibly difficult, and so on, and so on. And I, I sort of brushed all of that aside,
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:28.800]   you know, and my, my, you know, I mean, you know, of course, that all turned out to be true,
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:39.360]   you know, I got, I got my PhD, before, basically, before I learned how to drive, really, or learned
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:44.080]   how to have any kind of a social life, you know, to speak of, I mean, or, you know, any, any kind
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:51.840]   of a dating life, really. But, you know, I did things in a weird order, you could say, and, and,
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:57.440]   and that did cause, you know, an enormous amount of stress for me. But, but my main argument was
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:04.720]   that, you know, I was already socially unhappy in high school, right? I was, I was already miserable,
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:09.840]   you know, without having skipped grades. And so, I felt like, you know, as long as I'm going to be
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:15.440]   miserable socially, anyway, as it seemed at the time, you know, I would be, you know, at least I
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:21.680]   could be learning stuff, at least, at least the academics could be better. Yeah. And as far as
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:26.240]   the academics go, what were the advantages and disadvantages of specializing so early?
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:33.280]   Well, I mean, I don't get to rerun my life multiple times and, and compare.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:46.400]   But I think that, you know, mainly, I'm, I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to, you know,
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:53.440]   to sort of learn about stuff that, that interested me. And it was not, it was not just, you know,
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:58.560]   that, you know, I wanted to take only math and CS and nothing else, right? It was not like that. I
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:08.640]   mean, I, I took, you know, plenty of humanities in college, right? And, but, you know, I wanted to
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:15.040]   sort of have some, some freedom to, you know, I pick what to, what to learn about, right? I mean,
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:22.560]   like, in, in, in, in high school, you know, humanities means, you know, the five paragraph
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:30.000]   essay, right? It means, you know, you basically have to regurgitate what the teacher wants from
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.440]   you, right? And, you know, if you try to, you know, do your own thing, write things in your
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:41.040]   own way, then you will actually fail, right? And, you know, this is, I, I learned this from
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:48.880]   experience, you know, this is not theoretical, right? And, you know, so even, even, even the
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:54.800]   humanities, right? I was a lot happier with in college than I was in high school. So, so it wasn't
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:02.400]   just a matter of, of specialization, but, but partly it was, I mean, I think that by the age of
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:10.400]   16 or so, I, I knew what, what I was passionate about. It was the fundamentals of computing,
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:17.040]   right? And understanding what computers could or couldn't do. And I was ready to be, to be
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:23.120]   learning about that and working on it. And, you know, I think that there, there is, you know,
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:28.960]   the, the, the entire concept of, you know, of, of sort of teenagerhood, right? That like people are,
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:35.920]   are, you know, from the age of 12 to 18, or now maybe even 20 or so, we're still basically
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:41.520]   children, right? I think that that's largely a modern construction, right? If you go back even
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.760]   a few hundred years, you know, by the time someone is a teenager, right, they're, they're an
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:51.120]   apprentice, right? They can work, you know, you know, they can be learning while they're also,
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.440]   you know, working and they can be, they can be learning, you know, the, the trade that they
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:03.440]   choose. And so, so, so I think that that, that's actually natural, right? I don't feel like I'm
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:08.320]   that unusual in that respect. I think, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, unusual in
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:14.080]   some respects, but, but not in, in, in wanting to sort of get started with life when, you know,
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:20.560]   I was 15 or 16. Yeah. I had Tyler Cowen on the podcast and he started, you wanted to be an
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:25.280]   economics professor basically in his early teens. And he was reading and preparing for that from
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:29.840]   that time on. Economics professor is not what, you know, what often thinks of as like a child,
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:34.640]   you know, or an adolescent realizing that they want, but that is that, that, that, that, for,
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:40.400]   for in the case of Tyler Cowen, I could easily believe that. Is there some special advantage of
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.720]   learning the fundamentals of the field, you know, you're going to go into early on. So instead of,
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.960]   except for the fact that you just get more years to accumulate knowledge, is there the special
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:54.640]   advantage of learning it in your early years? You know, I'm not sure. It's a very interesting
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:59.920]   question. I mean, you know, one could imagine that, you know, while someone's brain is still
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:06.400]   developing, right. That it's good to be exposed to certain things at that age. And, you know,
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:10.640]   I mean, I mean, like we, we, we, we, we know examples that are like this, right. Like,
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:15.200]   you know, an obvious one would be learning languages, right. Where, you know, there,
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:20.320]   there's a window where, you know, children can just soak up languages, you know, like a sponge.
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:26.000]   And, you know, after that window, okay. You know, you can learn a language, but it will be a
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.760]   difficult, you know, intellectual puzzle. And you'll never speak it as well as a, as a,
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:40.160]   as a native five-year-old will speak it. Right. So, so it, it, it could be like that, but it could
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:48.720]   also be that, you know, like our, our, our, our, our, our brains are not really adapted for,
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.600]   for learning any of this stuff. Right. I mean, like, well, you know, when we get to, you know,
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:59.440]   theoretical physics, theoretical computer science and so on. Right. You know, all of it is, is,
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:06.000]   is, is like, you know, learning a language that we don't natively speak. Right. And, and on that,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.360]   on that model, it would just be a question of getting a headstart of, of, you know, of how
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:16.160]   much time you have to spend on it. I would, I would love for someone to research that question
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:21.600]   because I don't know the answer. I have heard. Well, so as you know, like many of the important
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.160]   discoveries in quantum mechanics were made by people who at the time were very young. Right.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.760]   And that's an interesting fact. Not only did I learn that stuff early on, but like they made
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.680]   those contributions early on. Yeah. But, but that's not just quantum mechanics. I mean, that's
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:40.800]   all over, you know, math and physics, right. There are, I mean, I mean, I mean, Newton was,
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:48.800]   you know, about 22, right. When he, you know, had his miracle year of inventing calculus,
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:54.080]   you know, discovering the laws of mechanics. Yeah. I mean, no, I mean, I mean, you know,
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:15:02.080]   I'm already old by the standards of math and physics, right. You know, which is,
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:10.720]   which is weird to think about, but, but, you know, there, there are also many examples of,
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:15.760]   you know, great contributions that were made by people in their forties or fifties or sixties.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:20.960]   Right. So, so, you know, so that, that, that, that's another empirical question that I wonder
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:28.400]   about, right. Is it that people's brains actually slow down as they, as they get older, or is it
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:35.440]   simply that they have less motivation or less free time? Right. I mean, like I, in my case,
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:41.920]   you know, having two kids, you know, get clearly given me enormously less time for research.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:47.120]   Right. And, you know, like in those cases where I'm, you know, traveling where I'm,
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:51.440]   you know, away from the kids for a week, you know, maybe like I can work again and it
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:58.240]   suddenly, you know, it feels a lot like it did when I was in my twenties. Right. And so,
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:06.560]   you know, yeah. And, and, and, and then there's also the, the issue of motivation, right. That
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:13.680]   like when I was before I was established, you know, like my, my entire conception of myself,
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:20.960]   you know, my entire, like goals for my life were wrapped up and, you know, succeeding in research,
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:27.360]   you know, at, at, you know, doing whatever it took. And now, you know, it's more like,
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:33.520]   you know, I, I have all kinds of other concerns. I have my own students to worry about, you know,
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:41.840]   my, my postdocs, my, my, my kids, of course my, my, my blog, you know, the popular things I write
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:47.120]   and, you know, research just feels like one more thing that I do, right. That my, my identity is
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:53.360]   not as much wrapped up in. So, you know, I, I, I may have also gotten dumber, right. That's,
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:58.080]   that's certainly possible. Right. But, you know, it's hard to disentangle from those other factors.
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.600]   Yeah. You're, you're the third person and I promise we'll get to the technical questions
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.280]   eventually, but you're, you're the third person on the podcast. I'm about to ask this question
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:09.440]   because it fascinates me. Miracle years, as you mentioned, it's not just that, you know,
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:13.840]   people make like very important discoveries at young ages, but they make lots of seemingly
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:20.240]   uncorrelated important discoveries at young ages. So as you know, like Einstein did Brownian motion
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.800]   with special relativity, but what was the third one? There were three more.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:30.480]   There was the photoelectric. Yeah, that's right. And these don't seem superficially,
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.400]   at least to be related. And yet it's interesting to happen in the same year.
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:42.320]   What do you think explains that phenomenon? In, in, in, in, in, in the case of Einstein,
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:46.960]   I mean, you know, you're, you're asking me to explain Einstein's miracle year. I mean, that's,
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:51.600]   that's, that's a, that's a, that's a, that's a tall order. I mean, I mean, one, one can,
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:56.720]   one can say certain things like, you know, one can say that, you know, physics in the early 20th
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:03.440]   century was ripe for these, you know, for, for, for these interrelated revolutions, right. Of
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:08.800]   relativity and quantum mechanics, right. You know, I mean, you know, if it, if it wasn't Einstein,
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:13.760]   it would have been someone else, you know, not long after with all of those things,
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:19.760]   general relativity, which, you know, which took Einstein a decade longer, you know, that was the
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:25.360]   one thing where if it hadn't been for Einstein, then, you know, for all we know, it might've been
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:32.560]   decades before anyone else did that. But you know, the, the you know, the stuff that he did in his
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:40.080]   in, in, in 1905, I mean, you know, they were all things that physics was kind of ripe for. Maybe it
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:46.080]   took, you know, one person just looking at things in a sufficiently different way. You know, I'm not,
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:52.720]   I'm not, I'm not sure really, but but, you know, but, but, but also it might be, you know, the
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:58.400]   confluence of all of those things is part of why, you know, we think of Einstein as Einstein,
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.800]   right. You know, there were, there were, there were many other great physicists, you know,
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:07.680]   around the same time, you know, who may have done, you know, one or two things of that caliber,
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:14.880]   right. But, but, you know but, but, but, but, but only, only Einstein does, does three or four of
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:21.520]   them. I'm glad, I'm glad you brought up the topic of like ideas being in the air and ready to plug,
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:25.680]   because this is, this leads me directly to the next question. I was rereading the lecture notes
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:30.240]   from your quantum information science class, and there's the lecture on quantum teleportation,
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:34.320]   and you were answering, how is it, how do people figure this kind of stuff out? And you say,
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.560]   it's worth pointing out that quantum mechanics was discovered in 1926, and that quantum
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:44.560]   teleportation was only discovered in the 90s. And of course, quantum computing, I'm a big fan of
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:51.040]   David Deutch, and he discovered it, or he thought of it in the 80s. It seems like these ideas were
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:56.080]   ready to pluck, you know, back when quantum mechanics was developed. Why did it take so
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:01.040]   long to have these ideas plucked? Yeah, that's a, that's a, that's an extremely interesting question.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:11.040]   I, I mean, you know, the, the, the, the whole idea of, of thinking about quantum entanglement,
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:17.440]   you know, and not as something like metaphysically weird, or, or, you know, a spooky,
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:22.880]   or, or basically, how do we explain this away? How do we get rid of this? But in terms of how
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:30.560]   do we use it, right? How do we use it for, you know, to improve information processing, right?
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:36.640]   I think that, that's, that's a point of view that, as far as I know, really only started with,
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:43.440]   with John Bell in the 1960s, right? With, you know, Bell having this remarkable insight that,
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:48.880]   that, you know, you could, you could, you could do this experiment to test the prediction of
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:55.280]   entanglement and, and distinguish it from any possible theory involving, you know,
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:02.800]   local hidden variables, right? And, you know, and then a little bit later, Stephen Wiesner,
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:10.400]   you know, had the idea of quantum money, right? Or using the uncertainty principle for cryptography,
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:17.200]   although he was, again, he was not able to publish that until the 80s. And, you know,
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:24.480]   there are, there are a few things that I could say here. I mean, one is that when, when quantum
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:31.120]   mechanics was discovered in the, in the 20s, it was not at all clear to the people who,
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:37.680]   who discovered it, that this was sort of a, a final form that the laws of physics would take,
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:43.680]   right? You know, they thought, you know, I mean, that there was a large contingent that, that,
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:50.160]   that thought that, you know, this, this is some, you know, scheme that, that sort of represents
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:56.400]   our current knowledge, but, you know, but clearly one, one, you know, one has to improve on it,
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.800]   right? And then, I mean, that was very much Einstein's point of view, for example, and I
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:08.080]   think also Schrodinger's. And, and then, you know, like Bohr and Heisenberg, you know, they
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:13.840]   were very much, you know, opposed to, to looking for something beyond quantum mechanics, but,
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:23.760]   but, but, but sort of not, you know, they, they like, like, they, they sort of, sort of not,
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:29.600]   not in a way that was sort of, you know, inspiring more research about what you could do with quantum
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:34.800]   mechanics, right? They just wanted everyone to just sort of shut up and stop, stop asking about
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:40.400]   these things, right? So you could say, you know, even though Bohr was right and, and Einstein was
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:46.240]   wrong on the issue of local hidden variables, you know, there's a, there's a deeper sense in which,
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:50.720]   in which, you know, Einstein was the more right one and sort of putting his finger on, you know,
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:56.000]   there is something here that we do not yet understand and that we need to understand,
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.600]   right? And, you know, indeed, you know, that, I'm sorry, you know, indeed, indeed, that, that,
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:08.080]   that, that thing would not be understood really until, until the discovery of the Bell inequality
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:15.840]   in the 60s. The other, you know, issue is that when quantum mechanics was, was discovered into
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:22.480]   the, you know, the, the 30s, you know, there was so much to do in terms of, you know, figuring out
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:28.560]   how chemistry works, right? Just, just applying quantum mechanics to understanding the real world
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:35.520]   around us, right? And, and, and you could say on, on the other side in computer science, you know,
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:41.600]   the, I mean, for God's sakes, the entire notion of a universal computer was just being born,
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:46.400]   right? The whole note, you know, the whole field of classical computing was only just being born,
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:52.160]   right? So there was sort of so much, you know, on the plates of both sides that, that, you know,
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:57.520]   it was, you know, it might've seemed wildly premature to anyone to, to combine the two,
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:04.720]   right? And then of course, World, World War II, you know, intervened with, you know, you know,
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:10.240]   and, and the people who were doing fundamental science, a lot of them went to work, you know,
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:16.720]   either at the Manhattan Project or Bletchley Park. And, you know, and then after that, I mean,
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:24.800]   I think theoretical physicists were very focused on this, you know, this zoo of new particles that
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:30.400]   were being discovered and in formulating quantum field theory, you know, it was very, very much
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:35.760]   out of fashion for, for decades to think about the, you know, the, the fundamentals of quantum
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:43.920]   mechanics itself. And, you know, in the meantime you know, people were, were finally, you know,
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:51.040]   building commercializing, figuring out the uses for classical computers. That was a, you know,
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:58.160]   a very young area itself. And I mean, the, the entire theory of computational complexity,
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:02.800]   which, you know, is sort of an intellectual prerequisite to quantum computing, right? That
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:09.360]   only developed in the 1960s, right? You know, and then the theory of, you know, P and NP and NP
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:16.800]   completeness, that was only the 1970s, right? So now, you know, if we think about, you know,
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:21.760]   the, the people who could have combined these, these fields, I mean, I, I think of, you know,
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:26.480]   I think of John von Neumann as an obvious possibility because he was, you know, of course,
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:35.840]   one of the, the great pioneers of both of computer science and of quantum mechanics, right? In fact,
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:43.840]   you know, he invented the notion of entropy of quantum states and, but, you know, he just, he
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:49.840]   had a lot of other things on his plate and then he died early. He died in the fifties, right? I mean,
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:56.080]   you know, Alan Turing was also, you know, of course, you know, founder of computer science,
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:01.840]   who was also passionately interested in the foundations of quantum mechanics. You know,
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:08.960]   as we know from his, his letters to his friends, you know, he, he, he died when he was 42, right?
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:16.800]   So, so, you know, whatever the case, you know, I feel like quantum mechanics and the theory of
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:23.360]   computing were both in place by the 1930s, but there was a lot of other stuff on people's plates
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:29.600]   and, you know, the, the, the idea of, you know, thinking of entanglement as a resource that only
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:35.520]   starts in the sixties, computational complexity that only starts in the sixties and seventies.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.920]   And then, you know, maybe a decade after that, people start thinking about quantum computation.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.080]   Interesting. I've heard two other theories and I want to see how, what you think of them. So
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:48.720]   the first one is, I think I might be misquoting him, but I think at some point David Deutsch said
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:52.320]   the reason he was able to think seriously about quantum computing was that he took
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.840]   the many worlds interpretation seriously. And because people before him hadn't taken many
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:00.560]   words seriously, they hadn't been able to go to quantum computing. Sorry, go ahead.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:04.560]   Go on, go on. Okay. Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe should I respond to that one? Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:12.000]   Okay. So, so that is definitely true for Deutsch, right? And I know, you know, Deutsch well,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.760]   you know, and then, you know, and he actually, you know, became a big believer in the many worlds
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:24.000]   interpretation when he was here at UT Austin as a student, as you know, and he, he heard Hugh
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:32.080]   Everett himself give a lecture about it. Bryce DeWitt, who was, you know, one of the main early
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:38.080]   proponents of the many worlds interpretation was also here at UT Austin and had a big role,
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:45.520]   had a big influence on Deutsch. And, you know, and Deutsch was, was thinking about, you know,
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:50.240]   how would you sort of make, you know, sort of shake people? How would you sort of make them
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:56.400]   realize that quantum mechanics is universally valid, that it applies at all scales? Well,
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:01.680]   you know, if you could build a computer, right, that, you know, could do a superposition over
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:06.640]   different computations, and then you could see the results of interference between them, right?
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:11.920]   That at that point, conceptually, it is almost like making a superposition over, you know,
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:17.680]   a brain that can think different thoughts, right? And, and then, you know, if you could have that,
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:23.600]   then, then, you know, the whole idea of that, that observers collapse, the wave function,
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:30.160]   that by being observers is no longer tenable. But so one, one problem is that Richard Feynman had
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:36.080]   the idea of quantum computing around the same time as Deutsch did, right? And Feynman, I mean,
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:40.960]   he was certainly aware of the many worlds interpretation, he was aware of Everett,
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:47.360]   but that was not his motivation for thinking about quantum computing. He was, you know, as,
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:55.760]   as usual, he was much more practically focused, he was thinking about how do we simulate physics,
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:00.880]   you know, how do we simulate nature with a computer? And if we use classical computers,
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:07.440]   we suffer this exponential slowdown, right? And so can we build a new kind of computer that will,
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:15.280]   that will solve that problem and give us a, a universal quantum simulator? You know, people
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:23.360]   were, there was also a whole movement in the 70s and 80s to think about the physics of computation,
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:30.480]   including like the thermodynamics of computation, can you make computation inherently reversible,
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:34.800]   you know, and, and all kinds of other issues, right, that are, that are, that are not about,
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:40.320]   you know, exponential speed ups. But that was also one of the intellectual streams that sort
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:45.680]   of led directly to, to quantum computation, right? So, so I think that what, what you said is very
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:50.480]   much true for Deutsch, but, you know, there were others, you know, besides Deutsch who were thinking
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:54.800]   about these things, Feynman was only one, there were, there were others as well, I think, you know,
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:30:02.800]   Benioff, you know, several others, and, you know, and, you know, few, few people in this field are
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:14.880]   as, are as, as, as, as messianic as Deutsch is about the many worlds interpretation.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:20.480]   It's interesting that, come to think of it, that both Deutsch and Turing were trying to solve a
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:25.920]   separate philosophical problem when they came up with their model of computation, at least in part.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:31.680]   Okay, so the second theory I've heard is that since the 1970s, that academia has been less
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:36.880]   open to new ideas. And you mentioned Wiesner, Everett, and both of them, I understand, were kind
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:43.760]   of, I don't know, looked down, ostracized or something. Is there, is, has that, is that theory
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:52.000]   confirmed? I think, I mean, it is possible that in some parts of academia, you know, it has become
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:31:00.560]   harder to explore new ideas, you know, than it, than it, than it once was. You know, I could
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:06.160]   believe that about the social sciences, I could believe that, you know, about parts of medicine,
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:11.760]   you know, people used to do just completely crazy things, just, you know, invent some new concoction,
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:16.880]   inject themselves with it, you know, see what happens, you know, write an article about it,
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:21.680]   you know, whereas today, you know, it might take like a billion dollars of investment before you
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:26.640]   could even get to the point where, you know, anyone would consider it remotely ethical to
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:41.600]   do such a thing, right? So, on the other hand, in, in physics, and let's say, you know, you know,
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:51.040]   speculation about, you know, the, you know, foundations of computing and, and, and, and,
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:57.360]   and, and, and, and cosmology and things like that, I think, if anything, things have gone in the
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:03.520]   opposite direction. And, you know, and this is partly because we now have this pre-print server,
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:09.760]   this archive, where, you know, everyone can post, you know, all of their new
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:15.840]   research ideas, you know, with no filter, right? You know, and, and, and I think that that is,
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:25.520]   that is somewhat transformed the, the scientific landscape, you know, because, I mean, we still
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:31.040]   have journals, but, you know, journals are now just like a final stamp of approval that, you
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:35.840]   know, in many fields is, yeah, I mean, it's important when you're looking for jobs or things
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:42.400]   like that, but journals are no longer gatekeepers to, you know, that can sort of prevent people from
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:51.040]   seeing your paper, right? And so, so, you know, if you just look at the quantum physics, you know,
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:59.840]   archive every day, you will see so many far-out ideas, right? It is so much crazy stuff that it's,
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:06.000]   you know, it's very hard to believe that, that a modern day Wiesner or Everett, you know,
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.240]   would feel any barrier to, you know, to getting their, their idea out there, right? I mean,
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:19.200]   today, the, the problem is more that, like, there are so many, you know, bold new ideas that,
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:24.000]   you know, of course, you know, most of them won't go anywhere, right? Most of them will fail,
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.240]   right? And, you know, and so there's, there's so much to sift through if you're, you know,
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.760]   looking for what is, what is, what is actually going to be revolutionary.
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:38.000]   I'm sure your comments section and email fills up with these, but have you, how many of the
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.560]   important ideas or do many important ideas in the field come from people outside academia? Or is it
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:47.520]   mostly the people with PhDs working within the system? Well, okay. I mean, I mean, those are,
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:55.520]   those are not exhaustive categories, right? Because, you know, there, there are, you know,
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:34:01.760]   there, there, there, there have been breakthroughs that have come from people who were not in
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:09.120]   academia. Very often, what you find is that these are people who were sort of on the margin of
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:15.440]   academia, like they got a PhD and then they left, you know, the, the academic world, or they,
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:21.600]   they did part of a PhD or, or, or, or things like that, right? There was a
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:28.400]   famous case of Yitang Zhang, who was this mathematician from, from China, right? Who
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:36.000]   proved that, that there are infinitely many pairs of primes at most 70 million apart,
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   right? Which was, you know, a, a major advance in number theory, right? And this was a guy who
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.920]   would like, he had gotten a PhD in math in China, I think, but then moved to the U.S. and then
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:55.120]   worked making, making sandwiches in public, you know, just, you know, in order to like support
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:35:01.520]   his family and, and, you know, work various other odd jobs, but, you know, but, but, but continued
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:10.480]   working on math. So I don't, you know, I mean, I mean, you know, I, I, I hear all the time from,
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:16.720]   you know, people who are, who are like complete autodidacts, you know, who, you know, taught
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:21.360]   themselves the S and, and, you know, that they think that they've solved the P versus NP problem
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:30.960]   or whatever, right? I, I've, you know, that, that is, you know, that, that, that is usually someone
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:39.680]   who just doesn't understand the question, who was just made some, you know, you know, and, and,
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:44.720]   and, and, and then, you know, I mean, there, there is a distinction because some, sometimes people,
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:50.080]   you know, who sort of teach themselves the field, they just, you know, they, they really want to
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:55.280]   learn. They just want an expert to talk to, you know, who will tell them like, here's, here's
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:36:00.240]   where you're on the right track. Here's where, you know, you, you made a mistake and they will
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:04.640]   thank you for that, right? Other times you get people who really dig in their heels and, you
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:11.200]   know, you know, the establishment is, is censoring me. And, you know, I had, when, when, when I taught
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:17.920]   at MIT, I had, you know, someone like writing to the president of MIT to try to get me fired.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:24.960]   You know, I had another one sending me death threats, you know, because, you know,
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:30.000]   like very, very specific, you know, I had to actually contact the police about them,
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:37.200]   you know, because I would not publish their, you know, proof of P equals NP or their refutation
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:42.640]   of quantum computing on my blog, right? So you get, you get, you get, you get the whole spectrum.
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:50.560]   But, you know, the, the, the, the other thing you, you find is, you know, there are, you know,
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:57.120]   and, and, and a lot of the readership of my blog comes from people who, who studied technical
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:04.320]   subjects in college, studied CS or math or physics, and then went out into industry, right?
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:09.680]   But maintain this connection, you know, maintain their sort of curiosity about fundamental
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:16.320]   questions. And some of those people, you know, actually want to continue to do research.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:22.560]   And I'm actually co-authoring a paper with one of them right now. You know, I posted this survey
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:29.360]   article about the busy beaver function on my blog recently. And, you know, there was a,
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:39.120]   you know, I guess a, a hobbyist who, who solved some of the open problems, a survey and yeah,
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:43.520]   and, and had a lot of new ideas and he and I are going to write a paper about it now.
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:48.000]   Oh, cool. Interesting. By the way, is that Chong the same one that co-authored the Nielsen textbook
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.280]   on quantum information? No, no, no, no, no. There's a Yitong Zhang and then there's
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:38:00.560]   the mathematician and then Isaac Chuang is the physicist who co-authored the Nielsen Chuang.
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:04.320]   Okay, got it. My mistake. So let me ask you about busy beaver. I was,
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:13.760]   is the proposition three was that you can't... I have no memory for the numbering of propositions.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:17.680]   Okay. Can you actually just explain what the busy beaver function is before I ask?
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:22.880]   Yes. Okay, sure. So, so the busy beaver function is a really, really remarkable
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:32.560]   sequence of, of hyper rapidly growing integers. And the way that we, we define it, you know,
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:40.880]   it was, it was, it was invented in 1962 by a mathematician named Tibor Rado. And, and, and,
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:47.680]   and basically what we do is what we, what, what, what we would like to say, let me, let me start
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:54.400]   with what we'd like to say. We'd like to say, you know, the you know, if I want to name the biggest
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:39:00.560]   number that I could possibly think to define, then why not just say, you know, the biggest number
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:07.040]   that can be named using a thousand words or fewer, okay. Or something like that. Right. And, but then
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:12.800]   I have to be careful because there's an inherent paradox there, right. Which is, I also could have
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:19.040]   said like one plus the biggest number that can be named with a thousand words or fewer, but then
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:27.920]   that, that, you know, I just named that with fewer than a thousand words. Right. And so, so, so, so
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:34.960]   from this, you know, the, the, the conclusion that you know, logicians, philosophers drew more than
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:40.800]   a hundred years ago is that the concept of naming a number, you know, in English is not as clear as
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:47.440]   we think it is, right. It, it, it leads to paradox if you're, if you're not careful about it. But,
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:54.320]   but, but, but what, what, what if we could name a number in a way that was completely unambiguous?
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:40:00.240]   Well, you know, since then, since Alan Turing in the 1930s, we've had such a way,
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:05.280]   that way is computer programs, right. We're, we're Turing machines. And so we could say,
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:14.720]   think of the largest integer that can be generated by a computer program that is at most, let's say
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:21.520]   a thousand bits in length. Okay. And, you know, now you have to be careful. What do you mean by,
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:26.400]   by that? Right. Because of course a computer program could run forever, right. It could start
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:33.440]   to, it, you know, I could, we could easily write a program that says do print not print nine loop,
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:39.600]   right. And then we just print an infinite sequence of nines. So what we do is we restrict attention
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:47.360]   to those computer programs that eventually halt, right. We say among, let's say for a given n,
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:52.880]   we consider all of the possible computer programs that are n bits long and say there are two to the
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:41:01.360]   n power of them or at most two to the n power, right. Many strings will just lead to things
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:05.680]   that are not even programs, you know, they won't even compile. So we'll, we'll throw those away,
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:12.400]   right. Now, among all of the valid n bit programs, some of them run forever. We just run them on a
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:18.000]   blank input that we throw those away as well. Right. We consider only the ones that eventually
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:25.040]   stop. And now among all of the ones that stop, we take the one that runs for the longest number
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:30.880]   of steps, the largest number of steps until it stops. And that number of steps, that is what
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:40.160]   we call the nth busy beaver number. So the way that Rado defined this was using Turing machine,
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:46.960]   which is just one particular programming language, the one invented by Alan Turing in the 1930s.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:54.560]   He said busy beaver of n is the largest finite number of steps that any n state Turing machine
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:42:04.400]   can run for. Right. And so, you know, the amazing thing is that one can prove that this function
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:14.160]   grows faster than any computable function. Right. So, you know, no matter what, you know,
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:22.480]   sequence of integers, you know, you can, you know, basically if you are in a contest to name,
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:29.120]   name the largest number, and if you say busy beaver of 1,000, then you will utterly destroy
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:35.120]   any opponent who doesn't know about the busy beaver function or about anything similar to it.
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:42.880]   Okay. So, you know, so one can say further remarkable things about this function,
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:49.680]   like that, you know, only a finite number of values of the function can actually be proven
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:55.200]   from the axioms of set theory, right. For reasons of Gerdl's incompleteness theorem,
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:43:01.120]   basically, after a certain finite point, you know, the values of this function, you know,
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:07.440]   we can, well, you know, presumably it has definite values, right, because it's a clearly defined
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:13.680]   function, and yet we could no longer prove what they are. Okay. So right now, only, you know,
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:18.960]   if you look, if you take the busy beaver function as Rado defined it in the 60s,
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:26.320]   only four values of the function are known. Okay. The busy beaver of 1 is 1, busy beaver of 2 is 6,
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:35.440]   busy beaver of 3 is 21, and busy beaver of 4 is 107. Busy beaver of 5, it is only known that it's
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:42.160]   at least 47 million. Okay. You know, we don't know how much bigger it might be. Busy beaver of 6,
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:50.480]   it's at least, I think, about 10 to the 36,000. Okay. Might be much bigger. Busy beaver of 7,
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:56.640]   it's at least 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 18 million, you know, and might be
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:44:02.880]   enormously larger still. Okay. Just to give people an idea of how this function grows.
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:08.000]   Yeah. Yeah. And by the way, I recommend everybody who's listening to check out the busy beaver
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.080]   frontier paper, because it was written in such a way that I also want to ask you how you learned
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:16.400]   to write so well. It was there in such a way that non-experts like me could understand it. And just
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:23.200]   to clarify for my own understanding, it's not that busy, there isn't a function that for any n is
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:29.360]   greater than busy beaver of n, it's just that it won't, busy beaver will eventually, with more
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:35.200]   states than, if you have a function it will grow back bigger. That's exactly what I meant when I
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:41.200]   said grows faster than. Right. Right. I mean, each particular value of busy beaver is just some
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:48.720]   positive integer, right? Yeah. It's very concrete thing, right? You know, like it's six or it's 21,
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:53.920]   right? But, you know, if you look at the rate of growth of these integers, right, it will dominate,
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:45:00.400]   eventually dominate any computable function. Right. And in practice, not just eventually,
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:04.640]   but very, very quickly. Yeah. And you show very elegantly in the paper that that means you can
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:09.440]   independently prove the halting problem and Godel's incompleteness theorem. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:17.280]   I'm looking at, I mean, I mean, I mean like the, the, the unsolvability of the halting problem,
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:21.920]   Godel's theorem, like these things are so intertwined that like there are many, many
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:26.480]   different ways, you know, ways to prove them all. Right. But the, the busy beaver function gives you
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:32.640]   one way that, yeah, you can prove that, you know, that you can, you can use it to prove independently
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:37.840]   that there is an uncomputable function. You can use it to prove Godel's incompleteness theorem.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:43.920]   Right. Okay. So my question, the proposition three was the one that said for any axiomatic
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:52.160]   theory, you can't approve all of busy beaver with it. Right. So my question was, can you keep,
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:58.320]   even though there's no systematic way to extend our set theory, is there plausibly a way that
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:02.880]   you can keep extending it such that you can prove higher and higher values of busy beaver?
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:11.600]   That's a, that's a, that's a wonderful question. You know, we, we, I, I would say we, we,
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:16.880]   we don't really know yet. Right. Because right now we can't even pin down busy beaver of five.
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:23.280]   Okay. I, you know, now, now my, my guess would be that the, the, the, the resources of,
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:28.800]   you know, existing set theory are, are, are perfectly enough to do that. Right. But,
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:36.480]   but, you know, we don't even know that. Right. So I, so four years ago a, a, a student of mine
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:43.120]   named Adam Yedidia and I decided to, you know, look into a question that for some reason,
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:50.560]   no one had looked at before, which was, you know, at like, what is the smallest n for which we can
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:57.200]   actually prove that the value of busy beaver of n is independent of set theory. Right. Like it was
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:02.480]   clear that there is some n for which this is true, but are we talking about 10 million or are we
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:11.520]   talking about 10? Right. So so, so in practice, what this problem boils down to, it is almost
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:19.280]   like software engineering. Like you have to construct a Turing machine that checks all of the
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:26.480]   theorems of set theory and that halts only if it finds a contradiction. Right. And you have to
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:32.000]   build such a Turing machine with as few states as possible. Okay. You can build such a machine
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:39.360]   with only n states, then you've proven that the, that set theory cannot determine the value of
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:44.640]   busy beaver of n, because if it did, then it would thereby determine its own consistency,
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:52.080]   which is exactly what Godel's theorem does not allow. Right. So so what we managed to do is we
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:58.800]   managed to find such a machine with 8,000 states. Okay. About 8,000 states, you know, that was after
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:05.120]   a lot of optimization, right. And, you know, a lot of coding and, and, and, and, and engineering and,
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:13.120]   and, and, and ideas, right. Since then, a, again, a, a, a hobbyist to come back to your earlier
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:20.080]   question. So I went outside of academia by the name of Stefan O'Rear has managed to improve our
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:27.040]   bound and got it to under 800 states. Yeah. Okay. And that, that is the current record.
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:32.640]   Now, if you could get that down to like, you know, you know, I, you know, it, it is a wonderful
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:37.280]   question. Could you get it down to like 10 states or something like that? Right. And, you know,
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:43.200]   that, that would tell us that we have to already go beyond the current axioms of set theory,
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:48.960]   you know, even to just get the next few values of the busy beaver function. Right. But maybe not,
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:54.160]   maybe, maybe, maybe you can even get a hundred of them with, with, with existing set theory,
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:49:01.440]   right. We, we, we don't know now what you can do is, you know, you know, at, at, at, at whatever
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:10.400]   point, you know, the F set Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, you know, which is the accepted basis for,
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:15.440]   for, you know, most of math at whatever point it runs out of steam, you know, we don't know
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:21.200]   exactly where that point is, but one could then extend it by what are called large cardinal
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:26.960]   axioms, right. Which basically assert that there exists an infinity that is bigger than any
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:32.000]   infinity that can be defined in ZF set theory, right. Or, you know, you can, you can say,
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:38.480]   you know, you know, you know, or infinities of various particular kinds, right. And,
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:45.360]   you know, and, and, and, and presumably one could then settle more values of the busy beaver
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:50.400]   function that way, right. But, but the issue is, you know, no matter what set theory you think of,
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:56.080]   right, as soon as you can build a Turing machine that enumerates all of the theorems of that set
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:50:02.320]   theory, then however many states there are in that Turing machine, that then sets a bound on
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:08.160]   how many busy beaver numbers that, that theory can ever determine, right. So, so in some sense,
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:14.160]   the set theories that can determine more and more busy beaver numbers will have to become more and
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:22.640]   more complicated, right. Right. Right. We, we, we, we, we, we know that. And, and, and, and as you
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:27.920]   said, right, there will never be a systematic way to search for it for them, because if there were,
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:34.000]   then that would make the busy beaver function computable. And, you know, and, and, and what it
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:39.680]   means for there to be no systematic way to search is that, you know, you could, we could keep like
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:45.760]   proposing more and more set theories. And if you look at modern, you know, mathematical logic,
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:52.080]   set theorists do this, right. They do propose more and more large cardinal axioms, but sometimes they
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:57.760]   actually discover that their axioms are inconsistent, right. Or, you know, they, they sort
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:05.120]   of provisionally, you know, adopt an axiom or use it, but the community is not really convinced
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:11.280]   that, that it won't lead to an inconsistency, right. So that, you know, there's no surefire way
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:18.240]   to think of these axioms and, and be confident that, that, that, you know, that, that, that,
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:23.040]   that you actually still have a consistent system. Hmm. Okay. Let me offer a very,
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:28.720]   very solid thought experiment. Okay. So this is inspired by that joke that if you shoot enough
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:34.720]   sunlight at the earth, it'll shoot, it'll shoot a Tesla back. Right. Okay. So the idea is if the
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:39.120]   Turing principle is true, you can simulate the earth and the solar system and everything on a
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:44.720]   very incomprehensibly big computer, right. And with all the humans on it. Given, given, given,
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:52.400]   given the appropriate initial data. Yeah. Yeah. And so simulating all of that is a computable
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:56.560]   function. And if you can check in like every a hundred years and see what is the biggest busy
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:52:00.400]   beaver number that humans have proven this century, what is the biggest busy year number
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:04.880]   approved a hundred centuries? Is that not a computable function where that tells you busy
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:12.240]   beaver of N indefinitely higher as long as. Well, well, it would give you a way to compute
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:19.200]   arbitrary values of the busy beaver function. If humans were indeed to, to continue you know,
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:29.040]   you could say under the assumptions that number one, you know, the you know everything in our
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:34.640]   physical world is computable. I mean, you know, we, we, we, we let that you and I just let that
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:39.520]   assumption pass almost without comment. Right. Although, you know, of course that's an enormous
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:44.960]   question in itself, right. With some brilliant people like, like Penrose on the, on the other
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:50.080]   side of that, but all right. But, but, you know, and then just so assuming that, that, you know
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:56.960]   everything we're doing is computable and also assuming that we could somehow, you know,
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:02.960]   continue finding more and more values of the busy beaver function indefinitely. Right. If that were
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:10.880]   true, then we would have a contradiction. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So then either everything is either
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:14.000]   the Turing principle is false or we can't indefinitely keep extending. Yeah. Yeah. You
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.800]   can. Yeah. You, you could say a very conservative way out would be to say, well, you know,
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:24.000]   our quest to compute more and more busy beaver numbers will come to an end. Right. Okay. That's
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:29.040]   very interesting. Yeah. And in fact, there, there has not been a, another busy beaver number
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:35.200]   determined since the early 1980s. Yeah. That's interesting. Which is when busy beaver four was
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:40.880]   in there. Okay. Okay. So I'm looking forward to the paper you published with the, with the hobbyists.
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:47.680]   Bruce Smith is his name. Bruce Smith. Okay. Very interesting. Okay. So let me ask you now,
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:55.520]   I remember in class last year, you said, you know, basically we have a very, a few,
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:59.440]   very important quantum algorithms like Grover's and Shor's that were discovered in the nineties.
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:03.520]   And now a lot of stuff now is just an extension of those algorithms. What do you think is the
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:07.840]   potential of finding, is there a good reason to think that there are other quantum algorithms
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:11.680]   to be discovered that are as fundamental and important as Grover's and Shor's were?
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:18.320]   I would, I would love it if there were, right. I I'd be, I'd be thrilled to, you know,
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:23.440]   discover such an algorithm, have one of my students discover it. Right. You know, this is,
[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:29.680]   this is you know, I, you know, I mean, I mean, that's, that's the kind of discovery that we,
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:36.080]   that we enter this field for. Right. I mean, you know, now, now, you know, if, if, if we're, we,
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:41.760]   we're being intellectually honest, you know, we have to admit that, you know, it's, it's been 25
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:49.120]   years since Grover's algorithm was discovered. Right. And you know, you know, maybe, maybe no
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:54.720]   other quantum algorithm as fundamental as Shor's or Grover's has been discovered, you know, in the
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:55:04.720]   last 25 years. What we have discovered, you know, as you, as you learned, cause you took my class,
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:12.240]   was, you know, a lot of, you know, an enormous number of generalizations and new applications
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:18.880]   and variations of, of Shor's and Grover's algorithms, you know, including what are
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:25.920]   called quantum walk algorithms including you know, phase estimation based algorithms.
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:34.240]   And you know, and, and, and some, some totally different quantum algorithms were also discovered,
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:38.880]   although, you know, the problems they solve are maybe more abstruse, right. Or, you know,
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:44.320]   hard, you know, it's harder to explain what, what problem they're, they're, they're, they're solving.
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:50.560]   And, you know, so, so, you know, you could, you could wonder, you know, is it, is it,
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:57.440]   is it lack of imagination on, on, on, on, on our part, or is it, you know, I mean, I, the, the,
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:04.480]   the, you know, another possibility is, you know, if you look at the history of classical computer
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:10.480]   science, you know, what you find is that there are a few basic techniques that were discovered
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:16.960]   very early on in the history of classical CS. One of them is dynamic programming, right? Like,
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:23.440]   you know, dividing, you know, breaking down your problem, like recursively into sub-problems,
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:28.160]   right? I mean, we could say, you know, in general recursion, right? Solving, you know, divide and
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:36.160]   conquer, greedy algorithms, you know, convex programming, you know, linear programming,
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:46.960]   you know, Gaussian elimination, right? And, you know, and, and, and, and most of the, you know,
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:52.080]   I mean, the field of classical algorithms is enormous. And yet, you know, most of the classical
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:57.760]   algorithms that we know are somehow built up out of these motifs that are, that were discovered
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:03.600]   very early on, right? And, and we don't normally think of that as a failure of classical algorithms,
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:09.120]   right? We just think of it as, you know, there are these fundamental features of the algorithmic
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:14.560]   universe that, you know, that people noticed as soon as they started looking, right? And then,
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:19.120]   you know, and then, you know, you can go much further, but, but you go much further by,
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:25.360]   by building on the basic things that you have, right? And so, so, so, so maybe we should think
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:31.440]   of Shor's algorithm and Grover's algorithm, not as just specific algorithms, but as sort of some of
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:37.120]   the basic design motifs of the world of quantum algorithms. And then, you know, it's not, it's
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:42.240]   not surprising that they were discovered very early on, just like dynamic programming was
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:50.000]   discovered, you know, right at the beginning of the history of classical algorithms. So, you know,
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:55.120]   so, you know, I mean, I mean, that's, that's, that's, that's one point of view. Now, another
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:58:02.240]   point of view is, you know, if, like when, when people ask for, for more quantum algorithms,
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:06.960]   or, you know, they'll say they, they, they, they hold us to account for our failure to discover
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:11.840]   more quantum algorithms, you know, I, I like to answer that question with another question,
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:17.440]   which is, well, what are the problems that you would like these algorithms for, right?
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:22.000]   And, and amazingly that, that, that question almost always stops, you know, they ask it,
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:27.360]   right, because like they didn't even, you know, well, well, because, because no matter what
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:32.080]   problem they name, you know, there's an excellent chance that people in quantum algorithms have
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:38.000]   thought about it, you know, and we know, you know, something about how much speed up you can get from
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:43.440]   a Grover type algorithm, you know, but we have good reasons to think that you're not going to
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:48.320]   be able to get better than that. Or, you know, I mean, or, you know, we, or, or we say, well,
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:53.600]   maybe there's like, if, if in the case of the graph isomorphism problem, yeah, sure. Maybe
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:58.480]   there's a polynomial time quantum algorithm, but probably just because there's a polynomial time
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:02.240]   classical algorithm, right. And that, that, you know, and it just, it's that, that hasn't been
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:07.680]   discovered, right. Although, you know, there, there's been major progress toward it. So,
[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:13.840]   so you know, no matter what problem they name, right. I mean, probably someone has studied it
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:19.840]   in the context of quantum algorithms and I could then tell them for that problem, you know, exactly
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:27.760]   what is the current situation and, you know, what, what are people stuck on, you know, and, and so
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:33.680]   it might be that if we want to discover fundamentally new quantum algorithms, that the
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:40.400]   way to do it will be to realize fundamentally new problems, right. Problems that people hadn't even
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:47.520]   thought about designing an algorithm for, you know, previously, right. You know, the way,
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:52.720]   you know, another thing that, you know, another way that I like to put it is, you know, like,
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:59.440]   like in any, you know, in any given area of math or science, right. There is this phenomenon of
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:05.040]   low hanging fruit that gets picked very, very early on, right. And, and then those of us who
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:10.160]   come into the field a little bit later have to jump, have to leap higher, you know, if we want
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:16.880]   to find any fruit, right. But the, you know, I think the, the, the ultimate solution to the problem
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:25.280]   of low hanging fruit being picked is to find the new orchard, you know, and so, so, you know,
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:31.920]   figure out what are, you know, potential problems that quantum computers could solve that, that,
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:38.400]   that no one has been thinking about before, you know, maybe people actually starting to get quantum
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:44.800]   computers as they finally are today that they can experiment with will help stimulate the discovery
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:49.440]   of those new problems or new applications. Just like with Grover's algorithm, is there
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:53.600]   some reason to expect that from, from first principles, there are other algorithms that
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:01:04.240]   can be solved by quantum algorithms? Yeah. So, so it is, you know, anything where it's sort of as
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:10.320]   basic as Grover's algorithm that you just look at, you know, the way that amplitudes are changing
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:15.120]   over time and think that an algorithm is going to exist, right. That probably would have been
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:21.200]   snapped up by now just because quantum algorithms have become so much more sophisticated compared
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:29.120]   to what they were 25 years ago. Okay. But there are some problems where there's some evidence that
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:35.600]   a quantum algorithm might exist, even though we don't, we don't yet know it, if it does exist.
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:40.480]   A good example is computing the edit distance between two strings, right, which means the
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:46.240]   minimum number of insertions and deletions and changes that I have to make to change one string
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:51.920]   to another string. This is a fundamental problem for a DNA sequence alignment, for example.
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:59.680]   The best known algorithm for it takes quadratic time based on dynamic programming, in fact.
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:05.600]   And, you know, there is some evidence that there might be a quantum algorithm that would take
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:11.360]   n to the three halves time or something like that. But, but if so it has not yet been discovered.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:21.360]   So, so, so, so, so there are cases like that. No.
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:26.240]   Gotcha. Okay. The next question I wanted to ask you was,
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:29.680]   why do many of the important discoveries, not just in this field, but in many other fields,
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:34.000]   come from closely communicating groups of collaborators or people within such groups?
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:42.880]   You said on Sean Carroll's podcast that Shor and Grover were collaborators of Bell Labs.
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:48.640]   I'm not sure that they actually were collaborators. I mean, they, they, they,
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:53.120]   they worked in the same building, I believe, you know, I think they, they, you know, you know,
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:58.880]   I think the discovery of Shor's algorithm created a lot of excitement, you know, well, you know,
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:04.560]   all over the place, but certainly at Bell Labs, which is where Shor was, right. And I think that
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:09.840]   Grover, who worked also at Bell Labs but in a completely different department, I think he was
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:20.160]   affected by that excitement. And, you know, I'm not even sure if they knew each other prior to
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:32.000]   Grover's discovery of Grover's cell. But I could ask them that. But, you know, I mean, more broadly,
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:43.280]   you know, it is certainly true that in the history of ideas, like, you know, major innovations seem
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:48.720]   to come in clusters all the time. Bell Labs was a huge example of that, right? I mean,
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:55.040]   you know, the Shor's and Grover's algorithms were really, really at the tail end,
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:04.400]   right? You know, the heyday of Bell Labs, right? Which was mostly the, you know, the 40s, 50s, 60s,
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:10.240]   70s, right? But, I mean, you know, you had the invention of the transistor, you know,
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:16.320]   of the communication satellite, and so many other things, right, from this one place.
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:26.000]   You know, another example would be, you know, I mean, you know, we could take
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:35.520]   Athens and the ancient world, right? We could take Florence. We could look at Cambridge University,
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:44.480]   right? At the turn of the 20th century, right? That had just so many mathematicians, economists,
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:54.320]   philosophers, physicists who revolutionized the world. Now, you know, this might be because,
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:05:05.120]   you know, something about the environment, right, that, you know, that, you know, ideas bounce off
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:11.920]   of each other, right? People see something, they see someone achieve something spectacular,
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:18.880]   and they're either, you know, inspired by that, or they view it as a challenge, you know, they
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:25.520]   want to compete against that and come up with their own thing, right? You know, a Silicon Valley,
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:29.760]   of course, you know, would be another big example, although more for technology than for science,
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:37.600]   right? So, that would be one explanation, and a different explanation would be that, you know,
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:43.920]   these certain places at certain points in time, just, you know, attract all of the people who,
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:49.280]   you know, maybe anyway, would have had these great ideas, but, you know, that kind of person
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:56.960]   wants to go to these, you know, these centers, you know, wherever they are. And so, these centers
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:02.640]   will just collect the kind of people who were likely to discover these things. Right. Correlation
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:08.560]   doesn't equal causation in this case. Okay. Let me ask you now, I've interviewed a lot of economists
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:12.400]   on this podcast. I think this question will be interesting to the listeners. In your paper on
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:17.600]   why philosophers should care about complexity, you talk about how the difficulty in finding
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:24.560]   Nash equilibrium might be relevant to discussions on economics. Can you explain this? Yeah. Okay.
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:32.880]   So, there was a big advance in theoretical computer science 14 years ago, when it was
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:42.880]   theoretical evidence was finally discovered for why computing a Nash equilibrium is a hard problem,
[01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:50.080]   basically. Yeah. And this confirmed a suspicion that people had had for a long time, right? Because,
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:57.360]   you know, if we look at von Neumann equilibrium, right, which is like an equilibrium of a,
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:04.480]   let's say, of a two-plier zero-sum game, right, then, you know, this can be found easily,
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:12.720]   you know, using linear programming, right? But a Nash equilibrium is somehow a more complicated
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:22.240]   beast, right? And it's, you know, the way that Nash proved that they exist in the 50s was using
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:28.320]   what's called the Kakutani fixed-point theorem, right? It's some fixed-point theorem from
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:36.240]   topology. And if you try to actually unwind the existence proof into an actual algorithm
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:41.840]   to calculate the equilibrium, then what you get is an algorithm that ends up taking exponential time.
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:48.720]   Right? You know, it eventually hits the equilibrium, but it, you know, it may have to
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:54.560]   follow an exponentially long trail before it reaches it. If you're interested in this, the
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:59.680]   best, by far the best things that have been written about it, I think, are by Christos Papadimitriou,
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:12.560]   right? And Papadimitriou was one of the discoverers in 2006, along with Goldberg
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:17.840]   and Daskalakis, of this hardness theorem, which, you know, it doesn't prove that it's
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:21.840]   hard to find a Nash equilibrium. In fact, it doesn't even prove that it's NP-hard.
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:28.720]   This problem kind of doesn't have the right structure to be an NP-complete problem. Just
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:34.320]   because of Nash's theorem that tells us that a Nash equilibrium always exists, right? Like,
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:40.160]   in order to be NP-complete in any way that we currently understand, there has to be
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:46.000]   a decision problem. You know, is there a solution or is there not a solution, right? But for finding
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:51.360]   a Nash equilibrium, there always is a solution, right? There's only the problem of how to find it.
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:09:00.240]   But what was shown is that basically finding a Nash equilibrium is at least as hard as any other
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:06.000]   problem for which, you know, a solution is guaranteed to exist because of the same kinds
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:14.240]   of principles. Okay. So it's sort of, it is complete for that complexity class of problems
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:19.360]   for which, you know, a solution is guaranteed to exist for this sort of reason. So, you know,
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:26.240]   what does this mean for economics? Well, it's not clear, right, if it has a sort of direct
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:33.040]   implication, but it sort of, it fits into this general narrative of, you know, just because
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:39.200]   an equilibrium exists, you know, that's not the end of the story, right? I mean, you know, if the
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:45.840]   market can't actually find the equilibrium, right, in any, we could say, you know, if calculating
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:50.560]   this equilibrium would take exponential time, then we shouldn't expect the market to be able
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:58.960]   to find it either, right? And so, you know, now economists are well aware, right, that there are
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:06.560]   these issues, right, that, you know, people are not perfectly rational, you know, even if they
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:12.560]   want to be perfectly rational, which they don't always, you know, being perfectly rational might
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:19.440]   involve computations that they're just not able to do, right? And, you know, and they've, you know,
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:24.240]   with varying degrees of success, you know, they've tried to account for such phenomena.
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:29.760]   But, you know, I would say, you know, the, you know, Nash equilibria are so central to economic
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:35.360]   theory, right, that, you know, the hardness of finding Nash equilibria, I think, you know, is a,
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:43.360]   you know, maybe a non-trivial result, you know, underscoring that general point.
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:49.520]   That's incredibly interesting. But do you think Hayek's knowledge problem,
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:54.560]   or the way he phrased it, might be related to complexity as well? So, in terms of, like,
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:58.640]   central planning, in order to satisfy some constraints set by bureaucrats might be,
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:06.480]   like, an NP-complete problem, where it's, like, you know, I want to separate two different things,
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:12.960]   right? One is lack of knowledge, right, about what is going on in the economy, so forth,
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:18.400]   and the other one is lack of ability to do computations on the knowledge that you have,
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:25.840]   right? So, you know, the hardness of Nash equilibria is talking about the latter issue.
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:28.640]   Yeah, I see what you're saying. I mean, you know, they're related in a way,
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:34.800]   right? They're both, you know, they're both different kinds of deviations from perfect
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:41.840]   omniscience, right? But there are different kinds of deviations from omniscience. And, you know,
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:47.440]   in theoretical computer science, you know, very, very often we have to distinguish them.
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:56.160]   So, you know, I mean, often, like, people will ask me if some problem is, you know, is or isn't
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:01.120]   NP-complete when, you know, what they really mean is, like, how hard is it to collect the
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:06.800]   information, right? Which is, you know, it's kind of like apples and oranges. It's a category
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:14.160]   mistake, right? Once, you know, like, to even talk about whether a problem is NP or is an NP
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:19.840]   or whatever, we assume that an input is given to you, right? So all of the information that you
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:25.760]   need, you know, you have it in front of you, and then, you know, we are exclusively concerned with
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:32.720]   the difficulty of calculating something about that information, right? Now, there is also,
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:41.120]   you know, the difficulty that, you know, people who are in, you know, economic actors, you know,
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:47.760]   don't have the information that they need, or certainly central planners, you know, don't have
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:53.040]   the information that they need, right? And there's actually is a whole subfield of economics,
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:58.560]   you know, that's the economics of information, right? How much do you pay to learn something
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:05.120]   about, you know, what is going on? Or how do you hold, how do you design an auction in a way that
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:10.640]   you elicit the information that you want from the participants in the auction and things like that?
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:16.160]   I think that economists maybe have an easier time dealing with those things, or, you know,
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:21.600]   that stuff has been better integrated into economics than the computational consideration.
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:26.560]   No. Okay, that's incredibly interesting. Just a few more questions.
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:28.160]   Okay, sure.
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:31.280]   Yeah, I'm going to bring us back to David Deutsch and creativity.
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:31.760]   Okay.
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:36.480]   In the "Ask Me Anything" chapter of "Quantum Computing Since Democritus," you have a student
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:42.320]   ask you, what complexity classes creativity in? And you say, part of what you say is,
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:47.680]   we've got a billion years of natural selection, giving us a very good toolbox
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:51.840]   of heuristics of solving certain kinds of search problems, like problems in NP.
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:57.040]   But that makes it kind of sound like we have more heuristics to solve these problems than
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:01.760]   chimpanzees do. Chimpanzees have more than ants. I don't know if this is how you meant it, but do you
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:07.280]   see, like, the algorithm for creativity as a thing you have or you don't have? Or is it like, you
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:09.760]   just have better heuristics for searching through different?
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:16.000]   I don't know that there is such a thing as the algorithm for creativity, right? In fact,
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:23.200]   you know, the phrase is almost oxymoronic, right? That if there were such an algorithm,
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:27.280]   well, then whatever it output would no longer be creative, would it? Because it would just
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:35.840]   be the output of that algorithm, right? So, you know, I think that, you know,
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:44.480]   it seems like there is such a thing as, you know, general purpose reasoning ability or
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:51.920]   general purpose ability to invent creative solutions to problems, which, you know, let's
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:58.480]   say, you know, Einstein had more of than some random person off the street, but the random
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:04.000]   person off the street has more of than a chimpanzee and a chimpanzee has more of than an ant.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:10.480]   But it is somehow very, very hard to articulate what we mean by that, you know, in a way that
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:16.560]   would actually support these, you know, comparisons across, you know, vastly different evolutionary
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:22.800]   histories and goals in life and all these things. Do you, from the beginning to infinity,
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:28.480]   do you buy David Deutsch's term, a universal explainer, that people are universal explainers,
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:32.320]   AIs will be universal explainers, but non-human animals aren't, and that's like the only
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:41.920]   demarcation that matters? Yeah, I think Deutsch is like, he's incredibly optimistic and also
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:47.840]   incredibly categorical in his thinking, right? You know, I don't know anyone else who is sort of as
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:54.800]   optimistic or, you know, and hardly anyone else who is as black and white, right? I mean,
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:06.640]   you know, it does seem likely that there is some kind of threshold that you cross in going from
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:13.120]   a chimpanzee to a human, right? Where like, yes, you know, a chimpanzee is smarter than a cow,
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:18.080]   right? But like, you know, if you stare at both of them, you know, it doesn't seem like, you know,
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:24.160]   the chimpanzee is noticeably closer than the cow is to, you know, being able to land on the moon,
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:36.320]   right? Or prove Fermat's last theorem, right? Or any of these things, right? And, you know, with
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:46.080]   humans, you know, you had like, in succession, you had, you know, a few, you know, extremely
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:50.880]   important milestones that, you know, that had not been crossed before in the animal kingdom,
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:57.360]   right? You have a universality of language, right? You know, I mean, the ability to have
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:05.440]   a recursive language that can sort of, you know, express thoughts of, you know,
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:13.520]   unbounded complexity. You had, you know, the invention of writing, you know, the ability
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:20.960]   to transmit those thoughts across generations. You know, the, you know, a number system that
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:28.000]   could refer to arbitrarily large numbers, you know, and then, you know, computers, you know,
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:33.680]   which are universal machines, right? The ability to build these kinds of machines. And, you know,
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:41.040]   and all of this went along with, you know, being able to explain the world around us in, you know,
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:51.840]   in, you know, in explicit theories, you know, to, you know, to an extent that no animal species,
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:59.280]   no other animal species was ever able to do. Having said that, you know, I don't actually know
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:11.440]   if people are universal explainers. That is, you know, I have, you know, I have no idea if we can
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:18.240]   explain everything, or even if we can explain everything that is explainable. You know, I,
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:24.080]   of course, I hope that we will continue being able to explain a lot more than we can explain
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:30.960]   right now. Right. But I mean, you know, Deutsch, you know, uses words in unusual ways, like he,
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:39.200]   like, like when he talks about why he is so optimistic, you know, part of his optimism
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:44.080]   is like, you know, when he uses the word people, he also includes extraterrestrials,
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:50.160]   right? So he does like, oh, yeah, you know, it's possible that humans on earth will just all kill
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:55.040]   themselves out, you know, there will be a nuclear war or an environmental catastrophe. But that's
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:19:00.960]   not a big deal, because people in the broader sense of, you know, life elsewhere in the universe
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:06.080]   will go and do all the amazing things anyway, that we would have done. I mean, that that may
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:12.800]   be called comfort to, to, to, to most of us here on earth. Right. And so when he when he says
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:18.080]   something like people are universal explainers, you know, you always have to press him on,
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:22.800]   you know, not only what does he mean by a universal explainer, but even what does he mean by people?
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:30.000]   Right. His claim on the universal explainer part is that just as many worlds as the most
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.720]   parsimonious way to describe quantum mechanics, so you don't have to like postulate an arbitrary,
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:41.040]   you know, collapse. Since we have no reason to expect there's things, since we have no proof
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:44.640]   that there are things we cannot explain, the most parsimonious explanation is that we can explain
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:52.000]   everything. Okay, I don't know. I mean, you know, there are, there are certain questions,
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.960]   like, like the hard problem of consciousness, let's say, or a question, question of what,
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:03.200]   why is there a universe at all, where, you know, it's not just that we don't have an explanation,
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:10.080]   it's that the the mind sort of spins in circles, when we try to contemplate what could possibly
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:18.160]   consist of an explanation, right? What could an explanation possibly look like, even in principle?
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:26.160]   Right? Now, that could just be a lack of imagination, right? But, you know, it could
[01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:31.200]   be that there are, you know, I mean, like we all know, you know, the two-year-old who just, you
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:37.760]   know, asks why, and then you tell them, and they ask why, and you tell them, and then they ask why.
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:44.960]   And, you know, after, you know, a half dozen whys, you know, you're all the way back at the Big Bang,
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:54.960]   right? You know, you're back at, you know, the beginning of the universe, and, you know,
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:21:04.240]   they continue asking why, right? And it could be that, you know, there are questions with the
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:11.520]   property that, you know, that every, so, okay, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:17.360]   first of all, you know, I think even, even Deutsch thinks that we will not, you know,
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:22.080]   that there is no one time where we'll have an explanation of everything, right? Because,
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:29.760]   because Deutsch, you know, says that each, each question that we answer will lead to further
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:35.360]   questions, right? You know, each, each time you explain something, you know, there's, there's then
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:40.400]   the question of, you know, whatever the explanation is based on, you know, why is that, right? So,
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:45.760]   just like that two-year-old, right, we can always dig deeper and deeper. Okay, but now, you know,
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:49.920]   just to, just to loop back to earlier in this conversation, like, if we think about the busy
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:58.640]   beaver function, right, we know that, you know, it's not just that, you know, like with, with,
[01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:06.960]   with, you know, you need more and more resources to compute more and more values of the busy beaver
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:12.080]   function, and so you'll never know all of them. It's that there are fixed values, like busy beaver
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:20.400]   of 800, right, where the, the existing axioms of set theory, you know, provably will not suffice
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:27.200]   to let you determine that, right? And so, likewise, for all I know, there could be fixed questions
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:32.960]   where, you know, maybe the hard problem of consciousness, maybe why is there a universe
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:38.880]   where what we currently consider to be an explanation just will not suffice to ever
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:47.360]   explain these things. Right. But, but I, but I don't know, you know, I feel like, unlike Deutsch,
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:53.840]   you know, I don't want to assert that I know the answer from first principles. I, you know, I,
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:59.840]   I want to continue looking for explanations of these things. You know, it can be, when you're
[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:05.680]   searching for explanations, you know, it can be psychologically helpful to, you know, assume that
[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:12.480]   the explanation exists. But, you know, but, but let's, let's not make that into more than it is,
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:18.240]   right? Let's not take a useful heuristic and elevate it into a basic principle of reality.
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:25.600]   Right. But on, on this point, Deutsch wrote a book in The Fabric of Reality, where he talks
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:30.800]   about how Gödel's incompleteness theorem actually verifies the importance of creativity. So that if
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:34.480]   we need to come up with new axioms to prove Bissebiber of 800, that's, that's the point of
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:39.920]   creativity. And as far as like, I think he thinks the hard problem of consciousness can be solved,
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:44.480]   but even if it can't be solved, like the reason it's so hard is not because it's not an artifact
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:49.040]   of our mind. It just seems like we can't imagine a possible mind. And that might, that might itself
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:53.520]   be an artifact of our mind. We can't imagine a possible way that you could solve it, regardless
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:57.600]   of what kind of mind you had. The final question is what advice would you give to a 20 year old
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:01.920]   who is interested in technical subjects, but not, maybe he's not doing a PhD program like you were
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:10.560]   at the time, but interested in technical subjects. Just learn all that you can. I mean, you know,
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:17.520]   there, there, you know, has never been a time when sort of more resources were available to anyone
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:28.960]   who wants to learn things. So, so, you know, take courses, talk to your professors, you know, go,
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:36.880]   go, go on the internet and, or, you know, read, read, read books, you know, delve deeply into a
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:45.200]   subject and, you know, and, and, you know, you, you might be surprised at sort of how,
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:52.080]   how low the barriers sometimes are, right. They're like, if you, you know, you know, let's say that
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:55.840]   it was quantum computing that you were interested in, right. It doesn't have to be, it could be
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:25:01.200]   anything else, but, you know, if you, you know, the entire literature of quantum computing pretty
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:08.480]   much is available for free on, you know, on archive.org. And, you know, if you go and like,
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:14.880]   look every, every night at the new quantum computing papers that come out and just flag the
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:20.720]   ones that are interesting to you and read them, you know, each paper will raise new questions that,
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:27.120]   that the authors don't know the answer to or yet. And, you know, sometimes they'll be explicitly
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:31.200]   listed in an open problem section, you know, other times, you know, there'll be ones that
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:40.080]   you could think of and, you know, you can, you know, you can study those problems. You know,
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:48.720]   if you have ideas about them, you can, you know, talk to, to the authors of the paper. And, you
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:55.120]   know, you, you know, it, it, it, it might, you know, it might take, you know, years or decades
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:26:01.920]   to become, you know, an expert, like in a whole field, you know, and you might be very far from
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:08.000]   that, but it really doesn't take that long to become the world expert on one particular tiny
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:17.040]   little problem. Right. And, you know, so, so try to, you know, become the world expert on, on
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:22.480]   something, you know, you know, even something very, very narrow. Right. And, and, you know,
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:27.920]   once you've done that, then you can, you know, write an article about it or, you know, do a,
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:33.200]   do a project about it. And then, you know, that will lead to more things, right. It will
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:39.040]   lead to, you know, maybe collaborations in the future, you know, and it will lead to, you know,
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:43.040]   you, you can then try to become an expert on something a little bit wider, something a little
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:48.640]   bit wider and so on. Yeah. That's very excellent advice. I love that. Okay. Well, Professor,
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:52.480]   thank you so much for your time. Hey, if you enjoyed this podcast, please consider sharing
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:56.960]   it with your friends and posting it on social media. Word of mouth is incredibly valuable for
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:05.120]   a new and a small podcast like this one. So thanks for watching.
