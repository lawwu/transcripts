[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.460]   Hello again, thank you for listening to Ask Pastor John, the game show where we try to
[00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.780]   stump John Piper into confused silence seven years in, and it hasn't happened yet. I'm
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.180]   your host, Tony Reike, trying to do it. Pastor John, today's question will, of course, prompt
[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.440]   a lot of thoughts for you, namely about the distinction between Calvinism and Arminianism
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.500]   when it comes to the power of God's grace. As listeners may know, you are hoping to finish
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.380]   up this summer writing a big new book on God's providence. So I know these questions about
[00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.580]   God's sovereignty are on the front of your mind already. Here's the email.
[00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.540]   "Hello, Pastor John. I'm a 26-year-old man in full-time ministry working primarily with
[00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.200]   collegiate golfers. In a recent Bible study, one of the older men in our group brought
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.880]   up the topic of 'prevenient grace,' the idea that the Holy Spirit enables everyone to potentially
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:58.300]   believe if they choose to cooperate. I was unprepared in the moment to respond. I am
[00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.320]   Reformed and believe wholly in the sovereignty of God and salvation. I believe we are saved
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.960]   by grace through faith, and this faith is not our own doing but is rather a gift of
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.100]   God coming to the elect from outside of us, all according to Ephesians 2.8. But I was
[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.900]   really unprepared to respond in that moment. I'd love to hear your answer. How do you address
[00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.940]   'prevenient grace?'"
[00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:30.660]   There are two very different views of how God's grace functions in bringing people from
[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:39.720]   spiritual darkness and deadness and unbelief into the light and life and faith which we
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:48.700]   call salvation and union with Christ. And if it helps, you can call the one view "Arminianism,"
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.540]   because one of its early and foremost advocates was Jacob Arminius, and you can call the other
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:02.820]   view—the one I'm going to argue for—"Calvinism," because one of its foremost advocates was
[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:10.940]   John Calvin. But the names "Arminianism" and "Calvinism" are not important in comparison
[00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.540]   to what's really at stake, and that is one of them more biblical, is one of them more
[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:25.300]   biblical than the other. Now, both of these views agree that until the grace of God is
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:33.340]   active and powerful in the human heart, there is only deadness and rebellion and unbelief,
[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:40.240]   with no possibility of man bringing about the changes in his own heart that are necessary
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.220]   for salvation. We need to get that clear, because sometimes Calvinists don't describe
[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:55.580]   Arminianism correctly there. Historic Arminianism agrees with Calvinism that fallen man, apart
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:05.260]   from special grace, cannot give himself life or produce his own faith. The difference lies
[00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:14.340]   in what this divine grace does in the human heart and how it relates to the will of man.
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.580]   So "prevenient grace," which is what we're being asked about, "prevenient grace" is
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:31.060]   a phrase used by Arminians usually to describe the work of God's grace prior to faith—hence
[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:39.220]   the word "prevenient," coming before—and without which faith would not be possible.
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.660]   That's what an Arminian would say. So let me read some words from a prominent Arminian
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:54.500]   theologian, Roger Olson, from his book Against Calvinism, to make sure that I express the
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:05.060]   view fairly. I want you to hear the very words of Dr. Olson as a historic, faithful, insightful
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.420]   Arminian, and here's what he says. Everything I say now is going to be a quote until I tell
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:19.220]   you otherwise. "If anyone comes to Christ with repentance and faith, it is only because
[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:28.620]   they are enabled by God's prevenient grace to do so." Page 66. Another quote. "Arminianism
[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:36.620]   has always insisted that the initiative in salvation is God's. It is called 'prevenient
[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:48.020]   grace' and is enabling but resistible." Page 169. Another quote. "Wesley affirmed original
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:56.180]   sin, including total depravity, in the sense of spiritual helplessness, but he also affirmed
[00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:04.640]   God's universal gift"—so everybody gets this—"universal gift of prevenient or enabling
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:13.760]   grace that restores freedom of the will." Page 129. Another quote. "Classical Arminian
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:21.080]   theology attributes the sinner's ability to respond to the gospel with repentance and
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:27.040]   faith to 'prevenient grace.'" Now let me insert a comment here. Just to be clear, he
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.580]   says the ability to respond is given with prevenient grace, but it's an ability to
[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.960]   believe or not to believe, and he'll make that really plain in just a minute. Continuing
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:45.320]   the quote now. "The illuminating, convicting, calling, enabling power of the Holy Spirit
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:55.800]   working in the sinner's soul makes them free to choose saving grace or reject it."
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:04.640]   Page 67. So prevenient grace brings one out of bondage to the point where you can receive
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:13.800]   or reject the work of God in your heart. Another quote. "So in Arminian theology, a partial
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:20.040]   regeneration"—now this is his phrase, I didn't know this phrase until I read this—"a
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:28.400]   partial regeneration does precede conversion, but it's not a complete regeneration. It
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:38.680]   is an awakening and enabling, but not an irresistible force. Prevenient grace is God's powerful,
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:48.720]   connecting, and persuading power that actually imparts free will to be saved or not." Page
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:56.320]   171. Now that's the end of my quotation, so that you could hear how a historic Arminian
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:04.240]   would describe their own understanding of prevenient grace. Those are all quotations.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:12.040]   And the question is whether that understanding of how grace works to bring about our faith
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:20.320]   is biblical, or whether the Calvinist view is biblical, which says God's grace doesn't
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:28.720]   just bring us up to a point in a "partial regeneration"—that's his term—and then
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:37.200]   stop and leave the outcome to our ultimate self-determination. Now that's my term,
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.480]   ultimate self-determination. Olson doesn't use that. I think it's fair, and I think
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:52.840]   it's right, in trying to get across the fact that man, not God, does the final and
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:08:00.880]   the ultimately decisive act. I know that the word "decisive" is a little slippery,
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:08.560]   and I'm trying to be clear and fair. Ultimately decisive. The very final act that brings me
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:19.160]   into Christ is that decisive moment in conversion is one that I perform, not God. Now let me
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:29.240]   tell you, Calvinism says that God does more in our conversion. Namely, he overcomes all
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:39.920]   of our resistance and opens the eyes of our hearts to make Christ so real and so beautiful
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:48.000]   and so compelling that our will gladly embraces Christ as our Savior and Lord and treasure.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.880]   So the question is, which of those is the biblical view of how God's grace brings
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:03.080]   us to faith and salvation? Does it make us free to choose grace or reject it? Or does
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:10.520]   it overcome our rebellion and blindness so that we are drawn triumphantly by the beauty
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:21.320]   of Christ to embrace what is true and real? Now, as you ponder which of these two views
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:27.520]   is biblical and you search the Scriptures, I would just point to one passage—and we
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:34.840]   could point to others, but just to save time, I'll point to one passage of Scripture that
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:46.360]   I think shows the complete saving effectiveness of God's grace and that God provides more
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:53.120]   than a partial regeneration in order to bring us to faith. And that passage is Ephesians
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:10:01.980]   2, verses 4 through 7. So let me read it. "God, being rich in mercy because of the
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:11.600]   great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses," and now
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:22.800]   comes two verbs of what God, being rich in mercy, does. Number one, "made us alive
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:32.700]   together with Christ." That's what he does for dead sinners. He made us alive with
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:42.820]   Christ, not just alive to reject Christ, but alive with Christ. And then he adds this parenthetical
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:47.800]   phrase, "By grace you have been saved," in order to show, I think, what grace actually
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:55.960]   does. It makes us alive with Christ. And then here's the second verb, "and raised
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:02.860]   us up with him." He made us alive together with Christ, and he raised us up. So he brings
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:09.100]   us alive out of the grave of our fallenness, and he raises us up with Christ, seats us
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:13.940]   in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages he might show the
[00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:19.980]   immeasurable riches of his grace and kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. I don't think
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:28.420]   that text can be fairly interpreted to mean that there is a split in regeneration or a
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:33.140]   split in making alive, and he does part of it, and then he waits to see what we will
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:40.580]   do with the rest of it if we will finish the making alive and bringing ourselves into union
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:48.300]   with Christ. I don't think that will work. And so the difference between me—and I think
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:55.880]   I speak for virtually all Calvinists on this point, and Arminians—is not that one believes
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:12:00.860]   in total depravity and the other doesn't. No, that's not it. And it's not—the
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:06.820]   difference is not that one believes that grace must precede faith and the other doesn't.
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:13.580]   No, no, that's not the difference either. Rather, that I believe what God's saving
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:24.040]   grace does is not merely restore a kind of free will that can accept or reject Christ,
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:31.660]   but rather opens our blind eyes, grants us to see the compelling truth and beauty and
[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:41.820]   worth of Jesus in such a way that we find him irresistible, and so gladly and willingly
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:51.660]   embrace him as our Savior and Lord and treasurer. He brings us all the way to the point of conversion
[00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:57.660]   so that we give him all the glory for our receiving of Jesus.
[00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:03.300]   Amen. Made alive in Christ, made alive to Christ, and all to the glory of his sovereign
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:07.900]   grace. Thank you, Pastor John, for outlining one of the key differences here. And if this
[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:13.060]   is all rather new to you and you want to better understand Calvinism in general, see Pastor
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:18.780]   John's book titled "Five Points." You can download the 100-page book free of charge
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:24.980]   right now. Go to DesiringGod.org/books and look for the title "Five Points." Spelled
[00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:28.260]   out F-I-V-E, five points, and you'll find it there.
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:32.180]   Well, as you can imagine, we get a lot of questions about what it means to live as a
[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:39.260]   child of God. How does God's disposition change towards us? And specifically, is God angry
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:46.100]   at his children when they sin? Is God angry at me when I sin? That's on Wednesday when
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.620]   we return. It's a great question. I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We'll see you then.
