[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   The words to which I should like to call attention this morning are to be found in the portion of Scripture that has been read to us in the 10th chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   reading again from verse 19 to the end of verse 22.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   "Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   and having an high priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water."
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Now we are looking here, as I gather you will all, most of you, realize this morning in view of the announcements that we've just been listening to,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   we are looking together here at one of these appeals that is made in this great epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   You remember the circumstances in which this epistle ever came to be written.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   These people were Jews by birth, Hebrews, but they'd heard the gospel and they'd believed it and had become Christians.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   They'd forsaken their own religion and they had become members in the Christian church.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   But for various reasons, they were by now in a very unhappy condition.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   We needn't go into the reasons.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   One of them, obviously, was persecution, because it's referred to more than once in the body of the epistle.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   There were many things that had discouraged them.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   And the result was that they'd become uncertain of the very basis and foundation of the Christian faith.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   And that's why this man writes to them.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   He shows them the consequences of falling away from this faith in Christ.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   At the beginning of the second chapter, he warns them not to let these things slip, not to slip away for them.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   And the result is that in this epistle, you have some of the most threatening and perhaps terrifying passages that are to be found anywhere in the whole of the Bible.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Now, here in particular, in this section, he's concerned to show them that if they become uncertain of the faith, it will affect their prayer life.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   It'll affect every act of prayer.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   In a sense, it will make prayer quite impossible.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   And that's what he deals with in this particular section.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   The idea that you can maintain your Christian life irrespective of what you believe is to deny the whole of the New Testament.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   All the Christian life and living in detail comes out of our central belief, our central faith.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   And if that becomes shaky, everything becomes shaky.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And nothing, of course, is more important than this whole matter of prayer.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Prayer is vital to the Christian.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   You remember how our Lord put it, that men should always pray and not faint.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   The alternative to praying is fainting.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   You can't go on in the Christian life without prayer.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   It's the way you receive power.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   It's central. It's vital.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   You see the place of prayer in the life of our blessed Lord himself.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   You see it in the apostles. You see it in the Old Testament.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   You see it in the lives of the saints throughout the centuries.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Prayer is vital to the Christian.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   So when this fails, everything tends to go.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   And so this man devotes this section to this particular matter.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   And I feel that you and I are living in days and times when we badly need this very message.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   We are engaged in a great fight.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   There's no question about this.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   I mean not only the fight against the world, the flesh, and the devil, but the fight within the Church.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   All who truly hold to this faith are having to fight today.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   There is tremendous opposition.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   And if you stand for the faith, you'll find yourself in a great battle.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   And you'll be discouraged.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   The enemy will attack you in very subtle ways.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   And it's so easy to fail and to falter.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Nothing can keep us standing and fighting except prayer.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   So it's vital that we should know something about this.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Another reason why I call attention to this is that some people give the impression that prayer is something simple and easy.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   It's a remark that one hears so often at the present time.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   People who are interested in this so-called ecumenical movement, they say, "We mustn't discuss doctrine together. That divides," they say.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   "But we can always pray together."
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   That's the argument.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   As if prayer were simple.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   And I've noticed over the years in discussion groups and classes and meetings, when a problem is presented, there's generally somebody present who jumps up at once and has an easy solution.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   They say, "Pray about it."
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   As if prayer is simple and easy.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Well, I want to show you this morning that that is not so.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   In many ways, prayer is one of the most difficult things in the Christian life.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   And we need to be taught how to pray.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   You remember the disciples themselves.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   They had been with our Lord, and they had noticed how he would get up a great while before dawn sometimes and pray, or he'd spend a whole night in prayer.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   And they couldn't do this.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   And they were troubled about this.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   So they went to him one day and they said, "Lord, teach us how to pray."
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Even as John taught his disciples to pray, they felt the need of instruction in this whole matter.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   And it is certain, as I say, that this is one of the most difficult things in the whole of the Christian life.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   A few years back, there was a movement.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   It's still in being, but we don't hear so much about it now.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Which used to tell people that prayer was as simple as this, that all you needed to do was to relax in a comfortable chair and let yourself go and begin to listen to God.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Quite simple, they said.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   But the teaching of the Bible is that it's not simple.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   And therefore, it's good for us to look at this instruction.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Now, why is prayer difficult?
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Let's put it like that.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Why do we need this instruction?
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Why do people find praying so difficult?
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Well, this man tells us that there are three main answers to that question.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   The first is this, that prayer means going into the very presence of God.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   "Having therefore, brethren," he says, "boldness to enter into the holiest."
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   That's what prayer means.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   I think it was yesterday afternoon I was referring to this in passing.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   You see, this man is writing to Hebrew Christians, to Jews.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   So he puts this in a way that they would understand.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   They, you see, in their old religion and in their worship, had been accustomed to the type of worship that was conducted in the tabernacle and then in the temple.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   And as I reminded you yesterday afternoon, these buildings were divided into compartments.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   And the ultimate compartment was that innermost sanctum, which was known as the holiest or the holiest of all.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   And it was there that God came to meet his people.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   You remember the accounts given in the Old Testament of this great day once a year when the high priest went into the holiest of all.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   It was a tremendous day.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   He went in to represent the people, had their sins, as it were, upon him, and he'd got a blood offering.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   And he went into that holiest of all.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Nobody else was allowed to go there, just the high priest alone.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   And when he went in, the people, we are told, were waiting outside in fear and trembling.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Why? Well, they wondered whether he'd ever come out again.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Why? Because he was going into the presence of this holy, just, and righteous God.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   And as this man puts it later on, "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God."
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   It was a tremendous thing, man going into the presence of this eternal, almighty, holy being.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   And so we are told that when they heard the sound of the jingling of the bells, you remember this great robe that the high priest wore?
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   There were bells sewn onto the hem of this robe.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   And when they heard the jingling of the bells, they knew that he was still alive, that he was moving, and that he was coming out.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   They knew their sins were covered for another year, and they were filled with a spirit of rejoicing.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Well, now then, this man reminds these people, therefore, that praying means going in that way, into the presence of God.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   And this is the greatest thing that a human being can ever do.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   It's a tremendous thing. This man is so concerned about it that he keeps on repeating it.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   At the end of chapter 12, he puts it like this, "Wherefore, we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved,
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear."
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   "For our God is a consuming fire."
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Now, this is the great theme of the Bible.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   "Who can dwell with a burning fire?" asks Isaiah.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   "Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord?" says the psalmist.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   This is the greatest activity a man can ever engage in.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Prayer, you see, doesn't just mean getting on your knees and offering up some pious hopes and fears and petitions,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   or talking to yourself, or talking to somebody else.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Prayer means having communion with God, talking to this everlasting and eternal God.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   It's entering into the holiest of all.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   Well, now, here's a problem, isn't it?
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Who can do this?
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Who is fit to do this?
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   The moment you realize what prayer really means, well, you see, it becomes, in a sense, almost impossible.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   We all know from experience, don't we, what it is to be in the presence of some great earthly person.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   You talk to some great men, or you talk to some king or some queen or some emperor,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   or somebody in some high and august position, and you feel nervous.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   You feel you can't say anything.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   You become speechless. You're overawed by the presence of this great person.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   The greater the person, the more we're overawed by such a person,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   and the more careful we are, and the more helpless we feel.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Multiply that by infinity, and there are you and I in the presence of God, and going to talk to God.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   The moment we realize this, we tend to feel that prayer is, therefore, impossible.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   How can we possibly do this?
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Very well, there's the first difficulty.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   But then he mentions a second difficulty, and the second difficulty is an accusing conscience.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   He puts it, you remember, in these words. Having, he says, a heart sprinkled from an evil conscience.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   What's this mean?
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Well, I don't think we need spend long on this. We all know what an evil conscience is.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   It's a bad conscience. It means the accusations of conscience.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   And you've often had this experience, haven't you? You go on your knees, perhaps in some great need,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   and you want help from God.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   And the moment you get on your knees, your conscience begins to speak.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   And it says to you, "Who are you to pray to God? You've disobeyed God. You've sinned against him.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   You haven't thought of him. You've been selfish. Your conscience accuses you."
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   And you can't answer it.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   What the conscience is saying is perfectly right. It's perfectly true.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   How can one deal with this?
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Now, here is a terrifying problem.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   You get instances of it in the Bible.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   You remember David in the 51st Psalm, which is perhaps one of the greatest treatments of this whole subject in the entire Bible.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   David, you see, had committed his terrible sins, two great sins, but he was quite happy.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   And all seemed well until the prophet had brought him face to face with what he'd done.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   And David is now utterly cast down, and he's got nobody to turn to.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   You can turn to nobody in such a condition but to God.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   But how can you turn to God?
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   He says, "I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me. Against thee, thee only have I sinned."
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Accusations of conscience.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   Or take the case of the prodigal son when he came to himself.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   And he went back and said to his father, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thy face, and am no more worthy to be called thy son."
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   The terrible accusations of conscience.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   And we really don't pray properly until we've dealt with those.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   You can't brush them aside. It is impossible.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   We would like to do so, but we can't.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   The conscience goes on speaking.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   And you'll have no liberty in prayer until you've been able to deal with the accusations of conscience.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Well, there's the second difficulty.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   And then he mentions the third difficulty.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   What is that?
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   Well, here he refers to what we may well describe as pollution.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   The pollution of sin.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   Our bodies washed with pure water.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   Now, what does this mean?
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   Well, I say this is his way of describing the polluting effect of sin.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   That means this.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Sin doesn't consist merely of a number of actions that we perform.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   There's something worse than that.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   It is the polluting, corrupting effect of sin upon our very souls, our innermost nature and being.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   And this is the most terrible thing of all.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   This is much worse than the acts of sin.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   In other words, it means this.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Our trouble is not merely that we do things that are wrong.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   The real trouble is that we've got such a nature that we have a desire to do such things.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   Now, here again you see David in that 51st Psalm is very eloquent on this point.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   He's acknowledged his sin.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   He's cried out for mercy.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   But he realizes that his real need is this nature of his.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   You see, he's committed adultery.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Then on top of that, and in order to cover it in a sense, he committed murder.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   Well, now, you can't imagine two more terrible, horrible sins.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   And yet David sees now that even that is not the real trouble.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   This is the trouble.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   "Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me."
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   What he says is this.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   I've done these two things, yes, I know, but the terrible thing is whatever made me desire to do them.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   This polluted, foul nature.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   So he goes on to offer his essential prayer, which is this.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   "Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me."
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   This is his greatest need.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   He needs to be washed.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   "Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow."
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   Now, this is a terrible thing.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   And until we come to realize this about ourselves, we're not truly Christian, and we certainly can't pray.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   We have to realize our total unworthiness, uncleanness, sinfulness, the pollution, and the corruption of sin.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   Though we feel our individual sins have been forgiven, the problem still is,
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   how can I possibly dwell in the presence of God and have communion with him?
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   Well, now, there, according to this man, are the three great problems which every one of us has to face when we attempt to pray to God.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   And you don't go near God without overcoming these three obstacles, whether we are conscious of it or not, that's the fact.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   We can talk to ourselves, but if you're really talking to God, you've got to deal with these three matters.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   Can it be done?
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   As you look at the difficulties, you feel that prayer is totally impossible.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   But it isn't, thank God.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   And it isn't because of the gospel.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   And that's why this man is writing about this.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   He says, "Don't you imagine that you can go wrong in doctrine and still go on praying to God? You can't.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   Without true doctrine, you cannot pray."
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   And so he tells them the only way whereby one can pray truly.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   What is it?
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   The first thing he mentions is this.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   "We must have," he says, "a true heart.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   Let us draw near with a true heart."
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   He emphasizes this point, that prayer is something that should be done with confidence, with boldness.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   Having, therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest of all.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   It seems a contradiction, doesn't it?
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   We've seen the difficulties, and yet, says this man, it is possible for you to go into the presence of God, into the holiest of all, with boldness, with full assurance of faith.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   True prayer, he says, is not being there on your knees and wondering whether God hears you or not, or whether you have a right to go to God.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   No, no, he says, prayer should be confident, bold, with full assurance of faith.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   How is it possible?
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   The first answer is, you must be honest.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   Having a true heart.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   Now, here again is a most important point.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   A true heart means a sincere heart, an honest heart, that you're open to God.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   You're not concealing anything, because this is where we all are so foolish.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   We can hide things from one another, and we tend to think we can hide them from God, but it can't be done.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   You remember the psalmist putting it like this, "If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me."
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   What does regard mean?
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   It means hide, shield, protect.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   In other words, we tend to go to God, and we're going to confess quite a lot, but there's one thing we're not going to confess.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   We want to hold on to that.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   We were prepared to give up all our sins, but one, we hold on, we regard iniquity.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   He says, "It's no use.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me."
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   Why not?
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Well, this man, you see, he's already expounded this, and it's amazing the way in which he goes on repeating himself.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   These things are so vital.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   He's dealt with this rarely in the fourth chapter, where he puts it in these words, verses 12 and following.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   "For the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight, but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do."
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   If you think you can hide anything from God, you don't know God.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Nothing can be hidden from God.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   You mustn't go to God with a divided heart.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   With an attempt to conceal anything, it must be a true heart.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   "Unite my heart to praise thy name."
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   It's no use attempting to pray unless we are absolutely honest and open before God, and not attempting to dissimulate or to conceal anything whatsoever.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   It's useless, because he knows everything, and nothing can be hidden from the eye of him with whom we have to do.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   So this is the first essential, sincerity, absolute sincerity.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   But you know, even that isn't enough. It's essential.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   But sincerity alone doesn't admit us into the presence of God.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Without sincerity, we have no hope of getting in.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   But even with sincerity, we can't get in.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   We've got to add to that, and this man tells us what is further necessary.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   What is it?
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   Well, this is how he puts it.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   "Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh, and having an high priest of the house of God, let us draw nigh."
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   Now there it is. What is it?
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   Well, he reminds these people, "Look here," he says, "I can't understand you.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   We've got a new way," he says. A new way.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   It's a new and a living way. What's he mean by this new way?
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Well, he's contrasting it with the old way.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   Did you notice it in the reading?
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   He says, "In the old way, when you used to go to the tabernacle with your burnt offerings and sacrifices, you had to keep on going, and you had to hand them over to priests, and they got old and they died, and there was a constant change.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   That was the old way."
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   But he says, "We've got a new way."
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   But here were some of these Hebrew Christians looking back with longing to the old way.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   You see, they were being attacked. People used to come to them and say, "Look here, you've taken up this new belief. What have you got to show for it?"
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   "It's something new," they said.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   "You've left the old religion, which has stood the test of the centuries.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   You've turned your backs on that. Can't you see you're risking everything?
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   The old was tried, and it's been going on for so long, and here you are. You've abandoned all that, and you've taken up this new way.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   And what have you had since you've taken it up?
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   You've had nothing but opposition and scorn and derision and persecution.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   You've been robbed of your goods. Can't you see you've made a big mistake?
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   Go back to the old way, the old tried way."
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   And some of them were so shaken that they were turning back and going back.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   "I'm amazed at you," says this man.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   "Going back to that old way, when we've got this new and living way?"
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   Now, let me try to put this to you in terms of a modern comparison.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   I feel that we can use it like this. It helps us to understand it.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   What these people, you see, in a sense, were doing was something like this.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   "Here we are today, in this world of motorways, bypasses.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   In the old times, we used to have these roads, A5, A6, and so on, and they twisted and they turned and they went through the villages,
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   and the towns and the streets were narrow, and you were held up constantly by congested traffic and traffic blocks,
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   and there you were, wasting your time back and forth on all this trouble and regulations.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   But now, bypasses, motorways, straight through.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   What would you think of a man who ignored the motorway, the direct route,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   and still persisted in meandering and wasting his time and his energy and everything else in going along the old roads?
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   You'd laugh at him. You'd say, "What a foolish man. Doesn't appreciate the value of the new."
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   Well, no, that's exactly what these were doing. And this man says, "Are you going back to that old way?
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   We've been delivered from that. There's a new way. There's a new way now. Come along this. This is the way to God."
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   And this is still the appeal. And this is a very contemporary word, you know.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   What appalls me is that evangelical people seem to be anxious to go back to certain old ways.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   I see Christian people, evangelical, Protestant people, really wanting to go back to Rome.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   They say there's something very beautiful, you know, about their ceremony.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   And didn't old Pope John look a nice and a kindly and a friendly man?
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   This is the kind of foolish talk that's going on, and people are being invited to go back to something
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   from which we've been delivered, and there is a new way.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   So he contrasts it with the old way, and then he calls it a living way.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Why does he call it a living way? Well, it's the same reason.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   What Mr. Sutton read to us explains that fully.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   The trouble about the old way was that in a way, in a sense, it was a way of death.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   And that's why you see there to keep on repeating these things,
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things,
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually,
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   make the comers thereunto perfect, for then would they not have ceased to be offered.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   But he says, but in those sacrifices, there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   It is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   In other words, it depended upon the blood of animals.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   And these died, and you ought to have new ones, and back and forth.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   But not only that, he said, the priesthood also was dependent upon men.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   which can never take away sins.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   Then on he goes. He says, they also, these priests, they were subject to age.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   He was a young priest, he got older, came to an age of retiring, and then he died,
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   the same with the high priests.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   And the priests came and they went. There was nothing permanent.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   It was a way of death.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   But now, he says, this is not only a new way, but it is a living way.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   And this is the thing that makes it so wonderful.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   We have a high priest, he says now, eternal in the heavens.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   Not one who comes and goes, not one who's constantly having to be replaced,
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   but the one and only.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Now, again, he said all this in the previous seventh chapter.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   Let me read to you in the seventh chapter, beginning at verse 23.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   They truly, he says, were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   by reason of death.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   But this man, Christ, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that cometh,
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   He says, why are you going back to that old dead way?
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   We've got a new way and it's a living way.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   Christ is alive forevermore.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   There'll never be a change.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   He's ever there making intercession for us at the right hand of God.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   It's a way of life, not a way of constant death and repetition.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   Once and forever, one sacrifice for sins forever.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   He's made it, he sat down, and he ever lives to apply it and to make intercession for us.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   Now this, he says, is the only way whereby we can truly pray.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   The new and the living way.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   But he's not content even to leave it at that.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   He tells us how this way has been made and prepared and how it has been opened for us.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   And this to me is very wonderful.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   You know these great motorways and bypasses and so on that we are so familiar with today.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   You've watched their being made, haven't you?
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   And what's one of the most important things about them?
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Well, it is the foundation, isn't it?
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   They're going to carry a lot of heavy traffic.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   So you must have a very good foundation that can bear the weight of this great traffic that's going to pass along the road.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Foundation is tremendously important.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Yes, says this man.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   And in the new and living way, the foundation is all important.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   He says, you know, you need such a strong foundation here that it can carry the souls of all these people through the centuries.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   And no man could ever be strong enough to make that.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   For every man sins and is weak and is frail and is fallible.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   Before we can have a new way which is safe and secure, we must have a foundation that can stand up to the weight.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   What is it?
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   Well, this man has told us all about it.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   It is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   Therefore, when he cometh into the world, he saith, sacrifice and offering the wood is not, but a body has thou prepared me.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   Jesus Christ, God and man.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   You must have the strength of the Godhead.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   No human priest can ever take us into the presence of God.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   Hence the folly of returning to Roman Catholicism.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   One only, God and man.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   There is one God and one mediator and one only between God and men, the man, Christ Jesus.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   Son of God, but a body has thou prepared me.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   Here's the foundation of the road.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   This is why it's strong enough to bear us.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   Whatever your sins, whatever you've been, whatever you've done, here is a road on which you can safely travel.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   It will never fail. There'll never be any subsidence.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   Nothing will ever go wrong.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   It's based upon the body of the Son of God, the incarnation.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   Very well.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   But even that, you see, is not sufficient.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   The man makes reference here to this body.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   Yes, by a new and living way which he has consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   He's already referred to the blood of Jesus.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   I like to look at it like this.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   Our Lord's coming into the world and taking the nature of man upon him, not of angels, as this author has already explained in chapter two.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Having become truly man, tempted in all points like as we are yet without sin, oh, everything is ready.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   The road is prepared.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   But now the road has got to be opened.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   It's got to be consecrated.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   And when was the great opening day of the new and the living way?
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   When did this happen? Where did it happen?
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   It happened on the cross on Calvary's Hill.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   It wasn't the cutting of a tape, but it was the shedding of the blood of the Son of God, the Lamb of God, the breaking, as it were, of his body.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   He's opened this way, he says, by his blood.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   He's consecrated it for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   The veil has been rent. His body has been rent. His blood has been shed.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   The road is open.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   And, my friends, what this man is saying is this.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   There is no other way to enter into the presence of God.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   Without shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   Now, this is unpopular today.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   People in the great denominations, they dispute this and they deny it.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   They laugh at it.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   They make fun, as they try to, of this holy God who demands a blood sacrifice.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   This theology of blood, they say.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   But the Bible's full of blood.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   And there is no remission of sins, apart from the shedding of blood.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   All the types of the Old Testament are pointing forward to this.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   He is the great type.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   He's the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   Without his death upon the cross, there is no entrance into the presence of God.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   People say, "But God is love." I know, but he's also righteous.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   And you mustn't pit one against the other.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   God is as he is.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   And our modern sentimental notions of love are leading people astray.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   The new and the living way has been opened, consecrated,
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   by the death of the Son of God on the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   But it didn't stop at that.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   He rose again by a new and living way, which he has consecrated for us through the veil,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   that is to say, his flesh, and having a high priest over the house of God.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   He rose again to justify us.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   He's brought life and immortality to light.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   He's ascended. He's passed through the heavens.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   Last Thursday, Ascension Day, I think we ought to observe it,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   to remind ourselves that he literally rose from the dead and passed through the heavens
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   and took his seat at the right hand of God.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   And there he ever liveth and reigneth and maketh intercession for us.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   That's the new and the living way.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   And, my dear friends, it is the only way into the presence of God.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   You can talk about the psychology of prayer,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   and prayer to most people is nothing but a bit of psychology, self-hypnotism, auto-suggestion.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   I remember a man preaching once on what he called "five minutes a day for health's sake,"
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   and he was preaching on prayer.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   What utter rubbish, what utter nonsense, when you put it in the light of the Scriptures.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   Do you know the Son of God came from heaven to earth,
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   suffered all the indignities and the contradiction of sinners against himself,
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   and even the shame and the death of the cross.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   What for? To make it possible for you and for me to go into the very presence of God.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   That's why he did it.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   He came to bring us to God.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   Not primarily to make us happy, thank God he does,
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   but he came not to make us happy, not to heal our bodies, not anything else.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   He does these things incidentally.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   His primary object in coming was to bring us to God,
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   to enable us to pray, to become the children of God,
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   have a right of entry and of access,
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   and enabling us to do so with confidence and boldness and with assurance.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   But I imagine somebody asking, "Is this way certain?"
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   You see, these poor Hebrews, they'd heard all this and they'd believed it,
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   but now they'd been shaken.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   Is it sufficient?
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   Can I venture on this new and living way, even with a holy boldness?
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   You can, says this man. It answers all the questions.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   What about the holiness and the justice and the righteousness of God?
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   Immortal, invisible, God only wise.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of hosts.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   That's what you read, isn't it?
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   Our Lord didn't rush into the presence of his Father,
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   though he was the only begotten Son of God.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   He prayed, "Holy Father."
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   He teaches us to pray, "Our Father,"
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   unless that might lead somebody to be familiar, he says,
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   "Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name."
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   That's the way to pray.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   Well, now then, how can we do this with boldness?
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   Oh, this is the answer.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   I can go along this new and living way, even into the presence of such a being,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   with boldness and confidence and assurance for this reason.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   It is he himself who has made this way.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   It's he who's made it.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   I haven't made it in an attempt to get to him.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   It's God who's made the way.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   He planned it in eternity before the foundation of the world.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   He's brought it to pass. He's done everything.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   It was God who so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   It's God. He's made the way and asks me and invites me to walk along it.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   I can go so, do so with confidence.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   It's God's way.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   And as Paul argues in Romans 8, "If God be for us, who can be against us?"
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   Who shall bring any accusation against us?
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   It is God himself that justifieth.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   Very well, if it's God who justifies and tells me this is the way I do it,
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   I can walk with confidence along this way.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   It's answered my first problem.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   Then I come to the second, my accusing conscience.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   How do I deal with this?
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   It's a very real thing, conscience, isn't it?
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   And you can't argue against conscience.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   It'll go on speaking.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   It'll always have the last word.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   How do I deal with this problem of my conscience and its accusations?
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   And the devil is clever.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   He can turn himself into an angel of light and he can quote scriptures
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   and he can bring me into utter condemnation.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   How can I answer him?
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   I cannot accept that I believe this message.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   And there's only one answer to the accusations of conscience.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   It's this.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   Yes, I am a sinner.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   I have done all the things of which you, my conscience, accuse me.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   But I can tell you this, that those very sins have already received their punishment.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   They were laid upon the Lamb of God by God himself.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   You are quite right.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   I am guilty of these sins and they deserve punishment.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   But I can tell you they have had the punishment.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   They've already been dealt with.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   The record is clear.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   The ledger has been put right.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   So my conscience is silenced.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   If our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts and knows all things.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   That's one of the arguments of John in his first epistle.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   So my second difficulty is solved.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   Then I come to the third.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   This pollution, this pollution which is in our natures.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   I need a clean heart.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   I can never cleanse my heart.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   If you spent the rest of your life in trying to clean your heart, you couldn't do it.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   The pollution is so deep, the stains have eaten into the very vitals.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   No man can cleanse his own heart.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   There's only one way.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   I need a new nature.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   God is holy.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   I'm sinful.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   I've inherited it from Adam.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   I can't change it.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   But I can receive a new birth through Christ.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   It's one of the very central doctrines of this great gospel.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   He said to Nicodemus, "You must be born again and we can receive a new birth."
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   The Holy Spirit can create us anew and we can receive a new nature.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   We become partakers of the divine nature.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   We are the children of God and therefore we can go with boldness.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   As a little child, we'll rush into the presence of his father with a boldness that a serving man or serving woman would never venture to do.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   The child has a claim and he knows that the father is always ready to receive him.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   So he goes with boldness and with assurance.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   There's only one remaining problem and that is the devil.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   He's the accuser of the brethren.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   He's our adversary.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   And there he is, I say, ready to bring us into condemnation.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   How do you deal with that devil, my friends?
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   And this is where people today are so superficial, it seems to me.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   They don't know the devil.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   "We are not ignorant of his devices," says Paul, "and the more one goes on in this life, the more one gets to know about the devil."
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   And I've sometimes suggested that a test of whether a man is a true Christian or not today is to ask him, "Do you believe in the devil?"
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   For if he doesn't believe in the devil, I don't think he believes in God.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   "We wrestle not against flesh and blood," says Paul, "that's bad enough, but against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high or in heavenly places."
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   There is the opposition headed up by the devil.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   How do you answer him?
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   And you can't answer him except in these terms, the new and living way, the great doctrines of salvation that are to be found in the Bible and especially in the New Testament.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   You know how you do it?
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   This is how it's put in the Scriptures.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   A word says in the book of Revelation, "They overcame him," how?
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   "By the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony."
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   Take another one, "Your adversary, the devil, is a roaring lion," says Peter, "is roaming about seeking whom he may devour."
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   How do you resist him?
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   "They whom resist steadfast in the faith."
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   In the doctrine, the doctrines of salvation.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   You cannot resist the devil without doctrine.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   It's impossible.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   That's why doctrine is essential and that's why this man reminds these Hebrews of it and presses it upon them.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   Resist the devil and he'll flee from you.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   But how do you resist him?
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   Only in this way.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   There is no other way that is at all adequate.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   You remember how old John Newton put this.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   And John Newton knew a great deal about the onslaughts and the attacks of the evil one.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   And he put it very beautifully one day, you remember, in a verse of a hymn.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   "Be thou my shield and hiding place that's sheltered near thy side.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   I may my fears accuse of face and tell him thou hast died."
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   That's the only way to settle the devil and to silence him.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   "Tell him that Christ has died for you."
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   And he's speechless.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   "He'll argue with you to his heart's content and he'll beat you at your arguments.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   But you mentioned the blood of Christ to him.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   Tell him that Christ has died for you and he'll give it up.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   He can't say anything."
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   "They overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   I shall my fears accuse of face and tell him thou hast died."
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   My dear friends, this is our only hope at a time such as this.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   The arm of flesh will fail us.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   We dare not trust our own.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   The battle against us is so mighty.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   It's so furious.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   The forces against us are so strong.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   We have but one hope and that is in the Lord and the power of his might.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   Clothed with his armor and praying over it all.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   That the armor may be kept clean and bright.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   Pray without ceasing.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   And then we shall have our victory.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   That men should always pray and not faint.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   We shall not faint on condition that we hold fast as he goes on to say.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   Yes, but don't forget the prayer.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   Prayer is absolutely essential.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   And this is the only way in which it is possible.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   Let us therefore go and come with boldness into the holiest of all.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   By the blood of Jesus.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   This glorious new and living way.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   Go to him in full assurance of faith.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   And he'll hear you.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   And he'll answer you.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   And he'll make you more than conquerors.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   Let us pray.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   Oh Lord our God.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   How can we thank thee sufficiently for this new and living way?
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   Oh forgive us for our folly.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   In so constantly looking back.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   Being tied by traditions and customs and habits.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   That never satisfied anybody.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   And are but a hindrance and a confusion.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   Lord deliver us from this.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   And grant that with the apostle thy servant of old.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   We may say forgetting the things that are behind.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   And looking forward.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   We may press forward together.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   Strong in the Lord.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   And in the power of his might.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   Continue oh God to bless thy faithful people here.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   And this their faithful witness.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   Keep them in thy love above all oh God.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   Let them know this constant access that they can enjoy.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   Into thy holy presence.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   We are weak but thou art mighty.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   Hold us with thy powerful hand.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   Continue then we pray thee to abide in the midst of thy people.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   Manifest thy self to them.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   Lord pour thy spirit upon them.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   Thou has done this in past ages.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   In this very part of this country.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   God of Hugh Bourne and William Close.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   The God of Moe Copp and other places.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   Descend again we pray thee with this spirit of burning.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   Create and kindle a flame in this people.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   That all England may hear of it.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   And come to receive of it.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   We know that with thee all things are possible.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   Numbers are immaterial in thy sight.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   God of the remnant as thou has ever been.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   Be the God of this remnant.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   And so lift them up and endue them with power from on high.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   That they shall be amazed themselves.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   And amaze this country.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   Lord hear our prayer.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   Be with thy faithful servant.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   Who shall conduct the services this afternoon and this evening.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   Thou has blessed him and honored him and used him.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   Use him again.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   Lord descend upon him with great power and authority.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   And be with all who cooperate with him.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   And who stand with him in the open air.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   And in the service here tonight.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   Go on with thy blessed work.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   Oh Lord and unto thee and unto thee alone.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   Shall we give and describe all the praise.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   And all the honor and all the glory.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   Both now and forever.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   Amen.
