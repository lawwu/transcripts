[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.680]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.560]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua Sheets. I
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.800]   am your host. Today on the show, we're going to talk more about tax planning. This is,
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.600]   I guess, the third episode in the show. The first one I did was, "Should you cheat on
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.560]   your taxes to save money?" My answer to that was no. I tried to give two basic arguments
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.840]   for that. Reason number one is when you evade your taxes, when you cheat on your taxes in
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.980]   order to save money, you run the risk of prison. If you care about personal freedom, then one
[00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.520]   of your primary goals is to not do things that could result in your being sentenced
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.600]   to prison. But more importantly, number two, I made the argument that if you become a tax
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.640]   evader, you cheat on your taxes to save money, then you will always be looking over your
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.320]   shoulder and thus you will probably never reach your full potential. You might have
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.200]   the potential to be the kind of guy who could build a $100 million business. But if you
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.680]   are just saying, "I'm not going to pay taxes," then you're going to be building some blue
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.120]   collar business where you can deal in cash instead of a white collar business where you
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.400]   can take digital payments, things like that. This is an important thing to consider.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.720]   Then we talked about how you can make a lot of money and live in the United States tax-free.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.600]   In that show, I talked about the big concept, which is that you have capital gains assets
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.540]   that are growing and then you borrow against those assets, always remembering that debt
[00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.560]   is not income. When you borrow money, you have spendable cash, but it is not income.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.800]   Forgive the thunder in the background if you're hearing that. My mic does a pretty good job
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.400]   with noise canceling, but I'm recording in the midst of an extremely loud thunderstorm
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:22.840]   and the children are in bed. I'm a single father today. My wife is at an appointment.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.080]   I'm a single father working from home while caring for her children recording in the middle
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.240]   of a thunderstorm. That's where we're at today.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.320]   I talked about how, yes, the basic concept of how you can live in the United States,
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.840]   make a lot of money, have capital gains assets, and then borrow money against them because
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.240]   debt is not income. Today I want to pivot and I want to talk about making less money.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.920]   I'm going to record a separate show where I talk about where tax savings should be on
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.540]   your list of priorities. Spoiler alert, it should not be your number one thing. There
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.280]   is no 100% tax bracket. Generally, it's always worth it to make a little bit more money,
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.160]   especially if you make that money in an easy way instead of a sweat of the brow type of
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:12.240]   way. At the end of the day, taxes are only one factor, not the most important factor.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.600]   I think you're better off to target your growth of your wealth and making a lot of money as
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.040]   long as you can do it in an efficient way rather than paying zero tax.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.680]   It's useful to think about paying zero tax. I'll also record a separate show where I talk
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.760]   about paying zero tax for moral reasons, tax resistance, because this is something I've
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.800]   been interested in for a long time and it's going to be something we talk about in today's
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:42.240]   show. The number one reason why you might want to say, "I'm determined to pay no tax,"
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.280]   is because you have some kind of moral reason to pay no tax. It's not a matter of the numbers,
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.520]   but you're saying, "I refuse to pay tax." A classic example of this is those who are
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.680]   war tax resistors in the United States. There can be many other good valid reasons for you
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:04.280]   to protest against taxes. Tax protests and tax strikes are a fundamental effective part
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.000]   of an activist's arsenal, of an activist's toolkit.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.360]   Way back in episode 17 of Radical Personal Finance, I interviewed a man named David Gross,
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.200]   who is an author of a book called 99 Tactics of Successful Tax Resistance Campaigns. We
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.120]   talked about whether you should stop paying taxes on moral grounds. David Gross has a
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.440]   good article that I'm going to be using as we introduce this show to explain how, if
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.160]   you want to pay zero taxes, you can accomplish that by lowering your income.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.320]   When we talk about this, it should be obvious to you. We all know that there are lots of
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.360]   people who live in the United States who pay no federal income taxes. Many estimates are
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.960]   that perhaps half of the population pays no federal income taxes. Now, in fairness, there's
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:57.160]   a lot of confusion about this, because while half of the population pays zero federal income
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.240]   taxes, that doesn't mean that half of the population pays no taxes.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.360]   When we talk about income taxes, we're always balancing these three different tax systems
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.600]   that are the most, that are the tax systems that grab most ordinary people. They are,
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.400]   number one, income taxes on the federal, state, and sometimes local level, but we just talk
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:23.080]   here at this show mainly about federal level taxes. Number two, it is employment taxes,
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.960]   which are the taxes that you pay on your wages in order to support the Social Security and
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:35.000]   Medicare systems. Number three is capital gains taxes. All of these taxes work together.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.080]   You pay all of them, depending on how your financial affairs are structured, but the
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.960]   tax planning that you do is different for each of them.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.640]   While it's true to say that half of the US population doesn't pay federal income
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.040]   taxes, it's not true that half the population doesn't pay taxes, because what that half
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:59.680]   of the population pays a lot of are employment taxes, because employment taxes wind up being
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.840]   what's called a regressive tax system, whereas federal income taxes are a progressive tax
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:11.080]   system. A regressive tax system is a tax system that imposes a greater burden of taxation
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.840]   upon lower income people, whereas a progressive tax system is a tax system that imposes a
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.240]   greater burden upon higher income people.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.600]   You have the employment tax system, which is functionally basically a regressive tax
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:30.160]   system because of the Social Security wage base. On Social Security taxes as part of
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:37.040]   the employment tax system, it's a regressive tax system. Remember that as of 2021, the
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:44.560]   Social Security wage base is $142,800. If you are an employee, you pay 6.2% of your
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:52.960]   wages up to the first $142,800 of income. You pay 6.2% on Social Security, and then
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:59.600]   your boss pays another 6.2% for you. If you're self-employed, you pay 12.4% of your first
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:09.440]   $142,800 of self-employment income. That's a maximum tax of $17,707. If you're self-employed,
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.520]   $8,853 if you are an employee, but that's the maximum for Social Security.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.800]   Now Medicare, it's a bit more complicated because Medicare has two numbers. If you're
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:26.760]   an employee, you pay 1.45% of your wages up to the first $200,000 of wages. Then above
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:33.920]   $200,000, you pay 2.35% of your wages in Medicare taxes. Of course, if you're self-employed,
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:42.280]   then you pay the 2.9% on the first $200,000, and you pay 3.8% on everything above $200,000.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:47.000]   With your Social Security taxes, you have a regressive tax system. For lower wage earners,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.780]   that's going to be a big number. If you're making a million dollars and you pay the max
[00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:57.120]   total as an employee of $8,853, it's not that big of a deal in terms of your overall taxation.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:02.520]   For Medicare, you have something of a flat tax system where it's just as flat 1.45% up
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:08.400]   to $200,000, then it's 2.35%. For income taxes, you have a highly progressive system where
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:13.600]   lower wage earners pay a low rate, high wage earners pay as high as 37% under the current
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:18.280]   tax law, possibly increasing. Then for capital gains taxes, you have something more of a
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:23.760]   flat system. You have a 0% capital gains tax bracket, a 15% capital gains tax bracket,
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.040]   and a 20% capital gains tax bracket, but a little bit flatter than some of these other
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:33.680]   brackets. You're always managing these three tax systems simultaneously, and it's important
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:39.880]   that you specify which particular tax system are we talking about. Each of them has their
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:46.800]   own issues. Let's talk today about federal income taxes. How can you live in the United
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:51.520]   States and reduce your federal income taxes to zero? Well, the answer is don't make very
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:57.440]   much and then use all of the applicable credits and deductions to lower your overall taxable
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:02.920]   burden. I'm going to begin by reading some portions of David Gross's article on this
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:08.040]   subject. Remember, David Gross is a war tax resister, and so his article is called "How
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:13.200]   to Resist the Federal Income Tax by Getting Under the Tax Line." Introduction. This guide
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:18.240]   shows you how to stop paying federal income tax in the United States legally and by the
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.400]   book, by keeping your taxable income low and by qualifying for certain credits. I call
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:28.960]   this the D.O.N. method, short for don't owe nothing. This guide is for people who are
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:33.440]   considering tax resistance but aren't sure how to go about it. It may be useful to people
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:40.840]   who simply want to pay less federal income tax, whatever their motives. Why I wrote this.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.800]   Here's a brief history of how I got interested in this subject and why I thought it was important
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:48.760]   to create this guide. In March of 2003, I decided to stop paying federal income tax
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:53.680]   because I did not want to fund the government's activities. I decided to do this by lowering
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.720]   my taxable income and by taking credits that reduced my income tax burden to zero, what
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:03.320]   I'm calling the D.O.N., don't owe nothing method. I was surprised to learn that I could
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:09.200]   earn quite a bit of income and live very comfortably without paying federal income tax and without
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:15.880]   having to battle the IRS. I could play by their rules and still pay nothing. And then
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.440]   he goes on and talks about some frequently asked questions that would be of interest
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.940]   to people who are interested in tax resistance. I'll link to the article in the show notes,
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:29.000]   but let's talk about the practical of it. How the D.O.N. method works. The D.O.N. method
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.060]   takes two paths. The federal income tax doesn't tax all of your income, just your taxable
[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:39.020]   income. Path number one is to remove as much of your income as possible from the taxable
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:43.940]   income category. Once you've done that, you'll have some taxable income and some amount of
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:49.600]   tax owed on it, but you can offset this tax or even reverse it into a refund by using
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.860]   various credits. Path number two is to qualify for these credits. You use those paths to
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:59.920]   figure out how much money you can earn and spend without owing income tax. Then you look
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:04.040]   at your lifestyle and your goals and adjust them if necessary so that you can live within
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:08.480]   your means at that income level. The remainder of this guide covers this in greater detail
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.920]   by reading this guide. You will be able to investigate for yourself if the D.O.N. method
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:18.500]   will work for you. Path one, get your income out of the taxable income category. When you
[00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:23.960]   fill out a 1040 form, your income cascades through several levels, changing a little
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:30.960]   each time from income to total income, then to adjusted gross income, and finally to taxable
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.080]   income. Each stage gives you the opportunity to prevent some of your income from being
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:41.000]   taxed. From income to total income. Income is just whatever money you brought in during
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.320]   the year, but income according to the IRS is not so simple. Some income is invisible
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.360]   to the tax collector. For example, if you had money deducted from your paycheck to go
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:55.480]   into a 401k retirement account or a health savings account, the IRS doesn't include
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.920]   that money in your income. There are other ways to shield your money from taxes. For
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:04.560]   example, at my last job, I had money withheld from my paycheck to buy my transit passes,
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:08.940]   and that money also did not register as part of my total income. Keep your eye out for
[00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:13.920]   opportunities like this. Ask your employer what pre-tax contributions you could make.
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.040]   Consider switching to a variety of health insurance that qualifies for health savings
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:22.020]   accounts, and then shelter some of your income by saving it to pay health costs. Your total
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:26.080]   income also includes any capital gains you made during the year. For instance, if you
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:31.160]   sold stock or property at a profit, you can also subtract some capital losses when you
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:36.120]   calculate your total income. If you run your own small business or do gig economy work,
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:40.620]   this profit or loss is also part of your total income. Some tax resistors find that having
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:45.100]   such a business helps them to regulate income, and years when income gets too high, they
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:50.160]   invest more money in their business and take a business loss or reduce their business profit.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.600]   You can't run your business at a loss every year though, or the IRS will decide that what
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:58.640]   you've got isn't a business as much as a hobby and your deduction may go away retroactively.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.440]   Among the other things that are part of your total income are interest, dividends, and
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.600]   unemployment compensation. This is just a brief introduction to some of the ways your
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.680]   total income is calculated. I haven't gone into it in much detail because I'm not really
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.200]   qualified to go into specifics about things like business expenses and such a discussion
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:19.920]   would be too long for this guide. From total income to adjusted gross income. Adjusted
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:25.680]   means lowered because all of the adjustments are deductions, so use as many as you can.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:30.320]   Do use your "adjusted gross income" to calculate some of the credits that I cover
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:36.360]   in Path 2 below. And in general, the lower your adjusted gross income is, the better.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:40.040]   One of the best of these deductions is for a tax-deferred individual retirement account
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:44.840]   (IRA). Not only because you can deduct the money you put in, typically up to $6,000 from
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.480]   your total income, but because when you put money into a retirement account you can qualify
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.880]   for a generous credit, which I'll cover in the Path 2 section below. Be aware though
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:57.680]   that there are forms of IRA, such as the Roth IRA, that aren't tax-deferred and that won't
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:02.480]   lower your adjusted gross income. Ask about the tax ramifications before you invest. If
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:06.200]   you run your own business or are otherwise self-employed, you may be able to take deductions
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:10.600]   here on things like your health insurance costs. Depending on the state of the tax law,
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.280]   you may be able to take this as a simple business expense or as a separate tax line item, and
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:18.600]   part of the cost of your payroll taxes. Other deductions are available for interest paid
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:23.080]   on student loans and for educational supplies bought by teachers. These aren't the only
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:27.520]   deductions, and I haven't covered them in much depth or detail. Just an overview.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.640]   From Adjusted Gross Income to Taxable Income
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:35.400]   There is one remaining deduction, either the itemized deduction or the standard deduction.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:40.000]   Once you subtract this, you are left with your taxable income. By itemizing, you can
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.600]   take deductions for things like charitable donations, medical expenses, state taxes,
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.760]   and such. But for most people, the standard deduction is higher than their itemized deductions
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:53.120]   would be, so they're better off taking the standard deduction instead. Once you've
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:57.000]   made this deduction, you have your taxable income, and you can look in the tax table
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.680]   to find out how much you're supposed to pay. But don't get out the checkbook yet,
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.680]   because you're only half done.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:06.160]   Now let's talk about Path 2, Use Credits to Eliminate Your Tax Liability
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.640]   Many tax credits exist. Credits are not deductions that you subtract from your income. Instead,
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.480]   you subtract them directly from the tax you would otherwise owe. For example, if the
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:20.920]   tax table says you owe $750, but you qualify for a $500 credit, you subtract that credit
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:28.960]   directly from the tax. $750 minus $500 equals $250. One credit is for your education expenses.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.600]   Another is for any income tax you've paid to a foreign government. Another is for your
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:37.800]   child care or dependent care expenses. You also get a per-child child tax credit, and
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:42.160]   can also take a credit for any adult dependents you have. My favorite credit is the Retirement
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:46.640]   Savings Contribution credit. Remember how, when you put money into a tax-deferred retirement
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.920]   account, you were able to deduct it from your income before you calculated your tax? Now
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.500]   it gets better. You can take a percentage of the amount you put into retirement accounts
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:59.960]   as a credit as well. If your adjusted gross income is low enough, that percentage is 50%,
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:04.900]   and your credit is as high as $1,000, which cuts your income tax to zero. The Earned Income
[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:10.340]   Tax Credit is a special creature. Most credits allow you, at best, to lower your tax to zero.
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:14.600]   The Earned Income Tax Credit allows you to lower your tax below zero, so that the government
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:19.320]   actually owes you money. This sort of credit is called a refundable credit. In order to
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:24.720]   qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit, your adjusted gross income must be very low,
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.180]   but you must have earned some income during the year. It's easier to qualify if you have
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:32.960]   at least one dependent child. Millions of people qualify for the EITC, but it does typically
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:38.040]   require having a very low income, lower than is strictly necessary for the DON method.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:43.400]   Now he goes on and gives some additional benefits that listeners of this show will be aware
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:48.040]   of. But let's use his example, and then I'll give you some ways to turbocharge these results.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:52.240]   So here's his example. Remember, the goal here is to pay zero taxes while living zero
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:57.080]   - excuse me - the goal here is to pay zero federal income taxes while living in the United
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:04.760]   States. Example. By September, Joe "Tax Me Not" had earned $39,000 at his job. $6,000
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:10.320]   in 401(k) contributions were deducted from his wages, along with $3,500 for his health
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:17.600]   savings account, $400 for pre-tax commuter checks, $3,060 for FICA tax, and $2,000 for
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:22.480]   federal income tax. Then he decided he didn't want to pay federal income tax anymore, and
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:28.200]   he began to try to get that $2,000 back by using the DON method. He quit his job and
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:32.240]   started a business doing freelance manuscript editing. He went through the paperwork and
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:36.200]   fees involved to get a business license, and he put some advertisements in magazines catering
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:41.520]   to authors and scriptwriters. By the time he finished with this, he'd spent $2,750 on
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:46.160]   his new business, but it started to pay off. He got his first of several freelance jobs
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:51.300]   in November, and his first check from a happy client - $1,800 - arrived just before the
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:57.260]   end of the year. He also sold some stock he'd bought. This brought in $1,250 in income,
[00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:02.960]   but he'd bought the stock for $5,000, so he really got hosed - $3,750 in losses. He
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:08.880]   can take $3,000 of those losses as a deduction this year, and save the leftover $750 for
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:18.360]   next year. Income - $39,000. Less 401(k) deduction of $6,000. Less commuter checks of $400. Less
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:26.920]   business expense of $2,750. Plus business income - $1,800. Less capital loss - $3,000.
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:32.520]   Equals $28,650 of total income. Joe's been lowering his expenses because he knew he might
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:37.860]   quit his job, but he's still kind of strapped for cash. He needs to put $6,000 into an IRA
[00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:42.560]   to make the DON method work for him. He does some research and discovers that the IRS will
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:47.740]   let him take credit for putting money into an IRA before he actually makes the contribution.
[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:52.400]   As long as he puts the money in before the tax filing deadline next year. So he declares
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:57.420]   the $6,000 contribution on his tax return in February, but waits until he gets his refund
[00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:02.000]   check from the IRS before he actually makes the contribution.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:10.520]   Total income - $28,650. Less health savings account contribution - $3,500. Less IRA - $6,000.
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:16.900]   Equals $19,150 of adjusted gross income. Joe takes an ordinary standard deduction because
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.720]   when he calculated his itemized deductions, they didn't amount to much. Adjusted gross
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:29.080]   income - $19,150. Minus standard deduction - $12,200. Equals $6,950 of taxable income.
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:36.560]   Joe looks in the tax table for the tax on $6,950. It's $695. He then fills out the
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:42.920]   retirement savings contributions credit form. Because his adjustable gross income is $19,250
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:48.260]   or below, he can take 50% of the first $2,000 that he put into retirement accounts, like
[00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:54.440]   his 401k and IRA, as a tax credit. This is a $1,000 credit. Alas, the IRS won't let
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:58.660]   you take more of this credit than you owe in taxes, so it only eliminates the tax rather
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:04.080]   than converting it into a refund. However, Joe is satisfied and claims victory.
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:12.560]   Tax on $6,950 is $695. Less a retirement savings contribution credit of $695. Equals $0 of
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:18.080]   tax owed. Joe files his return and soon gets a check for $2,000 from the federal government.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.380]   The $2,000 that had been withheld from his wages for income tax. He remembers to put
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:27.080]   that check into his IRA as part of his $6,000 contribution. Over the course of the year,
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:34.760]   he put $12,000 away for retirement, put $3,500 away to pay his medical bills (or for retirement
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:40.560]   if he stays healthy), and spent $2,750 to get his business off the ground. Subtracting
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:45.780]   the FICA that was taken from his paycheck, that's left him with $21,490 to spend however
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:52.320]   he wants, plus a business, plus $12,000 invested to spend in his old age, and $3,500 to cover
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:58.680]   his health insurance deductible if need be. Not too shabby. Wages $39,000, plus stocks
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:05.280]   sold $1,250, plus business earnings $1,800, less retirement savings $12,000, less health
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:14.600]   savings $3,500, less business expenses $2,750, less FICA $3,060, equals $20,740 free and
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:20.640]   clear. Joe figures he can live on $20,740 pretty easily, and can even save up a little
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.400]   bit for when he runs out of that rotten bubble stock and he has to squeeze things a little
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.480]   tighter. He figures he'll probably be pretty good at living on the cheap by then though.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:33.580]   Joe's cousin, Jane, earns only $23,000 a year. By the time her taxes have been withheld
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:38.560]   from her wages, including about $1,200 in federal income tax, she has less free and
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:42.840]   clear take home income than Joe does. She can't believe that Joe, who brought in much
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:47.400]   more money than she did last year, and has all that savings to show for it, doesn't
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:51.280]   have to pay any federal income tax at all. She's going to go through the numbers herself
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.160]   and see if maybe she could try the D.O.N. method too.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:59.480]   So there's the example from David Gross's article on how to resist federal income taxes
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:03.480]   by getting under the tax line. I think it's a good place to start because it demonstrates
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:08.760]   some of the principles involved. Again, separately I'll talk about how much should you prioritize
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:14.320]   this. Someone who's not trying to resist federal income taxes, by the way, in the way that
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:18.160]   David Gross is, would clearly say, "Well, wouldn't it be better to go make $100,000?"
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:24.080]   Well, perhaps. But by understanding this, you can understand how to adjust it.
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.960]   Now let's use some other examples because depending on your personal situation, these
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:33.420]   numbers may be quite modest or they might be much larger. If I were a single man like
[00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:37.280]   I believe David Gross is, he's never commented about being married or having children. If
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:42.120]   I were a single man, I think I could live very comfortably on that amount of money.
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.960]   I wouldn't live in a house. I would probably live in an RV. I'd live kind of a nomad lifestyle
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:50.280]   living modestly. But there are lots of people living very comfortably on $1,500, $2,000
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.920]   a month, seeing the world, et cetera, traveling all around. And that's the kind of thing that
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:58.600]   I would probably do if I were in his situation. However, I'm not. But because I'm not, I have
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:03.840]   a different set of numbers. So let's pretend that I wanted to live in the United States,
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:10.200]   but I was very concerned for moral reasons about paying $0 of tax. I would say, "Listen,
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.420]   I'm not going to earn a million dollars. I'm not going to go black market. I'm not going
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:17.640]   to not pay tax. But I want to live in the United States and I want to, for moral reasons,
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:23.200]   pay $0 of tax. What could I do?" Well, remember, the big difference between David and me is
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:29.680]   I have four children. And so with a $2,000 child tax credit, all of a sudden now my children
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:35.360]   can help me to reduce my taxable burden significantly. So the numbers would change significantly.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:42.680]   So let's play a little game here. Let's begin with this. Let's say that I have a business
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:50.480]   or a series of businesses that generate for me a total of $150,000 of gross profit from...
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:56.080]   Excuse me. Let me rephrase that. Let's assume that I have a couple of businesses that generate
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:03.280]   for me $150,000 of gross revenue into the business, gross revenue. And let's assume
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:08.200]   that I've been thoughtful about the kinds of businesses that I engaged in. And I chose
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:14.040]   the kinds of businesses that allow me to generate my income in a very pleasing way and that
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:19.480]   allow me to shelter the kinds of expenses that are important to me to shelter. Let's
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:26.120]   say, for example, that my wife and I, we have a real estate agency. And she has a real estate
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:30.560]   license and I have a real estate license. And we're real estate investors. And so now,
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:34.600]   because we spend quite a lot of time driving around to show property to clients, we wind
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:41.560]   up doing a decent amount of entertaining. We can use our meals and entertainment expenses
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:45.480]   with our clients to generate more business. We can do all kinds of interesting things.
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:51.120]   We could use our home once a year for a big business party and deduct those expenses.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:56.160]   Our cell phones and our computers and a major portion of our mileage is now deductible.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:00.000]   And we've created something that allows both of us to work in the business. And so now,
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.600]   if we go to a real estate agent seminar in Orlando, we can go to a seminar on Thursday
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:11.800]   and Friday. We can stay over the weekend and go take our children to Disney World, make
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.000]   sure we have meetings scheduled on Monday morning. We could fly home on Tuesday or drive
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.760]   there with take our children. Now we have ample business deductions. All the kinds of
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:23.800]   things that we've talked plenty about here on Radical Personal Finance.
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:31.300]   So let's assume that I have $150,000 of gross revenue, but that I have $30,000 of business
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:36.240]   deductions, business expenses that are associated with generating that revenue, ordinary necessary
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:41.600]   expenses, what the IRS would call them. So that drops my net profit from my business
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:48.960]   from $150,000 to $120,000. Let's assume now that my wife and I put into, let's say we
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:54.320]   set up a solo 401k and she makes contributions to that and I make contributions and we contributed
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:26:01.040]   a total of $25,000 to our 401k for our real estate business that we run together. And
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:08.360]   so now we've taken our $120,000 of net profit and I've lowered that with my personal income
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:17.480]   from $120,000 to $95,000. So we have now $95,000 of wages coming into our household.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:21.960]   So the first thing to keep things very simple that we do is let's assume no other deductions
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:26.200]   at the moment, right? We could do a health reimbursement arrangement program. We could
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:31.280]   set that up in our business that would allow us to deduct all of our kids' medical expenses,
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:35.120]   their orthodontia bills and all kinds of stuff with a health reimbursement arrangement program.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.240]   We could participate in a health savings account. We could do a couple other things.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:44.800]   But let's skip most of that. We have $95,000 of wages and we just simply have a straight
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:52.080]   $95,000 of adjusted gross income. Well, then we take from that the standard deduction for
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:59.520]   a married couple filing jointly, which is $24,800. And you subtract $95,000, you subtract
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:06.920]   out $24,800, which leads us with a household taxable income of $70,200. That's our household
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:13.360]   taxable income. We now take that taxable income over to the tax chart and we wind up with
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:20.920]   $8,032 of tax owed. So the tax chart says that if you have a taxable income for a married
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:29.820]   couple filing jointly of $70,200, you owe $8,032 of tax. Now in this example, with this
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:35.000]   high of an income, some of the other things like the earned income tax credit and other
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.720]   things won't be so significant. But remember, I've got four children, so I can take a child
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:46.480]   tax credit of $2,000 per child. That's a total of $8,000. And now I subtract $8,000
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:52.080]   from my total taxable income, sorry, from my total tax of $8,032, which leaves me with
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:59.400]   a total tax due of $32. So that's pretty close to zero. If I scratched around and dropped
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:04.000]   my income from $95,000 to $94,000, then I could probably do a little bit better. Just
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.400]   was looking for a simple math. And so this can show that I can actually live in the United
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:15.720]   States and if I'm thoughtful about how I put all these things together, notice I emphasized
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:20.800]   having a kind of business that allows me to shelter business deductions that are the kinds
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:26.560]   of things that I would need to, that would make for a pleasing lifestyle. I can, and
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:30.200]   then I use retirement accounts to put money into a retirement account, which I could put
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:36.440]   more than $25,000 if I structure things properly. I can shelter a significant amount of money
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:41.960]   from tax and wind up paying no federal income taxes. So this is a powerful thing. The business
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:46.480]   is not required, right? If I just had $95,000 of wages working for someone, maybe I have
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:51.640]   a, maybe I'm an accountant, right? And I work and my wages are $95,000. Well, in my situation,
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:56.000]   I would wind up owing $0 of federal income tax. And so this is how you do it. And so
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.280]   if you're interested in paying $0 of federal income tax, perhaps you have on moral grounds,
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:05.600]   something like, like David does to be a war tax resistor. This is how you live in the
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:11.360]   United States and pay $0 of federal income tax. Now, how do you turbocharge this? Well,
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:15.960]   I've already mentioned businesses. The way that you turbocharge this is instead of working
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:19.760]   at a job that you don't like, that doesn't give you the opportunity to have many business
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:24.480]   expense, you start your own business. You start a family business. Maybe you're working
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:28.080]   at a salary. Your wife runs an at-home business. You start something that incorporates the
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:33.600]   two of you. You start the kinds of businesses that provide you with the kind of lifestyle
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:38.440]   that you want to live. When I think about it with my personal values, I think about,
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:42.200]   all right, I'm going to start a real estate business where we have a small real estate
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:47.160]   agency, where we sell real estate. We're also going to have a rehab business because now
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:53.080]   that allows my wife and me, we both have business miles. We both have business lunches. We both
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:57.920]   have cell phones. We both have computers. So this covers a lot of our basic needs there.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:01.000]   That allows us because we both work for the same business, we can travel together. We
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.320]   can go to seminars. We can go to educational events. We can go to promote our services.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:09.520]   We would start a number of different things that provided us with the lifestyle that we
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.720]   needed while also still being significantly profitable. If you're thoughtful about the
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:18.640]   kind of business that you start, then you can use it and have quite a lot of completely
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:23.360]   legitimate business deductions for your household.
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:27.280]   The second way that you turbocharge this is by maximizing your retirement contributions.
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:32.560]   Again, back to your own business. Your own business run properly with a properly structured
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:40.480]   solo 401k, which can be a husband and wife solo 401k as well, can allow you to exempt
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:45.840]   up to basically $50,000 a year, a little over $50,000 a year from your wages. So you can
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:50.400]   put a lot of money into retirement accounts to gain the tax deferral. So that's also a
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.760]   really useful thing to keep in mind.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:57.900]   And then you optimize this on the expense side by saying, "How can we live really well
[00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:03.920]   on less money?" Now, a lot of people wouldn't consider $95,000 of wages a little bit of
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:08.080]   money, but still, it's probably less than your capacity. So if you're focused on paying
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:12.820]   a low income, sorry, a low amount of tax, you will want to get good at other things.
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:16.800]   If you were David Gross and you were living low, you would want to figure out a lifestyle
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:22.280]   that allowed you to generate the things that you need at a relatively low cost. How can
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:26.320]   you do that? Well, you can choose some kind of unusual lifestyle. You can choose to lower
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:33.800]   your housing expenses by living in some kind of shared housing. Maybe you work for a farmer
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:38.520]   and the farmer says you can have the little apartments out on the backside of the barn
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:42.240]   and that gives you a comfortable little apartment and that's part of your overall wages. And
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.720]   because you're living there for the convenience of the employer to care for the farm when
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:49.300]   the farmer is not there, you don't have to pay tax on the value of that housing receipt.
[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:53.520]   That would be an example. Perhaps you choose a non-traditional living situation. You live
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:32:01.240]   in an RV, right? You're a van dweller. You live in an RV. You travel around and this
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:06.720]   just lowers your overall costs significantly. Perhaps you live in a paid-off house where
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:10.280]   maybe your dad died and left you a house that you live in and it's totally paid off and
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:15.040]   so your living costs are quite low because of that. Maybe you live in a sailboat and
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:19.720]   so you don't have many costs there and then you figure out how to keep your overall sailing
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.680]   expenses fairly low. I mean there's so many things that you can do. You live in a tent
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:26.760]   in the woods for crying out loud. There's so many things that you can do to keep your
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:33.060]   expenses low on housing. Then you look at your other expense categories. You minimize
[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:38.680]   utility costs through energy efficiency. You minimize your phone costs or your internet
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:42.400]   costs by going to the library. A guy like David Gross, single guy, he could live in
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.800]   a modest apartment. He could work from the apartment, work from a coffee shop, work from
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:51.640]   a library and have relatively low communications expenses while still building his business.
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:56.840]   Perhaps you grow a big garden. Maybe you live on a farm and you grow a big garden that provides
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:00.200]   your family with a lot of food and you raise animals and you butcher your own animals.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:05.360]   Now instead of to provide for your four children, instead of needing to spend $1,500 a month,
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:11.840]   maybe you spend $250 a month but the rest of your labor is just simply non-taxable labor
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:16.680]   for your own personal household. You're cutting wood to heat your house with. You are raising
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:21.760]   your own food, etc. So you can keep your expenses low. So this is a really good solution as
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:26.960]   well. So this is how you turbocharge it if you're committed to living in the United States
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:30.720]   and paying no tax, this is a way that you do it. Now there are other things that you
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:35.560]   can do as well. We've talked about finding income that just simply doesn't exist for
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:40.680]   tax purposes such as income from the sale of a personal residence. If you were wealthy,
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:45.600]   municipal bond income. There are always a few different kinds of income that you can
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:50.840]   do if you're committed to paying no tax. And that's where I want to leave things for now.
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:56.560]   Now should you do this? It depends on your motivation. We'll talk about the philosophy
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:01.040]   in a separate show. But you should know that this is available to you. What is your big
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:06.520]   problem in all of this? Your big problem is that here we've really only dealt with your
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:14.480]   federal income tax. We haven't dealt with that big bite of employment taxes. That would
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:20.800]   be your big cost. Because on that same $95,000 of wages that I used the example, that $95,000
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:26.800]   of wages, if I generated $95,000 of wage, I would have a $32 tax bill, $32 of taxes
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:34.440]   owed. However, if I was an employee generating that, I would wind up with a total tax bill
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:42.400]   of $7,267 by generating that $95,000 for employment taxes, paying for Medicare and
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:49.680]   Social Security. If I were self-employed on that same $95,000, I would wind up with a
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:59.080]   $14,000, oops, excuse me, did the math wrong, 15.3%. I would wind up, yeah, $14,535. So
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:05.680]   that would be my biggest tax bill. How do you avoid employment taxes? Well, you either
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:11.760]   have to not create wages of any kind. So how do you do that? Well, you have a business
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:17.000]   that doesn't generate wages. People will minimize their wages with an S-corporation, where you
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:23.520]   pay out a combination of wages and dividends. So you could lower that with an S-corporation,
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:29.440]   but you can't eliminate it. That's not going to work. Or you can generate income that's
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:36.660]   not wage income, trading, capital gains, profits, or you can leave the country. Or you can work
[00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:41.360]   for an offshore corporation when you've left the country. Then you can eliminate your employment
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:45.560]   taxes. Just always keep in the back of your mind, you've got these three different tax
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:50.280]   systems that you're dealing with, where you're kind of fighting among the three of them.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:55.120]   But that's how you live in the United States and earning a varying amount of income, pay
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:36:02.880]   no taxes. Thanks for listening. As I go today, let me remind you that I am setting up a new
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:06.560]   text messaging system. If you'd like to text me, by the way, you're welcome to ask me any
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:11.800]   question. So far, I've responded to 100% of listeners who've sent me a question. So if
