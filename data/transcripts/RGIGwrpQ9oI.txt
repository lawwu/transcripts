[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320]   there's a lot of historical areas where what is left-wing is not even well-defined.
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.940]   And in that sense, Conquest's law can't even hold there.
[00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.040]   So once I had a debate with Mark Andreessen about this, I think Mark tends to see left-wing,
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.980]   right-wing, wherever your views might be, as somewhat universal historical categories.
[00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.480]   And I very much do not.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.120]   So in medieval times, what's left-wing, what's right-wing?
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.380]   Even 17th century England, there are like particular groups who on particular issues
[00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.900]   are very left or right-wing.
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.800]   It seems to me unsatisfying, and there's a lot of fluidity in how these axes play out
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.280]   over real issues.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.800]   Something insightful I heard from Bernd Hobart is that if the left keeps winning, then just
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.900]   redefine what the left is.
[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.440]   So if you think of prohibition, right, at the time it was a left-wing cause, right,
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.780]   now the opposite of prohibition is a left-wing cause, so then just change what left is.
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.780]   Exactly.
[00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.200]   There seem to be a lot of cases where Conquest's law is not so economical.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.900]   No, Napoleon is a great example of this, where it's not sure whether, is he the most left-wing
[00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.480]   figure in history or the most right-wing figure in history?
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.140]   We both somehow, yes.
