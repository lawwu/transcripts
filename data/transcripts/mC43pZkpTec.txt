[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   Remember George Washington, you know how he died?
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.720]   Well-meaning physicians bled him to death.
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.380]   And this was the most important patient in the country,
[00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.520]   maybe in the history of the country.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.700]   And we bled him to death trying to help him.
[00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.480]   So when you're actually inflating the money supply at 7%,
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.880]   but you're calling it 2% because you wanna help the economy,
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.880]   you're literally bleeding the free market to death.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.400]   But the sad fact is George Washington went along with it
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.920]   'cause he thought that they were gonna do him good.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.920]   And the majority of the society, most companies,
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.440]   most conventional thinkers, the working class,
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.120]   they go along with this because they think
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.820]   that someone has their best interest at mind.
[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.180]   And the people that are bleeding them to death
[00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.880]   believe that prescription because their mental models
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.220]   are just so defective.
[00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.000]   - The following is a conversation with Michael Saylor,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   one of the most prominent and brilliant
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.880]   Bitcoin proponents in the world.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.760]   He is the CEO of MicroStrategy,
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.880]   founder of Saylor Academy, graduate of MIT.
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.440]   And Michael is one of the most fascinating
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.640]   and rigorous thinkers I've ever gotten a chance
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.220]   to explore ideas with.
[00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.240]   He can effortlessly zoom out to the big perspectives
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.480]   of human civilization and human history
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.880]   and zoom back in to the technical details
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.040]   of blockchains, markets, governments,
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.080]   and financial systems.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.080]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.280]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.440]   in the description.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.420]   And now, dear friends, here's Michael Saylor.
[00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.160]   Let's start with a big question of truth and wisdom.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.680]   When advanced humans or aliens or AI systems,
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.240]   let's say five to 10 centuries from now,
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.200]   look back at Earth on this early 21st century,
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.080]   how much do you think they would say we understood
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.920]   about money and economics or even about engineering,
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.240]   science, life, death, meaning, intelligence,
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.880]   consciousness, all the big interesting questions?
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.640]   - I think they would probably give us a B minus
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.560]   on engineering, on all the engineering things,
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.080]   the hard sciences.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.760]   - A passing grade.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.240]   - Like we're doing okay.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.660]   We're working our way through rockets and jets
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.880]   and electric cars and electricity transport systems
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.240]   and nuclear power and space flight and the like.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.240]   And if you look at the walls that grace the great court
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.160]   at MIT, it's full of all the great thinkers
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.020]   and they're all pretty admirable.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.280]   If you could be with Newton or Gauss or Madame Curie
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.280]   or Einstein, you would respect them.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.100]   I would say they'd give us a D minus on economics,
[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.000]   like an F plus or a D minus.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.720]   - You say they have an optimistic vision.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.120]   First of all, optimistic vision of engineering
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.320]   because everybody you've listed, not everybody,
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.840]   most people you've listed is just over the past
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.520]   couple of centuries and maybe stretches a little
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.360]   farther back, but mostly all the cool stuff
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.400]   we've done in engineering is the past couple of centuries.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.100]   - I mean, Archimedes had his virtues.
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.680]   You know, I studied the history of science at MIT
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.920]   and I also studied aerospace engineering.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.800]   And so I clearly have a bias in favor of science.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.680]   And if I look at the past 10,000 years and I consider
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.100]   all of the philosophy and the politics
[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.840]   and their impact on the human condition,
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.280]   I think it's a wash for every politician that came up
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.920]   with a good idea, another politician came up with a bad idea.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.560]   And it's not clear to me that most of the political
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.560]   and philosophical contributions to the human race
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.360]   and the human conditions have advanced so much.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.360]   I mean, we're still taking guidance and admiring Aristotle
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.260]   and Plato and Seneca and the like.
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.260]   And on the other hand, you know, if you think about
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.780]   what has made the human condition better,
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:30.380]   fire, water, harnessing of wind energy,
[00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.620]   try to row across an ocean, right?
[00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.780]   Not easy.
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.580]   - And for people who are just listening or watching,
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.180]   there's a beautiful, sexy ship from 16th, 17th century.
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.360]   - This is a 19th century handmade model
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.520]   of a 17th century sailing ship,
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.120]   which is of the type that the Dutch East India's Company
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.100]   used to sail the world and trade.
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.480]   So that was made, you know, the original was made
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.520]   sometime in the 1600s.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.440]   And then this model is made in the 19th century
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.560]   by individuals.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.260]   - Both the model and the ship itself
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.640]   is engineering at its best.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.140]   And just imagine, just like rockets flying out to space,
[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.100]   how much hope this filled people with.
[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.180]   Exploring the unknown, going into the mystery.
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.680]   Both the entrepreneurs and the business people
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.060]   and the engineers and just humans.
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.080]   What's out there?
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.480]   What's out there to be discovered?
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.720]   - Yeah, the metaphor of human beings leaving shore,
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.640]   sailing across the horizon, risking their lives
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.800]   in pursuit of a better life is an incredibly powerful one.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:40.800]   In 1900, I suppose the average life expectancy is 50.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.060]   During the Revolutionary War, you know,
[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.260]   while our founding fathers were fighting to establish,
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.860]   you know, life, liberty, pursuit of happiness,
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.900]   the constitution, average life expectancy of,
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.880]   it's like 32, somewhere between 32 and 36.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.260]   So all the sound and the fury doesn't make you live past 32,
[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.460]   but what does, right?
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.580]   Antibiotics, conquest of infectious diseases.
[00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.460]   If we understand the science of infectious disease,
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.460]   you know, sterilizing a knife and harnessing antibiotics
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.860]   gets you from 50 to 70, and that happened fast, right?
[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.860]   That happens from 1900 to 1950 or something like that.
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.100]   And I think if you look at the human condition,
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.580]   you ever get on one of those rowing machines
[00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.140]   where they actually keep track of your watts output
[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.980]   when you're on that?
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:35.820]   - Yeah.
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.760]   - Yeah, it's like 200 is a lot.
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.060]   - Okay, 200 is a lot.
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.780]   So a kilowatt hour is like all the energy
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.780]   that a human, a trained athlete can deliver in a day.
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.900]   And probably not 1% of the people in the world
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.180]   could deliver a kilowatt hour in a day.
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.020]   And the commercial value of a kilowatt hour,
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.980]   the retail value is 11 cents today.
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.540]   And the wholesale value is 2 cents.
[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.140]   And so you have to look at the contribution
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.540]   of politicians and philosophers and economists
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.260]   to the human condition.
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.020]   And it's like at best a wash one way or the other.
[00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.620]   And then if you look at the contribution
[00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.880]   of John D. Rockefeller,
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.380]   when he delivered you a barrel of oil,
[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.380]   yeah, and the energy in oil, liquid energy,
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.980]   or the contribution of Tesla, you know,
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.260]   as we deliver electricity,
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.380]   and what's the impact on the human condition
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:43.380]   if I have electric power, if I have chemical power,
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.300]   if I have wind energy,
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.900]   if I can actually set up a reservoir,
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.220]   create a dam, spin a turbine,
[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.060]   and generate energy from a hydraulic source,
[00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.020]   that's extraordinary, right?
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:02.340]   And so our ability to cross the ocean,
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.940]   our ability to grow food, our ability to live,
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:09.000]   it's technology that gets the human race
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   from a brutal life where life expectancy is 30
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.300]   to a world where life expectancy is 80.
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.820]   - You gave a D minus to the economists.
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.660]   So are they too like the politicians,
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:27.020]   a wash in terms of there's good ideas and bad ideas,
[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:31.620]   and that tiny delta between good and bad
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.020]   is how you squeak past the F plus
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.220]   onto the D minus territory?
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.580]   - I think most economic ideas are bad ideas.
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:40.780]   - Most?
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.180]   - You know, like, take us back to MIT,
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:47.380]   and you wanna solve a fluid dynamics problem,
[00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:51.060]   like design the shape of the hull of that ship,
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.100]   or you wanna design an airfoil, a wing,
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.220]   or if you wanna design an engine,
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:01.500]   or a nozzle in a rocket ship,
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.360]   you wouldn't do it with simple arithmetic.
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.680]   You wouldn't do it with a scalar.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.060]   There's not a single number, right?
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.260]   It's vector math, you know,
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.720]   computational fluid dynamics is N-dimensional,
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.320]   higher level math, you know, complicated stuff.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:21.160]   So when an economist says the inflation rate is 2%,
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.460]   that's a scalar.
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.980]   And when an economist says,
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.340]   it's not a problem to print more money
[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:30.420]   because the velocity of the money is very low,
[00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:34.140]   monetary velocity is low, that's another scalar.
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.280]   Okay, so the truth of the matter is,
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.000]   inflation is not a scalar,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.060]   inflation is an N-dimensional vector.
[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.380]   Money velocity is not a scalar.
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:50.320]   Saying what's the velocity of money,
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.740]   oh, it's slow or it's fast,
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.340]   it ignores the question of
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.140]   what medium is the money moving through?
[00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.460]   And the same way that, you know,
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.820]   what's the speed of sound?
[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.140]   Okay, well, what is sound, right?
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:09.260]   Sound, you know, sound is a compression wave,
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.540]   it's energy moving through a medium,
[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.120]   but the speed is different.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.500]   So for example, the speed of sound through air
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.100]   is different than the speed of sound through water.
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.460]   And sound moves faster through water.
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:22.820]   It moves faster through a solid,
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.400]   and it moves faster through a stiffer solid.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.260]   So there isn't one.
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.740]   - What is the fundamental problem
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.220]   with the way economists reduce the world down to a model?
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:33.860]   Is it too simple?
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.940]   Or is it just even the first principles
[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.900]   of constructing the model is wrong?
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:41.920]   - I think that the fundamental problem is,
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.860]   if you see the world as a scalar,
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:47.060]   you simply pick the one number
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:50.620]   which supports whatever you wanna do,
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:55.620]   and you ignore the universe of other consequences
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.220]   from your behavior.
[00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.580]   - In general, I don't know if you've heard of,
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.380]   like Eric Weinstein has been talking about this
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:03.220]   with gauge theory.
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.660]   So different kinds of approaches from the physics world,
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:07.980]   from the mathematical world
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.980]   to extend past this scalar view of economics.
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.100]   So gauge theory is one way that comes from physics.
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:20.820]   Do you find that way of exploring economics interesting?
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.700]   So outside of cryptocurrency,
[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.380]   outside of the actual technologies and so on,
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.420]   just analysis of how economics works,
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.920]   do you find that interesting?
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:33.260]   - Yeah, I think that if we're gonna wanna
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.020]   really make any scientific progress in economics,
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:40.740]   we'll have to apply much more computationally intensive
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.220]   and richer forms of mathematics.
[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.340]   - So simulation perhaps, or?
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.140]   - Yeah, you know, when I was at MIT,
[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.580]   I studied system dynamics.
[00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.180]   You know, they taught it at the Sloan School.
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.700]   It was developed by Jay Forrester,
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:58.700]   who was an extraordinary computer scientist.
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:04.340]   And when we've created models of economic behavior,
[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:08.520]   they were all multidimensional non-linear models.
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:12.100]   So if you wanna describe how anything works
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.140]   in the real world,
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.660]   you have to start with the concept of feedback.
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:19.780]   If I double the price of something, demand will fall
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:23.420]   and attempts to create supply will increase.
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:28.140]   And there will be a delay before the capacity increases.
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.480]   There'll be an instant demand change,
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.220]   and there'll be rippling effects
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.420]   throughout every other segment of the economy,
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.320]   downstream and upstream of such thing.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.500]   So it's kind of common sense,
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.940]   but most economics, most classical economics,
[00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:45.740]   it's always taught with linear models,
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.740]   fairly simplistic linear models.
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:52.740]   And oftentimes even, I'm really shocked today
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:56.860]   that the entire mainstream dialogue of economics
[00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.760]   has been captured by scalar arithmetic.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.460]   For example, if you read, you know,
[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.300]   read any article in New York Times
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:07.640]   or the Wall Street Journal, right?
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:08.540]   They just refer to it.
[00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:11.420]   There's an inflation number or the CPI
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.340]   or the inflation rate is X.
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:17.300]   And if you look at all the historic studies
[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.540]   of the impact of inflation,
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:23.900]   generally they're all based upon the idea
[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:26.220]   that inflation equals CPI.
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.380]   And then they try to extrapolate from that
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.280]   and you just get nowhere with it.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.020]   - So at the very least,
[00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.860]   we should be considering inflation
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.020]   and other economics concept
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.780]   as a nonlinear dynamical system.
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:44.020]   So non-linearity and also just embracing the full complexity
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.580]   of just how the variables interact,
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.140]   maybe through simulation,
[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:50.180]   maybe some have some interesting models around that.
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.460]   - Wouldn't it be refreshing if somebody for once
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:56.260]   published a table of the change in price of every product,
[00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:01.260]   every service and every asset in every place over time?
[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:02.300]   - You said table.
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.060]   Some of that also is the task of visualization,
[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:08.720]   how to extract from this complex set of numbers,
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:13.720]   patterns that somehow indicate something fundamental
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.220]   about what's happening.
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.820]   So summarization of data is still important,
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:22.220]   perhaps summarization not down to a single scale of value,
[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:25.420]   but looking at that whole sea of numbers,
[00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:30.020]   you have to find patterns.
[00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.380]   Like what is inflation in a particular sector?
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.940]   What is maybe a change over time,
[00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.260]   maybe different geographical regions,
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.180]   things of that nature.
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:40.580]   I think that's kind of,
[00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.420]   I don't know even what that task is.
[00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.940]   You could look at machine learning,
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.260]   you can look at AI with that perspective,
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.060]   which is like how do you represent
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.460]   what's happening efficiently,
[00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.060]   as efficiently as possible.
[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.700]   That's never going to be a single number,
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.220]   but it might be a compressed model
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.580]   that captures something beautiful,
[00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.060]   something fundamental about what's happening.
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.660]   - It's an opportunity for sure.
[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:12.500]   If we take, for example, during the pandemic,
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.700]   the response of the political apparatus
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.140]   was to lower interest rates to zero
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:24.660]   and to start buying assets, in essence, printing money.
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.120]   And the defense was there's no inflation.
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:31.940]   But of course you had one part of the economy
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.460]   where it was locked down,
[00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:36.620]   so it was illegal to buy anything.
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.180]   But you couldn't, it was either illegal
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:41.360]   or it was impractical.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.220]   So it would be impossible for demand to manifest.
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.100]   So of course there is no inflation.
[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.820]   On the other hand,
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:51.540]   there was instantaneous immediate inflation
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:53.540]   in another part of the economy.
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:58.180]   For example, you lower the interest rates to zero.
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:01.440]   At one point we saw the swap rate on a 30 year note
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.420]   go to 72 basis points.
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:08.140]   Okay, that means that the value of a long dated bond
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:09.500]   immediately inflates.
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:14.100]   So the bond market had hyperinflation within minutes
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.620]   of these financial decisions.
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.400]   The asset market had hyperinflation.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.300]   We had what you call a K-shape recovery,
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.100]   what we affectionately call a K-shape recovery.
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.640]   Main street shut down,
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.940]   Wall Street recovered all within six weeks.
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.300]   The inflation was in the assets,
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.820]   like in the stocks, in the bonds.
[00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:41.380]   If you look today, you see that a typical house,
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.120]   according to the Case-Shiller Index today
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.720]   is up 19.2% year over year.
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.400]   So if you're a first time home buyer,
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.740]   the inflation rate is 19%.
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:58.740]   The formal CPI announced a 7.9%.
[00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:03.420]   You can pretty much create any inflation rate you want
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.980]   by constructing a market basket,
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.820]   a weighted basket of products or services
[00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.840]   or assets that yield you the answer.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:15.740]   I think that the fundamental failing of economists
[00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.480]   is first of all,
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:22.680]   they don't really have a term for asset inflation.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.700]   Right?
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:25.700]   What's an asset?
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.340]   What's asset hyperinflation?
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:29.760]   You mentioned bond market swap rate
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.300]   and asset is where the majority
[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:33.780]   of the hyperinflation happen.
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.780]   What's inflation?
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:36.820]   What's hyperinflation?
[00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.020]   What's an asset?
[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.340]   What's an asset market?
[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:40.860]   I'm gonna ask so many dumb questions.
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.500]   In the conventional economic world,
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:48.500]   you would treat inflation as the rate of increase in price
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.380]   of a market basket of consumer products
[00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.360]   defined by a government agency.
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.460]   So they have like traditional things
[00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:01.180]   that a regular consumer would be buying.
[00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:05.740]   The government selects like a toilet paper, food,
[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:09.940]   toaster, refrigerator, electronics, all that kind of stuff.
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:14.580]   And it's like a representative basket of goods
[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:18.240]   that lead to a content existence on this earth
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.820]   for a regular consumer.
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.740]   - They define a synthetic metric, right?
[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.360]   I mean, I'm gonna say you should have
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.780]   a thousand square foot apartment
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.820]   and you should have a used car
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:33.180]   and you should eat three hamburgers a week.
[00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:37.460]   Now, 10 years go by and the apartment costs more.
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:40.740]   I could adjust the market basket by,
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.220]   they call them hedonic adjustments.
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:45.100]   I could decide that it used to be in 1970,
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:46.480]   you needed a thousand square feet,
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.480]   but in the year 2020, you only need 700 square feet
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.720]   because we've miniaturized televisions
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.780]   and we've got more efficient electric appliances
[00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:58.620]   because things have collapsed under the iPhone.
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.300]   You just don't need as much space.
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:04.780]   So now, it may be that the apartment costs 50% more,
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:07.460]   but after the hedonic adjustment, there is no inflation
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.260]   because I just downgraded the expectation
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.820]   of what a normal person should have.
[00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.460]   - So the synthetic nature of the metric
[00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:17.520]   allows for manipulation by people in power.
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:18.360]   - Pretty much.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.880]   I guess my criticism of economists
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:25.940]   is rather than embracing inflation
[00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.260]   based upon its fundamental idea,
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.540]   which is the rate at which the price of things go up,
[00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:35.420]   right, they've been captured
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:39.240]   by mainstream conventional thinking
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:44.240]   to immediately equate inflation to the government issued CPI
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:48.300]   or government issued PCE or government issued PPI measure,
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.460]   which was never the rate at which things go up.
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:55.020]   It's simply the rate at which a synthetic basket
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:59.100]   of products and services the government wishes to track
[00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.220]   go up.
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:04.460]   Now, the problem with that is two big things.
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.340]   One thing is the government gets to create
[00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.920]   the market basket and so they keep changing
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.360]   what's in the basket over time.
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.860]   So, I mean, if I said three years ago,
[00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.700]   you should go see 10 concerts a year
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.620]   and the concert tickets now cost $200 each,
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.680]   now it's $2,000 a year to go see concerts.
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:27.060]   Now I'm in charge of calculating inflation.
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:30.860]   So I redefine your entertainment quota for the year
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:33.540]   to be eight Netflix streaming concerts
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:36.660]   and now they don't cost $2,000, they cost nothing
[00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:37.780]   and there is no inflation,
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:39.600]   but you don't get your concerts, right?
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:44.340]   So the problem starts with continually changing
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.460]   the definition of the market basket.
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.100]   But in my opinion, that's not the biggest problem.
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:57.180]   The more egregious problem is the fundamental idea
[00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:00.360]   that assets aren't products or services.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.600]   Assets can't be inflated.
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.800]   What's an asset?
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:08.800]   A house, a share of Apple stock, a bond,
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:15.520]   a Bitcoin is an asset, or a Picasso painting.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.600]   Not a consumable good.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:23.180]   - Not an Apple that you can eat.
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.420]   - Right, if I throw away an asset,
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:30.240]   then I'm not on the hook to track the inflation rate for it.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:34.380]   So what happens if I change the policy such that,
[00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:35.700]   let's take the classic example,
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.260]   a million dollar bond at a 5% interest rate
[00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:41.880]   gives you $50,000 a year in risk-free income.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.260]   You might retire on $50,000 a year
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.840]   in a low cost jurisdiction.
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.840]   So the cost of social security or early retirement
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:54.000]   is $1 million when the interest rate is 5%.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.740]   During the crisis of March of 2020,
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:59.920]   the interest rate on a 10-year bond went to 50 basis points.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:04.000]   So now the cost of that bond is $10 million.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.320]   The cost of social security went from $1 million
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.720]   to $10 million.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.440]   So if you wanted to work your entire life,
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.020]   save money and then retire risk-free
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:18.160]   and live happily ever after on a $50,000 salary,
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:22.000]   live in on a beach in Mexico, wherever you want it to go,
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.360]   you had hyperinflation.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:28.240]   The cost of your aspiration increased by a factor of 10
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.660]   over the course of some amount of time.
[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.400]   In fact, in that case,
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.380]   that was like over the course of about 12 years, right?
[00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:39.520]   As the inflation rate ground down, the asset traded up,
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:43.200]   but the conventional view is,
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.820]   oh, that's not a problem because it's good that assets,
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:49.180]   it's good that the bond is highly priced
[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:51.080]   because we own the bond.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:54.500]   Or what's the problem with the inflation rate
[00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:56.860]   in housing being 19%?
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.860]   It's an awful problem for a 22-year-old
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:01.460]   that's starting their first job,
[00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:03.620]   that's saving money to buy a house,
[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:07.660]   but it would be characterized as a benefit to society
[00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.660]   by a conventional economist who would say,
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.900]   well, housing asset values are higher
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.820]   because of interest rate fluctuation,
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:17.220]   and now the economy's got more wealth.
[00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:20.940]   And so that's viewed as a benefit.
[00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:24.140]   - So what's being missed here,
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:27.260]   like the suffering of the average person
[00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:31.220]   or the struggle, the suffering,
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.360]   the pain of the average person,
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.800]   like metrics that captured that within the economic system.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.020]   Is that, when you talk about-
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:42.480]   - One way to say it is a conventional view of inflation
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.140]   as CPI understates the human misery
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:49.580]   that's inflicted upon the working class
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:54.580]   and on mainstream companies by the political class.
[00:23:54.580 --> 00:24:00.260]   And so it's a massive shift of wealth
[00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:03.100]   from the working class to the property class.
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:07.140]   It's a massive shift of power from the free market
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:11.280]   to the centrally governed or the controlled market.
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.900]   It's a massive shift of power
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:14.900]   from the people to the government.
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:19.900]   And maybe one more illustrative point here, Alexis,
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:23.500]   is what do you think the inflation rate's been
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:24.700]   for the past 100 years?
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:27.740]   - Oh, are we talking about the scalar again?
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.660]   - If you took a survey of everybody on the street
[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:33.300]   and you asked them, what do they think inflation was?
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:34.540]   What is it?
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:36.660]   You remember when Jerome Powell said,
[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:38.780]   our target's 2%, but we're not there.
[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:42.440]   If you go around the corner,
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:46.820]   I have posted the deed to this house sold in 1930.
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:53.420]   Okay, and the number on that deed is $100,000, 1930.
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:58.780]   And if you go on Zillow and you get the Z estimate-
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:00.260]   - Is it higher than that?
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.780]   - $30,500,000.
[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:07.780]   So that's 92 years, 1930 or 2022.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:14.440]   And in 92 years, we've had 305X increase
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.160]   in price of the house.
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.760]   Now, if you actually back calculate,
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:22.420]   you come to a conclusion that the inflation rate
[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:27.420]   was approximately 6.5% a year, every year for 92 years.
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:33.360]   Okay, and there's nobody, nobody in government,
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.040]   no conventional economists that would ever admit
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.600]   to an inflation rate of 7% a year
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.560]   in the US dollar over the last century.
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:45.360]   Now, if you dig deeper, I mean,
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.880]   one guy that's done a great job working on this
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:52.440]   is Saifuddin Amos, who wrote the book, "The Bitcoin Standard."
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.440]   And he notes that on average,
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:57.800]   it looks like the inflation rate and the money supply
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.900]   is about 7% a year, all the way up to the year 2020.
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.900]   If you look at the S&P index,
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:08.180]   which is a market basket of scarce desirable stocks,
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:12.160]   it returned about 10%.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.520]   If you talk to 10% a year for a hundred years,
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:19.320]   the money supply is expanding at 7% a hundred years.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.520]   If you actually talk to economists
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:24.480]   or you look at the economy and you ask the question,
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.280]   how fast does the economy grow
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.920]   in its entirety year over year?
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.640]   Generally about two to 3%.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.800]   Like the sum total impact of all this technology
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:39.160]   and human ingenuity might get you a 2.5, 3% improvement
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:39.980]   a year.
[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:41.240]   - As measured by GDP.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.800]   Is that, are you okay with that?
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.760]   - I'm not sure I'd go that far yet,
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.760]   but I would just say that if you had the human race
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:53.560]   doing stuff, and if you ask the question,
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:56.880]   how much more efficiently will we do the stuff next year
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.480]   than this year, or what's the value of all of our
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.320]   innovations and inventions and investments
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.120]   in the past 12 months?
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.080]   You'd be hard pressed to say we get 2% better.
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:13.600]   Typical investor thinks they're 10% better every year.
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:16.160]   So if you look at what's going on,
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.240]   really when you're holding a million dollars of stocks
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.200]   and you're getting a 10% gain a year,
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:25.440]   you're really got a 7% expansion of the money supply.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:30.040]   You're getting a two or 3% gain under best circumstances.
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.280]   And another way to say that is,
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:36.220]   if the money supply stopped expanding at 7% a year,
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:39.560]   the S&P yield might be 3% and not 10%.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:40.880]   It probably should be.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:46.080]   Now that gets you to start to ask a bunch of other
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.160]   fundamental questions.
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:51.400]   Like if I borrow a billion dollars and pay 3% interest
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.960]   and the money supply expands at 7 to 10% a year,
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:59.960]   and I ended up making a 10% return on a billion dollars
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.920]   investment paying 3% interest, is that fair?
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:07.360]   And who suffered so that I could do that?
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:11.400]   Because in an environment where you're just inflating
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:15.240]   the money supply and you're holding the assets constant,
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:18.520]   it stands to reason that the price of all the assets
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:21.620]   is going to appreciate somewhat proportional
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:23.400]   to the money supply.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.720]   And the difference in asset appreciations
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.720]   is gonna be a function of the scarce desirable quality
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:32.400]   of the assets and to what extent can I make more of them
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:37.400]   and to what extent are they truly limited in supply?
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:41.560]   - Yeah, so we'll get to a lot of the words you said there.
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:46.560]   The scarcity and so connected to how limited they are
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:49.700]   and the value of those assets.
[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.920]   But you also said, so the expansion of the money supply,
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:56.800]   which is put another way is printing money.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.680]   And so is that always bad,
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.600]   the expansion of the money supply?
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.360]   Is this, just to put some terms on the table
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.520]   so we understand them.
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:09.760]   You nonchalantly say it's always on average
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.080]   expanding every year, the money supply's expanding
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.800]   every year by 7%.
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:14.760]   That's a bad thing?
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:17.240]   That's universally a bad thing?
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.080]   - It's awful.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:22.720]   I guess to be precise, it's the currency.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:30.360]   I would say money is monetary energy or economic energy.
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:34.120]   And the economic energy has to find its way into a medium.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:37.320]   So if you wanna move it rapidly as a medium of exchange,
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.420]   has to find its way into currency.
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.960]   But the money can also flow into property,
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.320]   like a house or gold.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.880]   If the money flows into property,
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:50.040]   it'll probably hold its value much better.
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.300]   If the money flows into currency,
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:56.120]   if you had put $100,000 in this house,
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:59.760]   you would have 305X return over 92 years.
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:00.980]   But if you had put the money,
[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:05.260]   $100,000 in a safe deposit box and buried it in the basement,
[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:09.760]   you would have lost 99.7% of your wealth
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.960]   over the same time period.
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:16.000]   So the expansion of the currency
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.140]   creates a massive inefficiency in the society,
[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:22.420]   what I'll call an adiabatic lapse.
[00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:25.620]   What we're doing is we're bleeding
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:28.720]   the civilization to death.
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.180]   - What's the adiabatic, what's that word?
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:33.180]   - Adiabatic lapse.
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:34.240]   - Adiabatic.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.260]   - Right, in aerospace engineering,
[00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:39.580]   you wanna solve any problem, they start with the phrase,
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:41.720]   assume an adiabatic system.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.620]   And what that means is a closed system.
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:48.220]   So I've got a container, and in that container,
[00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:50.460]   no air leaves and no air enters,
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:54.540]   no energy exits or enters, so it's a closed system.
[00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:57.100]   - So you got the closed system lapse.
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:00.660]   - Okay, what's a closed, okay, I'm gonna use a--
[00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:02.020]   - There's a leak in the ship.
[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:04.540]   - I'm gonna use a physical metaphor for you,
[00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:06.020]   'cause you're a jujitsu, right?
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:09.280]   Like you got 10 pints of blood in your body,
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:12.120]   and so before your next workout,
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.020]   I'm gonna take one pint from you.
[00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:17.260]   Now you're gonna go exercise, but you're one pint,
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:21.420]   you've lost 10% of your blood, okay?
[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:22.860]   You're not gonna perform as well,
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:25.380]   it takes about one month for your body
[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.700]   to replace the red blood platelets.
[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:29.980]   So what if I tell you every month you gotta show up
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:31.340]   and I'm gonna bleed you?
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:32.180]   - Yeah.
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:35.660]   - Okay, so if I'm draining the energy,
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:39.420]   I'm draining the blood from your body, you can't perform.
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:42.740]   If you, adiabatic lapse is when you go up in altitude,
[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:45.780]   every thousand feet, you lose three degrees.
[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:50.180]   You go 50,000 feet, you're 150 degrees colder than sea level,
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:53.540]   that's why you look at your instruments
[00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:56.740]   and instead of 80 degrees, you're minus 70 degrees.
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.860]   Why is the temperature falling?
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:01.780]   Temperature's falling because it's not a closed system,
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:02.980]   it's an open system.
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:06.860]   As the air expands, the density falls, right?
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:11.860]   The energy per cubic whatever, you know, falls,
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:16.860]   and therefore the temperature falls, right?
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:18.940]   The heat's falling out of the solution.
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:22.860]   So when you're inflating, let's say you're inflating
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:27.860]   the currency supply by 6%, you're sucking 6% of the energy
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:34.620]   out of the fluid that the economy is using to function.
[00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:37.540]   - So the currency, this kind of ocean of currency,
[00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:39.900]   that's a nice way for the economy to function.
[00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:42.540]   It's the most kind of, it's being inefficient
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.500]   when you expand the money supply,
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:49.340]   but it's the liquid, I'm trying to find the right
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:50.820]   kind of adjective here.
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:54.980]   It's how you do transactions at a scale of billions.
[00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:59.380]   - Currency is the asset we use to move monetary energy
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.020]   around and you could use the dollar
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:04.580]   or you could use the peso or you could use the Bolivar.
[00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:08.100]   - Selling houses and buying houses is much more inefficient.
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:13.100]   Or like you can't transact between billions of people
[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:14.700]   with houses.
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:18.740]   - Yeah, properties don't make such good mediums of exchange.
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:20.820]   They make better stores of value
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:25.100]   and they have utility value if it's a ship or a house
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:29.460]   or a plane or a bushel of corn, right?
[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:31.580]   - Can I zoom out just for, can we zoom out?
[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:33.900]   Keep zooming out until we reach the origin
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:36.260]   of human civilization, but on the way,
[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:39.820]   ask, you gave economists a D minus.
[00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:42.620]   I'm not even gonna ask you what you give to governments.
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:48.620]   Do you think their failure, economists and government failure
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:51.900]   is malevolence or incompetence?
[00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:56.340]   - I think policy makers are well-intentioned,
[00:33:56.340 --> 00:34:00.580]   but generally all government policy is inflationary
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:03.660]   and all government, it's inflammatory and inflationary.
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:06.100]   So what I mean by that is, you know,
[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:11.100]   when you have a policy pursuing supply chain independence
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:15.780]   if you have an energy policy, if you have a labor policy,
[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:19.140]   if you have a trade policy, if you have a, you know,
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:22.900]   any kind of foreign policy, a domestic policy,
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:25.940]   a manufacturing policy, every one of these,
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:29.860]   a medical policy, every one of these policies
[00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:32.180]   interferes with the free market
[00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:36.860]   and generally prevents some rational actor
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:40.100]   from doing it in a cheaper, more efficient way.
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:43.100]   So when you layer them on top of each other,
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.900]   they all have to be paid for.
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:47.820]   If you wanna shut down the entire economy for a year,
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:49.260]   you have to pay for it, right?
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:52.940]   If you wanna fight a war, you have to pay for it, right?
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:55.540]   If you don't wanna use oil or natural gas,
[00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:57.020]   you have to pay for it.
[00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:00.660]   If you don't wanna manufacture semiconductors in China
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:02.500]   and you wanna manufacture them in the US,
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:03.540]   you gotta pay for it.
[00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:06.860]   If I rebuild the entire supply chain in Pennsylvania
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:08.820]   and I hire a bunch of employees
[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:11.460]   and then I unionize the employees,
[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:16.460]   then not only am I, I idle the factory in the Far East,
[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.500]   it goes to 50% capacity.
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:22.300]   So whatever it sells, it has to raise the price on.
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:24.500]   And then I drive up the cost of labor
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.700]   for every other manufacturer in the US
[00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:29.980]   because I'm competing against them, right?
[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:31.220]   I'm changing their conditions.
[00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:33.580]   So everything gets less efficient,
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:35.540]   everything gets more expensive.
[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:37.580]   And of course the government couldn't really pay
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:42.540]   for its policies and its wars with taxes.
[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:44.380]   We didn't pay for World War I with tax,
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:46.140]   we didn't pay for World War II with tax,
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:47.940]   we didn't pay for Vietnam with tax.
[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:50.060]   In fact, when you trace this,
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.740]   what you realize is the government never pays
[00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:54.220]   for all of its policies with tax.
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:56.420]   - 'Cause it's too painful to ask,
[00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:59.980]   to raise the taxes to truly transparently pay
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:02.660]   for the things you're doing with taxes,
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:05.180]   with taxpayer money 'cause they feel the pain.
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:06.660]   - That's one interpretation
[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:08.100]   or it's just too transparent.
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:12.580]   If people understood the true cost--
[00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:15.220]   - Of war, they wouldn't wanna go to war.
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:20.220]   - If you were told that you would lose 95% of your assets
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:23.940]   and 90% of everything you will be ever
[00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:25.780]   will be taken from you,
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:30.180]   you might reprioritize your thought about a given policy
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:32.020]   and you might not vote for that politician.
[00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:35.700]   - But you're still saying incompetence, not malevolence.
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:38.820]   So fundamentally, government creates a bureaucracy
[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:42.100]   of incompetence is kind of how you look at it.
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:44.180]   - I think a lack of humility,
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:49.180]   right, like if people had more humility
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:51.820]   than they would realize--
[00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:53.860]   - Humility about how little they know,
[00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:55.380]   how little they understand
[00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:56.940]   about the function of complex systems.
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:58.660]   - There's a phrase from Quinney's "Towards Movie"
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:36:59.860]   on "Forgiven" where he says,
[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:01.900]   "A man's gotta know his limitations."
[00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:04.060]   (laughing)
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:06.860]   I think that a lot of people overestimate
[00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:12.060]   what they can accomplish and experience,
[00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:17.060]   experience in life causes you to re-evaluate that.
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:20.060]   So I mean, I've done a lot of things in my life
[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:25.060]   and generally my mistakes were always my good ideas
[00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:27.020]   that I enthusiastically pursued.
[00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:31.100]   To the detriment of my great ideas
[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:36.140]   that required 150% of my attention to prosper.
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:39.540]   So I think people pursue too many good ideas.
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.700]   You know, they all sound good,
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:45.620]   but there's just a limit to what you can accomplish.
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:49.660]   And everybody underestimates the challenges
[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:53.460]   of implementing an idea, right?
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:57.540]   And they always overestimate the benefits
[00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:58.500]   of the pursuit of that.
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.100]   And so I think it's an overconfidence
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:05.180]   that causes an overexuberance in pursuit of policies.
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:09.100]   And as the ambition of the government expands,
[00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:11.900]   so must the currency supply.
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:14.300]   You know, I could say the money supply,
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.020]   but let's say the currency supply.
[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:21.340]   You can triple the number of pesos in the economy,
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:25.060]   but it doesn't triple the amount of manufacturing capacity
[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:27.020]   in the said economy.
[00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:29.820]   And it doesn't triple the amount of assets in the economy,
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.140]   it just triples the pesos.
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:35.620]   So as you increase the currency supply,
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:39.540]   then the price of all those scarce desirable things
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:42.460]   will tend to go up rapidly.
[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:47.180]   And the confidence of all of the institutions,
[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:50.220]   the corporations and the individual actors
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:53.500]   and trading partners will collapse.
[00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.300]   If we take a tangent on a tangent
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.420]   and we will return soon
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:00.540]   to the big human civilization question.
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:07.700]   So if government naturally wants to buy stuff
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:12.620]   it can't afford, what's the best form of government?
[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:17.140]   Anarchism, libertarianism.
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:20.100]   So not even, there's not even armies,
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:22.660]   there's no borders, that's anarchism.
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:23.980]   - Not least.
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:25.700]   - The smallest possible.
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:27.580]   The smallest possible.
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:29.380]   - The best government would be the least
[00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:32.100]   and the debate will be over that.
[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:33.740]   - When you think about this stuff,
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:36.140]   do you think about, okay, government is the way it is,
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:39.700]   I as a person that can generate great ideas,
[00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:41.420]   how do I operate in this world?
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:43.340]   Or do you also think about the big picture?
[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:47.460]   If we start a new civilization somewhere on Mars,
[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:50.980]   do you think about what's the ultimate form of government?
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:53.420]   What's at least a promising thing to try?
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.740]   (Lex sighs)
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:40:04.140]   - You know, I have laser eyes on my profile on Twitter, Lex.
[00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:07.660]   - What does that mean?
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:11.620]   - And the significance of laser eyes is to focus
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:14.300]   on the thing that can make a difference.
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:17.820]   And if I look at the civilization,
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:24.220]   I would say half the problems in the civilization
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:28.660]   are due to the fact that our understanding of economics
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:32.260]   and money is defective, half, 50%.
[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:35.460]   I don't know, it's worth $500 trillion worth of problems.
[00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:40.460]   Like money represents all the economic energy
[00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:44.060]   in the civilization and it kind of equates
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:46.380]   to all the products, all the services
[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:49.580]   and all the assets that we have and we're ever gonna have.
[00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:50.860]   So that's half.
[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:54.180]   The other half of the problems in the civilization
[00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:59.180]   are medical and military and political
[00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:04.820]   and philosophical and natural.
[00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:09.740]   And I think that there are a lot of different solutions
[00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:11.060]   to all those problems.
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:16.060]   And they are all honorable professions
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:19.860]   and they all merit a lifetime of consideration
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:22.200]   for the specialist in all those areas.
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:27.780]   I think that what I could offer it's constructive is
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:32.940]   inflation is completely misunderstood.
[00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:37.060]   It's a much bigger problem than we understand it to be.
[00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:40.060]   We need to introduce engineering and science techniques
[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:43.440]   into economics if we wanna further the human condition.
[00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:47.240]   All government policy is inflationary.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:53.260]   And another pernicious myth is inflation is always
[00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:55.860]   and everywhere a monetary phenomena.
[00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:58.420]   A famous quote by Milton Friedman, I believe,
[00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:00.460]   it's like, "It's a monetary phenomena,
[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:03.940]   "that is inflation comes from expanding the currency supply."
[00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:06.860]   It's a nice phrase and it's oftentimes quoted
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:09.160]   by people that are anti-inflation.
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:13.220]   But again, it just signifies a lack of appreciation
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:14.900]   of what the issue is.
[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:18.260]   Inflation is, if I had a currency
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:21.140]   which was completely non-inflationary,
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:23.900]   if I never printed another dollar,
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:26.340]   and if I eliminated fractional reserve banking
[00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:29.980]   from the face of the earth, we'd still have inflation.
[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:33.660]   And we'd have inflation as long as we have government
[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:38.660]   that is capable of pursuing any kind of policies
[00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:41.820]   that are in themselves inflationary
[00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:43.380]   and generally they all are.
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:48.380]   - So in general, inflationary is the big characteristic
[00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:50.940]   of human nature that governments,
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:53.300]   collection of groups that have power over others
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:55.440]   and allocate other people's resources,
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:00.860]   will try to intentionally or not hide the costs
[00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:04.940]   of those allocations, like in some tricky ways,
[00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:07.120]   whatever the options that are available.
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:12.340]   - Hiding the cost is like the tertiary thing.
[00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:16.600]   The primary goal is the government will attempt to do good.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.540]   Right?
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:21.420]   - That's the primary problem?
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:22.660]   - They will attempt to do good
[00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:26.000]   and they will do good imperfectly
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   and they will create oftentimes as much damage,
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.740]   more damage than the good they do.
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:35.420]   Most government policy will be iatrogenic.
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:37.940]   It will create more harm than good in the pursuit of it.
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:39.980]   But it is what it is.
[00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:44.980]   The secondary issue is they will unintentionally pay for it
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:51.020]   by expanding the currency supply without realizing
[00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:56.020]   that they're actually paying for it in a suboptimal fashion.
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:44:01.000]   They'll collapse their own currencies
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.720]   while they attempt to do good.
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:06.800]   The tertiary issue is they will mismeasure
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:09.740]   how badly they're collapsing the currency.
[00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:13.780]   So for example, if you go to the Bureau of Labor Statistics
[00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:16.040]   and look at the numbers printed by the Fed,
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:19.220]   they'll say, "Oh, it looks like the dollar has lost 95%
[00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:21.580]   "of its purchasing power over a hundred years."
[00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:24.900]   Okay, they sort of fess up that there's a problem
[00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:27.940]   but they make it 95% loss over a hundred years.
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:32.660]   What they don't do is realize it's a 99.7% loss
[00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:34.100]   over 80 years.
[00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:38.480]   So they will mismeasure just the horrific extent
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:43.480]   of the monetary policy in pursuit of the foreign policy
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:49.240]   and the domestic policy, which they overestimate
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:53.940]   their budget and their means to accomplish their ends.
[00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:57.420]   And they underestimate the cost.
[00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:02.120]   And they're oblivious to the horrific damage
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:03.920]   that they do to the civilization
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:07.040]   because the mental models that they use
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:10.680]   that are conventionally taught are wrong, right?
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.920]   The mental model that like,
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:14.580]   "It's okay, we can print all this money
[00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:18.820]   "because the velocity of the money is low, right?
[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:21.440]   "Because money velocity is a scalar
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:23.120]   "and inflation is a scalar
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:25.280]   "and we don't see 2% inflation yet
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:26.520]   "and the money velocity is low.
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:29.920]   "And so it's okay if we print trillions of dollars."
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:34.480]   Well, the money velocity was immediate, right?
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.280]   The velocity of money through the crypto economy
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:42.520]   is 10,000 times faster than the velocity of money
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:45.640]   through the consumer economy, right?
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:48.160]   It's like, I think Nick pointed out when you spoke to him,
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:49.640]   he said, "It takes two months
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:52.600]   "for a credit card transaction to settle, right?
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:54.400]   "So you wanna spend a million dollars
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.100]   "in the consumer economy,
[00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:59.080]   "you can move it six times a year.
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:01.400]   "You put a million dollars into gold,
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:04.060]   "gold will sit in a vault for a decade, okay?
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:07.200]   "So the velocity of money through gold is 0.1.
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:09.800]   "You put the money in the stock market
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.340]   "and you can trade it once a week,
[00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:12.920]   "the settlement is T plus two,
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:15.000]   "maybe you get to two to one leverage.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.440]   "You might get to a money velocity of 100 a year
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:20.180]   "in the stock market.
[00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:22.520]   "You put your money into the crypto economy
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:25.660]   "and these people are settling every four hours.
[00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:27.920]   "And if you're offshore,
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:30.240]   "they're trading with 20X leverage.
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:32.720]   "So if you settle every day
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:34.540]   "and you trade the 20X leverage,
[00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:36.320]   "you just went to 7,000."
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:42.660]   So the velocity of the money varies.
[00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:44.300]   I think the politicians,
[00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:46.340]   they don't really understand inflation
[00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:48.280]   and they don't understand economics,
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:50.360]   but you can't blame them
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.840]   because the economists don't understand economics.
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:55.440]   Because if they did,
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:47:00.160]   they would be creating multivariate computer simulations
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:03.440]   where they actually put in the price
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:06.500]   of every piece of housing in every city in the world,
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:09.740]   the full array of foods and the full array of products
[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:12.220]   and the full array of assets.
[00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:14.840]   And then on a monthly basis,
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:17.440]   they would publish all those results.
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:21.940]   And that's a high bandwidth requirement.
[00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:25.180]   And I think that people don't really wanna embrace it.
[00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:28.040]   And also there's the most pernicious thing,
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:30.280]   like there's that phrase,
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:33.420]   you can't tell people what to think,
[00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:35.160]   but you can tell them what to think about.
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:38.400]   The most pernicious thing is,
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:42.760]   I get you to misunderstand the phenomena
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:46.680]   so that even when it's happening to you,
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:48.920]   you don't appreciate that it's a bad thing
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:50.520]   and you think it's a good thing.
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:53.840]   So if housing prices are going up 20% year over year,
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:56.060]   and I say this is great for the American public
[00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:58.580]   'cause most of them are homeowners,
[00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:02.020]   then I have misrepresented a phenomena.
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:05.820]   Inflation is 20%, not 7%.
[00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:08.100]   And then I have misrepresented it
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:11.360]   as being a positive rather than a negative.
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:13.340]   And people will stare at it
[00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:17.580]   and you could even show them their house on fire
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:19.500]   and they would perceive it as being great
[00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:21.020]   because it's warming them up
[00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:23.020]   and they're gonna save on their heat cost.
[00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:25.760]   - It does seem that the cruder the model,
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:28.220]   whether it's economics, whether it's psychology,
[00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:31.160]   the easier it is to weave
[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:33.540]   whatever the heck narrative you want,
[00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:36.180]   and not in a malicious way,
[00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:41.180]   but just like it's some kind of emergent phenomena,
[00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:43.820]   this narrative thing that we tell ourselves.
[00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:46.360]   So you can tell any kind of story about inflation.
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:47.920]   Inflation is good, inflation is bad.
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:49.500]   Like the cruder the model,
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:51.820]   the easier it is to tell a narrative about it.
[00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:52.900]   And that's what the,
[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:55.280]   so like if you take an engineering approach,
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:59.660]   I feel like it becomes more and more difficult
[00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:03.620]   to run away from sort of a true deep understanding
[00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:05.320]   of the dynamics of the system.
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:09.460]   - I mean, honestly, if you went to 100 people on the street
[00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:11.500]   and you asked them to define inflation,
[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:15.540]   how many would say it's a vector tracking
[00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:18.780]   the change in price of every product,
[00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:21.320]   service, asset in the world over time?
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:23.240]   - No. - Not many.
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:24.200]   - Not many.
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:26.700]   - If you went to them and you said,
[00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:31.840]   do you think 2% inflation a year is good or bad?
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:34.600]   The majority would probably say, well, here it's good.
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:36.840]   The majority of economists would say,
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:39.040]   2% inflation a year is good.
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:43.280]   And of course, there's, look at the ship next to us.
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:48.280]   What if I told you that the ship leaked 2%, right,
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:52.360]   of its volume every something, right?
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:54.440]   The ship is rotting 2% a year.
[00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:57.120]   That means the useful life of the ship is 50 years.
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:58.600]   Now, ironically, that's true.
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:02.520]   Like a wooden ship had a 50 year to 100 year life,
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:05.120]   100 would be long, 50 years, not unlikely.
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:07.400]   So when we built ships out of wood,
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:10.740]   they had a useful life of about 50 years
[00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:13.320]   and then they sunk, they rotted.
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:15.120]   There's nothing good about it, right?
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:17.840]   You build a ship out of steel, you know,
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:21.800]   and it's zero as opposed to 2% degradation.
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:25.480]   And how much better is 0% versus 2%?
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:30.320]   Well, 2% means you have a useful life of, you know,
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:32.760]   it's half life at 35 years.
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:35.120]   2% is a half life of 35 years.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:37.760]   That's basically the half life of money and gold.
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:40.420]   If I store your life force in gold,
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:42.240]   under perfect circumstances,
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.960]   you have a useful life of 35 years.
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:48.200]   0% is a useful life of forever.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:51.000]   So 0% is immortal.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.880]   2% is 35 years average life expectancy.
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:59.320]   So the idea that you would think the life expectancy
[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:01.480]   of the currency and the civilization
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:03.600]   should be 35 years instead of forever
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:05.660]   is kind of a silly notion.
[00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:09.640]   But the tragic notion is it was, you know,
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:11.740]   seven into 70 or 10 years.
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:15.000]   The money has had a half life of 10 years,
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.360]   except for the fact that in weak societies
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:21.160]   in Argentina or the like,
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:24.640]   the half life of the money is three to four years,
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:26.680]   in Venezuela, one year.
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:30.480]   So the United States dollar
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:32.520]   and the United States economic system
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:35.040]   was the most successful economic system
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:37.160]   in the last hundred years in the world.
[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:38.640]   We won every war.
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:40.480]   We were the world's superpower.
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:43.840]   Our currency lost 99.7% of its value.
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:46.160]   And that means horrifically,
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:49.880]   every other currency lost everything, right?
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:53.120]   In essence, the other ones were 99.9,
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:55.560]   except for most that were 100%
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:58.080]   because they all completely failed.
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:03.080]   And, you know, you've got a mainstream economic community,
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:07.420]   you know, that thinks that inflation is a number
[00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:09.700]   and 2% is desirable.
[00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:14.420]   It's kind of like, you know,
[00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:16.860]   remember George Washington, you know how he died?
[00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:17.680]   - No.
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:21.300]   - Well-meaning physicians bled him to death.
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:26.220]   Okay, the last thing in the world you would wanna do
[00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:29.820]   to a sick person is bleed them, right?
[00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:30.680]   In the modern world.
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:33.380]   I think we understand that oxygen
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:35.180]   is carried by the blood cells.
[00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:42.820]   And if, you know, there's that phrase, right?
[00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:47.020]   A triage phrase, what's the first thing you do in an injury?
[00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:48.540]   Stop the bleeding.
[00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:49.920]   Single first thing, right?
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:52.420]   You show up after any action, I look at you,
[00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:55.020]   stop the bleeding because you're gonna be dead
[00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:57.860]   in a matter of minutes if you bleed out.
[00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:01.080]   So it strikes me as being ironic
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:03.380]   that orthodox conventional wisdom
[00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:05.340]   was bleed the patient to death.
[00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:07.740]   And this was the most important patient
[00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:11.180]   in the country, maybe in the history of the country.
[00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:14.380]   And we bled him to death trying to help him.
[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:19.140]   So when you're actually inflating the money supply at 7%,
[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:23.540]   but you're calling it 2% because you wanna help the economy,
[00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:28.540]   you're literally bleeding the free market to death.
[00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:32.060]   But the sad fact is George Washington went along with it
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:34.600]   'cause he thought that they were gonna do him good.
[00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:39.600]   And the majority of the society, most companies,
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:45.120]   most conventional thinkers, you know, the working class,
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:47.780]   they go along with this because they think
[00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:50.480]   that someone has their best interest at mind.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:52.840]   And the people that are bleeding them to death
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:57.520]   believe that prescription because their mental models
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:58.680]   are just so defective.
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:03.680]   And their understanding of energy and engineering
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:07.960]   and the economics that are at play
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:11.560]   is crippled by these mental models.
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:13.400]   - But that's both the bug and the feature
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:16.320]   of human civilization, that ideas take hold,
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:18.820]   they unite us, we believe in them.
[00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:23.720]   And we make a lot of cool stuff happen
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:28.720]   by, as an average sort of, just the fact of the matter,
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:31.720]   a lot of people believe the same thing,
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:34.400]   they get together and they get some shit done
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.080]   because they believe that thing.
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:38.720]   And then some ideas can be really bad
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:40.920]   and really destructive, but on average,
[00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:45.160]   the ideas seem to be progressing in a direction of good.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:47.200]   Let me just step back.
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:51.480]   What the hell are we doing here, us humans, on this earth?
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:52.840]   How do you think of humans?
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:54.640]   How special are humans?
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:59.240]   How did human civilization originate on this earth?
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:02.140]   And what is this human project that we're all taking on?
[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:05.720]   You mentioned fire and water,
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:08.600]   and apparently bleeding you to death is not a good idea.
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:11.280]   I always thought you can get the demons out in that way,
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:14.880]   but that was a recent invention.
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:16.980]   So what's this thing we're doing here?
[00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:22.880]   - I think what distinguishes human beings
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:25.640]   from all the other creatures on the earth
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:30.040]   is our ability to engineer.
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:31.880]   We're engineers, right?
[00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:36.880]   - To solve problems or just build incredible cool things?
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:42.200]   - Engineering, harnessing energy and technique
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:44.760]   to make the world a better place than you found it.
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:51.520]   From the point that we actually started to play with fire,
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:53.280]   that was a big leap forward.
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:58.360]   Harnessing the power of kinetic energy and missiles,
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:00.560]   another step forward.
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:04.160]   Every city built on water.
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:05.440]   Why water?
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:08.360]   Well, water's bringing energy, right?
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:13.360]   If you actually put a turbine on a river
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:16.920]   or you capture a change in elevation of water,
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:19.720]   you've literally harnessed gravitational energy.
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:21.880]   But water's also bringing you food.
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:25.960]   It's also giving you a cheap form
[00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:27.880]   of getting rid of your waste.
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:30.400]   It's also giving you free transportation.
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:32.840]   You wanna move one ton blocks around.
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:34.680]   You wanna move them in water.
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:38.220]   So I think, I mean, the human story
[00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:41.640]   is really the story of engineering a better world.
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:47.120]   And the rise in the human condition
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:50.520]   is determined by those groups of people,
[00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:54.160]   those civilizations that were best at harnessing energy.
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:58.360]   If you look, the Greek civilization,
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:02.800]   they built it around ports and seaports and water
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:04.680]   and created a trading network.
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:07.160]   The Romans were really good at harnessing
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:09.660]   all sorts of engineering.
[00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:12.060]   I mean, the aqueducts are a great example.
[00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:14.940]   If you go to any big city,
[00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:16.440]   you travel through cities in the Med,
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:19.640]   you find that the carrying capacity of the city
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:22.720]   or the island is 5,000 people without running water.
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:25.320]   And then if you can find a way to bring water to it,
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:27.560]   increases by a factor of 10.
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:31.480]   And so human flourishing is really only possible
[00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:35.240]   through that channeling of energy, right?
[00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:40.240]   That eventually takes the form of air power, right?
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:44.280]   I mean, that ship, I mean,
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:46.680]   look at the intricacy of those sails.
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:49.320]   I mean, it's just the model is intricate.
[00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:51.840]   Now think about all of the experimentation
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:53.600]   that took place to figure out how many sails
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:55.640]   to put on that ship and how to rig them
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:59.000]   and how to repair them and how to operate them.
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:03.820]   - It's thousands of lives spent thinking
[00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:06.760]   through all the tiny little details,
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:10.040]   all to increase the efficiency of this,
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:12.760]   the effectiveness, the efficiency of this ship
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:14.600]   as it sails through water.
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:16.560]   And we should also note there's a bunch of cannons
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:18.400]   on the side, so obviously.
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:20.840]   - Another form of engineering, right?
[00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:23.640]   Energy harnessing with explosives.
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:24.800]   - To achieve what end?
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:26.640]   That's another discussion, exactly.
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:30.320]   - Suppose we're trying to get off the planet, right?
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:32.260]   - Well, there's a selection mechanism going on,
[00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:33.800]   so natural selection.
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:36.160]   However evolution works,
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:39.420]   it seems that one of the interesting inventions on Earth
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:42.200]   was the predator-prey dynamic,
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:44.180]   that you wanna be the bigger fish.
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:48.520]   That violence seems to serve a useful purpose
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:50.520]   if you look at Earth as a whole.
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:54.120]   We as humans now like to think of violence
[00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:56.000]   as really a bad thing.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.880]   It seems to be one of the amazing things about humans
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:02.600]   is we're ultimately tend towards cooperation.
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:03.780]   We like peace.
[00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:06.980]   If you just look at history,
[00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:08.880]   we want things to be nice and calm.
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:14.920]   But just wars break out every once in a while
[00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:18.000]   and lead to immense suffering and destruction and so on.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.440]   And they have a kinda,
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:26.000]   like resetting the palette effect.
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:27.880]   It's one that's full of just
[00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:31.220]   immeasurable human suffering,
[00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:33.200]   but it's like a way to start over.
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:37.600]   - We're called the apex predator on the planet.
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:40.500]   And I Googled something the other day,
[00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:45.500]   what's the most common form of mammal life on Earth?
[00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:48.740]   - By number of organisms?
[00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:49.980]   - Count. - By count.
[00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:52.700]   - And the answer that came back was human beings.
[00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:54.460]   I was shocked, I couldn't believe it.
[00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:57.540]   It says, apparently, if we're just looking at mammals,
[00:59:57.540 --> 00:59:59.460]   the answer was human beings are the most common,
[00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:01.100]   which was very interesting to me.
[01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:03.500]   I almost didn't believe it,
[01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:04.860]   but I was trying to, you know,
[01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:07.340]   eight billion or so human beings.
[01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:10.300]   There's no other mammal that's got more than eight billion.
[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:13.020]   If you walk through downtown Edinburgh and Scotland
[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:16.900]   and you look up on this hill and this castle up on the hill,
[01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:20.780]   you know, and you talk to people and the story is,
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:23.700]   oh yeah, well, that was a British castle
[01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:25.260]   before it was a Scottish castle,
[01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:26.660]   before it was a Pict castle,
[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:28.380]   before it was a Roman castle,
[01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:31.960]   before it was, you know, some other Celtic castle,
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:32.900]   before it was, you know,
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:35.700]   then they found 13 prehistoric castles
[01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:38.380]   buried one under the other under the other.
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:42.500]   And you get to conclusion that 100,000 years ago,
[01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:45.060]   somebody showed up and grabbed the high point,
[01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:48.140]   the apex of the city,
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:51.500]   and they built a stronghold there and they flourished
[01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.580]   and their family flourished and their tribe flourished
[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:56.580]   until someone came along and knocked them off the hill.
[01:00:56.580 --> 01:01:00.180]   And it's been a nonstop, never ending fight
[01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:04.580]   by the aggressive, most powerful entity,
[01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:08.700]   family, organization, municipality, tribe, whatever.
[01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:09.860]   - All for the hill.
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:14.860]   - For that one hill, going back since time immemorial.
[01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:18.340]   And you know, you scratch your head
[01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:21.940]   and you think it seems like it's like
[01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:24.340]   just this never ending wheel.
[01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:26.620]   - But doesn't that lead, if you just,
[01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:29.780]   all kinds of metrics that seems to improve
[01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:33.180]   the quality of our cannons and ships as a result.
[01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:36.900]   Like it seems that war, just like your laser eyes,
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:39.580]   focuses the mind on the engineering tasks.
[01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:40.420]   - It is that.
[01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:45.220]   And it does remind you that the winner
[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:47.980]   is always the most powerful.
[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:51.100]   And we throw that phrase out,
[01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:53.220]   but no one thinks about what that phrase means.
[01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:56.820]   Like who's the most powerful or the, you know,
[01:01:56.820 --> 01:01:58.420]   or the most powerful side one,
[01:01:58.420 --> 01:01:59.460]   but they don't think about it.
[01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:04.020]   They think about power, energy delivered
[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:05.180]   in a period of time.
[01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:09.460]   And then you think a guy with a spear is more powerful
[01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:10.900]   than someone with their fist.
[01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:13.100]   And someone with a bow and arrow is more powerful
[01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:14.540]   than the person with the spear.
[01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:17.540]   And then you realize that somebody with bronze
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:19.180]   is more powerful than without,
[01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:21.700]   and steel is more powerful than bronze.
[01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:24.020]   And if you look at the Romans, you know,
[01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:26.380]   they persevered, you know, with artillery
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:28.900]   and they could stand off from 800 meters
[01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:31.460]   and blast you to smithereens, right?
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:35.300]   You know, you study the history of the Balearic slingers,
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:36.140]   right?
[01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:37.780]   And, you know, you think we invented bullets,
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:41.060]   but they invented bullets to put in slings
[01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:43.020]   thousands of years ago.
[01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:45.040]   They could have stood off 500 meters
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.240]   and put a hole in your head, right?
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:52.240]   And so there was never a time when humanity wasn't vying
[01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:59.780]   to come up with an asymmetric form of projecting
[01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:02.620]   their own power via technology.
[01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:05.500]   - And absolute power is when a leader is able
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:10.340]   to control a large amount of humans
[01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:13.300]   that are facing the same direction,
[01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:17.380]   working in the same direction to leverage energy.
[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:20.220]   - The most organized society wins.
[01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:21.060]   - Yeah.
[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:24.220]   - When the Romans were dominating everybody,
[01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:27.500]   they were the most organized civilization in Europe.
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:31.640]   And as long as they stayed organized, they dominated.
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:33.820]   And at some point they over expanded
[01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:36.480]   and got disorganized and they collapsed.
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:39.740]   And I guess you could say that, you know,
[01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:41.920]   the struggle of the human condition,
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:45.300]   it catalyzes the development of new technologies
[01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:46.180]   one after the other.
[01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:51.180]   It penalizes anybody that rejects ocean power, right?
[01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:55.100]   It gets penalized, you reject artillery, you get penalized,
[01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:58.140]   you reject atomic power, you get penalized.
[01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:02.440]   If you reject digital power, cyber power, you get penalized.
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:07.380]   And the underlying control of the property
[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:12.140]   keeps shifting hands from, you know, one institution
[01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:15.460]   or one government to another based upon how rationally
[01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:17.760]   they're able to channel that energy
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:20.660]   and how well organized or coordinated they are.
[01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:21.740]   - Well, that's a really interesting thing,
[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:25.020]   about both the human mind and governments,
[01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:27.820]   that they, once they get a few good, and companies,
[01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:31.260]   once they get a few good ideas, they seem to stick with them.
[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:33.300]   They reject new ideas.
[01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:35.540]   It's almost, whether that's emergent
[01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:37.700]   or however that evolved,
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:41.180]   it seems to have a really interesting effect.
[01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:45.340]   'Cause when you're young, you fight for the new ideas.
[01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:49.460]   You push them through, then a few of us humans
[01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:52.900]   find success, then we get complacent,
[01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:55.820]   we take over the world using that new idea,
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:05:00.620]   and then the new young person with the better new idea
[01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:05.020]   challenges you, and you, as opposed to pivoting,
[01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:07.900]   you stick with the old and lose because of it.
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:09.620]   And that's how empires collapse.
[01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:12.460]   And it's just both at the individual level that happens,
[01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:14.460]   when two academics fighting about ideas
[01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:18.940]   or something like that, and at the human civilization level,
[01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:22.900]   governments, they hold on to the ideas of old.
[01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:24.460]   It's fascinating.
[01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:27.980]   - Yeah, an ever persistent theme in the history of science
[01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:29.300]   is the paradigm shift.
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:33.460]   And the paradigms shift when the old guard dies
[01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:35.580]   and a new generation arrives.
[01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:38.460]   Or the paradigm shifts when there's a war,
[01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:43.340]   and everyone that disagrees with the idea of aviation
[01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:45.540]   finds bombs dropping on their head.
[01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:48.500]   Or everyone that disagrees with whatever your technology is
[01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:51.780]   has a rude awakening, and if they totally disagree,
[01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:54.220]   their society collapses and they're replaced
[01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:57.300]   by that new thing.
[01:05:57.300 --> 01:05:59.500]   - A lot of the engineering you talked about
[01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:04.060]   had to do with ships and cannons and leveraging water.
[01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:07.420]   What about this whole digital thing that's happening,
[01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:10.940]   been happening over the past century?
[01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:14.460]   Is that still engineering in your mind?
[01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:18.180]   You're starting to operate in these bits of information.
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:21.620]   - I think there's two big ideas.
[01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:25.580]   The first wave of ideas were digital information,
[01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:27.260]   and that was the internet wave been running
[01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:31.100]   since 1990 or so, for 30 years.
[01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:33.580]   And the second wave is digital energy.
[01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:36.660]   So if I look at digital information,
[01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:41.820]   this idea that we wanna digitally transform a book,
[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:47.660]   I'm gonna dematerialize every book in this room into bits,
[01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:51.740]   and then I'm going to deliver a copy of the entire library
[01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:54.540]   to a billion people, and I'm gonna do it
[01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:58.080]   for pretty much de minimis electricity.
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:03.900]   If I can dematerialize music, books, education,
[01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:07.500]   entertainment, maps, right?
[01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:12.500]   That is an incredibly exothermic,
[01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:16.300]   transaction, it's a crystallization
[01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:18.340]   when we collapse into a lower energy state
[01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:22.620]   as a civilization and we give off massive amounts of energy.
[01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:24.260]   Like if you look at what Carnegie did,
[01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:27.220]   the richest man in the world created libraries everywhere
[01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:29.740]   at the time, and he gave away his entire fortune.
[01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:32.060]   And now we can give a better library
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:34.620]   to every six-year-old for nothing.
[01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:37.900]   And so what's the value of giving a million books
[01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:41.420]   to eight billion people, right?
[01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:44.180]   That's the explosion in prosperity
[01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:46.480]   that comes from digital transformation.
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:51.340]   And when we do it with maps, I transform the map,
[01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:53.380]   I put it into a car, you get in the car
[01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:56.660]   and the car drives you where you wanna go with the map,
[01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:58.660]   right, and how much better is that
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:01.180]   than a Rand McNally Atlas right here?
[01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:03.780]   It's like a million times better.
[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:08.420]   So the first wave of digital transformation
[01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:12.020]   was the dematerialization of all of these
[01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:14.980]   informational things which are non-conservative.
[01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:17.980]   That is, I could take Beethoven's Fifth Symphony
[01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:21.100]   played for by the best orchestra in Germany,
[01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:22.940]   and I could give it to a billion people
[01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:26.680]   and they could play it a thousand times each
[01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:29.300]   at less than the cost of the one performance, right?
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:33.180]   So I deliver culture and education and erudition
[01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:37.660]   and intelligence and insight to the entire civilization
[01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:39.620]   over digital rails.
[01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:41.260]   And the consequences of the human race
[01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:44.740]   are first order, generally good, right?
[01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:47.260]   The world is a better place, it drives growth.
[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:49.740]   And you create these trillion dollar entities
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:51.900]   like Apple and Amazon and Facebook
[01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:54.980]   and Google and Microsoft, right?
[01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:57.020]   That is the first wave.
[01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:58.180]   The second wave--
[01:08:58.180 --> 01:08:59.900]   - Do you mind, I'm sorry to interrupt,
[01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:01.220]   but that first wave,
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:07.920]   it feels like the impact that's positive,
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.640]   you said the first order impact is generally positive.
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:12.360]   It feels like it's positive in a way
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:15.280]   that nothing else in history has been positive.
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:20.280]   And then we may not actually truly be able
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:23.960]   to understand the orders of magnitude
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:28.600]   of increase in productivity in just progress
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.440]   of human civilization
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:32.860]   until we look back centuries from now.
[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:34.600]   It just feels, or maybe,
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:37.920]   like just looking at the impact of Wikipedia.
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:38.760]   - Right.
[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:44.440]   - Giving access to basic wisdom or basic knowledge
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:48.140]   and then perhaps wisdom to billions of people.
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:50.700]   If you can just linger on that for a second,
[01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:53.140]   what's your sense of the impact of that?
[01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:59.940]   - You know, I would say if you're a technologist,
[01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:05.260]   philosopher, the impact of a technology
[01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:08.620]   is so much greater on the civilization
[01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:12.080]   and the human condition than a non-technology
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:14.660]   that it's almost not worth your trouble to bother
[01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:17.340]   trying to fix things a conventional way.
[01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:18.840]   So let's take example.
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:23.220]   I have a foundation, the Sailor Academy,
[01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:27.220]   and the Sailor Academy gives away free education,
[01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:29.780]   free college education to anybody on earth
[01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:31.060]   that wants it.
[01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:33.460]   And we've had more than a million students.
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:36.840]   And if you go and you take the physics class,
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:39.060]   the lectures were by the same physics lecturer
[01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:41.140]   that taught me physics at MIT.
[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:43.780]   Except when I was at MIT,
[01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:46.980]   the cost of the first four weeks of MIT
[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:49.380]   would have drained my family's life,
[01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:52.220]   collective life savings for the first last 100 years.
[01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:53.060]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:56.180]   - Like 100 years worth of my father, my grandfather,
[01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:57.100]   my great-grandfather,
[01:10:57.100 --> 01:10:59.420]   they saved every penny they had after 100 years,
[01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:02.780]   they could have paid for one week or two weeks of MIT.
[01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:05.780]   That's how fiendishly expensive and inefficient it was.
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:08.120]   So I went on scholarship.
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:10.540]   I was lucky to have a scholarship.
[01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:12.580]   But on the other hand,
[01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:16.980]   I sat in the back of the 801 lecture hall
[01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:19.180]   and I was like right up in the rafters.
[01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:20.860]   It's an awful experience
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:23.260]   on these like uncomfortable wooden benches
[01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:25.500]   and you can barely see the blackboard
[01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:28.340]   and you got to be there synchronously.
[01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:30.220]   And the stuff we upload,
[01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:33.100]   you can start it and stop it and watch it on your iPad
[01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:36.380]   or watch it on your computer and rewind it multiple times
[01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:37.880]   and sit in a comfortable chair
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.800]   and you can do it from anywhere on earth
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:42.020]   and it's absolutely free.
[01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:44.460]   So I think about this and I think,
[01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:47.260]   you want to improve the human condition.
[01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:51.780]   You need people with postgraduate level education.
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:53.100]   You need PhDs.
[01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:54.500]   And I know this sounds kind of elitist
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.360]   but you want to cure cancer
[01:11:56.360 --> 01:12:00.980]   and you want to go to the stars, fusion drive.
[01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:02.780]   We need new propulsion, right?
[01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:06.880]   We need extraordinary breakthroughs
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:10.500]   in every area of basic science,
[01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:14.580]   be it biology or propulsion or material science
[01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:16.260]   or computer science.
[01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:18.440]   You're not doing that with an undergraduate degree.
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:22.180]   You're certainly not doing it with a high school education.
[01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:25.580]   But the cost of a PhD is like a million bucks.
[01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:27.880]   There's like 10 million PhDs in the world.
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:29.740]   If you go do the, if you check it out,
[01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:31.420]   there's 8 billion people in the world.
[01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:34.940]   How many people could get a PhD or would want to?
[01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:38.520]   Maybe not 8 billion, but a billion, 500 million.
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:41.220]   Let's just say 500 million to a billion.
[01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:44.400]   How do you go from 10 million to a billion
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:49.400]   highly educated people, all of them specializing in,
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:52.180]   and I don't have to tell you how many different fields
[01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:53.620]   of human endeavor there are.
[01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:56.300]   I mean, your life is interviewing these experts
[01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:59.880]   and there's so many, right?
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:02.140]   You know, it's amazing.
[01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:06.260]   So how do I give a multimillion dollar education
[01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:07.860]   to a billion people?
[01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:09.880]   And there's two choices.
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:12.180]   You can either endow a scholarship,
[01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:15.460]   in which case you pay $75,000 a year.
[01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:18.940]   Okay, 75,000, let's pay a million dollars
[01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:20.780]   and a million dollars a person.
[01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:22.600]   I can do it that way.
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:27.380]   And you're never, even if you had a trillion dollars,
[01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:30.260]   if you had $10 trillion to throw at the problem,
[01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:34.340]   and we've just thrown $10 trillion at certain problems,
[01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:36.780]   you don't solve the problem, right?
[01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:39.380]   If I put $10 trillion on the table and I said,
[01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:41.060]   "Educate everybody, give them all a PhD,"
[01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:42.300]   you still wouldn't solve the problem.
[01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:47.300]   Harvard University can't educate 18,000 people
[01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:51.820]   simultaneously or 87,000 or 800,000 or 8 million.
[01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:54.200]   So you have to dematerialize the professor
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:56.120]   and dematerialize the experience.
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:58.960]   So you put it all as streaming on-demand,
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:02.160]   computer-generated education,
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:03.960]   and you create simulations
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:06.940]   where you need to create simulations and you upload it.
[01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:11.360]   It's like the human condition is being held back
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:16.360]   by 500,000 well-meaning average algebra teachers.
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:20.880]   (Luke laughs)
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:21.720]   I love them.
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:22.840]   I mean, please don't take offense
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:23.900]   if you're an algebra teacher,
[01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:27.360]   but instead of 500,000 algebra teachers
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:31.140]   going through the same motion over and over again,
[01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:35.080]   what you need is like one or five or 10
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:36.840]   really good algebra teachers,
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:39.760]   and they need to do it a billion times a day
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:42.360]   or a billion times a year for free.
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:44.700]   And if we do that,
[01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:49.920]   there's no reason why you can't give infinite education,
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:54.640]   certainly in science, technology, engineering, and math,
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:59.640]   infinite education to everybody with no constraint.
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:01.720]   And I think the same is true
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:03.200]   with just about every other thing.
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:08.200]   If you wanna bring joy to the world, you need digital music.
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:11.680]   If you wanna bring enlightenment to the world,
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:13.540]   you need digital education.
[01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:18.540]   If you wanna bring anything of consequence in the world,
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:20.320]   you gotta digitally transform it,
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:23.000]   and then you gotta manufacture it something like
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.840]   100 times more efficiently as a start,
[01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:31.840]   but a million times more efficiently is probably optimal.
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:34.720]   That's hopeful.
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:36.680]   Maybe you have a chance.
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:39.520]   If you look at all of these space endeavors
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:40.600]   and everything we're thinking about,
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:42.480]   getting to Mars, getting off the planet,
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:44.260]   getting to other worlds,
[01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:45.640]   number one thing you gotta do
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:47.960]   is you gotta make a fundamental breakthrough
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.680]   in an engine.
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:52.320]   People dreamed about flying for thousands of years,
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:56.080]   but until the internal combustion engine,
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:59.360]   you didn't have enough energy,
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:03.320]   enough power in a light enough package
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:05.480]   in order to solve the problem.
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:08.760]   And the human race has all sorts of those
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:13.760]   fundamental engines and materials and techniques
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:16.920]   that we need to master.
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:20.880]   And each one of them is a lifetime of experimentation
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:25.640]   of someone capable of making a seminal contribution
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:27.920]   to the body of human knowledge.
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:29.320]   - There's certain problems like education
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:31.400]   that could be solved through this process
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:32.800]   of dematerialization.
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:37.800]   And by the way, to give props to the 500K algebra teachers,
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:41.320]   when I look at YouTube, for example,
[01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:45.000]   one possible approach is each one of those 500,000 teachers
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.960]   probably had days and moments of brilliance.
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:49.680]   And if they had ability to contribute
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:52.240]   to the natural selection process,
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:55.000]   like the market of education,
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.120]   where the best ones rise up,
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:59.020]   that's a really interesting way,
[01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:03.320]   which is like the best day of your life,
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:05.960]   the best lesson you've ever taught
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:10.960]   could be found and sort of broadcast to billions of people.
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:17.120]   So all of those kinds of ideas
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:19.200]   can be made real in the digital world.
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:21.640]   Now, traveling across planets,
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:26.640]   you still can't solve that problem with dematerialization.
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:28.320]   What you could solve potentially
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:31.200]   is dematerializing the human brain
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:34.520]   where you can transfer, like you don't need
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:36.720]   to have astronauts on the ship.
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:41.120]   You can have a floppy disk carrying a human brain.
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:42.720]   - Touching on those points,
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:45.400]   you'd love for the 500,000 algebra teachers
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:48.440]   to become 500,000 math specialists,
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:52.200]   and maybe they clump into 50,000 specialties as teams,
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:54.840]   and they all pursue 50,000 new problems,
[01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:57.520]   and they put their algebra teaching on autopilot.
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:17:59.920]   That's the same as when I give you
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:02.240]   11 cents worth of electricity,
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:07.240]   and you don't have to row a boat eight hours a day
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:10.320]   before you can eat, right?
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:11.920]   It would be a lot better
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:13.760]   that you would pay for your food
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:15.960]   in the first eight seconds of your day,
[01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:18.860]   and then you could start thinking about other things, right?
[01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:23.760]   With regard to technology,
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:26.520]   one thing that I learned studying technology
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:31.520]   when you look at S-curves is until you start the S-curve,
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:36.880]   you don't know whether you're 100 years from viability,
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:41.680]   1,000 years from viability, or a few months from viability.
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:43.000]   So--
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.080]   - Isn't that fun?
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.440]   That's so fun.
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:48.000]   The early part of the S-curve is so fun,
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.880]   'cause you don't know.
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:54.840]   - In 1900, you could've got any number of learned academics
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:59.040]   to give you 10,000 reasons why humans will never fly, right?
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:01.360]   And in 1903, the Wright brothers flew,
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.960]   and by 1969, we're walking on the moon.
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:08.960]   So the advance that we made in that field was extraordinary,
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:12.520]   but for the 100 years and 200 years before,
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:15.560]   they were just back and forth and nobody was close.
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:19.080]   And that's the happy part.
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:22.960]   The happy part is we went from flying 20 miles an hour
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:27.960]   or whatever to flying 25,000 miles an hour in 66 years.
[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:33.840]   The unhappy part is I studied aeronautical engineering
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:35.840]   at MIT in the '80s,
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:39.320]   and in the '80s, we had Gulfstream aircraft,
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:43.200]   we had Boeing 737s, we had the space shuttle.
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:46.000]   And you fast forward 40 years,
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.120]   and we pretty much had the same exact aircraft.
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:55.400]   The efficiency of the engines was 20, 30% more, right?
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:20:01.480]   We slammed into a brick wall around '69 to '75.
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:07.200]   Like in fact, the Global Express, the Gulfstream,
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:12.000]   these were all engineered in the '70s, some in the '60s.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.880]   The actual, the fuselage silhouette of a Gulfstream,
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:19.360]   of a G5 was the same shape as a G4,
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:22.720]   is the same shape as a G3, is the same shape as a G2.
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:25.160]   And that's because they were afraid to change the shape
[01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:27.880]   for 40 years because they worked it out in a wind tunnel,
[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:29.320]   they knew it worked.
[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:32.400]   And when they finally decided to change the shape,
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:35.400]   it was like a $10 billion exercise
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:40.400]   with modern supercomputers and computational fluid dynamics.
[01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:41.840]   - Why was it so hard?
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:46.440]   What is that wall made of that you slammed into?
[01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:48.160]   - The right question is, so why does a guy
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:50.720]   that went to MIT that got an aeronautical engineering degree
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:52.680]   spend his career in software?
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:56.080]   Like why is it that I never a day in my life,
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:59.240]   with the exception of some Air Force Reserve work,
[01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:01.240]   I never got paid to be an aeronautical engineer
[01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:03.720]   and I worked in software engineering my entire career.
[01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:06.080]   - Maybe software engineering is the new aeronautical
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:07.400]   engineering in some way.
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:12.280]   Maybe you hit fundamental walls in certain,
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:14.640]   until you have to return to it centuries later.
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:17.200]   Or no.
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:19.880]   - The National Gallery of Art was endowed
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:23.400]   by a very rich man, Andrew Mellon,
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.880]   and you know how he made his money?
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:26.720]   Aluminum.
[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:28.640]   Okay?
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:32.520]   And so, and you know what kind of airplanes
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:34.280]   you can create without aluminum?
[01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:36.480]   Nothing.
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:37.680]   Nothing, right?
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:39.600]   - So it's a materialist problem.
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:44.600]   - Okay, so 1900, we made massive advances in metallurgy,
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:47.160]   right, I mean that was US steel,
[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:50.280]   that was iron to steel, aluminum,
[01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:52.520]   massive fortunes were created because this was
[01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:55.640]   a massive technical advance, and then we also had
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:57.920]   the internal combustion engine and you know,
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:01.040]   the story of Ford and General Motors and Daimler,
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:04.480]   Chrysler and the like is informed by that.
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:07.400]   So you have no jet engines, no rocket motors,
[01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:10.600]   no internal combustion engines, you have no aviation,
[01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:12.480]   but even if you had those engines,
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:15.280]   if you were trying to build those things with steel,
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:17.640]   no chance, you had to have aluminum.
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:22.640]   So there's like two pretty basic technologies
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:25.560]   and once you have those two technologies,
[01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:27.620]   stuff happens very fast.
[01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:32.620]   So tell me the last big advance in like jet engines,
[01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:38.380]   there hasn't been one, like the last big advance
[01:22:38.380 --> 01:22:40.300]   in rocket engines, how's it been one?
[01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:43.940]   The big advances in spaceship design from what I can see
[01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:47.220]   are in the control systems, the gyros and the ability
[01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:50.900]   to land, right, in a stable fashion,
[01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:53.620]   that's pretty amazing, landing a rocket.
[01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:58.620]   - Also in the, at least according to Elon and so on,
[01:22:58.620 --> 01:23:03.300]   the manufacture of more efficient
[01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:06.700]   and less expensive manufacture of rockets.
[01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:09.300]   So like it's a production, whatever you call that discipline
[01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:12.380]   of at scale manufacture, at scale production,
[01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:15.340]   so factory work, but it's not 10X.
[01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:18.660]   I mean, maybe it's 10X over a period of a few decades.
[01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:23.660]   - When we figure out how to operate a spaceship,
[01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:27.580]   on the water in your water bottle for a year, right?
[01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:29.380]   Now, then you've got a breakthrough.
[01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:34.380]   So the bottom line is propulsion technology,
[01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:37.780]   propellants and the materials technology,
[01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:40.900]   they were critical to getting on that aviation S curve
[01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:44.740]   and then we slammed into a wall in the 70s
[01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:49.740]   and the Boeing 747, the Global Express, the Gulf Stream,
[01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:52.580]   these things were, the space shuttle,
[01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:54.620]   they were all pretty much reflective of that
[01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:56.620]   and then we kind of, then we stopped
[01:23:56.620 --> 01:23:59.140]   and at that point you have to switch to a new S curve.
[01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:03.780]   So the next equivalent to the internal combustion engine
[01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:07.900]   was the CPU and the next aluminum equivalent was silicon.
[01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:11.420]   So when we actually started developing CPUs,
[01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:13.420]   the transistor gave way to CPUs
[01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:17.260]   and if you look at the power, right?
[01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:20.300]   The bandwidth that we had on computers and Moore's law,
[01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:24.140]   right, what if the efficiency of jet engines
[01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:28.620]   had doubled every three years, right?
[01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:31.220]   In the last 40 years, where we'd be right now, right?
[01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:35.980]   So I think that if you're a business person,
[01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:40.420]   if you're looking for commercially viable application
[01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:44.540]   of your mind, then you have to find that S curve
[01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:47.780]   and ideally, you have to find it
[01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:50.860]   in the first five, six, 10 years
[01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:52.780]   but people always miss this.
[01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:55.660]   Let's take Google Glass, right?
[01:24:55.660 --> 01:25:00.660]   Google Glass was an idea 2013, the year is 2022
[01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:03.740]   and people were quite sure this was gonna be a big thing.
[01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:07.140]   - And it could have been at the beginning of the S curve.
[01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:10.500]   - But fundamentally, we didn't really have
[01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:11.980]   an effective mechanism.
[01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:14.140]   I mean, people getting vertigo and they're--
[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:17.140]   - But you didn't know that at the beginning of the S curve.
[01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:19.980]   Right, I mean, maybe some people had a deep intuition
[01:25:19.980 --> 01:25:23.020]   about the fundamentals of augmented reality
[01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:24.220]   but you don't know that.
[01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:27.740]   You don't have those, you're looking through the fog.
[01:25:27.740 --> 01:25:28.580]   You don't know.
[01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:32.140]   - So the point is, we're year zero in 2013
[01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:34.820]   and we're still year zero in 2022
[01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:37.100]   on that augmented reality
[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:40.500]   and when somebody puts out a set of glasses
[01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:44.820]   that you can wear comfortably without getting vertigo,
[01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:48.060]   right, without any disorientation
[01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:49.900]   that managed to have the stability
[01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:53.660]   and the bandwidth necessary to sync with the real world,
[01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:57.020]   you'll be in year one and from that point,
[01:25:57.020 --> 01:26:01.020]   you'll have a 70 year or some interesting future
[01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:03.420]   until you slam into a limit to growth
[01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:06.420]   and then it'll slow down
[01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:10.540]   and this is the story of a lot of things, right?
[01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:13.260]   I mean, John D. Rockefeller got in the oil business
[01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:18.260]   in the 1860s and the oil business as we understood it,
[01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:22.260]   you know, became fairly mature, you know,
[01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:25.300]   by the 1920s, the '30s
[01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:26.980]   and then it actually stayed that way
[01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:28.340]   until we got to fracking
[01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:30.540]   and which was like 70 years later
[01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:32.620]   and then it burst forward.
[01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:33.460]   So--
[01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:35.100]   - The interesting story about Moore's law though
[01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:39.780]   is that you get this like constant burst of S curves
[01:26:39.780 --> 01:26:41.700]   on top of S curves on top of S curve.
[01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:44.820]   It's like the moment you start slowing down
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:47.300]   or almost ahead of you slowing down,
[01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:50.220]   you come up with another innovation, another innovation.
[01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:52.100]   So Moore's law doesn't seem to happen
[01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:55.780]   in every technological advancement.
[01:26:55.780 --> 01:26:58.740]   It seems like you only get a couple of S curves
[01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:01.020]   and then you're done for a bit.
[01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:02.620]   So I wonder what the pressures there are
[01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:06.140]   that resulted in such success over several decades
[01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:07.420]   and still going.
[01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:10.500]   - Humility dictates that nobody knows
[01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:13.260]   when the S curve kicks off
[01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:17.820]   and you could be 20 years early or a hundred years early.
[01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:22.140]   Leonardo da Vinci, you know, Michelangelo,
[01:27:22.140 --> 01:27:24.900]   they were designing flying machines
[01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:26.340]   hundreds and hundreds of years ago.
[01:27:26.340 --> 01:27:28.460]   So humility says you're not quite sure
[01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:31.500]   when you really hit that commercial viability
[01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:34.740]   and it also dictates you don't know when it ends.
[01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:37.180]   Like when will the party stop?
[01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:39.020]   When will Moore's law stop?
[01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:39.900]   And we'll get to the point
[01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:42.100]   where they're exponentially diminishing returns
[01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:45.580]   on silicon performance.
[01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:48.900]   And just like we got exponentially diminishing returns
[01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:51.900]   on jet engines, you know,
[01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:54.820]   and it just takes an exponential increase
[01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:57.300]   in effort to make it 10% better.
[01:27:57.300 --> 01:27:59.460]   But while you're in the middle of it,
[01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:01.020]   then you know you can do things.
[01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:05.180]   So the reason that the digital revolution is so important
[01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:08.340]   is because the underlying platforms,
[01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:12.260]   the bandwidth of, and the performance of the components,
[01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:17.260]   and I say the components are the radio protocols,
[01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:21.100]   mobile protocols, the batteries,
[01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:26.020]   the CPUs and the displays, right?
[01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:28.380]   Those four components are pretty critical.
[01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:31.380]   They're all critical in the creation of an iPhone.
[01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:33.940]   I wrote about it in the book, "The Mobile Wave,"
[01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:38.140]   and they catalyze this entire mobile revolution.
[01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:41.900]   Because they have advanced and continue to advance,
[01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:45.340]   they created the very fertile environment
[01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:48.860]   for all these digital transformations.
[01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:53.860]   And the digital transformations themselves, right,
[01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:58.260]   they call for creativity in their own, right?
[01:28:58.260 --> 01:29:01.740]   Like, I think the interesting thing about,
[01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:03.860]   let's take digital maps, right?
[01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:05.620]   When you conceptualize something
[01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:08.620]   as a dematerialized map, right,
[01:29:08.620 --> 01:29:13.180]   it becomes a map because I can put it on a display,
[01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:17.300]   like an iPad, or I can put it in a car, like a Tesla.
[01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:20.140]   But if you really want to figure it out,
[01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:21.420]   you can't think like an engineer.
[01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:24.300]   You need to think like a fantasy writer.
[01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:27.060]   Like, this is where it's useful if you studied,
[01:29:27.060 --> 01:29:28.900]   if you played "Dungeons and Dragons"
[01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:30.500]   and you read "Lord of the Rings"
[01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:33.100]   and you studied all the fantasy literature.
[01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:38.100]   Because when I dematerialize the map,
[01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:41.580]   first I put 10 million pages of satellite imagery
[01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:43.540]   into the map, right?
[01:29:43.540 --> 01:29:46.020]   That's a simple physical transform.
[01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:50.940]   But then I start to put telemetry into the map
[01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:53.780]   and I keep track of the traffic rates on the roads.
[01:29:53.780 --> 01:29:55.620]   And I tell you whether you'll be in a traffic jam
[01:29:55.620 --> 01:29:56.500]   if you drive that way.
[01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:58.220]   And I tell you which way to drive.
[01:29:58.220 --> 01:30:00.660]   And then I start to get feedback on where you're going.
[01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:02.100]   And I tell you the restaurant's closed
[01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:03.980]   and people don't like it anyway.
[01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:06.820]   And then I put an AI on top of it
[01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:09.300]   and I have it drive your car for you.
[01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:12.780]   And eventually, the implication
[01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:14.780]   of digital transformation of maps is,
[01:30:14.780 --> 01:30:16.860]   I get in a self-driving car and I say,
[01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:18.860]   take me someplace cool where I can eat.
[01:30:18.860 --> 01:30:21.420]   Yeah.
[01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:23.940]   And how did you get to that last step, right?
[01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:27.500]   It wasn't simple engineering.
[01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:30.540]   There's a bit of fantasy in there, a bit of magic.
[01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:33.380]   - Design, art, whatever the heck you call it.
[01:30:33.380 --> 01:30:34.460]   It's whatever, yeah.
[01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:38.340]   Fantasy injects magic into the engineering process.
[01:30:38.340 --> 01:30:43.340]   Like imagination, like precedes
[01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:46.260]   great revolutions in engineering.
[01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:48.020]   It's like imagining a world,
[01:30:48.020 --> 01:30:51.180]   like of what you can do with the display.
[01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:52.460]   How will the interaction be?
[01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:54.020]   That's where Google Glass actually came in,
[01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:55.860]   augmented reality, virtual reality.
[01:30:55.860 --> 01:31:00.260]   People were playing in the space of sci-fi imagination.
[01:31:00.260 --> 01:31:01.260]   - They called a moonshot.
[01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:02.500]   They tried, it didn't work.
[01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:05.020]   But to their credit, they stopped trying, right?
[01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:06.020]   - And then there's new people.
[01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:06.860]   They keep dreaming.
[01:31:06.860 --> 01:31:09.580]   There's dreamers all around us.
[01:31:09.580 --> 01:31:10.500]   I love those dreamers.
[01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:13.340]   And most of them fail and suffer because of it.
[01:31:13.340 --> 01:31:16.540]   But some of them will win Nobel prizes
[01:31:16.540 --> 01:31:18.620]   or become billionaires.
[01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:20.260]   But what I would say is,
[01:31:20.260 --> 01:31:23.820]   if half the civilization dropped
[01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:25.820]   what they were doing tomorrow
[01:31:25.820 --> 01:31:29.180]   and eagerly started working
[01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:32.580]   on launching a rocket to Alpha Centauri,
[01:31:32.580 --> 01:31:37.700]   it might not be the best use of our resources
[01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:41.500]   because it's kind of like if half of Athens
[01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:44.380]   in the year 500 BC eagerly started working
[01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:46.020]   on flying machines.
[01:31:46.020 --> 01:31:47.300]   If you went back and you said,
[01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:49.100]   what advice would you give them?
[01:31:49.100 --> 01:31:49.940]   - Don't.
[01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:50.940]   - You would say, you know,
[01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:52.780]   it's not gonna work till you get to aluminum
[01:31:52.780 --> 01:31:53.980]   and you're not gonna get to aluminum
[01:31:53.980 --> 01:31:57.380]   till you work out the steel and certain other things.
[01:31:57.380 --> 01:31:58.340]   And you're not gonna get to that
[01:31:58.340 --> 01:32:00.780]   until you work out the calculus of variations
[01:32:00.780 --> 01:32:02.060]   and some metallurgy.
[01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:03.340]   And there's a dude, Newton,
[01:32:03.340 --> 01:32:05.620]   that won't come along for quite a while.
[01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:07.500]   And he's gonna give you the calculus to do it.
[01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:08.980]   And until then it's hopeless.
[01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:12.940]   So you might be better off to work on the aqueduct
[01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:16.180]   or to focus upon sales or something.
[01:32:16.180 --> 01:32:19.080]   So if I look at this today, I say,
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:25.060]   there's massive profound civilization advances
[01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:27.780]   to be made through digital transformation of information.
[01:32:27.780 --> 01:32:29.340]   And you can see them out there.
[01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:31.780]   This is the story of today.
[01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:33.340]   This is not the story of today, right?
[01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:36.020]   It's 10 years old, what we've been seeing.
[01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:38.100]   - We're living through different manifestations
[01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:39.940]   of that story today too, though.
[01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:44.620]   Like social media, the effects of that is very interesting
[01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:46.620]   because ideas spread even,
[01:32:46.620 --> 01:32:48.300]   you talk about velocity of money,
[01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:52.060]   the velocity of ideas keeps increasing.
[01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:55.220]   So like Wikipedia is a passive store.
[01:32:55.220 --> 01:32:57.220]   It's a store of knowledge.
[01:32:57.220 --> 01:33:02.220]   Twitter is like a water hose or something.
[01:33:02.220 --> 01:33:04.500]   It's like spraying you with knowledge
[01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:05.880]   whether you want it or not.
[01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:10.420]   It's like social media is just like this explosion of ideas.
[01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:11.780]   And then we pick them up
[01:33:11.780 --> 01:33:14.180]   and then we try to understand ourselves
[01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:17.660]   because the drama of it also plays with our human psyche.
[01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:21.940]   So sometimes there's more ability for misinformation,
[01:33:21.940 --> 01:33:23.300]   for propaganda to take hold.
[01:33:23.300 --> 01:33:25.300]   So we get to learn about ourselves.
[01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:26.820]   We get to learn about the technology
[01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:29.620]   that can decelerate the propaganda, for example,
[01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:30.640]   all that kind of stuff.
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:32.460]   But like the reality is we're living,
[01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:34.700]   I feel like we're living through a singularity
[01:33:34.700 --> 01:33:37.640]   in the digital information space.
[01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:41.340]   And we don't have a great understanding
[01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:43.900]   of exactly how it's transforming our lives.
[01:33:43.900 --> 01:33:45.860]   - And this is where money is useful
[01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:48.540]   as a metaphor for significance
[01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:53.540]   because if money is the economic energy of the civilization,
[01:33:53.540 --> 01:33:59.340]   then something that's extraordinarily lucrative
[01:33:59.340 --> 01:34:02.500]   that's gonna generate a monetary or a wealth increase
[01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:05.620]   is a way to increase the net energy in the civilization.
[01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:09.300]   And ultimately, if we had 10 times as much of everything,
[01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:12.820]   we'd have a lot more free resources
[01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:15.260]   to pursue all of our advanced scientific
[01:34:15.260 --> 01:34:17.460]   and mathematical and theoretical endeavors.
[01:34:17.460 --> 01:34:19.360]   So let's take Twitter.
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:20.800]   Twitter is something that could be 10 times
[01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:22.040]   more valuable than it is.
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:26.420]   Twitter could be made 10 times better.
[01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:28.620]   - Oh, by the way, I should say that people
[01:34:28.620 --> 01:34:29.460]   should follow you on Twitter.
[01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:30.780]   Your Twitter account is awesome.
[01:34:30.780 --> 01:34:31.620]   - Thank you.
[01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:32.460]   (laughing)
[01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:34.100]   - It could be made 10 times better, yeah.
[01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:36.380]   - Yeah, Twitter can be made 10 times better.
[01:34:36.380 --> 01:34:41.040]   If we take YouTube or take education,
[01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:45.140]   we could generate a billion PhDs.
[01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:49.900]   And the question is, do you need any profound breakthrough
[01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:52.180]   in materials or technology to do that?
[01:34:52.180 --> 01:34:53.860]   And the answer is not really.
[01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:57.460]   Right, so if you wanna, you could make Apple,
[01:34:57.460 --> 01:35:00.840]   Amazon, Facebook, Google, Twitter, all these things better.
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:06.580]   The United States government, if they took 1%
[01:35:06.580 --> 01:35:09.580]   of the money they spend on the Department of Education
[01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:13.060]   and they simply poured it into digital education
[01:35:13.060 --> 01:35:16.500]   and they gave degrees to people
[01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:19.380]   that actually met those requirements,
[01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:22.040]   they could provide 100x as much education
[01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:24.700]   for 1/100th of the cost,
[01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:26.660]   and they could do it with no new technology.
[01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:30.900]   That's a marketing and political challenge.
[01:35:30.900 --> 01:35:35.900]   So I don't think every objective is equally practical.
[01:35:35.900 --> 01:35:39.300]   And I think the benefit of being an engineer
[01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:44.020]   or thinking about practical achievements
[01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:49.020]   is when the government pursues an impractical objective
[01:35:49.020 --> 01:35:53.260]   or when anybody, an entrepreneur,
[01:35:53.260 --> 01:35:54.420]   not so bad with an entrepreneur
[01:35:54.420 --> 01:35:56.020]   'cause they don't have that much money to waste.
[01:35:56.020 --> 01:35:58.840]   When a government pursues an impractical objective,
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:01.460]   they squander trillions and trillions of dollars
[01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:02.860]   and achieve nothing.
[01:36:02.860 --> 01:36:06.300]   Whereas if they pursue a practical objective
[01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:11.140]   or if they simply get out of the way and do nothing
[01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:12.980]   and they allow the free market
[01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:15.180]   to pursue the practical objectives,
[01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:17.980]   then I think you can have profound impact
[01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:20.260]   on the human civilization.
[01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:25.260]   And if I look at the world we're in today,
[01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:30.500]   I think that there are multi-trillion,
[01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:35.860]   10, 20, $50 trillion worth of opportunities
[01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:40.000]   in the digital information realm yet to be obtained.
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:45.300]   But there's hundreds of trillions of dollars
[01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:49.100]   of opportunities in the digital energy realm
[01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:52.460]   that not only are they not obtained,
[01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:54.740]   the majority of people don't even know
[01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:56.320]   what digital energy is.
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:58.540]   Most of them would reject the concept.
[01:36:58.540 --> 01:37:00.820]   They're not looking for it.
[01:37:00.820 --> 01:37:02.660]   They're not expecting to find it.
[01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:05.900]   It's inconceivable because it is a paradigm shift.
[01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:08.820]   But in fact, it's completely practical,
[01:37:08.820 --> 01:37:10.740]   right under our nose.
[01:37:10.740 --> 01:37:13.000]   It's staring at us and it could make
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:16.860]   the entire civilization work dramatically better
[01:37:16.860 --> 01:37:18.900]   in every respect.
[01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:22.260]   - So you mentioned in the digital world,
[01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:27.100]   digital information is one, digital energy is two,
[01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:30.900]   and the possible impact on the world
[01:37:30.900 --> 01:37:33.300]   and the set of opportunities available
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:36.260]   in the digital energy space is much greater.
[01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:39.340]   So how do you think about digital energy?
[01:37:39.340 --> 01:37:40.160]   What is it?
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:44.140]   - So I'll start with Tesla.
[01:37:44.140 --> 01:37:45.360]   He had a very famous quote.
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:47.220]   He said, "If you want to understand the universe,
[01:37:47.220 --> 01:37:50.820]   "think in terms of energy, vibration, and frequency."
[01:37:50.820 --> 01:37:55.780]   And it gets you thinking about what is the universe.
[01:37:55.780 --> 01:37:58.860]   And of course, the universe is just all energy.
[01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:00.580]   And then what is matter?
[01:38:00.580 --> 01:38:03.780]   Matter is low frequency energy.
[01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:05.740]   And what are we?
[01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:10.180]   We're vibrating from ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
[01:38:10.180 --> 01:38:13.100]   I can turn a tree into light.
[01:38:13.100 --> 01:38:16.340]   I can turn light back into a tree.
[01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:19.220]   If I consider the entire universe,
[01:38:19.220 --> 01:38:21.460]   and it's very important because we don't really
[01:38:21.460 --> 01:38:25.640]   think this way, let's take the New York disco model.
[01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:30.460]   If I walk into a nightclub and there's loud music blaring
[01:38:30.460 --> 01:38:34.540]   in New York City, what's really going on there?
[01:38:34.540 --> 01:38:39.140]   If you blast out 14 billion years ago,
[01:38:39.140 --> 01:38:40.860]   the universe is formed.
[01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:43.860]   Okay, that's a low frequency thing, the universe.
[01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:45.360]   Four and a half billion years ago,
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:47.660]   the sun, maybe the earth are formed.
[01:38:47.660 --> 01:38:51.140]   The continents are 400 million years old.
[01:38:51.140 --> 01:38:53.500]   The schist that New York City is on
[01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:55.940]   is some hundreds of millions of years.
[01:38:55.940 --> 01:38:58.940]   But the Hudson River is only 20,000 years.
[01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:02.540]   There's a building that's probably 50 years old.
[01:39:02.540 --> 01:39:06.100]   There's a company operating that disco or that club,
[01:39:06.100 --> 01:39:08.760]   which is five to 10 years old.
[01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:11.180]   There's a person, a customer walking in there
[01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:13.900]   for an experience for a few hours.
[01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:18.900]   There's music that's oscillating at some kilohertz
[01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:20.860]   and then there's light.
[01:39:20.860 --> 01:39:25.860]   And you have all forms of energy, all frequencies,
[01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:29.620]   right, all layered, all moving through different medium.
[01:39:29.620 --> 01:39:33.060]   And how you perceive the world is a question of
[01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:36.980]   at what frequency do you wanna perceive the world?
[01:39:36.980 --> 01:39:41.980]   And I think that once you start to think that way,
[01:39:41.980 --> 01:39:46.260]   you're catalyzed to think about
[01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:48.140]   what would digital energy look like
[01:39:48.140 --> 01:39:51.460]   and why would I want it?
[01:39:51.460 --> 01:39:54.140]   And what is it?
[01:39:54.140 --> 01:39:57.100]   So why don't we just start right there.
[01:39:57.100 --> 01:39:58.620]   What is it?
[01:39:58.620 --> 01:40:02.780]   The most famous manifestation of digital energy is Bitcoin.
[01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:05.040]   Bitcoin's a crypto asset.
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:08.220]   It's a crypto asset that has monetary value.
[01:40:08.220 --> 01:40:09.820]   - Can we just linger on that?
[01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:12.940]   Bitcoin is a,
[01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:17.680]   so it's a digital asset that has monetary value.
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:20.380]   What is a digital asset?
[01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:21.260]   What is monetary?
[01:40:21.260 --> 01:40:26.260]   Why use those terms versus the words of money and currency?
[01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:29.020]   Is there something interesting in that disambiguation
[01:40:29.020 --> 01:40:30.580]   of different terms?
[01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:33.440]   - I'd call it a crypto asset network.
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:38.220]   The goal is to create a billion dollar block
[01:40:38.220 --> 01:40:41.420]   of pure energy in cyberspace.
[01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:46.900]   One that I could then move with no friction
[01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:49.320]   at the speed of light, right?
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:54.260]   It's the equivalent to putting a million pounds in orbit.
[01:40:54.260 --> 01:40:59.260]   How do I actually launch something into orbit, right?
[01:40:59.260 --> 01:41:01.940]   How do I launch something into cyberspace
[01:41:01.940 --> 01:41:03.860]   such that it moves friction-free?
[01:41:03.860 --> 01:41:08.540]   And the solution is a decentralized
[01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:10.060]   proof of work network, right?
[01:41:10.060 --> 01:41:12.340]   Satoshi's solution was,
[01:41:12.340 --> 01:41:14.720]   I'm going to establish a protocol
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:17.440]   running on a distributed set of computers
[01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:19.940]   that will maintain a constant supply
[01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:22.740]   of never more than 21 million Bitcoin
[01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:26.860]   sub-dividable by a hundred million Satoshi's each,
[01:41:26.860 --> 01:41:31.340]   transferable via transferring private keys.
[01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:34.940]   Now, the innovation is
[01:41:34.940 --> 01:41:39.220]   to create that in a
[01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:45.300]   ethical, durable fashion, right?
[01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:47.080]   The ethical innovation is,
[01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:50.120]   I want it to be property and not a security.
[01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:53.500]   A bushel of corn, an acre of land,
[01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:57.000]   a stack of lumber and a bar of gold
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.480]   and a Bitcoin are all property.
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:03.000]   And that means they're all commonly occurring elements
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:03.880]   in the world.
[01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:05.320]   You could call them commodities,
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:07.400]   but commodity is a little bit misleading.
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:09.000]   And I'll tell you why in a second,
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.720]   but they're all distinguished by the fact
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:15.720]   that no one entity or person or government controls them.
[01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:19.500]   If you have a barrel of oil and you're in Ukraine
[01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:23.600]   versus Russia versus Saudi Arabia versus the US,
[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:27.520]   you have a barrel of oil, right?
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:31.300]   And it doesn't matter what the premier in Japan
[01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:35.400]   or the mayor of Miami beach thinks about your barrel.
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:37.620]   They cannot wave their hand
[01:42:37.620 --> 01:42:42.620]   and make it not a barrel of oil or a cord of wood, right?
[01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:46.640]   And so property is just a naturally occurring element
[01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:49.160]   in the universe, right?
[01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:50.760]   - Why use the word ethical?
[01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:53.760]   And sorry to, I may interrupt occasionally.
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:56.920]   Why ethical assigned to property?
[01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:00.720]   - Because if it's a security,
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:04.500]   a security would be an example of a share of a stock
[01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:07.660]   or a crypto token controlled by a small team.
[01:43:07.660 --> 01:43:12.160]   And in the event that something is a security
[01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:17.160]   because some small group or some identifiable group
[01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:20.520]   can control its nature, character, supply,
[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:26.080]   then it really only becomes ethical to promote it
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:29.840]   or sell it pursuant to fair disclosures.
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:34.740]   So I'll give you maybe practical example.
[01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:36.940]   I'm the mayor of Chicago.
[01:43:36.940 --> 01:43:38.540]   I give a speech.
[01:43:38.540 --> 01:43:40.460]   My speech, I say, I think everybody in Chicago
[01:43:40.460 --> 01:43:43.860]   should own their own farm and have chicken,
[01:43:43.860 --> 01:43:46.860]   a chicken in the backyard and their own horse
[01:43:46.860 --> 01:43:48.020]   and an automobile.
[01:43:48.020 --> 01:43:50.440]   That's ethical.
[01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:52.780]   I give the same speech and I say,
[01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:56.060]   I think everybody in Chicago should buy Twitter stock,
[01:43:56.060 --> 01:44:00.600]   sell their house or sell their cash and buy Twitter stock.
[01:44:01.260 --> 01:44:03.580]   Well, is that ethical?
[01:44:03.580 --> 01:44:04.900]   Not really.
[01:44:04.900 --> 01:44:07.440]   At that point, you've entered into a conflict of interest
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:11.940]   because what you're doing is you're promoting an asset
[01:44:11.940 --> 01:44:13.820]   which is substantially controlled
[01:44:13.820 --> 01:44:16.560]   by a small group of people, the board of directors
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:18.840]   or the CEO of the company.
[01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:22.060]   So how would you feel if the president of the United States
[01:44:22.060 --> 01:44:26.600]   said, I really think Americans should all buy Apple stock?
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:29.820]   Especially if you worked at Google,
[01:44:29.820 --> 01:44:31.200]   but you worked anywhere, you'd be like,
[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:32.760]   why isn't he saying buy mine?
[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:38.780]   A security is a proprietary asset in some way, shape or form
[01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:43.500]   and the whole nature of securities law,
[01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:46.900]   it starts from this ancient idea,
[01:44:46.900 --> 01:44:48.860]   thou shalt not lie, cheat or steal.
[01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:55.300]   So if I'm going to sell you securities
[01:44:55.300 --> 01:44:58.260]   or I'm gonna promote securities as a public figure
[01:44:58.260 --> 01:45:01.560]   or as an influencer or anybody else,
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:06.280]   if I create my own yo-yo coin or Mikey coin
[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:08.860]   and then there's a million of them
[01:45:08.860 --> 01:45:11.820]   and I tell you that I think that it's a really good thing
[01:45:11.820 --> 01:45:13.780]   and Mikey coin will go up forever,
[01:45:13.780 --> 01:45:18.700]   everybody buys Mikey coin and then I give 10 million to you
[01:45:18.700 --> 01:45:22.200]   and don't tell the public, I've cheated them.
[01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:24.680]   Maybe if I have Mikey coin
[01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:27.160]   and I think there's only 2 million Mikey coin
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:29.700]   and I swear to you, there's only 2 million
[01:45:29.700 --> 01:45:31.700]   and then I get married and I have three kids
[01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:34.100]   and my third kid is in the hospital
[01:45:34.100 --> 01:45:37.420]   and my kid's gonna die and I have this ethical reason
[01:45:37.420 --> 01:45:39.620]   to print 500,000 more Mikey coin
[01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:40.900]   or else people are gonna die
[01:45:40.900 --> 01:45:42.540]   and everybody tells me it's fine.
[01:45:42.540 --> 01:45:46.940]   I've still abused the investor, right?
[01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:50.260]   It's a ethical challenge.
[01:45:50.260 --> 01:45:55.260]   If you look at ethics laws everywhere in the world,
[01:45:57.140 --> 01:45:59.420]   they all boil down to having a clause
[01:45:59.420 --> 01:46:01.100]   which says that if you're a public figure,
[01:46:01.100 --> 01:46:04.560]   you can't endorse any security,
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:06.520]   you can't endorse something that would cause you
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:08.340]   to have a conflict of interest.
[01:46:08.340 --> 01:46:11.340]   So if you're a mayor, a governor, a country,
[01:46:11.340 --> 01:46:13.780]   a public figure, an influencer,
[01:46:13.780 --> 01:46:17.920]   and you want to promote or promulgate or support something
[01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:21.460]   using any public influence or funds
[01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:25.180]   or resources you may have, it needs to be property,
[01:46:25.180 --> 01:46:27.380]   it can't be security.
[01:46:27.380 --> 01:46:29.780]   So it goes beyond that, right?
[01:46:29.780 --> 01:46:32.680]   I mean, like what the Chinese want to support
[01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:34.700]   an American company, right?
[01:46:34.700 --> 01:46:37.440]   As soon as you look at what's in the best interest
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:41.140]   of the human race, the civilization,
[01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:45.860]   you realize that if you want an ethical path forward,
[01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:50.860]   it needs to be based on common property, which is fair.
[01:46:50.860 --> 01:46:54.180]   And the way you get to a common property
[01:46:54.180 --> 01:46:57.780]   is through an open permissionless protocol.
[01:46:57.780 --> 01:46:59.180]   If it's not open, right?
[01:46:59.180 --> 01:47:01.700]   If it's proprietary and I know what the code says
[01:47:01.700 --> 01:47:03.480]   and you don't know what the code says,
[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:05.340]   that makes it a security.
[01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:10.340]   If it's permissioned, if you're not allowed on my network
[01:47:10.340 --> 01:47:16.260]   or if you can be censored or booted off my network,
[01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:18.000]   that also makes it a security.
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:23.740]   So when I talk about property,
[01:47:23.740 --> 01:47:27.140]   I mean, the challenge here is how do I create something
[01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:32.140]   that's equivalent to a barrel of oil in cyberspace?
[01:47:32.140 --> 01:47:36.500]   And that means it has to be a non-sovereign bearer
[01:47:36.500 --> 01:47:41.060]   instrument, open permissionless, not censorable, right?
[01:47:41.060 --> 01:47:47.100]   If I could do that, then I could deliver you
[01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:50.660]   10,000 dematerialized barrels of oil
[01:47:50.660 --> 01:47:53.820]   and you would take settlement of them
[01:47:53.820 --> 01:47:56.620]   and you would know that you have possession
[01:47:56.620 --> 01:48:00.020]   of that property, irregardless of the opinion
[01:48:00.020 --> 01:48:02.420]   of any politician or any company
[01:48:02.420 --> 01:48:04.420]   or anybody else in the world.
[01:48:04.420 --> 01:48:08.780]   That's a really critical characteristic.
[01:48:08.780 --> 01:48:13.420]   And it actually is, it's probably one of the fundamental
[01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:15.780]   things that makes Bitcoin special.
[01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:18.020]   Bitcoin isn't just a crypto asset network.
[01:48:18.020 --> 01:48:20.220]   It's easy to create a crypto asset network.
[01:48:20.220 --> 01:48:25.220]   It's very hard to create an ethical crypto asset network
[01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:30.780]   because you have to create one without any government
[01:48:30.780 --> 01:48:35.500]   or corporation or investor exercising
[01:48:35.500 --> 01:48:37.620]   in due influence to make it successful.
[01:48:37.620 --> 01:48:42.580]   - So open, permissionless, non-censorable.
[01:48:42.580 --> 01:48:47.580]   So basically no way for you without explicitly saying so
[01:48:48.580 --> 01:48:50.540]   outsourcing control to somebody else.
[01:48:50.540 --> 01:48:54.980]   So it's a kind of, you have full control.
[01:48:54.980 --> 01:48:58.220]   Even with a barrel of oil, what's the difference
[01:48:58.220 --> 01:49:01.820]   in between a barrel of oil and a Bitcoin to you?
[01:49:01.820 --> 01:49:07.140]   Because you kind of mentioned that both are property.
[01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:10.860]   You mentioned Russia and China and so on.
[01:49:10.860 --> 01:49:13.820]   Is it the ability of the government to confiscate?
[01:49:13.820 --> 01:49:16.340]   In the end, governments can probably confiscate
[01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:17.700]   no matter what the asset is,
[01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:21.500]   but you want to lessen the effort involved.
[01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:24.140]   - A barrel of oil is a bucket of physical property,
[01:49:24.140 --> 01:49:27.860]   liquid property, and a Bitcoin is a digital property.
[01:49:27.860 --> 01:49:32.420]   - But it's easier to confiscate a barrel of oil.
[01:49:32.420 --> 01:49:35.260]   - It's easier to confiscate things in the real world
[01:49:35.260 --> 01:49:38.740]   than things in cyberspace, much easier.
[01:49:38.740 --> 01:49:40.220]   - So that's not universally true.
[01:49:40.220 --> 01:49:43.140]   Some things in the digital space are actually easier
[01:49:43.140 --> 01:49:48.140]   to confiscate because just the nature of how things move
[01:49:48.140 --> 01:49:50.140]   easily with information, right?
[01:49:50.140 --> 01:49:52.580]   - So I think in the Bitcoin world, what we would say
[01:49:52.580 --> 01:49:57.500]   is that Bitcoin is the most difficult property
[01:49:57.500 --> 01:49:59.300]   that the human race possesses
[01:49:59.300 --> 01:50:02.420]   or has yet invented to confiscate.
[01:50:02.420 --> 01:50:04.700]   And that's by virtue of the fact that you could take
[01:50:04.700 --> 01:50:06.700]   possession of it via your private keys.
[01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:10.900]   So if you got your 12 seed phrases in your head,
[01:50:10.900 --> 01:50:13.740]   then that will be the highest form of property right
[01:50:13.740 --> 01:50:16.580]   because I literally have to crack your head open
[01:50:16.580 --> 01:50:19.100]   and read your mind to take it.
[01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:21.580]   It doesn't mean I couldn't extract it from you
[01:50:21.580 --> 01:50:25.300]   under duress, but it means that it's harder
[01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:26.900]   than every other thing you might own.
[01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:29.740]   If you, in fact, it's exponentially harder.
[01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:32.540]   If you consider every other thing you might own,
[01:50:32.540 --> 01:50:37.540]   a car, a house, a share of stock, gold, diamonds,
[01:50:37.580 --> 01:50:40.380]   property rights, intellectual property rights,
[01:50:40.380 --> 01:50:43.740]   movie rights, music rights, anything imaginable,
[01:50:43.740 --> 01:50:45.700]   they would all be easier by orders
[01:50:45.700 --> 01:50:48.140]   and orders of magnitude to seize.
[01:50:48.140 --> 01:50:53.140]   So digital property and the form of a set of private keys
[01:50:53.140 --> 01:50:58.140]   is by far the apex property of the human race.
[01:50:58.140 --> 01:50:59.900]   In terms of ethics, I wanna make one more point.
[01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:02.500]   It's like, I might say to you, Lex,
[01:51:02.500 --> 01:51:05.460]   I think Bitcoin is the best, most secure,
[01:51:05.460 --> 01:51:08.100]   most durable crypto asset network in the world
[01:51:08.100 --> 01:51:09.300]   is gonna go up forever
[01:51:09.300 --> 01:51:11.340]   and there's nothing better in the world.
[01:51:11.340 --> 01:51:14.060]   I might be right, I might be wrong,
[01:51:14.060 --> 01:51:18.460]   but the point is because it's property,
[01:51:18.460 --> 01:51:21.260]   it's ethical for me to say that.
[01:51:21.260 --> 01:51:23.740]   If I were to turn around and say, you know, Lex,
[01:51:23.740 --> 01:51:27.540]   I think the same about micro strategy stock, MSTR.
[01:51:27.540 --> 01:51:29.940]   That's a security, okay?
[01:51:29.940 --> 01:51:33.380]   If I'm wrong about that, I have civil liability
[01:51:33.380 --> 01:51:37.500]   or other liability because I could go
[01:51:37.500 --> 01:51:40.260]   to a board meeting tomorrow and I could actually propose
[01:51:40.260 --> 01:51:43.700]   we issue a million more shares of micro strategy stock.
[01:51:43.700 --> 01:51:48.180]   Whereas the thing that makes Bitcoin ethical for me
[01:51:48.180 --> 01:51:51.740]   to even promote is the knowledge that I can't change it.
[01:51:51.740 --> 01:51:55.860]   If I knew that I could make it 42 million
[01:51:55.860 --> 01:51:59.820]   instead of 21 million and I had the button back here,
[01:51:59.820 --> 01:52:03.580]   right, then I have a different degree
[01:52:03.580 --> 01:52:05.500]   of ethical responsibility.
[01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:07.540]   Now, I could tell you your life will be better
[01:52:07.540 --> 01:52:09.260]   if you buy Bitcoin and it might not.
[01:52:09.260 --> 01:52:11.580]   You might go buy Bitcoin, you might lose the keys
[01:52:11.580 --> 01:52:13.340]   and be bankrupt and your life ends
[01:52:13.340 --> 01:52:14.540]   and your life is not better
[01:52:14.540 --> 01:52:16.620]   because you bought Bitcoin, right?
[01:52:16.620 --> 01:52:20.820]   But it wouldn't be my ethical liability any more
[01:52:20.820 --> 01:52:24.740]   than if I were to say, Lex, I think you ought to get a farm.
[01:52:24.740 --> 01:52:26.940]   I think you should be a farmer.
[01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:28.980]   I think a chicken in every pot,
[01:52:28.980 --> 01:52:30.580]   you should get a horse.
[01:52:30.580 --> 01:52:31.500]   I think you'd be better.
[01:52:31.500 --> 01:52:36.380]   I mean, these are all, they're all opinions expressed
[01:52:36.380 --> 01:52:39.420]   about property, which may or may not be right
[01:52:39.420 --> 01:52:41.980]   that you may or may not agree with.
[01:52:41.980 --> 01:52:46.060]   But in a legal sense, if we read the law,
[01:52:46.060 --> 01:52:48.300]   if we understand securities law,
[01:52:48.300 --> 01:52:49.740]   and I would say, you know, most people
[01:52:49.740 --> 01:52:52.100]   in the crypto industry, you know,
[01:52:52.100 --> 01:52:54.300]   they didn't take companies public.
[01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:56.580]   And so they're not really focused on the securities law.
[01:52:56.580 --> 01:52:58.940]   They don't even know the securities law.
[01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:00.700]   If you focus on the securities law,
[01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:04.740]   that would say you just can't legally sell this stuff
[01:53:04.740 --> 01:53:07.060]   to the general public or promote it
[01:53:07.060 --> 01:53:10.860]   without a full set of continuing disclosures
[01:53:10.860 --> 01:53:13.780]   signed off on by a regulator.
[01:53:13.780 --> 01:53:17.460]   So there's a fairly bright line there
[01:53:17.460 --> 01:53:19.420]   with regard to securities.
[01:53:19.420 --> 01:53:23.100]   But when you get to the secondary issue,
[01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:27.420]   it's how do you actually build a world
[01:53:27.420 --> 01:53:31.500]   based on digital property if public figures
[01:53:31.500 --> 01:53:36.500]   can't embrace it or endorse it?
[01:53:36.500 --> 01:53:39.140]   You see, so you're not gonna build a better world
[01:53:39.140 --> 01:53:43.980]   based upon Twitter stock, if that's your idea of property,
[01:53:43.980 --> 01:53:46.780]   because Twitter stock is a security
[01:53:46.780 --> 01:53:48.820]   and Twitter stock is never going to be
[01:53:48.820 --> 01:53:52.180]   a non-sovereign bearer instrument in Russia, right?
[01:53:52.180 --> 01:53:53.660]   Or in China, right?
[01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:54.700]   It's not even legal in China, right?
[01:53:55.100 --> 01:53:58.420]   It's not a global permissionless open thing.
[01:53:58.420 --> 01:54:01.140]   It will never be trusted by the rest of the world.
[01:54:01.140 --> 01:54:05.620]   And legally it's impractical, but would you really wanna
[01:54:05.620 --> 01:54:08.980]   put $100 trillion worth of economic value on Twitter stock
[01:54:08.980 --> 01:54:10.860]   if there's a board of directors and a CEO
[01:54:10.860 --> 01:54:13.340]   that could just get up and take half of it tomorrow?
[01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:14.340]   The answer is no.
[01:54:14.340 --> 01:54:18.980]   So if you wanna build a better world
[01:54:18.980 --> 01:54:21.060]   based on digital energy,
[01:54:21.060 --> 01:54:25.060]   you need to start with constructing a digital property.
[01:54:25.060 --> 01:54:28.300]   And I'm using property here in the--
[01:54:28.300 --> 01:54:29.900]   Open, permissionless--
[01:54:29.900 --> 01:54:31.760]   In the legal sense. Okay.
[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:35.220]   But I would also go to the next step and say,
[01:54:35.220 --> 01:54:39.220]   property is low frequency money.
[01:54:39.220 --> 01:54:42.380]   So if I give you a million dollars
[01:54:42.380 --> 01:54:46.380]   and you wanna hold it for a decade,
[01:54:46.380 --> 01:54:49.180]   you might go buy a house with it, right?
[01:54:49.180 --> 01:54:51.700]   And the house is low frequency money.
[01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:55.940]   You converted the million dollars of economic energy
[01:54:55.940 --> 01:54:58.200]   into a structure called a house.
[01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:01.700]   Maybe after a decade, you might convert it back into energy.
[01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:04.820]   You might sell the house for currency
[01:55:04.820 --> 01:55:06.740]   and it'll be worth more or less
[01:55:06.740 --> 01:55:08.380]   depending upon the monetary climate.
[01:55:08.380 --> 01:55:10.940]   The frequency means what here?
[01:55:10.940 --> 01:55:13.940]   How quickly it changes state?
[01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:16.220]   How quickly does something vibrate?
[01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:22.180]   So if I transfer $10 from me to you for a drink
[01:55:22.180 --> 01:55:26.720]   and then you turn around and you buy another, right?
[01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:30.260]   We're vibrating on a frequency of every few hours, right?
[01:55:30.260 --> 01:55:32.200]   The energy is changing hands.
[01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:33.860]   But it's not likely that you sell
[01:55:33.860 --> 01:55:36.980]   and buy houses every few hours, right?
[01:55:36.980 --> 01:55:41.120]   The frequency of a transaction in real estate
[01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:43.280]   is every 10 years, every five years.
[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:46.180]   It's a much lower frequency transaction.
[01:55:46.180 --> 01:55:51.180]   And so when you think about what's going on here,
[01:55:51.180 --> 01:55:56.620]   you have extremely low frequency things
[01:55:56.620 --> 01:55:58.480]   which we'll call property.
[01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:01.760]   Then you have mid frequency things.
[01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:04.660]   I'm gonna call them money or currency.
[01:56:04.660 --> 01:56:09.240]   And then you have high frequency and that's energy.
[01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:11.140]   And that's why I use the illustration of,
[01:56:11.140 --> 01:56:13.620]   you got the building, you got the light
[01:56:13.620 --> 01:56:14.860]   and you got the sound
[01:56:14.860 --> 01:56:19.620]   and they're all just energy moving at different frequencies.
[01:56:19.620 --> 01:56:24.620]   Now, Bitcoin is magical and it is truly the innovation.
[01:56:24.620 --> 01:56:29.600]   It's like a singularity because it represents
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:32.400]   the first time in the history of the human race
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:36.540]   that we managed to create a digital property
[01:56:36.540 --> 01:56:38.340]   properly understood.
[01:56:38.340 --> 01:56:42.820]   It's easy to create something digital, right?
[01:56:42.820 --> 01:56:46.700]   Every coupon and every scan on Fortnite and Roblox
[01:56:46.700 --> 01:56:49.900]   and Apple TV credits and all these things,
[01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:53.420]   they're all digital something, but they're securities, right?
[01:56:53.420 --> 01:56:55.340]   Shares of stock are securities.
[01:56:55.340 --> 01:56:57.420]   Whenever anybody transfers,
[01:56:57.420 --> 01:56:59.860]   when you transfer money on PayPal or Apple Pay,
[01:56:59.860 --> 01:57:04.440]   you're transferring an essence, a security or an IOU.
[01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:07.740]   And so transferring a bearer instrument
[01:57:07.740 --> 01:57:11.820]   with final settlement in the internet domain
[01:57:11.820 --> 01:57:16.020]   or in cyberspace, that's a critical thing.
[01:57:16.020 --> 01:57:19.740]   And anybody in the crypto world can do that.
[01:57:19.740 --> 01:57:21.360]   All the cryptos can do that.
[01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:22.740]   But what they can't do,
[01:57:22.740 --> 01:57:26.620]   what 99% of them fail to do is be property.
[01:57:26.620 --> 01:57:27.900]   They're securities, right?
[01:57:27.900 --> 01:57:30.540]   Well, there's a line there I'd like to explore further.
[01:57:30.540 --> 01:57:34.440]   For example, what about when you,
[01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:36.820]   like Coinbase or something like that,
[01:57:36.820 --> 01:57:41.660]   when there's an exchange that you buy Bitcoin is in,
[01:57:41.660 --> 01:57:45.120]   you start to move away from this kind of,
[01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:50.120]   some of the aspects that you said makes up a property,
[01:57:50.120 --> 01:57:55.740]   which is this non-censorable
[01:57:55.740 --> 01:57:58.500]   and permissionless and open.
[01:57:58.500 --> 01:58:01.600]   So in order to achieve the convenience,
[01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:05.860]   the effectiveness of the transfer of energy,
[01:58:05.860 --> 01:58:10.240]   you have to leverage some of these places
[01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:12.520]   that remove the aspects of property.
[01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:14.540]   So maybe you can comment on that.
[01:58:14.540 --> 01:58:17.060]   - Let me give you a good model for that.
[01:58:17.060 --> 01:58:20.320]   If you think about the layer one of Bitcoin,
[01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:24.060]   the layer one is the property settlement layer.
[01:58:24.060 --> 01:58:27.980]   And we're gonna do 350,000 transactions or less a day,
[01:58:27.980 --> 01:58:29.740]   100 million transactions a year
[01:58:29.740 --> 01:58:31.920]   is the bandwidth on the layer one.
[01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:34.900]   And it would be an ideal layer one
[01:58:34.900 --> 01:58:37.840]   to move a billion dollars from point A to point B
[01:58:37.840 --> 01:58:39.660]   with the massive security.
[01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:44.160]   The role of the layer one is two things.
[01:58:44.160 --> 01:58:47.800]   One thing is I wanna move a large sum of money
[01:58:47.800 --> 01:58:50.720]   through space with security.
[01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:55.720]   I can move any amount of Bitcoin in a matter of minutes
[01:58:55.720 --> 01:58:59.260]   for dollars on layer one.
[01:58:59.260 --> 01:59:03.100]   The second important feature of the layer one
[01:59:03.100 --> 01:59:06.360]   is I need the money to last forever, right?
[01:59:06.360 --> 01:59:08.680]   I need the money indestructible, immortal.
[01:59:08.680 --> 01:59:12.680]   So the bigger trick is not to move a billion dollars
[01:59:12.680 --> 01:59:13.740]   from here to Tokyo.
[01:59:13.740 --> 01:59:15.760]   The big trick is to move a billion dollars
[01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:17.980]   from here to the year 2140.
[01:59:17.980 --> 01:59:24.000]   And that's what we wanna solve with layer one.
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.700]   And the best real metaphor in New York City
[01:59:26.700 --> 01:59:29.200]   would be the granite or the schist.
[01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:33.040]   What you want is a city block of bedrock.
[01:59:33.040 --> 01:59:34.480]   And how long has it been there?
[01:59:34.480 --> 01:59:37.340]   Like millions of years it's been there.
[01:59:37.340 --> 01:59:39.380]   And how fast do you want it to move?
[01:59:39.380 --> 01:59:40.520]   You don't.
[01:59:40.520 --> 01:59:43.080]   In fact, the single thing that's most important
[01:59:43.080 --> 01:59:45.240]   is that it not deflect.
[01:59:45.240 --> 01:59:49.280]   If it deflects a foot in a hundred years, it's too much.
[01:59:49.280 --> 01:59:51.360]   If it deflects an inch in a hundred years,
[01:59:51.360 --> 01:59:53.040]   you might not want that.
[01:59:53.040 --> 01:59:55.920]   So the layer one of Bitcoin is a foundation
[01:59:55.920 --> 01:59:57.440]   upon which you put weight.
[01:59:57.440 --> 01:59:59.400]   How much weight can you put on it?
[01:59:59.400 --> 02:00:04.240]   You put a trillion, 10 trillion, 100 trillion, a quadrillion.
[02:00:04.240 --> 02:00:07.940]   How much weights on the bedrock in Manhattan?
[02:00:07.940 --> 02:00:10.380]   Think about a hundred story buildings.
[02:00:10.380 --> 02:00:15.260]   So the real key there is the foundational asset
[02:00:15.260 --> 02:00:16.680]   needs to be there at all.
[02:00:16.680 --> 02:00:20.720]   So the fact that you can create a hundred trillion dollar
[02:00:20.720 --> 02:00:23.380]   layer one that would stand for a hundred years,
[02:00:23.380 --> 02:00:27.460]   that is the revolutionary breakthrough first time.
[02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:29.540]   And the fact that it's ethical.
[02:00:29.540 --> 02:00:32.060]   It's ethical and it's common property,
[02:00:32.060 --> 02:00:33.740]   global permissionless.
[02:00:33.740 --> 02:00:36.320]   Extremely unlikely that would happen.
[02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:39.200]   People tried 50 times before and they all failed.
[02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:41.800]   They tried 15,000 times after,
[02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:44.240]   and they've all generally failed.
[02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:48.600]   98% have failed and a couple have been less successful.
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:53.600]   But for the most part, that's an extraordinary thing.
[02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:57.000]   Just really quickly pause just to define some terms.
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:01.880]   If people don't know, layer one that Michael's referring to
[02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:05.820]   is in general what people know of
[02:01:05.820 --> 02:01:09.720]   as the Bitcoin technology originally defined,
[02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:11.600]   which is the blockchain.
[02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:14.360]   There's a consensus mechanism of proof of work,
[02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:16.140]   a low number of transactions,
[02:01:16.140 --> 02:01:21.140]   but you can move a very large amount of money.
[02:01:21.140 --> 02:01:24.280]   The reason he's using the term layer one
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:27.440]   is now that there's a lot of ideas of layer two technologies
[02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:29.800]   that built on top of this bedrock
[02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:33.580]   that allow you to move a much larger number of transactions.
[02:01:33.580 --> 02:01:39.240]   So sort of higher frequency,
[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:41.100]   I don't know what terminology you want to use,
[02:01:41.100 --> 02:01:43.340]   but basically be able to use now
[02:01:43.340 --> 02:01:48.000]   something that is based on Bitcoin to then buy stuff,
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:51.420]   be a consumer, to transfer money, to use it as currency.
[02:01:51.420 --> 02:01:54.800]   Just to define some terms.
[02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:55.640]   - Yeah.
[02:01:56.600 --> 02:02:00.040]   So the layer one is the foundation
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:02.720]   for the entire cyber economy.
[02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:06.760]   And we don't want it to move fast.
[02:02:06.760 --> 02:02:10.560]   What we want is immortality,
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:15.800]   immortal, incorruptible, indestructible, right?
[02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:18.880]   That's what you want, integrity from the layer one.
[02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:21.000]   Now there's layer two and layer three,
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:25.040]   and layer two I would define as an open, permissionless,
[02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:30.000]   non-custodial protocol that uses
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:34.360]   the underlying layer one token as its gas fee.
[02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:35.920]   - So what's custodial mean
[02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:38.600]   and how does the different markets,
[02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:40.240]   like is lightning network?
[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:42.040]   - So lightning network would be an example
[02:02:42.040 --> 02:02:44.640]   of a layer two, non-custodial.
[02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:49.560]   So the lightning network will sit on top of layer one.
[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:51.560]   It'll sit on top of Bitcoin.
[02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:53.880]   And it solves the, what you want to do
[02:02:53.880 --> 02:02:57.000]   is solve the problem of, it's well and fine.
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.360]   I don't want to move a billion dollars every day.
[02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:04.360]   What I want to move is $5 a billion times a day.
[02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:08.200]   So if I want to move $5 a billion times a day,
[02:03:08.200 --> 02:03:12.320]   I don't really need to put the entire trillion dollars
[02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:16.080]   of assets at risk every time I move $5.
[02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:20.240]   All I really need to do is put $100,000 in a channel
[02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:22.240]   or a million dollars in a channel.
[02:03:22.240 --> 02:03:24.320]   And then I do 10 million transactions
[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:27.000]   where I have a million dollars at risk.
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:28.680]   And of course it's kind of simple.
[02:03:28.680 --> 02:03:36.060]   If I lower my security requirement by a factor of a million,
[02:03:36.060 --> 02:03:39.440]   I can probably move the stuff a million times faster.
[02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:41.440]   And that's how lightning works.
[02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:45.960]   It's non-custodial because there's no corporation
[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:49.260]   or custodian or counterparty you're trusting.
[02:03:50.100 --> 02:03:50.940]   Right?
[02:03:50.940 --> 02:03:53.380]   There's the risk of moving through the channel,
[02:03:53.380 --> 02:03:57.700]   but lightning is an example of how I go
[02:03:57.700 --> 02:04:00.540]   from 350,000 transactions a day
[02:04:00.540 --> 02:04:03.300]   to 350 million transactions a day.
[02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:06.060]   So on that layer too, you could move the Bitcoin
[02:04:06.060 --> 02:04:08.640]   in seconds for fractions of pennies.
[02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:11.140]   Now that's not the end all be all
[02:04:11.140 --> 02:04:14.700]   because the truth is there are a lot of open protocols.
[02:04:14.700 --> 02:04:16.860]   Lightning probably won't be the only one.
[02:04:16.860 --> 02:04:18.980]   You know, there's a open market competition
[02:04:18.980 --> 02:04:21.980]   of other permissionless open source protocols
[02:04:21.980 --> 02:04:23.700]   to do this work.
[02:04:23.700 --> 02:04:28.700]   And in theory, any other crypto network
[02:04:28.700 --> 02:04:33.780]   that was deemed to be property, deemed to be non-security,
[02:04:33.780 --> 02:04:36.180]   you could also think of as potentially
[02:04:36.180 --> 02:04:38.100]   a layer two to Bitcoin.
[02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:38.940]   Right?
[02:04:38.940 --> 02:04:40.980]   There's a debate about are there any and what are they?
[02:04:40.980 --> 02:04:43.420]   And we can leave that for a later time.
[02:04:43.420 --> 02:04:46.620]   - But why do you think of them as layer two
[02:04:46.620 --> 02:04:49.520]   as opposed to contending for layer one?
[02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:53.540]   - Yeah, actually, if they're using their own token,
[02:04:53.540 --> 02:04:54.940]   then they are layer one.
[02:04:54.940 --> 02:04:58.380]   If you create an open protocol that uses the Bitcoin token
[02:04:58.380 --> 02:05:02.420]   as the fee, then it becomes a layer two.
[02:05:02.420 --> 02:05:03.260]   - Okay.
[02:05:03.260 --> 02:05:04.080]   - Right?
[02:05:04.080 --> 02:05:07.500]   Bitcoin itself, right, incentivizes its own transactions
[02:05:07.500 --> 02:05:10.560]   with its own token and that's what makes it layer one.
[02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:13.920]   - Okay, what's layer three then?
[02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:16.380]   - Layer three is a custodial layer.
[02:05:16.380 --> 02:05:20.500]   So if you wanna move Bitcoin in milliseconds for free,
[02:05:20.500 --> 02:05:26.220]   you move it through Binance or Coinbase or Cash App.
[02:05:26.220 --> 02:05:27.860]   So this is a very straightforward thing.
[02:05:27.860 --> 02:05:30.500]   I mean, it seems pretty obvious when you think about it
[02:05:30.500 --> 02:05:32.700]   that there are gonna be hundreds of thousands
[02:05:32.700 --> 02:05:34.520]   of layer threes.
[02:05:34.520 --> 02:05:36.860]   There may be dozens of layer twos.
[02:05:36.860 --> 02:05:38.700]   There might, I mean, lightning is A1,
[02:05:38.700 --> 02:05:39.980]   but it's not the only one.
[02:05:39.980 --> 02:05:42.740]   Anybody can invent something, right?
[02:05:42.740 --> 02:05:47.740]   And we can have this debate about custodial, non-custodial.
[02:05:47.740 --> 02:05:55.100]   - Don't you think there's a monopolization possibilities
[02:05:55.100 --> 02:05:56.600]   at layer three?
[02:05:56.600 --> 02:06:02.620]   So, you know, coin, you mentioned Binance, Coinbase,
[02:06:02.620 --> 02:06:04.740]   what if they start to dominate
[02:06:04.740 --> 02:06:08.580]   and basically everybody's using them, practically speaking,
[02:06:08.580 --> 02:06:11.980]   and then it becomes too costly to memorize
[02:06:11.980 --> 02:06:15.220]   the private key in your brain?
[02:06:15.220 --> 02:06:19.620]   I mean, or like a cold storage of layer one technology.
[02:06:19.620 --> 02:06:23.380]   - The idealist fear the layer threes because they think,
[02:06:23.380 --> 02:06:28.380]   and especially they detest, they would detest a bit,
[02:06:28.380 --> 02:06:30.380]   there's almost like a layer four, by the way,
[02:06:30.380 --> 02:06:31.220]   if you want to.
[02:06:31.220 --> 02:06:34.980]   A layer four would be, I've got Bitcoin on an application,
[02:06:34.980 --> 02:06:37.740]   but I can't withdraw it.
[02:06:37.740 --> 02:06:40.580]   So I've got an application that's backed by Bitcoin,
[02:06:40.580 --> 02:06:42.660]   but the Bitcoin is sealed.
[02:06:42.660 --> 02:06:44.340]   It's a proprietary example.
[02:06:44.340 --> 02:06:45.620]   And I'll give you an example of that.
[02:06:45.620 --> 02:06:48.620]   That would be like a grayscale.
[02:06:48.620 --> 02:06:53.620]   If I own a share of GBTC, and so I own a security,
[02:06:53.620 --> 02:06:57.340]   actually, you know, you could own MSTR.
[02:06:57.340 --> 02:06:59.580]   If you own a security or you own a product
[02:06:59.580 --> 02:07:01.360]   that has Bitcoin embedded in it,
[02:07:01.360 --> 02:07:03.980]   you get the benefits of Bitcoin,
[02:07:03.980 --> 02:07:07.580]   but you don't have the ability to withdraw the asset.
[02:07:07.580 --> 02:07:10.740]   - So you get out of the security market at layer four?
[02:07:10.740 --> 02:07:12.860]   Am I understanding this correctly?
[02:07:12.860 --> 02:07:14.540]   - I don't know if I would say,
[02:07:14.540 --> 02:07:17.420]   not all securities are layer four,
[02:07:17.420 --> 02:07:21.140]   but anything that's a proprietary product
[02:07:21.140 --> 02:07:23.980]   based upon with Bitcoin embedded in it,
[02:07:23.980 --> 02:07:26.580]   where you can't withdraw the Bitcoin
[02:07:26.580 --> 02:07:29.100]   is another application of Bitcoin.
[02:07:29.100 --> 02:07:33.660]   So if you think about different ways you can use this,
[02:07:33.660 --> 02:07:36.340]   you can either stay completely on the layer one
[02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:39.300]   and use the base chain for your transactions,
[02:07:39.300 --> 02:07:42.020]   or you can limit yourself to layer one
[02:07:42.020 --> 02:07:43.820]   and layer two lightning.
[02:07:43.820 --> 02:07:46.020]   And the purist would say, we stay there,
[02:07:46.020 --> 02:07:48.580]   get your Bitcoin off the exchange.
[02:07:48.580 --> 02:07:50.940]   But you could also go to the layer three.
[02:07:50.940 --> 02:07:53.900]   When Cash App supported Bitcoin,
[02:07:53.900 --> 02:07:55.540]   they made it very easy to buy it.
[02:07:55.540 --> 02:07:57.780]   And then they gave you the ability to withdraw.
[02:07:57.780 --> 02:08:00.860]   When PayPal, or I think Robinhood let you buy it,
[02:08:00.860 --> 02:08:01.940]   they wouldn't let you withdraw it.
[02:08:01.940 --> 02:08:03.540]   And there was a big community uproar.
[02:08:03.540 --> 02:08:07.060]   And people want, they want these layer threes
[02:08:07.060 --> 02:08:09.300]   to make it possible to withdraw the Bitcoins.
[02:08:09.300 --> 02:08:11.820]   You can take it to your own private wallet
[02:08:11.820 --> 02:08:14.220]   and get it off the exchange.
[02:08:14.220 --> 02:08:15.940]   I think the answer to the question of,
[02:08:15.940 --> 02:08:17.820]   well, is corruption possible?
[02:08:17.820 --> 02:08:22.620]   Corruption is possible in all human institutions
[02:08:22.620 --> 02:08:25.060]   and all governments everywhere.
[02:08:25.060 --> 02:08:27.260]   The difference between digital property
[02:08:27.260 --> 02:08:30.180]   and physical property is when you own a building
[02:08:30.180 --> 02:08:34.780]   in Los Angeles and the city politics turn against you,
[02:08:34.780 --> 02:08:36.940]   you can't move the building.
[02:08:36.940 --> 02:08:40.740]   And when you own a share of a security,
[02:08:40.740 --> 02:08:43.180]   that's like a US traded security,
[02:08:43.180 --> 02:08:46.580]   and you wish to move to some other country,
[02:08:46.580 --> 02:08:50.660]   you can't take the security with you either.
[02:08:50.660 --> 02:08:52.180]   And when you own a bunch of gold
[02:08:52.180 --> 02:08:53.580]   and you try to get through the airport,
[02:08:53.580 --> 02:08:55.860]   they might not let you take it.
[02:08:55.860 --> 02:09:00.860]   So Bitcoin is advantageous versus all those
[02:09:00.860 --> 02:09:03.100]   because you actually do have the option
[02:09:03.100 --> 02:09:06.460]   to withdraw your asset from the exchange.
[02:09:06.460 --> 02:09:09.420]   And if you had Bitcoin with Fidelity
[02:09:09.420 --> 02:09:11.820]   and you had shares of stock with Fidelity,
[02:09:11.820 --> 02:09:15.700]   and if you had bonds and sovereign debt with Fidelity,
[02:09:15.700 --> 02:09:20.180]   and if you own some mutual funds
[02:09:20.180 --> 02:09:23.500]   and some other random limited partnerships with Fidelity,
[02:09:23.500 --> 02:09:26.180]   none of those things can be removed from the custodian,
[02:09:26.180 --> 02:09:30.060]   but the Bitcoin, you can take off the exchange,
[02:09:30.060 --> 02:09:31.820]   you can remove from the custodian.
[02:09:31.820 --> 02:09:32.660]   So-
[02:09:32.660 --> 02:09:35.980]   It's still possible though.
[02:09:35.980 --> 02:09:37.060]   There's a deterrent.
[02:09:37.060 --> 02:09:40.300]   There's a deterrent that's an anti-corrupting element.
[02:09:40.300 --> 02:09:43.800]   And the phrase is an armed society is a polite society.
[02:09:43.800 --> 02:09:47.620]   Right, because you have the optionality
[02:09:47.620 --> 02:09:52.100]   to withdraw all your assets from the crypto exchange,
[02:09:52.100 --> 02:09:54.100]   you can enforce fairness.
[02:09:54.100 --> 02:09:57.360]   And at the point where you disagree with their policies,
[02:09:57.360 --> 02:09:59.100]   you can within an hour,
[02:09:59.100 --> 02:10:01.740]   move your assets to another counterparty
[02:10:01.740 --> 02:10:04.660]   or take personal custody of those assets.
[02:10:04.660 --> 02:10:06.660]   And you don't have that option
[02:10:06.660 --> 02:10:08.460]   with most other forms of property.
[02:10:08.460 --> 02:10:11.820]   Maybe you don't have as much optionality
[02:10:11.820 --> 02:10:13.580]   with any other form of property on earth.
[02:10:13.580 --> 02:10:17.480]   And so what makes digital property distinct
[02:10:17.480 --> 02:10:22.300]   is the fact that it has the most optionality for custody.
[02:10:22.300 --> 02:10:25.120]   Now, coming back to this digital energy issue,
[02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:28.980]   the real key point is the energy moves in milliseconds
[02:10:28.980 --> 02:10:32.100]   for free on layer threes.
[02:10:32.100 --> 02:10:35.600]   It moves in seconds or less than seconds on layer twos.
[02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:39.320]   It moves in minutes on the layer one.
[02:10:39.320 --> 02:10:43.600]   And I don't think it makes any sense to even think about
[02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:46.720]   trying to solve all three problems on the layer one
[02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:49.640]   because it's impossible to achieve the security
[02:10:49.640 --> 02:10:53.000]   and the incorruptibility and immortality
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.180]   if you try to build that much speed
[02:10:55.180 --> 02:10:57.340]   and that functionality and performance.
[02:10:57.340 --> 02:11:01.460]   In fact, if you come back to the New York model,
[02:11:01.460 --> 02:11:03.720]   you really wanted a block of granite,
[02:11:03.720 --> 02:11:06.000]   a building and a company.
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.600]   That's what makes the economy, right?
[02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:11.400]   If I said to you, you're gonna build a building,
[02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:13.000]   but you can only have one company in it
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:14.520]   for the life of the building,
[02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:17.660]   it would be very fragile, like very brittle.
[02:11:17.660 --> 02:11:21.360]   What company a hundred years ago is still relevant today?
[02:11:21.360 --> 02:11:22.900]   You want all three layers
[02:11:22.900 --> 02:11:26.280]   because they all oscillate at different frequencies.
[02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:29.480]   And there's a tendency to think,
[02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:33.840]   well, it's gotta be this L1 or that L1, not really.
[02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:34.920]   And sometimes people think,
[02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:38.480]   well, I don't really want any L3.
[02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:41.320]   But companies, it's not an even or.
[02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:45.560]   Companies are better than crypto asset networks
[02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:46.960]   at certain things.
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:50.080]   If you want complexity, you wanna implement complexity
[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:55.080]   or you wanna implement compliance or customer service,
[02:11:55.080 --> 02:11:57.640]   companies do these things well.
[02:11:57.640 --> 02:12:04.120]   We know you couldn't decentralize Apple or Netflix
[02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:06.140]   or even YouTube.
[02:12:06.140 --> 02:12:08.400]   The performance wouldn't be there
[02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:10.000]   and the subtlety wouldn't be there.
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:14.080]   And you can't really legally decentralize
[02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:16.240]   certain forms of banking and insurance
[02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:18.080]   because they will become illegal
[02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:19.780]   in the political jurisdiction they're in.
[02:12:19.780 --> 02:12:22.340]   So unless you're a crypto anarchist
[02:12:22.340 --> 02:12:25.860]   and you believe in no companies and no nation states,
[02:12:25.860 --> 02:12:31.960]   which is just not very practical, not anytime soon.
[02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:34.640]   Once you allow that nation states will continue
[02:12:34.640 --> 02:12:36.880]   and companies have a role,
[02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:40.280]   then the layered architecture follows
[02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:45.280]   and the free market determines who wins.
[02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:48.360]   For example, there are layer threes
[02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:52.600]   that let you acquire Bitcoin and withdraw Bitcoin.
[02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:56.720]   There are other applications that let you acquire
[02:12:56.720 --> 02:12:58.400]   but not withdraw it.
[02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:01.500]   And they don't get the same market share,
[02:13:01.500 --> 02:13:04.400]   but they might give you some other advantage.
[02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:08.680]   There are certain layer threes like Jack Dorsey's Cash App
[02:13:08.680 --> 02:13:11.280]   where they just incorporated Lightning,
[02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:12.760]   an implementation of it.
[02:13:12.760 --> 02:13:13.720]   So-
[02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:16.580]   - Into Cash App.
[02:13:16.580 --> 02:13:19.400]   - So that makes it advantageous
[02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:23.780]   versus an application that doesn't incorporate Lightning.
[02:13:23.780 --> 02:13:27.400]   If you think about the big picture,
[02:13:27.400 --> 02:13:30.640]   the big picture is 8 billion people with mobile phones
[02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:33.120]   served by a hundred million companies
[02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:37.000]   doing billions of transactions an hour.
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:42.000]   And the companies are settling with each other
[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:46.440]   on the base layer in blocks of 80 million at a time.
[02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:50.440]   And then the companies are trading with the consumers,
[02:13:50.440 --> 02:13:51.440]   right?
[02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:55.720]   In proprietary layers, like layer three.
[02:13:55.720 --> 02:13:58.020]   And then on occasion,
[02:13:58.020 --> 02:14:01.040]   people are shuffling assets across custodians
[02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:02.800]   with Lightning layer two,
[02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:05.720]   because you don't wanna pay $5 to move $50.
[02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:10.320]   You wanna pay a 20th of a penny to move $50.
[02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:15.320]   And so all of these things create efficiency in the economy.
[02:14:15.320 --> 02:14:19.340]   And Lex, if you wanna consider how much efficiency,
[02:14:19.340 --> 02:14:22.360]   if you gave me a billion dollars in 20 years,
[02:14:22.360 --> 02:14:25.560]   I couldn't find a way to trade with another company
[02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:27.360]   or a counterparty in Nigeria.
[02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:31.600]   Like no amount of money.
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:33.000]   Give me $10 billion.
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:34.200]   I couldn't do it
[02:14:34.200 --> 02:14:38.240]   because you get shut down at the banking level.
[02:14:38.240 --> 02:14:40.560]   You can't link up a bank in Nigeria
[02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:42.480]   with the bank in the US.
[02:14:42.480 --> 02:14:45.040]   You get shut down at this credit card level
[02:14:45.040 --> 02:14:46.560]   because they don't have the credit card
[02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:48.240]   so they won't clear.
[02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:53.240]   You get shut down at the compliance FCPA level
[02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:58.240]   because you wouldn't be able to implement a system
[02:14:58.240 --> 02:15:01.080]   that interfaced with somebody else's system
[02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:04.160]   if it's not in the right political jurisdiction.
[02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:06.840]   On the other hand, three entrepreneurs in Nigeria
[02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:09.480]   on the weekend could create a website
[02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:12.200]   that would trade in this lightning economy
[02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:16.400]   using open protocols without asking anybody's permission.
[02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:17.680]   So you're talking about something
[02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:20.240]   that's like a million times cheaper,
[02:15:20.240 --> 02:15:24.120]   less friction and faster to do it
[02:15:24.120 --> 02:15:27.680]   if you wanna get money to move.
[02:15:27.680 --> 02:15:28.840]   What do you think that looks like
[02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:31.840]   so that now there's a war going on in Ukraine,
[02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:35.280]   there's other wars, Yemen, going on throughout the world
[02:15:35.280 --> 02:15:40.280]   in this most difficult of states
[02:15:40.280 --> 02:15:43.300]   the nation can be in, which is at war,
[02:15:43.300 --> 02:15:46.580]   civil war or war with other nations.
[02:15:46.580 --> 02:15:50.600]   What's the role of Bitcoin in this context?
[02:15:50.600 --> 02:15:55.160]   I mean, Bitcoin's a universal trust protocol, right?
[02:15:55.160 --> 02:15:57.520]   A universal energy protocol, if you will.
[02:15:58.400 --> 02:15:59.520]   English is one.
[02:15:59.520 --> 02:16:04.440]   What I see is a bunch of fragmentation of applications.
[02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:07.560]   For example, the Russian payment app
[02:16:07.560 --> 02:16:09.420]   is not gonna work in Ukraine.
[02:16:09.420 --> 02:16:12.000]   The Ukraine payment app is not gonna work in Russia.
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:15.560]   The US payment apps won't work either of those places
[02:16:15.560 --> 02:16:17.000]   as far as I know.
[02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:21.040]   So, and in Argentina, their payment app
[02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:23.820]   may not work in certain parts of Africa.
[02:16:23.820 --> 02:16:28.820]   So what you have is different local economies
[02:16:28.820 --> 02:16:31.940]   where people spin up their own applications
[02:16:31.940 --> 02:16:35.100]   compliant with their own local laws
[02:16:35.100 --> 02:16:40.100]   or in war zones, not compliant, but just spinning up.
[02:16:40.100 --> 02:16:44.500]   So how do you build something that's not compliant?
[02:16:44.500 --> 02:16:47.860]   What is the revolutionary act here
[02:16:47.860 --> 02:16:50.580]   when you don't agree with the government
[02:16:50.580 --> 02:16:52.700]   or you want to free yourself from the constraints?
[02:16:52.700 --> 02:16:54.700]   So here's the thing.
[02:16:54.700 --> 02:16:56.720]   When a nation is really at war,
[02:16:56.720 --> 02:17:01.460]   especially if it's an authoritarian regime,
[02:17:01.460 --> 02:17:03.340]   it's going to try to control the,
[02:17:03.340 --> 02:17:06.380]   like lock everything down, the spread of information.
[02:17:06.380 --> 02:17:07.660]   How do you break through that?
[02:17:07.660 --> 02:17:09.100]   Do you do the thing that you mentioned,
[02:17:09.100 --> 02:17:11.900]   which is you have to build another app, essentially,
[02:17:11.900 --> 02:17:14.420]   that allows you the flow of money
[02:17:14.420 --> 02:17:16.860]   outside the legal constraints
[02:17:16.860 --> 02:17:18.020]   placed on you by the government?
[02:17:18.020 --> 02:17:19.580]   So basically break the law.
[02:17:21.980 --> 02:17:22.820]   Is that possible?
[02:17:22.820 --> 02:17:23.640]   Metaphorically speaking,
[02:17:23.640 --> 02:17:25.820]   if you want to break out of the constraints of your culture,
[02:17:25.820 --> 02:17:27.900]   you learn to speak English.
[02:17:27.900 --> 02:17:29.980]   For example, it's not illegal to speak English,
[02:17:29.980 --> 02:17:31.540]   or even if it is, right?
[02:17:31.540 --> 02:17:35.100]   Doesn't matter, but English works everywhere in the world
[02:17:35.100 --> 02:17:38.020]   if you can speak it, and then you can tap into
[02:17:38.020 --> 02:17:41.780]   a global commerce and intelligence network.
[02:17:41.780 --> 02:17:45.340]   So Bitcoin is a language, so you learn to speak Bitcoin
[02:17:45.340 --> 02:17:47.180]   or you learn to speak Lightning,
[02:17:47.180 --> 02:17:49.500]   and then you tap into that network
[02:17:49.500 --> 02:17:53.060]   in whatever manner you can.
[02:17:53.060 --> 02:17:54.660]   - But the problem is it's still very difficult
[02:17:54.660 --> 02:17:58.220]   to move Bitcoin around in Russia and Ukraine now,
[02:17:58.220 --> 02:18:01.740]   during war, and there was a sense to me
[02:18:01.740 --> 02:18:06.300]   that the cryptocurrency in general could be the savior
[02:18:06.300 --> 02:18:07.140]   for helping people.
[02:18:07.140 --> 02:18:10.860]   There's millions of refugees that are moving all around.
[02:18:10.860 --> 02:18:15.860]   It's very difficult to move money around
[02:18:15.860 --> 02:18:18.140]   in that space to help people.
[02:18:18.140 --> 02:18:19.860]   - I think we're very early.
[02:18:19.860 --> 02:18:22.220]   Like, we're very embryonic here.
[02:18:22.220 --> 02:18:23.340]   If you look at the--
[02:18:23.340 --> 02:18:24.180]   - Who's we, sorry?
[02:18:24.180 --> 02:18:25.660]   Are we as a human civilization,
[02:18:25.660 --> 02:18:28.340]   or are we operating in the cryptocurrency space?
[02:18:28.340 --> 02:18:32.700]   - I think the entire crypto economy is very embryonic,
[02:18:32.700 --> 02:18:36.540]   and the human race's adoption of it is embryonic.
[02:18:36.540 --> 02:18:39.980]   We're like 1%, 2% down that adoption curve.
[02:18:39.980 --> 02:18:43.380]   If you take Lightning, for example,
[02:18:43.380 --> 02:18:46.940]   the first real commercial applications of Lightning
[02:18:46.940 --> 02:18:48.940]   are just in the last 12 months.
[02:18:48.940 --> 02:18:50.460]   So we're like year one.
[02:18:50.460 --> 02:18:52.780]   We might be approaching year two
[02:18:52.780 --> 02:18:54.380]   of commercial Lightning adoption.
[02:18:54.380 --> 02:18:56.980]   And if you look at Lightning adoption,
[02:18:56.980 --> 02:18:59.660]   Lightning's not built into Coinbase,
[02:18:59.660 --> 02:19:03.020]   it's not built into Binance, it's not built into FTX.
[02:19:03.020 --> 02:19:07.780]   Cash App just implemented the first implementation,
[02:19:07.780 --> 02:19:09.500]   but not all the features are built into it.
[02:19:09.500 --> 02:19:11.900]   There's a few dozen,
[02:19:11.900 --> 02:19:15.220]   a dozen Lightning wallets circulating out there.
[02:19:15.220 --> 02:19:19.100]   So I think that we're probably gonna be 36 months
[02:19:19.100 --> 02:19:22.060]   of software development,
[02:19:22.060 --> 02:19:26.700]   at the point that every Android phone and every iPhone
[02:19:26.700 --> 02:19:31.700]   has a Bitcoin wallet or a crypto wallet in it of sorts.
[02:19:31.700 --> 02:19:34.340]   That's a big deal.
[02:19:34.340 --> 02:19:37.940]   If Apple embraced Lightning, that's a big deal.
[02:19:37.940 --> 02:19:40.020]   - So the adoption is the thing,
[02:19:40.020 --> 02:19:42.620]   like in a war zone adoption,
[02:19:44.140 --> 02:19:46.820]   the people who struggle the most in war
[02:19:46.820 --> 02:19:49.580]   are people who weren't doing that great
[02:19:49.580 --> 02:19:51.100]   before the war started.
[02:19:51.100 --> 02:19:53.180]   They don't have the technological sophistication.
[02:19:53.180 --> 02:19:56.300]   The hackers and all those kinds of people will find a way.
[02:19:56.300 --> 02:19:59.500]   It's just regular people who are just struggling
[02:19:59.500 --> 02:20:01.740]   to make day by day living.
[02:20:01.740 --> 02:20:05.540]   And so if the adoption permeates the entire culture,
[02:20:05.540 --> 02:20:08.380]   then you can start to move money around
[02:20:08.380 --> 02:20:10.940]   in the digital space.
[02:20:13.980 --> 02:20:17.300]   If you can psychoanalyze Jack Dorsey for a second.
[02:20:17.300 --> 02:20:18.860]   So he's one of the early adopters,
[02:20:18.860 --> 02:20:21.420]   or he's one of the people pushing the early adoption,
[02:20:21.420 --> 02:20:25.180]   this layer three, so inside Cash App.
[02:20:25.180 --> 02:20:29.380]   What do you make of the man of this decision
[02:20:29.380 --> 02:20:32.980]   as a business owner, as somebody playing in this space?
[02:20:32.980 --> 02:20:35.820]   Why did he do it?
[02:20:35.820 --> 02:20:40.300]   And what does that mean for others at this scale
[02:20:40.300 --> 02:20:41.500]   that might be doing the same?
[02:20:41.500 --> 02:20:43.380]   So incorporating lightning networking,
[02:20:43.380 --> 02:20:46.380]   incorporating Bitcoin into their products.
[02:20:46.380 --> 02:20:49.300]   I think he's been pretty clear about this.
[02:20:49.300 --> 02:20:51.060]   He feels that Bitcoin is an instrument
[02:20:51.060 --> 02:20:53.980]   of economic empowerment for billions of people
[02:20:53.980 --> 02:20:58.980]   that are unbanked and have no property rights in the world.
[02:20:58.980 --> 02:21:04.620]   If you want to give an incorruptible bank
[02:21:07.620 --> 02:21:11.220]   to 8 billion people on the planet,
[02:21:11.220 --> 02:21:14.980]   that's the same as asking the question,
[02:21:14.980 --> 02:21:19.780]   how do you give a full education through PhD
[02:21:19.780 --> 02:21:22.540]   to 8 billion people on the planet?
[02:21:22.540 --> 02:21:26.500]   And the answer is a digital version
[02:21:26.500 --> 02:21:29.460]   of the 20th century thing running on a mobile phone.
[02:21:29.460 --> 02:21:32.460]   And Bitcoin is a bank in cyberspace,
[02:21:32.460 --> 02:21:34.140]   is run by incorruptible software,
[02:21:34.140 --> 02:21:36.180]   and it's for everybody on earth.
[02:21:36.180 --> 02:21:37.540]   - So I think when Jack looks at it,
[02:21:37.540 --> 02:21:40.380]   he's very sensitive to the plight of everybody in Africa.
[02:21:40.380 --> 02:21:42.580]   You look at Africans, right?
[02:21:42.580 --> 02:21:43.940]   Like you're gonna give them banks,
[02:21:43.940 --> 02:21:45.780]   you're not gonna put a bank branch on every corner.
[02:21:45.780 --> 02:21:47.940]   That's an obscene waste of energy.
[02:21:47.940 --> 02:21:50.500]   You're not gonna run copper wires across the continent.
[02:21:50.500 --> 02:21:52.420]   That's an obscene waste of energy.
[02:21:52.420 --> 02:21:56.140]   You're not gonna give them gold.
[02:21:56.140 --> 02:22:02.780]   So how are you going to provide people with a decent life?
[02:22:02.780 --> 02:22:05.820]   The metaphor I think is relevant here,
[02:22:05.820 --> 02:22:09.300]   the biological metaphor, Lex, is a type one diabetic.
[02:22:09.300 --> 02:22:12.900]   If you're a type one diabetic, you can't form fat.
[02:22:12.900 --> 02:22:14.700]   And if you can't form fat,
[02:22:14.700 --> 02:22:16.660]   then you can't store excess energy.
[02:22:16.660 --> 02:22:19.220]   So that means that, I mean,
[02:22:19.220 --> 02:22:21.300]   fat is the ultimate organic battery.
[02:22:21.300 --> 02:22:22.780]   And if you've got 30 pounds of it,
[02:22:22.780 --> 02:22:24.980]   you can go 60 days without eating.
[02:22:24.980 --> 02:22:27.540]   But if you can't generate insulin,
[02:22:27.540 --> 02:22:29.260]   you can't form fat cells.
[02:22:29.260 --> 02:22:32.180]   And if you can't form fat cells and store energy,
[02:22:32.180 --> 02:22:34.300]   then you can eat yourself to death.
[02:22:34.300 --> 02:22:36.380]   I mean, you will eat and you will die.
[02:22:36.380 --> 02:22:37.860]   You'll starve to death.
[02:22:37.860 --> 02:22:40.460]   So the lack of property rights
[02:22:40.460 --> 02:22:43.340]   is like being a type one diabetic.
[02:22:43.340 --> 02:22:46.900]   And so if you look at most people everywhere in the world,
[02:22:46.900 --> 02:22:50.820]   they don't have property rights,
[02:22:50.820 --> 02:22:52.460]   they don't have an effective bank,
[02:22:52.460 --> 02:22:54.860]   and their currency is broken.
[02:22:54.860 --> 02:22:58.300]   Like what are the two things that in theory
[02:22:58.300 --> 02:23:03.300]   would serve as the equivalent of an organic battery
[02:23:03.660 --> 02:23:05.740]   or an economic battery to civilization?
[02:23:05.740 --> 02:23:09.100]   It would be, I have a currency which holds its value
[02:23:09.100 --> 02:23:10.580]   and I can store it in a bank.
[02:23:10.580 --> 02:23:15.580]   So a risk-free currency derivative.
[02:23:15.580 --> 02:23:21.380]   I pay you your money, you take your life savings,
[02:23:21.380 --> 02:23:24.020]   you put it in the bank, you save up for your retirement,
[02:23:24.020 --> 02:23:25.300]   you'll have happily ever after.
[02:23:25.300 --> 02:23:28.180]   That's the American dream, right?
[02:23:28.180 --> 02:23:30.740]   That's the idyllic situation.
[02:23:30.740 --> 02:23:33.860]   The real situation is there are no banks,
[02:23:33.860 --> 02:23:35.620]   you can't get a bank account.
[02:23:35.620 --> 02:23:38.940]   So I give you your pay in currency
[02:23:38.940 --> 02:23:42.260]   and then I double the supply and I give it to my cousin
[02:23:42.260 --> 02:23:44.180]   or I give it to whatever cause I want
[02:23:44.180 --> 02:23:45.620]   or I use it to buy weapons.
[02:23:45.620 --> 02:23:48.860]   And then you find a loaf of bread cost triple next month
[02:23:48.860 --> 02:23:50.020]   is what it costs.
[02:23:50.020 --> 02:23:53.140]   And your life savings is worthless.
[02:23:53.140 --> 02:23:55.300]   And so in that environment,
[02:23:55.300 --> 02:23:58.220]   everybody's ripped back to Stone Age barter.
[02:23:58.220 --> 02:24:00.780]   And the problem with that even Stone Age barter
[02:24:00.780 --> 02:24:03.820]   is you're gonna carry your life savings on your back.
[02:24:03.820 --> 02:24:05.380]   And what happens when the guy with a machine gun
[02:24:05.380 --> 02:24:07.580]   points it at your head and just takes your life savings.
[02:24:07.580 --> 02:24:11.380]   So I think from Jack's point of view,
[02:24:11.380 --> 02:24:15.340]   he thinks that life is, this is maybe too strong,
[02:24:15.340 --> 02:24:17.620]   but these are my words, life is hopeless
[02:24:17.620 --> 02:24:20.740]   for a lot of people and Bitcoin is hope.
[02:24:20.740 --> 02:24:25.140]   Because it gives everyone an engineered,
[02:24:25.980 --> 02:24:30.980]   an engineered monetary asset that's a bearer instrument.
[02:24:30.980 --> 02:24:35.740]   And it gives them a bank on their mobile phone.
[02:24:35.740 --> 02:24:40.220]   And they don't have to trust their government
[02:24:40.220 --> 02:24:45.220]   or another counterparty with their life force.
[02:24:45.220 --> 02:24:50.860]   So there's a secondary thing I think he's interested in,
[02:24:50.860 --> 02:24:53.980]   which is the first thing is the human rights issue.
[02:24:53.980 --> 02:24:57.780]   And the second thing would be the friction
[02:24:57.780 --> 02:25:02.300]   to trade cross borders is so great.
[02:25:02.300 --> 02:25:10.180]   You know, you like AI, so I'll give you a beautiful notion.
[02:25:10.180 --> 02:25:14.180]   Maybe one day there'll be an artificially intelligent
[02:25:14.180 --> 02:25:18.940]   creature in cyberspace that is self-sufficient and rich.
[02:25:18.940 --> 02:25:23.900]   - Like that we would have sovereignty.
[02:25:23.900 --> 02:25:28.900]   - Can a robot own money or property?
[02:25:28.900 --> 02:25:30.580]   How about can a Tesla car?
[02:25:30.580 --> 02:25:33.580]   Can I actually put enough money in a car
[02:25:33.580 --> 02:25:36.300]   for it to drive itself and maintain itself forever?
[02:25:36.300 --> 02:25:39.700]   Or can I create an artificially intelligent creature
[02:25:39.700 --> 02:25:43.780]   in cyberspace that is endowed such that it would live
[02:25:43.780 --> 02:25:48.020]   a thousand years and continue to do its job, right?
[02:25:48.020 --> 02:25:50.460]   You know, we have a word for that in the real world
[02:25:50.460 --> 02:25:54.180]   it's institution, Harvard, Cambridge, Stanford, right?
[02:25:54.180 --> 02:25:56.060]   There are institutions with endowments
[02:25:56.060 --> 02:25:58.660]   that go on in perpetuity.
[02:25:58.660 --> 02:26:03.660]   But what if I wanted to perpetuate a software program?
[02:26:03.660 --> 02:26:09.420]   And with something like digital property
[02:26:09.420 --> 02:26:12.460]   with Bitcoin and lightning, you could do it.
[02:26:12.460 --> 02:26:18.400]   And on the other hand, with banks and credit cards,
[02:26:19.740 --> 02:26:22.140]   you couldn't, right?
[02:26:22.140 --> 02:26:23.220]   You couldn't ever.
[02:26:23.220 --> 02:26:28.100]   So you can create things that are beautiful and lasting.
[02:26:28.100 --> 02:26:31.540]   And what's the difference in speed?
[02:26:31.540 --> 02:26:36.540]   Well, so I can either trade with everybody in the world
[02:26:36.540 --> 02:26:40.820]   at the speed of light, friction-free in 24 hours,
[02:26:40.820 --> 02:26:45.940]   writing a Python script, or I can spend $100 billion
[02:26:45.940 --> 02:26:49.220]   to trade with a few million people in the world
[02:26:49.220 --> 02:26:53.040]   after it takes them six months of application.
[02:26:53.040 --> 02:26:58.040]   The impedance is like a 10 million to one difference, right?
[02:26:58.040 --> 02:27:02.100]   And the metaphors are literally like launching something
[02:27:02.100 --> 02:27:07.100]   in orbit versus almost orbit or vacuum sealing something.
[02:27:07.100 --> 02:27:10.420]   Does it last forever and does it orbit forever
[02:27:10.420 --> 02:27:14.140]   or does it go up and come down and burn up, right?
[02:27:14.140 --> 02:27:18.500]   And I think Jack is interested in, you know,
[02:27:19.500 --> 02:27:21.660]   putting freedom in orbit, right?
[02:27:21.660 --> 02:27:23.500]   Putting freedom.
[02:27:23.500 --> 02:27:24.420]   Putting freedom in orbit.
[02:27:24.420 --> 02:27:25.940]   And he said it many times.
[02:27:25.940 --> 02:27:29.420]   He said, "The internet needs a native currency."
[02:27:29.420 --> 02:27:30.300]   Yeah.
[02:27:30.300 --> 02:27:31.140]   Right?
[02:27:31.140 --> 02:27:35.500]   And no political construct or security
[02:27:35.500 --> 02:27:37.360]   can be a native currency.
[02:27:37.360 --> 02:27:39.540]   You need a property and you need a property
[02:27:39.540 --> 02:27:42.100]   that can be moved a million times a second.
[02:27:42.100 --> 02:27:46.940]   Can you oscillate it at 10 kilohertz or a hundred kilohertz?
[02:27:46.940 --> 02:27:51.940]   And the answer is only if it's a pure digital construct,
[02:27:51.940 --> 02:27:55.060]   permissionless and open.
[02:27:55.060 --> 02:27:58.860]   And so I think he's enthusiastic as the technologist
[02:27:58.860 --> 02:28:01.580]   and he's enthusiastic as the humanitarian.
[02:28:01.580 --> 02:28:05.900]   And what he's doing is support both those areas.
[02:28:05.900 --> 02:28:08.380]   He's supporting the Bitcoin and the Lightning protocol
[02:28:08.380 --> 02:28:09.620]   by building them into his products,
[02:28:09.620 --> 02:28:12.900]   but he's also building the applications,
[02:28:12.900 --> 02:28:15.580]   which you need at the cash app level
[02:28:15.580 --> 02:28:19.340]   in order to commercialize and deliver the functionality
[02:28:19.340 --> 02:28:20.700]   and the compliance necessary.
[02:28:20.700 --> 02:28:22.760]   And they're related.
[02:28:22.760 --> 02:28:28.020]   - And I should also say, he's just a fascinating person.
[02:28:28.020 --> 02:28:31.940]   For a random reason that I couldn't even explain,
[02:28:31.940 --> 02:28:35.580]   if I tried, I met him a few days ago
[02:28:35.580 --> 02:28:38.420]   and gave him a great big hug in the middle of nowhere.
[02:28:38.420 --> 02:28:39.980]   There was no explanation.
[02:28:39.980 --> 02:28:41.340]   He just appeared.
[02:28:41.340 --> 02:28:42.720]   That's a fascinating human.
[02:28:42.720 --> 02:28:45.420]   His relationship with art, with the world,
[02:28:45.420 --> 02:28:48.840]   with human suffering, with technology is fascinating.
[02:28:48.840 --> 02:28:53.660]   I don't know what his path looks like,
[02:28:53.660 --> 02:28:56.100]   but it's interesting that people like that exist.
[02:28:56.100 --> 02:28:59.300]   And in part, I'm saddened that he no longer
[02:28:59.300 --> 02:29:03.580]   is involved with Twitter directly as its CEO,
[02:29:03.580 --> 02:29:06.020]   because I was hoping something inside Twitter
[02:29:06.020 --> 02:29:09.900]   would also integrate some of these ideas
[02:29:09.900 --> 02:29:12.580]   of what you're calling digital energy
[02:29:13.740 --> 02:29:15.420]   to see how social networks,
[02:29:15.420 --> 02:29:17.820]   something I'm really interested in and passionate about,
[02:29:17.820 --> 02:29:19.460]   could be transformed.
[02:29:19.460 --> 02:29:21.940]   Let me ask you just for educational purposes,
[02:29:21.940 --> 02:29:26.700]   what's the, can you please explain to me
[02:29:26.700 --> 02:29:30.580]   what Web3 and the beef between Jack and Marc Andreessen is?
[02:29:30.580 --> 02:29:31.500]   Exactly.
[02:29:31.500 --> 02:29:33.140]   Did you see what happened?
[02:29:33.140 --> 02:29:36.400]   Sorry to have you analyze Twitter like it's Shakespeare,
[02:29:36.400 --> 02:29:38.900]   but can you please explain to me
[02:29:38.900 --> 02:29:42.740]   why there was any drama over this topic?
[02:29:42.740 --> 02:29:47.740]   First of all, Web3 is a term that's used to refer
[02:29:47.740 --> 02:29:51.740]   to the part of the economy that's token finance.
[02:29:51.740 --> 02:29:54.860]   So if I'm launching an application and my idea
[02:29:54.860 --> 02:29:58.820]   is to create a token along with the application
[02:29:58.820 --> 02:30:00.540]   and issue the token to the community
[02:30:00.540 --> 02:30:04.140]   so as to finance the application and build support for it,
[02:30:04.140 --> 02:30:09.540]   I think that that's the most common interpretation
[02:30:09.540 --> 02:30:10.380]   of Web3.
[02:30:10.380 --> 02:30:12.380]   There are other interpretations too.
[02:30:12.380 --> 02:30:14.420]   So I'm just gonna refer to that one.
[02:30:14.420 --> 02:30:17.180]   And I think the beef, in a nutshell,
[02:30:17.180 --> 02:30:19.180]   not articulated, but I'll articulate it,
[02:30:19.180 --> 02:30:23.620]   is whether or not you should focus all your energy
[02:30:23.620 --> 02:30:26.940]   creating applications on top of an ethical digital property
[02:30:26.940 --> 02:30:30.460]   like Bitcoin, or whether you should attempt
[02:30:30.460 --> 02:30:33.500]   to create a competitor to it,
[02:30:33.500 --> 02:30:39.020]   which generally would be deemed as a security
[02:30:39.020 --> 02:30:40.560]   by the Bitcoin community.
[02:30:40.560 --> 02:30:42.660]   So I'm gonna put on my Bitcoin hat here.
[02:30:42.660 --> 02:30:43.480]   Yeah.
[02:30:43.480 --> 02:30:44.860]   All the tokens that are,
[02:30:44.860 --> 02:30:46.820]   if it's driven by a venture capitalist,
[02:30:46.820 --> 02:30:48.000]   well, it's a security.
[02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.900]   If there's a CEO and a CTO, it's a security.
[02:30:50.900 --> 02:30:53.700]   All these projects, they're companies,
[02:30:53.700 --> 02:30:55.700]   foundations are companies.
[02:30:55.700 --> 02:30:58.180]   If you call them a project or a foundation,
[02:30:58.180 --> 02:31:00.660]   it doesn't make it not a security.
[02:31:00.660 --> 02:31:04.500]   They're all in essence collections of individuals
[02:31:04.500 --> 02:31:08.420]   that are issuing equity in the form of a token.
[02:31:08.420 --> 02:31:13.420]   And if there's a pre-mine, an IPO, an ICO, a foundation,
[02:31:13.420 --> 02:31:18.980]   or any kind of protocol where there's a group of engineers
[02:31:18.980 --> 02:31:25.480]   that have influence over it,
[02:31:25.480 --> 02:31:30.480]   then to a securities lawyer, or to most Bitcoiners,
[02:31:30.480 --> 02:31:33.440]   and definitely to anybody that's steeped in securities law,
[02:31:33.440 --> 02:31:36.920]   you look at it and say, "Well, that passes the Howey test.
[02:31:36.920 --> 02:31:39.640]   It looks like a security.
[02:31:39.640 --> 02:31:41.220]   It should be sold to the public
[02:31:41.220 --> 02:31:45.900]   pursuant to disclosures and regulations."
[02:31:45.900 --> 02:31:49.600]   And you're just ducking the IPO process.
[02:31:49.600 --> 02:31:53.760]   And so now we get back to the ethical issue.
[02:31:53.760 --> 02:31:56.940]   Well, the ethical issue is,
[02:31:56.940 --> 02:31:58.760]   if you're trading it as a commodity
[02:31:58.760 --> 02:32:00.980]   and representing it as a commodity,
[02:32:00.980 --> 02:32:03.820]   while truthfully it's a security,
[02:32:03.820 --> 02:32:05.620]   then it's a violation of ethics rules,
[02:32:05.620 --> 02:32:07.060]   and it's probably illegal.
[02:32:07.060 --> 02:32:08.720]   - Well, you keep leaning on this.
[02:32:08.720 --> 02:32:10.020]   Let me push back on that part.
[02:32:10.020 --> 02:32:10.980]   Maybe you can educate me.
[02:32:10.980 --> 02:32:14.220]   But you keep leaning on this line of securities law
[02:32:14.220 --> 02:32:18.720]   as if it, with all due respect to lawyers,
[02:32:18.720 --> 02:32:23.720]   as if that line somehow defines what is and isn't ethical.
[02:32:23.720 --> 02:32:27.460]   I think there's a lot of correlation, as you've discussed.
[02:32:27.460 --> 02:32:31.300]   But I'd like to leave the line aside.
[02:32:31.300 --> 02:32:33.660]   If the law calls something a security,
[02:32:33.660 --> 02:32:38.460]   it doesn't mean, in my eyes, that it is unethical.
[02:32:38.460 --> 02:32:40.460]   I mean, there could be some technicalities,
[02:32:40.460 --> 02:32:42.780]   and lawyers and people play games
[02:32:42.780 --> 02:32:44.200]   with this kind of stuff all the time.
[02:32:44.200 --> 02:32:47.420]   But I take your bigger point that if there's a CEO,
[02:32:47.420 --> 02:32:49.620]   there's a project lead that's fundamentally,
[02:32:49.620 --> 02:32:51.860]   well, that to you is fundamentally different
[02:32:51.860 --> 02:32:54.620]   than the structure of Bitcoin.
[02:32:54.620 --> 02:32:57.380]   - It's not that creating securities is unethical.
[02:32:57.380 --> 02:32:58.280]   I created security.
[02:32:58.280 --> 02:33:01.000]   I took a company public, right?
[02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:02.260]   That's not the unethical part.
[02:33:02.260 --> 02:33:05.060]   It's completely ethical to create securities.
[02:33:05.060 --> 02:33:06.220]   Block is a security.
[02:33:06.220 --> 02:33:08.220]   All companies are securities.
[02:33:08.220 --> 02:33:10.980]   The unethical part is to represent it as property
[02:33:10.980 --> 02:33:15.980]   when it's a security, and to promote it or trade it as such.
[02:33:15.980 --> 02:33:20.800]   - This whole promotion, that's also a technical thing,
[02:33:20.800 --> 02:33:25.800]   'cause you're, like, what counts and not as promotion
[02:33:25.800 --> 02:33:28.020]   is a legal thing, and you get in trouble
[02:33:28.020 --> 02:33:28.840]   for all these things.
[02:33:28.840 --> 02:33:31.820]   But that's the game that lawyers play.
[02:33:31.820 --> 02:33:34.260]   There's an ethical thing here, which is, like,
[02:33:34.260 --> 02:33:36.120]   what's right to promote and not?
[02:33:36.120 --> 02:33:40.460]   To me, propaganda is unethical,
[02:33:40.460 --> 02:33:42.800]   but it's usually not illegal.
[02:33:42.800 --> 02:33:48.460]   - If you roll the clock back 20 years, right?
[02:33:48.460 --> 02:33:50.580]   All the boiler room pump and dump schemes
[02:33:50.580 --> 02:33:53.300]   were all about someone pitching a penny stock,
[02:33:53.300 --> 02:33:55.660]   selling Swampland in Florida.
[02:33:55.660 --> 02:33:59.720]   And if you roll the clock back forward 20 years,
[02:33:59.720 --> 02:34:01.860]   and I create my own company,
[02:34:01.860 --> 02:34:03.740]   and I represent it as the same thing,
[02:34:03.740 --> 02:34:06.220]   and I don't make the disclosures, right?
[02:34:06.220 --> 02:34:10.540]   You're just one step removed from the boiler room scheme,
[02:34:10.540 --> 02:34:13.760]   and that's what's distasteful about it.
[02:34:13.760 --> 02:34:15.940]   There are ways to sell securities to the public,
[02:34:15.940 --> 02:34:18.580]   but there are expectations.
[02:34:18.580 --> 02:34:22.620]   Maybe we could forget about whether the security laws
[02:34:22.620 --> 02:34:24.540]   are ethical or not, right?
[02:34:24.540 --> 02:34:25.860]   We'll leave that alone.
[02:34:25.860 --> 02:34:29.500]   We'll just start with the biblical definition of ethics.
[02:34:29.500 --> 02:34:31.860]   - Yes. - Don't lie, cheat, or steal.
[02:34:31.860 --> 02:34:34.460]   So if I'm going to sell something to you,
[02:34:34.460 --> 02:34:38.280]   I need to fully disclose what I'm selling to you, right?
[02:34:38.280 --> 02:34:43.280]   And that's a matter of great debate right now.
[02:34:43.280 --> 02:34:47.160]   And so I think that that's part of the debate.
[02:34:47.160 --> 02:34:48.900]   But the other part of the debate is
[02:34:48.900 --> 02:34:54.280]   whether or not we need more than one token.
[02:34:54.280 --> 02:34:58.660]   Like, we need at least one, right?
[02:34:58.660 --> 02:35:01.580]   We need at least one digital property
[02:35:01.580 --> 02:35:06.180]   because zero means there is no digital economy.
[02:35:06.180 --> 02:35:10.140]   And by the way, the conventional view of maximalists
[02:35:10.140 --> 02:35:13.080]   is they think there's only one and everything else isn't.
[02:35:13.080 --> 02:35:14.640]   That's not the point I'm gonna make.
[02:35:14.640 --> 02:35:19.440]   I would say we know there is at least one digital property,
[02:35:19.440 --> 02:35:20.440]   and that is Bitcoin.
[02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:24.980]   If you can create a truly decentralized,
[02:35:24.980 --> 02:35:29.980]   non-custodial, you know, bearer instrument
[02:35:29.980 --> 02:35:34.640]   that is not under the control of any organization
[02:35:34.640 --> 02:35:36.980]   that is fairly distributed,
[02:35:36.980 --> 02:35:39.500]   then you might create another or multiple,
[02:35:39.500 --> 02:35:42.100]   and there may be others out there.
[02:35:42.100 --> 02:35:47.100]   But I think that the frustration of a lot of people
[02:35:47.100 --> 02:35:51.480]   in the Bitcoin community, and I share this with Jack,
[02:35:51.480 --> 02:35:56.080]   is we could create $100 trillion of value in the real world
[02:35:56.080 --> 02:35:57.840]   simply by building applications
[02:35:57.840 --> 02:36:02.080]   on top of Bitcoin as a foundation.
[02:36:02.080 --> 02:36:05.800]   And so continually trying to reinvent the wheel
[02:36:05.800 --> 02:36:10.800]   and create competitive things
[02:36:10.800 --> 02:36:14.560]   is a massive waste of time
[02:36:14.560 --> 02:36:19.240]   and it's diversion of human creativity.
[02:36:19.240 --> 02:36:23.000]   It's like, we have an ethical good thing,
[02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:28.000]   and now we're going to try to create a third or a fourth one.
[02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:29.020]   Why?
[02:36:29.020 --> 02:36:29.860]   - Well, let's talk about it.
[02:36:29.860 --> 02:36:31.680]   So first of all, I'm with you,
[02:36:31.680 --> 02:36:34.360]   but let me ask you this interesting question,
[02:36:34.360 --> 02:36:37.020]   because we talked about properties and securities.
[02:36:37.020 --> 02:36:39.480]   Let's talk about conflict of interest.
[02:36:39.480 --> 02:36:41.840]   So you said you could advertise public,
[02:36:41.840 --> 02:36:44.280]   you have a popular Twitter account.
[02:36:44.280 --> 02:36:47.400]   It's hilarious and insightful.
[02:36:48.560 --> 02:36:52.320]   You do promote Bitcoin in a sense.
[02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:54.040]   I don't know if you would say that,
[02:36:54.040 --> 02:36:56.720]   but do you think there's a conflict of interest
[02:36:56.720 --> 02:36:59.880]   in anyone who owns Bitcoin promoting Bitcoin?
[02:36:59.880 --> 02:37:03.760]   Is it the same as you promoting the farming?
[02:37:03.760 --> 02:37:07.200]   - I would say no, there's an interest.
[02:37:07.200 --> 02:37:12.200]   I think that you can promote a property or an idea
[02:37:15.320 --> 02:37:18.920]   to the extent that you don't control it.
[02:37:18.920 --> 02:37:22.640]   I think that the point at which you start to have
[02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:25.520]   a conflict of interest is when you're promoting
[02:37:25.520 --> 02:37:29.140]   a proprietary product or a proprietary security.
[02:37:29.140 --> 02:37:32.120]   A security in general is a proprietary asset.
[02:37:32.120 --> 02:37:35.000]   So for example, if you look at my Twitter,
[02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:38.120]   you will find that I make lots of statements about Bitcoin.
[02:37:38.120 --> 02:37:40.960]   You won't ever see me making a statement that say,
[02:37:40.960 --> 02:37:43.560]   micro strategy stock will go up forever.
[02:37:43.560 --> 02:37:47.560]   I'm not promoting a security MSTR
[02:37:47.560 --> 02:37:51.400]   because at the end of the day, MSTR is a security.
[02:37:51.400 --> 02:37:52.440]   It is proprietary.
[02:37:52.440 --> 02:37:54.680]   I have proprietary interest in it.
[02:37:54.680 --> 02:37:58.440]   I have a disproportionate amount of control
[02:37:58.440 --> 02:38:01.040]   and influence on the direction.
[02:38:01.040 --> 02:38:02.320]   - The control is the problem.
[02:38:02.320 --> 02:38:03.960]   The control is the problem
[02:38:03.960 --> 02:38:05.920]   because you have interest in both.
[02:38:05.920 --> 02:38:09.600]   You can vary, if Bitcoin is as successful
[02:38:09.600 --> 02:38:11.280]   as we're talking about,
[02:38:11.280 --> 02:38:13.720]   you are very possibly can become
[02:38:13.720 --> 02:38:16.080]   the richest human on earth,
[02:38:16.080 --> 02:38:19.360]   given how much you own in Bitcoin, right?
[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:20.920]   The wealthiest, not the richest.
[02:38:20.920 --> 02:38:22.560]   I don't know what those words mean.
[02:38:22.560 --> 02:38:24.920]   - I would benefit economically.
[02:38:24.920 --> 02:38:26.280]   - You would benefit economically.
[02:38:26.280 --> 02:38:27.120]   - That's true.
[02:38:27.120 --> 02:38:30.240]   - So the reason that's not conflict of interest
[02:38:30.240 --> 02:38:34.440]   is because the word property,
[02:38:34.440 --> 02:38:39.440]   that Bitcoin is an idea and Bitcoin is open.
[02:38:40.160 --> 02:38:41.960]   I don't control it.
[02:38:41.960 --> 02:38:46.000]   In essence, the ethical line here is,
[02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:49.520]   could I print myself 10 million more Bitcoin or not?
[02:38:49.520 --> 02:38:52.560]   - Or can anyone, right?
[02:38:52.560 --> 02:38:55.600]   It's not just you, it's can anyone.
[02:38:55.600 --> 02:38:57.680]   Because can you promote somebody else's?
[02:38:57.680 --> 02:38:58.920]   Yes, I guess you can.
[02:38:58.920 --> 02:39:02.880]   Like, can you promote us, Apple?
[02:39:02.880 --> 02:39:06.160]   - It's like, you could have a Twitter account
[02:39:06.160 --> 02:39:10.600]   where you promote oil or you promote camping
[02:39:10.600 --> 02:39:15.040]   or you promote family values or promote a carnivore diet
[02:39:15.040 --> 02:39:17.720]   or promote the Iron Man, right?
[02:39:17.720 --> 02:39:21.600]   - You're not gonna get wealthier if you promote camping
[02:39:21.600 --> 02:39:23.760]   'cause you can't own a stake in, I mean,
[02:39:23.760 --> 02:39:27.960]   you own a lot of Bitcoin, what is that?
[02:39:27.960 --> 02:39:32.640]   Don't you own the stake in the idea of Bitcoin?
[02:39:32.640 --> 02:39:33.880]   - I would grant you that.
[02:39:34.800 --> 02:39:39.320]   But the lack of control is the fundamental ethical line
[02:39:39.320 --> 02:39:41.160]   that you just, you don't have,
[02:39:41.160 --> 02:39:43.320]   all you are is you're a fan of the idea,
[02:39:43.320 --> 02:39:45.820]   you believe in the idea and the power of the idea.
[02:39:45.820 --> 02:39:47.920]   - Yeah, I think--
[02:39:47.920 --> 02:39:50.400]   - You can't take that idea away from others.
[02:39:50.400 --> 02:39:52.080]   - Let's come back to, let me give you
[02:39:52.080 --> 02:39:54.160]   some maybe easier examples.
[02:39:54.160 --> 02:39:58.000]   If you were the head of the Marine Corps, right?
[02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:01.880]   And someone came to you and said,
[02:40:01.880 --> 02:40:03.920]   "I created Marine Coin."
[02:40:03.920 --> 02:40:07.600]   And the twist on Marine Coin is,
[02:40:07.600 --> 02:40:09.200]   I want you to tell every Marine
[02:40:09.200 --> 02:40:11.040]   that they'll get an extra Marine Coin
[02:40:11.040 --> 02:40:15.160]   when they get their next stripe.
[02:40:15.160 --> 02:40:16.880]   And then I'm gonna give you,
[02:40:16.880 --> 02:40:18.800]   I'm gonna let you buy Marine Coin now
[02:40:18.800 --> 02:40:20.280]   and then after you buy Marine Coin,
[02:40:20.280 --> 02:40:25.280]   I want you to like promote it to them, right?
[02:40:25.280 --> 02:40:29.200]   At some point, if you start to have
[02:40:29.200 --> 02:40:31.680]   a disproportional influence on it
[02:40:31.680 --> 02:40:33.080]   or if you're in a conversation
[02:40:33.080 --> 02:40:34.760]   with people with disproportionate influence
[02:40:34.760 --> 02:40:36.160]   becomes conflict of interest
[02:40:36.160 --> 02:40:39.800]   and it would make you profoundly uncomfortable, I think.
[02:40:39.800 --> 02:40:42.120]   If the head of the Marine Corps started promoting
[02:40:42.120 --> 02:40:45.120]   anything that looked like a security.
[02:40:45.120 --> 02:40:46.960]   Now, if the head of the Marine Corps
[02:40:46.960 --> 02:40:48.440]   started promoting canoeing,
[02:40:48.440 --> 02:40:51.680]   you might think he's kind of wacky,
[02:40:51.680 --> 02:40:54.440]   like maybe, like that's kind of a waste of time
[02:40:54.440 --> 02:40:56.040]   and a distraction, so,
[02:40:56.040 --> 02:41:01.040]   but to the extent that canoeing is not a security,
[02:41:01.640 --> 02:41:03.920]   not a problem unless you, you know.
[02:41:03.920 --> 02:41:07.400]   Ultimately, the issue of decentralization
[02:41:07.400 --> 02:41:10.600]   is really a critical one. - So not having a head.
[02:41:10.600 --> 02:41:15.600]   So is it something, can Bitcoin be replicated?
[02:41:15.600 --> 02:41:19.960]   So all the things that you're saying
[02:41:19.960 --> 02:41:22.320]   that make it a property, can that be replicated?
[02:41:22.320 --> 02:41:23.760]   Have any other-- - I think it's possible
[02:41:23.760 --> 02:41:26.520]   to create other crypto properties.
[02:41:26.520 --> 02:41:31.520]   - Does the having a head like of a project
[02:41:31.560 --> 02:41:35.040]   a thing that limits its ability to be a property?
[02:41:35.040 --> 02:41:38.120]   If you try to replicate a project?
[02:41:38.120 --> 02:41:41.480]   Is that the fundamental flaw?
[02:41:41.480 --> 02:41:43.760]   - Look, I think the real fundamental issue
[02:41:43.760 --> 02:41:45.800]   is you just never want it to change.
[02:41:45.800 --> 02:41:51.200]   Like, if you really want something decentralized,
[02:41:51.200 --> 02:41:55.520]   you want a genetic template that substantially
[02:41:55.520 --> 02:41:58.280]   is not gonna change for a thousand years.
[02:41:58.280 --> 02:42:00.760]   So I think Satoshi said it at one point,
[02:42:00.760 --> 02:42:02.760]   he said the nature of the software is such
[02:42:02.760 --> 02:42:06.480]   that by version 0.1, its genetic code was set.
[02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:09.800]   If there was any development team
[02:42:09.800 --> 02:42:12.080]   that's continually changing it, you know,
[02:42:12.080 --> 02:42:16.280]   on a routine basis, it becomes harder and harder
[02:42:16.280 --> 02:42:18.080]   to maintain its decentralization
[02:42:18.080 --> 02:42:20.200]   because now there's the issue
[02:42:20.200 --> 02:42:23.840]   of who's influencing the changes.
[02:42:23.840 --> 02:42:28.840]   So what you really want is a very, very simple idea, right?
[02:42:30.320 --> 02:42:32.440]   The simplest idea, I'm just gonna keep track
[02:42:32.440 --> 02:42:36.200]   of who owns 21 million parts of energy.
[02:42:36.200 --> 02:42:40.680]   And when someone proposes big functional upgrades,
[02:42:40.680 --> 02:42:43.200]   you almost don't, you don't really want that development
[02:42:43.200 --> 02:42:44.320]   to go on the base layer.
[02:42:44.320 --> 02:42:46.720]   You want that development to go on the layer threes
[02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:51.720]   because now Cash App has a proprietary set of functionality
[02:42:51.720 --> 02:42:53.880]   and it's a security.
[02:42:53.880 --> 02:42:57.160]   And if you're gonna promote the use of this thing,
[02:42:57.160 --> 02:43:02.160]   you're not gonna promote the layer three security
[02:43:02.160 --> 02:43:05.960]   because that's an edge to a given entity
[02:43:05.960 --> 02:43:07.520]   and you're trusting the counterparty.
[02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:12.400]   You're gonna promote the layer one or most the layer two.
[02:43:12.400 --> 02:43:18.600]   - Okay, so one of the fascinating things about Bitcoin,
[02:43:18.600 --> 02:43:21.320]   and sorry to romanticize certain notions,
[02:43:21.320 --> 02:43:24.560]   but Satoshi Nakamoto, that the founder is anonymous.
[02:43:25.680 --> 02:43:29.720]   Maybe you can speak to whether that's useful,
[02:43:29.720 --> 02:43:32.080]   but also I just like the psychology of that,
[02:43:32.080 --> 02:43:33.760]   to imagine that there's a human being
[02:43:33.760 --> 02:43:37.120]   that was able to create something special and walk away.
[02:43:37.120 --> 02:43:40.360]   So first, are you Satoshi Nakamoto?
[02:43:40.360 --> 02:43:41.440]   - I'm certain I'm not.
[02:43:41.440 --> 02:43:48.760]   No, actually, I think the provenance is really important.
[02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:51.680]   And if I were to look at the highlighted points,
[02:43:51.680 --> 02:43:55.320]   I think having a founder that was anonymous
[02:43:55.320 --> 02:43:57.000]   or said anonymous is important.
[02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.920]   I think the founder disappearing is also important.
[02:43:59.920 --> 02:44:03.400]   I think that the fact that the Satoshi coins never moved
[02:44:03.400 --> 02:44:04.720]   is also important.
[02:44:04.720 --> 02:44:08.880]   I think the lack of an initial coin offering
[02:44:08.880 --> 02:44:10.120]   is also important.
[02:44:10.120 --> 02:44:14.160]   I think the lack of a corporate sponsor is important.
[02:44:14.160 --> 02:44:16.920]   I think the fact that it traded for 15 months
[02:44:16.920 --> 02:44:21.480]   with no commercial value was also important.
[02:44:21.480 --> 02:44:26.480]   You know, I think that the simplicity of the protocol
[02:44:26.480 --> 02:44:29.200]   is very important.
[02:44:29.200 --> 02:44:31.960]   I think that the outcome of the block size wars
[02:44:31.960 --> 02:44:33.440]   is very important.
[02:44:33.440 --> 02:44:38.440]   And all of those things add up to common property.
[02:44:38.440 --> 02:44:43.440]   They're all indicators of a digital property
[02:44:43.440 --> 02:44:45.160]   as opposed to security.
[02:44:45.160 --> 02:44:47.440]   If there was a Satoshi sitting around,
[02:44:47.440 --> 02:44:52.240]   sitting on top of $50 billion worth of Bitcoin,
[02:44:52.240 --> 02:44:57.240]   I don't think it would cripple Bitcoin as property,
[02:44:57.240 --> 02:45:02.240]   but I think it would undermine its digital property.
[02:45:02.240 --> 02:45:05.680]   And if I wanted to undermine a crypto asset network,
[02:45:05.680 --> 02:45:08.080]   I would do the opposite of all those things.
[02:45:08.080 --> 02:45:09.840]   I would launch one myself.
[02:45:09.840 --> 02:45:13.480]   I would sell 25% or 50% of the general public.
[02:45:13.480 --> 02:45:15.320]   I would keep some of the initial,
[02:45:15.320 --> 02:45:18.360]   I would pre-mine some stuff or early mine it,
[02:45:18.360 --> 02:45:20.480]   and I would keep an influence on it.
[02:45:20.480 --> 02:45:24.680]   Those are all the opposite of what you would do
[02:45:24.680 --> 02:45:28.640]   in order to create common property.
[02:45:28.640 --> 02:45:33.080]   And so I see the entire story as Satoshi giving a gift
[02:45:33.080 --> 02:45:38.080]   of digital property to the human race and disappearing.
[02:45:38.080 --> 02:45:40.200]   - Do you think it was one person?
[02:45:40.200 --> 02:45:41.800]   Do you have ideas of who it could be?
[02:45:41.800 --> 02:45:44.600]   - I don't care to speculate.
[02:45:45.040 --> 02:45:45.880]   (laughs)
[02:45:45.880 --> 02:45:48.080]   - But do you think it was one person?
[02:45:48.080 --> 02:45:49.880]   - I think it was one person.
[02:45:49.880 --> 02:45:51.880]   Maybe in conjunction with a bunch of others.
[02:45:51.880 --> 02:45:53.480]   I mean, it might've been a group of people
[02:45:53.480 --> 02:45:54.520]   that were working together,
[02:45:54.520 --> 02:45:56.440]   but certainly there's a Satoshi.
[02:45:56.440 --> 02:45:58.240]   - I mean, it's just so fascinating to me
[02:45:58.240 --> 02:46:02.080]   that one person could be so brave and thoughtful.
[02:46:02.080 --> 02:46:03.440]   Or do you think a lot of his accent,
[02:46:03.440 --> 02:46:05.280]   like the block size wars,
[02:46:05.280 --> 02:46:08.560]   the decision to make a block a certain size,
[02:46:08.560 --> 02:46:12.000]   all the things you mentioned led up to the characteristics
[02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:13.960]   that make Bitcoin property.
[02:46:13.960 --> 02:46:17.040]   Do you think that's an accident
[02:46:17.040 --> 02:46:19.360]   or it was deeply thought through?
[02:46:19.360 --> 02:46:21.000]   Like how does, this is almost like a history
[02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:21.840]   of science question.
[02:46:21.840 --> 02:46:24.400]   - People tried it for, they tried 40 of them, right?
[02:46:24.400 --> 02:46:26.960]   I mean, I think there's a history of attempting
[02:46:26.960 --> 02:46:28.280]   to create something like this
[02:46:28.280 --> 02:46:29.840]   and it was tried many, many times
[02:46:29.840 --> 02:46:32.340]   and they failed for different reasons.
[02:46:32.340 --> 02:46:35.760]   And I think that it's like Prometheus tried to start a fire
[02:46:35.760 --> 02:46:39.440]   47 times and maybe the 48th time it sparked.
[02:46:39.440 --> 02:46:40.840]   And that's how I see this.
[02:46:40.840 --> 02:46:42.640]   This is the first one that sparked
[02:46:42.640 --> 02:46:46.920]   and it sets a roadmap for us.
[02:46:46.920 --> 02:46:50.760]   And I think if you're looking for any one word
[02:46:50.760 --> 02:46:52.600]   that characterize it's fair, right?
[02:46:52.600 --> 02:46:55.840]   The whole point of the network is it's a fair launch,
[02:46:55.840 --> 02:46:58.320]   a fair distribution.
[02:46:58.320 --> 02:47:02.560]   Like, yeah, I have Bitcoin, but I bought it.
[02:47:02.560 --> 02:47:08.360]   In fact, at this point we've paid $4 billion
[02:47:08.360 --> 02:47:11.040]   of you real cash to buy it.
[02:47:11.040 --> 02:47:16.040]   If I was sitting on the same position and I had it for free,
[02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:19.080]   then there's always this question of,
[02:47:19.080 --> 02:47:21.840]   did I, or I bought it for a nickel, a coin or a penny,
[02:47:21.840 --> 02:47:24.040]   a coin, the question is, was it fair?
[02:47:24.040 --> 02:47:27.800]   And that's a very hard question to answer, right?
[02:47:27.800 --> 02:47:32.240]   Did you acquire the Bitcoin that you own fairly?
[02:47:32.240 --> 02:47:34.600]   And if you roll the clock back,
[02:47:34.600 --> 02:47:37.160]   you could have bought it for a nickel or a dime,
[02:47:37.160 --> 02:47:38.880]   but that was when it was a million times
[02:47:38.880 --> 02:47:41.280]   more likely to fail, right?
[02:47:41.280 --> 02:47:44.600]   When the risk was greater, the cost was lower.
[02:47:44.600 --> 02:47:47.880]   And then over time, the risk became lower
[02:47:47.880 --> 02:47:50.320]   and the cost became greater.
[02:47:50.320 --> 02:47:54.760]   And the real critical thing was to allow the marketplace
[02:47:54.760 --> 02:47:59.120]   absent any powerful interested actor, right?
[02:47:59.120 --> 02:48:01.560]   It's almost like if Satoshi had held a million coins
[02:48:01.560 --> 02:48:03.640]   and then stayed engaged for 10 more years,
[02:48:03.640 --> 02:48:06.040]   tweaking things in the background,
[02:48:06.040 --> 02:48:07.880]   there'd still be that question.
[02:48:07.880 --> 02:48:11.200]   But what we've got is really a beautiful thing.
[02:48:11.200 --> 02:48:15.200]   We've got a chain reaction in cyberspace
[02:48:15.200 --> 02:48:19.480]   or an ideology spreading virally in the world
[02:48:19.480 --> 02:48:25.600]   that has seasoned in a fair ethical fashion.
[02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:29.480]   Sometimes it's a very violent, brutal fashion
[02:48:29.480 --> 02:48:32.040]   with all the volatility, right?
[02:48:32.040 --> 02:48:35.980]   And there's been a lot of sound and fury along the way.
[02:48:36.180 --> 02:48:39.780]   - How do you psychoanalyze, how do you deal
[02:48:39.780 --> 02:48:42.060]   from a financial, from a human perspective
[02:48:42.060 --> 02:48:43.420]   with the volatility?
[02:48:43.420 --> 02:48:45.820]   You mentioned you could have gotten it for a nickel
[02:48:45.820 --> 02:48:47.440]   and the risk was great.
[02:48:47.440 --> 02:48:48.820]   Where's the risk today?
[02:48:48.820 --> 02:48:50.220]   What's your sense?
[02:48:50.220 --> 02:48:54.100]   - You know, we're 13 years into this entire activity.
[02:48:54.100 --> 02:48:56.260]   I think the risk has never been lower.
[02:48:56.260 --> 02:48:59.100]   I, if you look at all the risks, right?
[02:48:59.100 --> 02:49:02.940]   The risks in the early years are,
[02:49:02.940 --> 02:49:05.020]   is the engineering protocol proper?
[02:49:05.020 --> 02:49:10.020]   Like one megabyte block size, 10 minute clock frequency,
[02:49:10.020 --> 02:49:15.780]   cryptography is, first, will it be hacked or will it crash?
[02:49:15.780 --> 02:49:19.100]   730,000 blocks and it hasn't crashed.
[02:49:19.100 --> 02:49:19.940]   Will it be hacked?
[02:49:19.940 --> 02:49:22.360]   Hasn't been hacked, but you know, it's a Lindy thing, right?
[02:49:22.360 --> 02:49:24.840]   You wait 13 years to see if it'll be hacked.
[02:49:24.840 --> 02:49:27.860]   But on the other hand, with a billion dollars,
[02:49:27.860 --> 02:49:30.340]   it's not as interesting a target as it is with a hundred
[02:49:30.340 --> 02:49:33.620]   billion and when it gets to be worth a trillion,
[02:49:33.620 --> 02:49:34.700]   then it's a bigger target.
[02:49:34.700 --> 02:49:39.700]   So, the risk has been bleeding off over time
[02:49:39.700 --> 02:49:43.380]   as the network monetized.
[02:49:43.380 --> 02:49:46.700]   I think the second question is, will it be banned?
[02:49:46.700 --> 02:49:47.540]   You couldn't know.
[02:49:47.540 --> 02:49:49.660]   It literally could have been banned at any time,
[02:49:49.660 --> 02:49:51.420]   many times early on.
[02:49:51.420 --> 02:49:53.660]   In fact, in 2013, I tweeted on that subject.
[02:49:53.660 --> 02:49:55.740]   I thought it would be banned.
[02:49:55.740 --> 02:49:57.420]   I made a very infamous tweet.
[02:49:57.420 --> 02:49:58.260]   - Infamous tweet, yeah.
[02:49:58.260 --> 02:50:00.220]   - I thought it was gonna be banned.
[02:50:00.220 --> 02:50:04.420]   In 2014, the IRS designated it as property
[02:50:04.420 --> 02:50:06.460]   and gave it property tax treatment, okay?
[02:50:06.460 --> 02:50:09.740]   So, they could have given it a tax treatment
[02:50:09.740 --> 02:50:13.940]   where you had to pay tax on the unrealized capital gains
[02:50:13.940 --> 02:50:17.340]   every year and it probably would have crushed it to death.
[02:50:17.340 --> 02:50:18.180]   Right?
[02:50:18.180 --> 02:50:23.180]   You know, so it could have been in any number of places,
[02:50:23.180 --> 02:50:25.220]   banned by a government,
[02:50:25.220 --> 02:50:28.460]   but in fact it was legitimized as property.
[02:50:28.460 --> 02:50:30.100]   And then the question is, would it be hacked
[02:50:30.100 --> 02:50:31.020]   or would it be copied?
[02:50:31.020 --> 02:50:32.260]   Will it be something better than that?
[02:50:32.260 --> 02:50:34.780]   And it was copied 15,000 times.
[02:50:34.780 --> 02:50:36.620]   And you know the story of all those.
[02:50:36.620 --> 02:50:41.180]   And they either diverged to be something totally different
[02:50:41.180 --> 02:50:42.380]   and not comparable,
[02:50:42.380 --> 02:50:46.980]   or someone trying to copy a non-sovereign bearer instrument
[02:50:46.980 --> 02:50:50.260]   store of value found that their networks crashed
[02:50:50.260 --> 02:50:52.020]   to be 1% of what Bitcoin is.
[02:50:52.020 --> 02:50:55.980]   So, now we're sitting at a point
[02:50:55.980 --> 02:50:59.180]   where all those risks are out of the way.
[02:50:59.180 --> 02:51:02.660]   I would say that year one of institutional adoption
[02:51:02.660 --> 02:51:05.860]   is it started August, 2020.
[02:51:05.860 --> 02:51:08.860]   That's when MicroStrategy bought $250 million worth
[02:51:08.860 --> 02:51:11.140]   of Bitcoin and we put that on the wire.
[02:51:11.140 --> 02:51:12.980]   We were the first publicly traded company
[02:51:12.980 --> 02:51:15.780]   to actually buy Bitcoin.
[02:51:15.780 --> 02:51:17.940]   I don't think you could have found a $5 million purchase
[02:51:17.940 --> 02:51:20.540]   from a public company before we did that.
[02:51:20.540 --> 02:51:23.740]   So, that was kind of like a gun going off.
[02:51:23.740 --> 02:51:26.460]   And then in the next 12 months,
[02:51:26.460 --> 02:51:30.060]   Tesla bought Bitcoin, Square bought Bitcoin.
[02:51:30.060 --> 02:51:33.580]   And I'd say now we're in year two of institutional adoption.
[02:51:33.580 --> 02:51:35.580]   And there are about 24,
[02:51:35.580 --> 02:51:38.100]   should be 24 publicly traded Bitcoin miners
[02:51:38.100 --> 02:51:39.860]   by the end of this quarter.
[02:51:39.860 --> 02:51:43.460]   So, you're looking at 36 publicly traded companies
[02:51:43.460 --> 02:51:46.460]   and you've got 50,
[02:51:46.460 --> 02:51:51.580]   at least in the range of $50 billion on the balance,
[02:51:51.580 --> 02:51:52.980]   of Bitcoin on the balance sheet
[02:51:52.980 --> 02:51:54.980]   of publicly traded companies,
[02:51:54.980 --> 02:51:59.340]   and hundreds of billions of dollars of market cap
[02:51:59.340 --> 02:52:01.620]   of Bitcoin exposed companies.
[02:52:01.620 --> 02:52:04.540]   So, I would say the asset,
[02:52:04.540 --> 02:52:09.300]   decade one was entrepreneurial, experimental.
[02:52:09.300 --> 02:52:15.260]   Decade two is a rotation from entrepreneurs to institutions
[02:52:15.260 --> 02:52:16.980]   and it's becoming institutionalized.
[02:52:16.980 --> 02:52:19.420]   So, maybe decade one, you go from zero to a trillion
[02:52:19.420 --> 02:52:22.740]   and decade two, you go from one trillion to a hundred trillion.
[02:52:22.740 --> 02:52:24.500]   What about governments?
[02:52:24.500 --> 02:52:27.300]   Government adoption, institutional adoption.
[02:52:27.300 --> 02:52:29.300]   Is government's important in this?
[02:52:29.300 --> 02:52:32.980]   Maybe making it some governments incorporating it
[02:52:32.980 --> 02:52:36.660]   into as a currency, into their banks,
[02:52:36.660 --> 02:52:38.060]   all that kind of stuff.
[02:52:38.060 --> 02:52:39.180]   Is that important?
[02:52:39.180 --> 02:52:42.860]   And if it is, when will it happen?
[02:52:42.860 --> 02:52:45.900]   It's not essential for the success of the asset class,
[02:52:45.900 --> 02:52:50.900]   but I think it's inevitable in various degrees over time.
[02:52:50.980 --> 02:52:53.700]   But the most likely thing to happen next
[02:52:53.700 --> 02:52:58.700]   is large acquisitions by institutional investors
[02:52:58.700 --> 02:53:03.660]   of Bitcoin as a digital gold,
[02:53:03.660 --> 02:53:06.980]   where they're just swapping out gold for digital gold
[02:53:06.980 --> 02:53:08.700]   and thinking of it like that.
[02:53:08.700 --> 02:53:11.220]   And the government entities most likely to be involved with
[02:53:11.220 --> 02:53:13.220]   that would be sovereign wealth funds.
[02:53:13.220 --> 02:53:14.940]   If you look at all the sovereign wealth funds
[02:53:14.940 --> 02:53:17.340]   that are holding a big tech stock,
[02:53:17.340 --> 02:53:19.980]   equities, the Swiss, the Norwegians,
[02:53:19.980 --> 02:53:23.700]   the Middle Easterners, if you can hold big tech,
[02:53:23.700 --> 02:53:26.700]   then holding digital gold would be,
[02:53:26.700 --> 02:53:29.180]   not far removed from that.
[02:53:29.180 --> 02:53:32.720]   That's a non-controversial adoption.
[02:53:32.720 --> 02:53:36.540]   I think there are opportunities for governments
[02:53:36.540 --> 02:53:39.300]   that are much more profound, right?
[02:53:39.300 --> 02:53:43.620]   If a government started to adopt Bitcoin
[02:53:43.620 --> 02:53:45.780]   as a treasury reserve asset,
[02:53:46.660 --> 02:53:50.260]   that's much bigger than just an asset investment.
[02:53:50.260 --> 02:53:51.700]   That's 100X bigger.
[02:53:51.700 --> 02:53:56.660]   And you could imagine that's like a trillion dollar
[02:53:56.660 --> 02:53:59.340]   opportunity, like any government that wanted to adopt it
[02:53:59.340 --> 02:54:01.140]   as a treasury reserve asset
[02:54:01.140 --> 02:54:03.980]   would probably generate trillions of dollars,
[02:54:03.980 --> 02:54:06.380]   a trillion or more of value.
[02:54:06.380 --> 02:54:09.860]   And then the thing that people think about is,
[02:54:09.860 --> 02:54:13.420]   well, will oil ever be priced in Bitcoin
[02:54:13.420 --> 02:54:16.260]   or any other export commodity?
[02:54:16.260 --> 02:54:18.420]   I think there's like $1.8 trillion
[02:54:18.420 --> 02:54:21.980]   or more of export commodities in the world.
[02:54:21.980 --> 02:54:23.940]   And right now they're all priced in dollars.
[02:54:23.940 --> 02:54:26.020]   I think that this is a colorful thing,
[02:54:26.020 --> 02:54:28.060]   but it's not really that relevant.
[02:54:28.060 --> 02:54:31.020]   Like you could sell all that stuff in dollars.
[02:54:31.020 --> 02:54:33.900]   The relevant decision that any institution makes,
[02:54:33.900 --> 02:54:36.700]   whether they're a nonprofit, a university,
[02:54:36.700 --> 02:54:38.660]   a corporation, or a government,
[02:54:38.660 --> 02:54:41.340]   is what's your treasury reserve asset?
[02:54:41.340 --> 02:54:44.380]   And if your treasury reserve asset is the peso,
[02:54:44.380 --> 02:54:49.380]   and if the peso's losing 20% or 30% of its value a year,
[02:54:49.380 --> 02:54:55.460]   then your balance sheet is collapsing within five years.
[02:54:55.460 --> 02:55:01.100]   And if the treasury reserve asset is dollars
[02:55:01.100 --> 02:55:05.340]   and currency derivatives and US treasuries,
[02:55:05.340 --> 02:55:07.780]   then you're getting your seven,
[02:55:07.780 --> 02:55:12.780]   right now it's probably 15% or more monetary inflation.
[02:55:13.180 --> 02:55:15.700]   We're running double the historic average.
[02:55:15.700 --> 02:55:16.660]   You could argue triple,
[02:55:16.660 --> 02:55:17.940]   somewhere between double and triple,
[02:55:17.940 --> 02:55:21.460]   depending upon what your metric is.
[02:55:21.460 --> 02:55:23.340]   So, do I think it'll happen?
[02:55:23.340 --> 02:55:24.780]   I think that they're conservative,
[02:55:24.780 --> 02:55:25.940]   but they have to be shocked.
[02:55:25.940 --> 02:55:27.500]   And I think there is a shock.
[02:55:27.500 --> 02:55:32.900]   The late Russian sanctions are a big shock.
[02:55:32.900 --> 02:55:36.060]   When the West sees $300 billion worth of Russian gold
[02:55:36.060 --> 02:55:38.060]   and currency derivatives, I think,
[02:55:38.060 --> 02:55:40.740]   you got the famous quote by Putin,
[02:55:41.820 --> 02:55:45.580]   we have to rethink our treasury strategies.
[02:55:45.580 --> 02:55:48.700]   And that pushes everybody toward a commodity strategy.
[02:55:48.700 --> 02:55:50.780]   What commodities do I want to hold?
[02:55:50.780 --> 02:55:53.220]   I think that's got a lot of people thinking.
[02:55:53.220 --> 02:55:55.020]   I think it's got the Chinese thinking.
[02:55:55.020 --> 02:55:57.500]   Everybody wants to be the reserve currency, right?
[02:55:57.500 --> 02:56:01.660]   So, if I buy $50 billion worth of dollars every year,
[02:56:01.660 --> 02:56:06.660]   then I buy 500 billion over a decade,
[02:56:07.460 --> 02:56:12.460]   and I probably pay $250 billion of inflation cost
[02:56:12.460 --> 02:56:18.660]   on the backs of my citizens in a decade.
[02:56:18.660 --> 02:56:20.020]   So-
[02:56:20.020 --> 02:56:23.180]   - So, inflation could be one of the sources of shock.
[02:56:23.180 --> 02:56:27.260]   And you wonder if there is a switch to Bitcoin,
[02:56:27.260 --> 02:56:29.780]   whether it will be a bang or a whimper,
[02:56:29.780 --> 02:56:32.660]   like what is the nature of the shock or the transition?
[02:56:32.660 --> 02:56:37.660]   - I think that the year 2022 is pretty catalytic
[02:56:37.660 --> 02:56:40.140]   for digital assets in general,
[02:56:40.140 --> 02:56:42.300]   and for Bitcoin in particular.
[02:56:42.300 --> 02:56:44.900]   The Canadian trucker crisis,
[02:56:44.900 --> 02:56:47.260]   I think educated hundreds of millions of people
[02:56:47.260 --> 02:56:51.980]   and made them start questioning their property rights
[02:56:51.980 --> 02:56:53.300]   and their banks.
[02:56:53.300 --> 02:56:58.300]   I think the Ukraine war was a second shock,
[02:56:59.540 --> 02:57:03.220]   but I think that the Russian sanctions was a third shock.
[02:57:03.220 --> 02:57:05.300]   - Yeah.
[02:57:05.300 --> 02:57:06.260]   - I think all three of them,
[02:57:06.260 --> 02:57:09.740]   and I think hyperinflation in the rest of the world
[02:57:09.740 --> 02:57:10.820]   is a fourth shock,
[02:57:10.820 --> 02:57:13.880]   and then persistent inflation in the US is a fifth shock.
[02:57:13.880 --> 02:57:17.420]   So, I think it's a perfect storm.
[02:57:17.420 --> 02:57:20.740]   And if you put all these events together,
[02:57:20.740 --> 02:57:21.620]   what do they signify?
[02:57:21.620 --> 02:57:24.220]   They signify the rational conclusion
[02:57:24.220 --> 02:57:27.540]   for any person thinking about this is,
[02:57:27.540 --> 02:57:31.660]   I'm not sure if I can trust my property.
[02:57:31.660 --> 02:57:33.420]   I don't know if I have property rights.
[02:57:33.420 --> 02:57:35.620]   I don't know if I can trust the bank.
[02:57:35.620 --> 02:57:38.060]   And if I'm politically at odds
[02:57:38.060 --> 02:57:41.760]   with the leader of my own country,
[02:57:41.760 --> 02:57:43.220]   I'm gonna lose my property.
[02:57:43.220 --> 02:57:45.380]   And if I'm politically at odds
[02:57:45.380 --> 02:57:47.800]   with the owner of another country,
[02:57:47.800 --> 02:57:49.600]   I'm still gonna lose my property.
[02:57:49.600 --> 02:57:50.840]   (laughs)
[02:57:50.840 --> 02:57:53.060]   And when push comes to shove,
[02:57:53.060 --> 02:57:56.380]   the banks will freeze my assets and seize them.
[02:57:56.380 --> 02:58:00.060]   And I think that that is playing out
[02:58:00.060 --> 02:58:02.160]   in front of everybody in the world,
[02:58:02.160 --> 02:58:08.780]   such that your logical response would be,
[02:58:08.780 --> 02:58:14.960]   I'm going to convert my weak currency to a strong currency.
[02:58:14.960 --> 02:58:18.400]   Like I'll convert my peso and lira to the dollar.
[02:58:18.400 --> 02:58:22.900]   I'm going to convert my weak property to strong property.
[02:58:22.900 --> 02:58:27.160]   I'm gonna sell my building downtown Moscow.
[02:58:27.160 --> 02:58:30.620]   And I'd rather own a building in New York City.
[02:58:30.620 --> 02:58:33.780]   I'd rather own in a powerful nation
[02:58:33.780 --> 02:58:37.160]   than be stuck with a building in Nigeria
[02:58:37.160 --> 02:58:40.020]   or a building in Argentina or whatever.
[02:58:40.020 --> 02:58:41.700]   So I'm gonna sell my weak properties
[02:58:41.700 --> 02:58:43.280]   to buy strong properties.
[02:58:43.280 --> 02:58:47.100]   I'm gonna convert my physical assets to digital assets.
[02:58:47.100 --> 02:58:48.820]   I'd rather own a digital building
[02:58:48.820 --> 02:58:50.260]   than own a physical building.
[02:58:51.600 --> 02:58:54.560]   Because if I had a billion dollar building in Moscow,
[02:58:54.560 --> 02:58:56.240]   who can I rent that to?
[02:58:56.240 --> 02:58:58.440]   But if I have a billion dollar digital building,
[02:58:58.440 --> 02:59:01.880]   I can rent it to anybody in any city in the world,
[02:59:01.880 --> 02:59:02.840]   anybody with money.
[02:59:02.840 --> 02:59:06.340]   And the maintenance cost is almost nothing.
[02:59:06.340 --> 02:59:07.720]   And I can hold it for a hundred years.
[02:59:07.720 --> 02:59:09.860]   Okay, so it's an indestructible building.
[02:59:09.860 --> 02:59:14.280]   And then finally, I wanna move from having my assets
[02:59:14.280 --> 02:59:18.720]   in a bank with a counterparty to self custody assets.
[02:59:18.720 --> 02:59:21.800]   And this is not just Ukraine,
[02:59:21.800 --> 02:59:25.080]   but this is like the story in Turkey, Lebanon, Syria,
[02:59:25.080 --> 02:59:29.080]   Afghanistan, Iraq, South America.
[02:59:29.080 --> 02:59:31.320]   You don't really wanna be sitting with $10 million
[02:59:31.320 --> 02:59:33.960]   in a bank in Istanbul.
[02:59:33.960 --> 02:59:35.640]   The bank's gonna freeze your money,
[02:59:35.640 --> 02:59:39.280]   convert it to lira, devalue the lira,
[02:59:39.280 --> 02:59:42.560]   and then feed it back to you over 17 years.
[02:59:42.560 --> 02:59:46.560]   - So self custody assets would be layer one, Bitcoin?
[02:59:46.560 --> 02:59:49.320]   - Self custody assets, it's like,
[02:59:49.320 --> 02:59:51.880]   if I got my own hardware wallet,
[02:59:51.880 --> 02:59:53.120]   and I've either got,
[02:59:53.120 --> 02:59:58.520]   your highest form of self custody would be Bitcoin
[02:59:58.520 --> 02:59:59.920]   on your own hardware wallet,
[02:59:59.920 --> 03:00:02.240]   or Bitcoin in your own self custody.
[03:00:02.240 --> 03:00:04.720]   And the other thing people think about is,
[03:00:04.720 --> 03:00:07.920]   how do I get crypto dollars, like Tether,
[03:00:07.920 --> 03:00:10.260]   like some stable coin?
[03:00:10.260 --> 03:00:12.200]   Like I'd rather, if you had a choice,
[03:00:12.200 --> 03:00:14.360]   would you rather have your money in a bank,
[03:00:14.360 --> 03:00:16.120]   in a war zone, in dollars,
[03:00:16.120 --> 03:00:19.120]   or have your money in a stable coin
[03:00:19.120 --> 03:00:22.220]   on your mobile phone in dollars?
[03:00:22.220 --> 03:00:25.480]   Right, I mean, you take the latter risk
[03:00:25.480 --> 03:00:26.800]   rather than the former risk.
[03:00:26.800 --> 03:00:28.680]   - In a war zone, definitely, yeah.
[03:00:28.680 --> 03:00:30.040]   - And you can see that happening.
[03:00:30.040 --> 03:00:32.240]   Like we've gone from 5 billion in stable coins
[03:00:32.240 --> 03:00:36.520]   to 200 billion in the last 24 months.
[03:00:36.520 --> 03:00:41.520]   So I do think there's massive demand for crypto dollars
[03:00:41.520 --> 03:00:44.240]   in the form of a US dollar asset,
[03:00:44.240 --> 03:00:49.240]   and everybody in the world would say, yeah, I want that.
[03:00:49.240 --> 03:00:52.840]   Well, unless you're just an extreme patriot,
[03:00:52.840 --> 03:00:54.680]   but most people in the world would say, I want that.
[03:00:54.680 --> 03:00:56.960]   And then a lesser group of people would say,
[03:00:56.960 --> 03:00:59.360]   I think I want to be able to carry my property
[03:00:59.360 --> 03:01:04.360]   in the palm of my hand, so I have self custody of it.
[03:01:04.360 --> 03:01:08.480]   - So the Bitcoin price has gone through quite a rollercoaster.
[03:01:08.480 --> 03:01:11.040]   What do you think is the high point it's gonna hit?
[03:01:11.040 --> 03:01:13.760]   - I think it'll go forever, right?
[03:01:13.760 --> 03:01:18.760]   I mean, I think the Bitcoin is going to climb
[03:01:18.760 --> 03:01:20.240]   in a serpentine fashion.
[03:01:20.240 --> 03:01:22.880]   It's going to advance and come back,
[03:01:22.880 --> 03:01:26.720]   and it's gonna keep climbing.
[03:01:26.720 --> 03:01:30.120]   I think that the volatility attracts all the capital
[03:01:30.120 --> 03:01:33.480]   into the marketplace, and so the volatility
[03:01:33.480 --> 03:01:35.160]   makes it the most interesting thing
[03:01:35.160 --> 03:01:36.600]   in the financial universe.
[03:01:36.600 --> 03:01:38.920]   It also generates massive yield
[03:01:38.920 --> 03:01:41.360]   and massive returns for traders,
[03:01:42.200 --> 03:01:44.000]   and that attracts capital.
[03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:45.360]   Like we're talking about the difference
[03:01:45.360 --> 03:01:49.240]   between 5% return and 500% return.
[03:01:49.240 --> 03:01:54.160]   So the fast money is attracted by the volatility.
[03:01:54.160 --> 03:01:58.600]   The volatility has been decreasing year by year by year.
[03:01:58.600 --> 03:02:02.480]   I think that it's stabilizing.
[03:02:02.480 --> 03:02:04.200]   I don't think we'll see as much volatility
[03:02:04.200 --> 03:02:06.800]   in the future as we have in the past.
[03:02:06.800 --> 03:02:11.320]   I think that if we look at Bitcoin and model it
[03:02:11.320 --> 03:02:15.880]   as digital gold, the market cap goes
[03:02:15.880 --> 03:02:18.360]   to between 10 and 20 trillion,
[03:02:18.360 --> 03:02:23.160]   but remember, gold is defective property.
[03:02:23.160 --> 03:02:24.880]   Gold is dead money.
[03:02:24.880 --> 03:02:26.240]   You have a billion dollars of gold
[03:02:26.240 --> 03:02:27.800]   that sits in a vault for a decade.
[03:02:27.800 --> 03:02:29.800]   It's very hard to mortgage the gold.
[03:02:29.800 --> 03:02:32.040]   It's also very hard to rent the gold.
[03:02:32.040 --> 03:02:33.200]   You can't loan the gold.
[03:02:33.200 --> 03:02:36.560]   No one's going to create a business with your gold.
[03:02:36.560 --> 03:02:39.440]   So gold, it doesn't generate much of a yield,
[03:02:39.440 --> 03:02:41.560]   so for that reason, most people wouldn't store
[03:02:41.560 --> 03:02:43.360]   a billion dollars for a decade in gold.
[03:02:43.360 --> 03:02:44.520]   They would buy a billion dollars
[03:02:44.520 --> 03:02:47.360]   of commercial real estate property,
[03:02:47.360 --> 03:02:49.960]   and the reason why is because I can rent it
[03:02:49.960 --> 03:02:52.680]   and generate a yield on it that's in excess
[03:02:52.680 --> 03:02:54.000]   of the maintenance cost.
[03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:56.720]   So if you consider digital property,
[03:02:56.720 --> 03:03:01.720]   that's 100 to $200 trillion addressable market.
[03:03:01.720 --> 03:03:06.440]   So I would think it goes from 10 trillion to 100 trillion
[03:03:06.440 --> 03:03:08.480]   as people start to think of it as digital property.
[03:03:08.480 --> 03:03:11.920]   - What does that mean in terms of price per coin?
[03:03:11.920 --> 03:03:16.920]   - At 500,000, right, that's a $10 trillion asset.
[03:03:16.920 --> 03:03:21.040]   At five million, that's $100 trillion asset.
[03:03:21.040 --> 03:03:24.440]   - So you think it crosses a million, it can go even higher?
[03:03:24.440 --> 03:03:26.320]   - Yeah, I think it keeps going up forever.
[03:03:26.320 --> 03:03:27.160]   I mean, there's no reason we're going to go
[03:03:27.160 --> 03:03:29.040]   to 10 million a coin, right?
[03:03:29.040 --> 03:03:32.560]   Because digital property isn't the highest form, right?
[03:03:32.560 --> 03:03:35.440]   Gold was that low-frequency money.
[03:03:35.440 --> 03:03:37.920]   Property is a mid-frequency money,
[03:03:37.920 --> 03:03:42.920]   but when I start to program it faster,
[03:03:42.920 --> 03:03:46.160]   it starts to look like digital energy,
[03:03:46.160 --> 03:03:50.640]   and then it doesn't just replace property,
[03:03:50.640 --> 03:03:53.800]   then you're starting to replace bonds.
[03:03:53.800 --> 03:03:55.360]   It's 100 trillion in bonds,
[03:03:55.360 --> 03:04:00.040]   there's 50 to 100 trillion in other currency derivatives.
[03:04:00.040 --> 03:04:03.800]   And these are all conventional use cases, right?
[03:04:03.800 --> 03:04:08.800]   I think that there's 350 trillion to $500 trillion
[03:04:08.800 --> 03:04:14.120]   worth of currency derivatives in the world.
[03:04:14.120 --> 03:04:17.760]   And when I say that, I mean things that are valued
[03:04:17.760 --> 03:04:20.120]   based upon fiat cash flows.
[03:04:20.120 --> 03:04:23.640]   Any commercial real estate, any bond, any sovereign debt,
[03:04:23.640 --> 03:04:28.600]   any currency itself, any derivatives to those things,
[03:04:28.600 --> 03:04:32.560]   they're all derivatives, and they're all defective,
[03:04:32.560 --> 03:04:35.040]   and they're all defective because of this persistent
[03:04:35.040 --> 03:04:40.040]   seven to 14% lapse, which we call inflation,
[03:04:40.040 --> 03:04:41.920]   or monetary expansion.
[03:04:41.920 --> 03:04:44.280]   Can we switch, so I'm just gonna talk about
[03:04:44.280 --> 03:04:48.480]   the energy side of it, like the innovative piece.
[03:04:48.480 --> 03:04:52.280]   Let's just start with this idea that I've got a hotel
[03:04:52.280 --> 03:04:55.040]   worth a billion dollars with a thousand rooms.
[03:04:55.040 --> 03:04:58.160]   When it becomes a dematerialized hotel--
[03:04:58.160 --> 03:04:59.800]   - I love that word so much, by the way,
[03:04:59.800 --> 03:05:01.040]   dematerialized hotel.
[03:05:01.040 --> 03:05:02.480]   - We're crossing the fountain below here.
[03:05:02.480 --> 03:05:05.400]   Imagine the fountain below is dematerialized.
[03:05:05.400 --> 03:05:07.440]   The problem with a physical hotel is I gotta hire
[03:05:07.440 --> 03:05:10.680]   real people moving subject to the speed of sound
[03:05:10.680 --> 03:05:13.440]   and physics laws and Newton's laws,
[03:05:13.440 --> 03:05:15.720]   and I can rent it to people in Miami Beach.
[03:05:15.720 --> 03:05:19.640]   But if it was a digital hotel, I could rent the room
[03:05:19.640 --> 03:05:23.360]   to people in Paris, London, and New York every night,
[03:05:23.360 --> 03:05:26.600]   and I can run it with robots, and as soon as I do that,
[03:05:26.600 --> 03:05:28.520]   I can rent it by the room hour,
[03:05:28.520 --> 03:05:30.400]   and I can rent it by the room minute.
[03:05:30.400 --> 03:05:35.400]   And so I start to chop my hotel up into 100,000 room hours
[03:05:35.400 --> 03:05:41.000]   that I sell to the highest bidder anywhere in the world,
[03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:44.160]   and you can see all of a sudden the yield,
[03:05:44.160 --> 03:05:48.040]   the rent and the income of the property
[03:05:48.040 --> 03:05:50.920]   is dramatically increased.
[03:05:50.920 --> 03:05:54.800]   I can also see the maintenance cost of the property falls.
[03:05:54.800 --> 03:05:58.640]   I get on Moore's Law, and I'm operating in cyberspace,
[03:05:58.640 --> 03:06:00.520]   so I got rid of Newton's laws.
[03:06:00.520 --> 03:06:04.000]   I got rid of all the friction and all those problems.
[03:06:04.000 --> 03:06:07.840]   I tapped into the benefits of cyberspace.
[03:06:07.840 --> 03:06:10.560]   I created a global property.
[03:06:10.560 --> 03:06:14.040]   I started monetizing at different frequencies,
[03:06:14.040 --> 03:06:15.920]   and of course, now I can mortgage it
[03:06:15.920 --> 03:06:18.440]   to anybody in the world, right?
[03:06:18.440 --> 03:06:20.640]   I mean, you're not gonna be able to get a mortgage
[03:06:20.640 --> 03:06:24.320]   on a Turkish building from someone in South Africa.
[03:06:24.320 --> 03:06:26.360]   You have to find someone that's local
[03:06:26.360 --> 03:06:29.400]   to the culture you're in.
[03:06:29.400 --> 03:06:33.320]   So when you start to move from analog property
[03:06:33.320 --> 03:06:36.400]   to digital property, it's not just a little bit better.
[03:06:36.400 --> 03:06:37.840]   It's a lot better.
[03:06:37.840 --> 03:06:42.160]   And what I just described, Lex, is like the DeFi vision,
[03:06:42.160 --> 03:06:45.640]   right, it's the beauty of DeFi, flash loans,
[03:06:45.640 --> 03:06:48.720]   money moving at high velocity.
[03:06:48.720 --> 03:06:53.720]   At some point, if the hotel is dematerialized,
[03:06:55.380 --> 03:06:59.060]   then what's the difference between renting a hotel room
[03:06:59.060 --> 03:07:02.280]   and loaning a block of stock, right?
[03:07:02.280 --> 03:07:05.160]   I'm just finding the highest, best use of the thing.
[03:07:05.160 --> 03:07:07.880]   - It feels like the magic really emerges, though,
[03:07:07.880 --> 03:07:11.800]   when you build a lot, a market of layer two
[03:07:11.800 --> 03:07:14.240]   and layer three technologies on top of that.
[03:07:14.240 --> 03:07:18.200]   It's like, maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong,
[03:07:18.200 --> 03:07:21.160]   but for all these hotels and all these kinds of ideas,
[03:07:21.160 --> 03:07:24.840]   it's always touching humans at some point.
[03:07:24.840 --> 03:07:29.840]   And the consumers or humans, business owners, and so on.
[03:07:29.840 --> 03:07:32.280]   So you have to create interface,
[03:07:32.280 --> 03:07:35.680]   you have to create services that make all of that
[03:07:35.680 --> 03:07:39.640]   super efficient, super fun to use, pleasant, effective,
[03:07:39.640 --> 03:07:41.000]   all those kinds of things.
[03:07:41.000 --> 03:07:43.440]   And so you have to build a whole economy on top of that.
[03:07:43.440 --> 03:07:45.880]   - Yeah, and I happen to think that won't be done
[03:07:45.880 --> 03:07:47.340]   by the crypto industry at all.
[03:07:47.340 --> 03:07:51.120]   I think that'll be done by centralized applications.
[03:07:51.120 --> 03:07:54.120]   I think it'll be the citadels of the world,
[03:07:54.120 --> 03:07:57.680]   the high speed traders of the world, the New Yorkers.
[03:07:57.680 --> 03:08:02.160]   I think it'll be Binance, FTX, and Coinbase
[03:08:02.160 --> 03:08:06.240]   as a layer three exchange that will give you the yield
[03:08:06.240 --> 03:08:10.560]   and will give you the loan and the best terms.
[03:08:10.560 --> 03:08:13.600]   Because ultimately you have to jump these compliance hoops.
[03:08:13.600 --> 03:08:17.240]   It comes, like BlockFi can give you yield,
[03:08:17.240 --> 03:08:19.580]   but they have to do it in a compliant way
[03:08:19.580 --> 03:08:22.040]   with the United States jurisdiction.
[03:08:22.040 --> 03:08:25.080]   So ultimately those applications to use
[03:08:25.080 --> 03:08:29.960]   that digital property and either generate a loan,
[03:08:29.960 --> 03:08:32.040]   give you a loan on it or give you yield on it
[03:08:32.040 --> 03:08:33.880]   are gonna come from companies.
[03:08:33.880 --> 03:08:37.400]   But the difference, the fundamental difference is
[03:08:37.400 --> 03:08:41.320]   it could be companies anywhere in the world.
[03:08:41.320 --> 03:08:44.420]   So if a company in Singapore comes up
[03:08:44.420 --> 03:08:47.520]   with a better offering, right,
[03:08:47.520 --> 03:08:50.160]   then the capital is gonna start to flow to Singapore.
[03:08:50.160 --> 03:08:54.880]   I can't send 10 city blocks of LA to Singapore
[03:08:54.880 --> 03:08:57.580]   to rent during a festival,
[03:08:57.580 --> 03:09:01.800]   but I can send 10 blocks of Bitcoin to Singapore.
[03:09:01.800 --> 03:09:05.200]   So you've got a truly global market that's functioning
[03:09:05.200 --> 03:09:08.440]   and this asset, and it's their second order asset.
[03:09:08.440 --> 03:09:11.080]   For example, maybe you're an American citizen
[03:09:11.080 --> 03:09:13.800]   and you own 10 Bitcoin and someone in Singapore
[03:09:13.800 --> 03:09:16.500]   will generate 27% yield in the Bitcoin,
[03:09:16.500 --> 03:09:19.280]   but legally you can't send the money to them
[03:09:19.280 --> 03:09:20.680]   or the Bitcoin to them.
[03:09:20.680 --> 03:09:23.320]   It doesn't matter because the fact that that exists
[03:09:23.320 --> 03:09:27.680]   means that someone in Hong Kong will borrow the 10 Bitcoin
[03:09:27.680 --> 03:09:29.380]   from somebody in New York,
[03:09:29.380 --> 03:09:32.560]   and then they will put on the trade in Singapore
[03:09:32.560 --> 03:09:34.800]   and that will create a demand for Bitcoin
[03:09:34.800 --> 03:09:36.560]   which will drive up the price of Bitcoin,
[03:09:36.560 --> 03:09:40.280]   which will result in an effective tax-free yield
[03:09:40.280 --> 03:09:41.760]   for the person in the US
[03:09:41.760 --> 03:09:43.920]   that's not even in the jurisdiction.
[03:09:43.920 --> 03:09:46.760]   So there's nothing that's going on in Singapore
[03:09:46.760 --> 03:09:50.320]   to drive up the price of your land in LA,
[03:09:50.320 --> 03:09:53.520]   but there is something going on everywhere in the world
[03:09:53.520 --> 03:09:56.580]   to drive up the price of property and cyberspace
[03:09:56.580 --> 03:09:59.460]   if there's only one digital Manhattan.
[03:09:59.460 --> 03:10:02.600]   And so there's a dynamic there
[03:10:02.600 --> 03:10:04.780]   which is profound because it's global.
[03:10:04.780 --> 03:10:07.520]   But now let's go to the next extreme.
[03:10:07.520 --> 03:10:11.140]   I'm still giving you a fairly conventional idea,
[03:10:11.140 --> 03:10:15.600]   which is let's just loan the money fast on a global network
[03:10:15.600 --> 03:10:19.600]   and let's just rent the hotel room fast in cyberspace.
[03:10:19.600 --> 03:10:24.560]   But let's move to maybe a more innovative idea.
[03:10:24.560 --> 03:10:27.600]   The first generation of internet
[03:10:27.600 --> 03:10:28.820]   brought a lot of productivity,
[03:10:28.820 --> 03:10:32.060]   but there's also just a lot of flaws in it.
[03:10:32.060 --> 03:10:34.720]   For example, Twitter is full of garbage.
[03:10:34.720 --> 03:10:37.240]   Instagram DMs are full of garbage.
[03:10:37.240 --> 03:10:39.680]   Your Twitter DMs are full of garbage.
[03:10:39.680 --> 03:10:42.000]   YouTube is full of scams.
[03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:43.080]   Every 15 minutes,
[03:10:43.080 --> 03:10:44.800]   there's a Michael Saylor Bitcoin giveaway
[03:10:44.800 --> 03:10:46.760]   spun up on YouTube.
[03:10:46.760 --> 03:10:50.800]   My Office 365 inbox is full of garbage,
[03:10:50.800 --> 03:10:52.720]   millions of spam messages.
[03:10:52.720 --> 03:10:55.900]   I'm running four different email filters.
[03:10:55.900 --> 03:10:58.760]   My company spends million dollars a year
[03:10:58.760 --> 03:11:00.440]   to fight denial of service attacks
[03:11:00.440 --> 03:11:03.200]   and all sorts of other security things.
[03:11:03.200 --> 03:11:05.880]   There are denial of service attacks everywhere
[03:11:05.880 --> 03:11:09.280]   against everybody in cyberspace all the time.
[03:11:09.280 --> 03:11:10.240]   It's extreme.
[03:11:10.240 --> 03:11:12.560]   And we're all beset with hostility, right?
[03:11:12.560 --> 03:11:14.720]   You've been a victim of it in Twitter.
[03:11:14.720 --> 03:11:18.720]   You go on Twitter and people post stuff
[03:11:18.720 --> 03:11:20.280]   they would never say to your face.
[03:11:20.280 --> 03:11:21.120]   And then if you look,
[03:11:21.120 --> 03:11:24.080]   you find out that the account was created like three days
[03:11:24.080 --> 03:11:27.520]   ago and it's not even a real person.
[03:11:27.520 --> 03:11:31.380]   So, we're beset with phishing attacks and scams
[03:11:31.380 --> 03:11:33.680]   and spam bots and garbage.
[03:11:33.680 --> 03:11:35.360]   And why?
[03:11:35.360 --> 03:11:37.400]   And the answer is because the first generation
[03:11:37.400 --> 03:11:40.900]   of internet was digital information and there's no energy.
[03:11:40.900 --> 03:11:44.440]   There's no conservation of energy in cyberspace.
[03:11:44.440 --> 03:11:46.720]   The thing that makes the universe work
[03:11:46.720 --> 03:11:48.640]   is conservation of energy.
[03:11:48.640 --> 03:11:52.640]   Like if I went to a hotel room,
[03:11:52.640 --> 03:11:54.200]   I'd have to post a credit card.
[03:11:54.200 --> 03:11:56.400]   And then if I smash the place up,
[03:11:56.400 --> 03:11:59.900]   there'd be economic consequences,
[03:11:59.900 --> 03:12:02.620]   maybe there'd be criminal consequences.
[03:12:02.620 --> 03:12:05.680]   There might be reputational consequences.
[03:12:05.680 --> 03:12:07.800]   You know, a lamp might fall on me.
[03:12:07.800 --> 03:12:08.880]   But in the worst case scenario,
[03:12:08.880 --> 03:12:10.840]   I can only smash up one hotel room.
[03:12:10.840 --> 03:12:15.000]   Now imagine I could actually write a Python script
[03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:17.920]   to send myself to every hotel room in the world
[03:12:17.920 --> 03:12:20.800]   every minute, not post a credit card
[03:12:20.800 --> 03:12:23.880]   and smash them all up anonymously.
[03:12:23.880 --> 03:12:28.840]   The thing that makes the universe work is friction,
[03:12:28.840 --> 03:12:31.440]   speed of sound, speed of light,
[03:12:31.440 --> 03:12:35.360]   and the fact that it's ultimately it's conservative.
[03:12:35.360 --> 03:12:37.000]   You're either energy or you're matter,
[03:12:37.000 --> 03:12:39.520]   but once you've used the energy, it's gone
[03:12:39.520 --> 03:12:42.800]   and you can't do infinite everything.
[03:12:42.800 --> 03:12:45.760]   That's missing in cyberspace right now.
[03:12:45.760 --> 03:12:49.760]   And if you look at all of the moral hazards
[03:12:49.760 --> 03:12:52.560]   and all of the product defects that we have
[03:12:52.560 --> 03:12:54.260]   in all of these products,
[03:12:54.260 --> 03:12:58.960]   most of them, 99% of them could be cured
[03:12:58.960 --> 03:13:03.960]   if we introduced conservation of energy into cyberspace.
[03:13:05.040 --> 03:13:08.920]   And that's what you can do with high-speed digital property,
[03:13:08.920 --> 03:13:09.920]   high-speed Bitcoin.
[03:13:09.920 --> 03:13:13.440]   And by high-speed, I mean, not 20 transactions a day.
[03:13:13.440 --> 03:13:15.380]   I mean, 20,000 transactions a day.
[03:13:15.380 --> 03:13:18.680]   So how do you do that?
[03:13:18.680 --> 03:13:23.680]   Well, I let everybody on Twitter post
[03:13:23.680 --> 03:13:27.520]   a thousand or 10,000 Satoshis via a lightning wallet,
[03:13:27.520 --> 03:13:29.200]   a lightning badge.
[03:13:29.200 --> 03:13:31.200]   Give me an orange check.
[03:13:31.200 --> 03:13:34.260]   If you put up 20 bucks once in your life,
[03:13:34.260 --> 03:13:37.280]   you could give 300 million people an orange check.
[03:13:37.280 --> 03:13:41.840]   Right now, you don't have a blue check, Lex.
[03:13:41.840 --> 03:13:42.960]   You're a famous person.
[03:13:42.960 --> 03:13:45.320]   I don't know why you don't have a blue check.
[03:13:45.320 --> 03:13:47.040]   Have you ever applied for a blue check?
[03:13:47.040 --> 03:13:47.880]   - No.
[03:13:47.880 --> 03:13:51.000]   - There are 360,000 people on Twitter with a blue check.
[03:13:51.000 --> 03:13:54.440]   There are 300 million people on Twitter.
[03:13:54.440 --> 03:13:58.440]   So the conventional way to verify accounts
[03:13:58.440 --> 03:14:02.440]   is elitist, archaic.
[03:14:02.440 --> 03:14:03.520]   - Yeah, how does it work?
[03:14:03.520 --> 03:14:04.600]   How do you get a blue check?
[03:14:04.600 --> 03:14:05.840]   I mean, what-- - You gotta apply
[03:14:05.840 --> 03:14:08.960]   and wait six months, and you have to post
[03:14:08.960 --> 03:14:12.640]   like three articles in the public mainstream media
[03:14:12.640 --> 03:14:15.120]   that illustrates you're a person of interest.
[03:14:15.120 --> 03:14:15.960]   - Interesting.
[03:14:15.960 --> 03:14:17.080]   - Generally, they would grant them
[03:14:17.080 --> 03:14:20.800]   to CEOs of public companies.
[03:14:20.800 --> 03:14:24.400]   The whole idea is to verify that you are--
[03:14:24.400 --> 03:14:25.240]   - Yeah, who you are.
[03:14:25.240 --> 03:14:26.080]   - Who you say you are.
[03:14:26.080 --> 03:14:26.900]   - Right.
[03:14:26.900 --> 03:14:28.600]   - But the question is, why isn't everybody verified?
[03:14:28.600 --> 03:14:29.440]   - Right.
[03:14:29.440 --> 03:14:31.400]   - And there's a couple of threads on that.
[03:14:31.400 --> 03:14:33.920]   One is some people don't wanna be doxed.
[03:14:33.920 --> 03:14:35.720]   They wanna be anonymous.
[03:14:35.720 --> 03:14:38.080]   But there are even anonymous people
[03:14:38.080 --> 03:14:39.800]   that should be verified.
[03:14:39.800 --> 03:14:40.760]   - Right.
[03:14:40.760 --> 03:14:44.200]   - Because otherwise, you're subjecting
[03:14:44.200 --> 03:14:46.460]   their entire following to phishing attacks
[03:14:46.460 --> 03:14:48.700]   and scams and hostility.
[03:14:48.700 --> 03:14:51.320]   But the other--
[03:14:51.320 --> 03:14:52.680]   - What's the orange verification?
[03:14:52.680 --> 03:14:55.400]   So this idea, can you actually elaborate
[03:14:55.400 --> 03:14:57.360]   a little bit more if you put up 20 bucks?
[03:14:57.360 --> 03:14:59.200]   - Yeah, I think everybody on Twitter
[03:14:59.200 --> 03:15:00.720]   ought to be able to get an orange check
[03:15:00.720 --> 03:15:02.760]   if they could come up with like $10.
[03:15:02.760 --> 03:15:05.760]   - And what is the power of that orange check?
[03:15:05.760 --> 03:15:08.280]   What does that verify exactly?
[03:15:08.280 --> 03:15:11.040]   - You basically post a security deposit
[03:15:11.040 --> 03:15:13.880]   for your safe passage through cyberspace.
[03:15:13.880 --> 03:15:15.720]   So the way it would work is,
[03:15:15.720 --> 03:15:19.120]   if you've got $10 once in your life,
[03:15:19.120 --> 03:15:22.320]   you can basically show that you're credit worthy.
[03:15:22.320 --> 03:15:24.560]   And that's your pledge to me
[03:15:24.560 --> 03:15:27.340]   that you're gonna act responsibly.
[03:15:27.340 --> 03:15:31.240]   So you put the 10 or the $20 into the lightning wallet,
[03:15:31.240 --> 03:15:33.320]   you get an orange check,
[03:15:33.320 --> 03:15:35.400]   then Twitter just gives you a setting
[03:15:35.400 --> 03:15:37.440]   where I can say, the only people that could DM me
[03:15:37.440 --> 03:15:38.640]   are orange checks, the only people
[03:15:38.640 --> 03:15:41.340]   that can post on my tweets are orange checks.
[03:15:41.340 --> 03:15:43.200]   So instead of locking out the public
[03:15:43.200 --> 03:15:46.480]   and just letting your followers comment,
[03:15:46.480 --> 03:15:49.520]   you lock out all the unverified.
[03:15:49.520 --> 03:15:51.200]   And that means people that don't wanna post
[03:15:51.200 --> 03:15:53.640]   $10 security deposit can't comment.
[03:15:53.640 --> 03:15:57.040]   Once you've done those two things,
[03:15:57.040 --> 03:16:01.400]   then you're in position to monetize malice,
[03:16:01.400 --> 03:16:03.760]   right, monetize motion or malice for that matter.
[03:16:03.760 --> 03:16:06.180]   But let's just say, for the sake of argument,
[03:16:06.180 --> 03:16:11.180]   you post something and 9,700 bots spin up,
[03:16:11.180 --> 03:16:14.400]   you know, and pitch their whatever scam.
[03:16:14.400 --> 03:16:17.060]   Right now you sit and you go,
[03:16:17.060 --> 03:16:20.380]   report, report, report, report, report, report.
[03:16:20.380 --> 03:16:23.440]   And if you spend an hour, you get through half of them,
[03:16:23.440 --> 03:16:25.520]   you waste an hour of your life,
[03:16:25.520 --> 03:16:27.760]   they just spin up another 97 kazillion
[03:16:27.760 --> 03:16:29.640]   because they've got a Python script spinning it up,
[03:16:29.640 --> 03:16:31.240]   so it's hopeless.
[03:16:31.240 --> 03:16:33.560]   But on the other hand, if you report them
[03:16:33.560 --> 03:16:36.920]   and they really are a bot, Twitter's got a method
[03:16:36.920 --> 03:16:39.520]   to actually delete the account,
[03:16:39.520 --> 03:16:41.260]   they know that they're bots.
[03:16:41.260 --> 03:16:43.520]   The problem is not, they don't know how to delete the account
[03:16:43.520 --> 03:16:45.240]   the problem is there are no consequences
[03:16:45.240 --> 03:16:46.860]   when they delete the account.
[03:16:46.860 --> 03:16:50.800]   So if there are consequences, Twitter could give,
[03:16:50.800 --> 03:16:53.680]   they could just seize the $10 or seize the $20
[03:16:53.680 --> 03:16:57.440]   'cause it's a bot, it's a malicious criminal act
[03:16:57.440 --> 03:17:00.440]   or whatever, it's a violation of the platform rules.
[03:17:00.440 --> 03:17:04.600]   You end up seizing $10,000, give half the money
[03:17:04.600 --> 03:17:08.040]   to the reporter and half the money to the Twitter platform.
[03:17:08.040 --> 03:17:10.800]   - That's a really powerful idea, but that's tying it,
[03:17:10.800 --> 03:17:14.200]   that's adding friction akin to the kind of friction
[03:17:14.200 --> 03:17:16.360]   you have in the physical world.
[03:17:16.360 --> 03:17:18.080]   You're tying, you have consequences,
[03:17:18.080 --> 03:17:19.360]   you have real consequences.
[03:17:19.360 --> 03:17:21.480]   - It's putting conservation of energy.
[03:17:21.480 --> 03:17:22.320]   - Conservation of energy.
[03:17:22.320 --> 03:17:25.600]   - There's no friction, there's no nothing on this earth.
[03:17:25.600 --> 03:17:28.600]   I mean, you can't walk across the room without friction.
[03:17:28.600 --> 03:17:34.680]   Friction is not bad, unnecessary friction is bad.
[03:17:34.680 --> 03:17:39.200]   So in this particular case,
[03:17:39.200 --> 03:17:42.200]   you're introducing conservation of energy
[03:17:42.200 --> 03:17:44.120]   and in essence, you're introducing the concept
[03:17:44.120 --> 03:17:48.360]   of consequence or truth into cyberspace.
[03:17:48.360 --> 03:17:51.240]   And that means if you do wanna spend up 10 million
[03:17:51.240 --> 03:17:55.400]   fake less Freedmans, right?
[03:17:55.400 --> 03:17:57.480]   It's gonna cost you $100 million
[03:17:57.480 --> 03:18:00.080]   to spend up 10 million fake Lexus.
[03:18:00.080 --> 03:18:01.960]   - But the thing is you could do that with the dollar,
[03:18:01.960 --> 03:18:06.960]   but your case, you're saying that it's more tied
[03:18:06.960 --> 03:18:10.320]   to physical reality when you do that with Bitcoin.
[03:18:10.320 --> 03:18:13.720]   - Yeah, well, let's follow up on that idea a bit more.
[03:18:13.720 --> 03:18:16.120]   If you did do it with the dollar,
[03:18:16.120 --> 03:18:19.000]   then the question is how does six billion people
[03:18:19.000 --> 03:18:20.640]   deposit the dollars?
[03:18:21.400 --> 03:18:23.520]   Right, because what you're doing is,
[03:18:23.520 --> 03:18:25.480]   could you do it with a credit card?
[03:18:25.480 --> 03:18:28.200]   Like how do you send dollars?
[03:18:28.200 --> 03:18:29.920]   You have to dock yourself.
[03:18:29.920 --> 03:18:31.680]   It's not easy.
[03:18:31.680 --> 03:18:35.280]   So you're talking about inputting a credit card transaction,
[03:18:35.280 --> 03:18:37.840]   doxing yourself and now you've just eliminated
[03:18:37.840 --> 03:18:40.080]   the 2 billion people that don't have credit cards
[03:18:40.080 --> 03:18:41.440]   or don't have banks.
[03:18:41.440 --> 03:18:42.880]   You've also got a problem with everybody
[03:18:42.880 --> 03:18:44.840]   that wants to remain anonymous,
[03:18:44.840 --> 03:18:46.960]   but you've also got this other problem,
[03:18:46.960 --> 03:18:51.960]   which is credit cards are expensive transactions,
[03:18:51.960 --> 03:18:55.720]   low frequency, slow settlement.
[03:18:55.720 --> 03:18:59.720]   So do you really wanna pay 2.5% every time
[03:18:59.720 --> 03:19:02.440]   you actually show a $20 deposit?
[03:19:02.440 --> 03:19:06.000]   And maybe you could do a Kluge version of this
[03:19:06.000 --> 03:19:09.000]   for a subset of people.
[03:19:09.000 --> 03:19:12.120]   It's like it's 10% as good if you did it
[03:19:12.120 --> 03:19:14.880]   with conventional payment rails.
[03:19:14.880 --> 03:19:19.600]   But what you can't do is the next idea,
[03:19:19.600 --> 03:19:23.720]   which is I want the orange badge to be used
[03:19:23.720 --> 03:19:26.200]   to give me safe passage through cyberspace,
[03:19:26.200 --> 03:19:28.720]   tripping across every platform.
[03:19:28.720 --> 03:19:33.080]   So how do I solve the denial of service attacks
[03:19:33.080 --> 03:19:34.040]   against a website?
[03:19:34.040 --> 03:19:38.760]   I publish a website, you hit it with a million requests.
[03:19:38.760 --> 03:19:42.560]   Okay, now how do I deal with that?
[03:19:42.560 --> 03:19:44.160]   Well, I can lock you out
[03:19:44.160 --> 03:19:46.440]   and I can make it a zero trust website.
[03:19:46.440 --> 03:19:48.480]   And then you have to be coming at me
[03:19:48.480 --> 03:19:51.600]   through a trusted firewall or with a trusted credential,
[03:19:51.600 --> 03:19:54.880]   but that's a pretty draconian thing.
[03:19:54.880 --> 03:19:58.560]   Or I could put it behind a lightning wall.
[03:19:58.560 --> 03:20:02.600]   A lightning wall would be, I just challenge you Lex,
[03:20:02.600 --> 03:20:04.920]   you wanna browse my website,
[03:20:04.920 --> 03:20:07.960]   you have to show me your 100,000 Satoshis.
[03:20:07.960 --> 03:20:10.480]   Do you have 100,000 Satoshis?
[03:20:10.480 --> 03:20:11.360]   Click.
[03:20:11.360 --> 03:20:15.680]   Okay, now you click away a hundred times or a thousand times
[03:20:15.680 --> 03:20:17.880]   and after a thousand times,
[03:20:17.880 --> 03:20:19.440]   well now Lex you're getting offensive
[03:20:19.440 --> 03:20:22.400]   I'm gonna take a Satoshi from you or 10 Satoshis,
[03:20:22.400 --> 03:20:23.640]   a micro transaction.
[03:20:23.640 --> 03:20:24.800]   You wanna hit me a million times?
[03:20:24.800 --> 03:20:27.240]   I'm taking all your Satoshis and locking you out.
[03:20:27.240 --> 03:20:31.160]   What you wanna do is you wanna go through
[03:20:31.160 --> 03:20:32.800]   200 websites a day.
[03:20:32.800 --> 03:20:38.280]   And what you want, every time you cross a domain,
[03:20:38.280 --> 03:20:40.560]   you need to be able to in a split second,
[03:20:41.520 --> 03:20:43.520]   prove that you've got some asset.
[03:20:43.520 --> 03:20:46.680]   And now when you cross back, when you exit domain,
[03:20:46.680 --> 03:20:48.720]   you wanna fetch your asset back.
[03:20:48.720 --> 03:20:51.600]   So how do I in a friction-free fashion,
[03:20:51.600 --> 03:20:55.320]   browse through dozens or hundreds of websites,
[03:20:55.320 --> 03:20:58.120]   post a security deposit for safe passage
[03:20:58.120 --> 03:21:00.040]   and then get it back?
[03:21:00.040 --> 03:21:03.160]   You couldn't afford to pay a credit card fee each time.
[03:21:03.160 --> 03:21:06.280]   When you think about two and a half percent
[03:21:06.280 --> 03:21:08.320]   as a transaction fee,
[03:21:08.320 --> 03:21:13.320]   it means you trade the money 40 times and it's gone.
[03:21:13.320 --> 03:21:14.440]   - Yeah.
[03:21:14.440 --> 03:21:15.280]   - It's gone.
[03:21:15.280 --> 03:21:16.120]   - Yeah.
[03:21:16.120 --> 03:21:17.360]   So you can't do this kind of hopping around
[03:21:17.360 --> 03:21:20.480]   through the internet with this kind of verification
[03:21:20.480 --> 03:21:23.160]   that grounds you to a physical reality.
[03:21:23.160 --> 03:21:24.520]   It's a really, really interesting idea.
[03:21:24.520 --> 03:21:26.520]   Why hasn't that been done?
[03:21:26.520 --> 03:21:30.160]   - I think you need two things.
[03:21:30.160 --> 03:21:33.720]   You need an idea like a digital asset like Bitcoin,
[03:21:33.720 --> 03:21:36.560]   that's a bearer instrument for final settlement.
[03:21:36.560 --> 03:21:39.600]   And then you need a high-speed transaction network
[03:21:39.600 --> 03:21:42.760]   like Lightning, where the transaction cost
[03:21:42.760 --> 03:21:46.640]   might be a 20th of a penny or less.
[03:21:46.640 --> 03:21:49.680]   And if you roll the clock back 24 months,
[03:21:49.680 --> 03:21:53.960]   I don't think you had the Lightning network
[03:21:53.960 --> 03:21:55.400]   in a stable point.
[03:21:55.400 --> 03:21:57.320]   It's really just the past 12 months.
[03:21:57.320 --> 03:22:01.120]   It's an idea you could think about this year.
[03:22:01.120 --> 03:22:06.120]   And I think you need to be aware of Bitcoin
[03:22:06.280 --> 03:22:09.280]   as something other than like a scary speculative asset.
[03:22:09.280 --> 03:22:12.160]   So I really think we're just the beginning.
[03:22:12.160 --> 03:22:14.080]   - The embryonic stage.
[03:22:14.080 --> 03:22:16.080]   I have to ask Michael Saylor,
[03:22:16.080 --> 03:22:19.080]   you said before there's no second best to Bitcoin.
[03:22:19.080 --> 03:22:22.000]   What would be the second best?
[03:22:22.000 --> 03:22:24.240]   Traditionally, there's Ethereum with smart contracts,
[03:22:24.240 --> 03:22:26.080]   Cardano with proof of stake,
[03:22:26.080 --> 03:22:31.080]   Polkadot with interoperability between blockchains,
[03:22:31.080 --> 03:22:34.680]   Dogecoin has the incredible power of the meme.
[03:22:35.680 --> 03:22:39.440]   Privacy with Monero, that just can keep going.
[03:22:39.440 --> 03:22:44.440]   There's of course, after the block size wars,
[03:22:44.440 --> 03:22:48.240]   the different offshoots of Bitcoin.
[03:22:48.240 --> 03:22:52.200]   - I think if you decompose or segment the crypto market,
[03:22:52.200 --> 03:22:54.560]   you've got crypto property.
[03:22:54.560 --> 03:22:56.360]   Bitcoin is the king of that.
[03:22:56.360 --> 03:22:57.880]   You know, another Bitcoin forks
[03:22:57.880 --> 03:23:02.560]   that wanted to be a bearer instrument, store of value,
[03:23:02.560 --> 03:23:05.760]   would be a property, a Bitcoin cash or light coin,
[03:23:05.760 --> 03:23:07.120]   something like that.
[03:23:07.120 --> 03:23:10.480]   Then you've got crypto currencies.
[03:23:10.480 --> 03:23:12.200]   I don't think Bitcoin's a currency
[03:23:12.200 --> 03:23:16.320]   because a currency I define in nation state sense,
[03:23:16.320 --> 03:23:20.080]   a currency is a digital asset that you can transfer
[03:23:20.080 --> 03:23:24.680]   in a transaction without incurring a taxable obligation.
[03:23:24.680 --> 03:23:27.440]   So that means it has to be a stable dollar
[03:23:27.440 --> 03:23:30.640]   or a stable Euro or a stable Yen, a stable coin.
[03:23:30.640 --> 03:23:32.200]   So I think about cryptocurrencies,
[03:23:32.200 --> 03:23:34.840]   Tether, Circle, most famous.
[03:23:34.840 --> 03:23:36.800]   Then I think you've got crypto platforms,
[03:23:36.800 --> 03:23:38.600]   you know, and Ethereum is the most famous
[03:23:38.600 --> 03:23:41.160]   of the crypto platforms, the platform upon which,
[03:23:41.160 --> 03:23:45.760]   you know, with smart contract functionality, et cetera.
[03:23:45.760 --> 03:23:47.840]   And then I think you've got just crypto securities.
[03:23:47.840 --> 03:23:51.600]   It's just like my favorite, whatever, meme coin.
[03:23:51.600 --> 03:23:52.880]   And I love it 'cause I love it.
[03:23:52.880 --> 03:23:54.880]   And it's attached to my game or my company
[03:23:54.880 --> 03:23:57.120]   or my persona or my whatever.
[03:23:57.120 --> 03:24:00.720]   I think if you, you know, push me and said,
[03:24:00.720 --> 03:24:01.800]   well, what's the second best?
[03:24:01.800 --> 03:24:04.120]   I would say the world wants two things.
[03:24:04.120 --> 03:24:06.920]   It wants crypto property as a savings account
[03:24:06.920 --> 03:24:10.080]   and it wants cryptocurrency as a checking account.
[03:24:10.080 --> 03:24:13.960]   And that means that the most popular thing really
[03:24:13.960 --> 03:24:17.360]   is going to be a stable coin dollar, right?
[03:24:17.360 --> 03:24:20.000]   And there's maybe a fight right now,
[03:24:20.000 --> 03:24:21.640]   it might be Tether, right?
[03:24:21.640 --> 03:24:26.640]   But a stable dollar, because I feel like the market,
[03:24:27.240 --> 03:24:29.600]   opportunity, it's not clear that there'll be one
[03:24:29.600 --> 03:24:30.480]   that will win.
[03:24:30.480 --> 03:24:32.760]   The class of stable dollars is probably
[03:24:32.760 --> 03:24:35.600]   a one to $10 trillion market easily.
[03:24:35.600 --> 03:24:39.320]   I think that in a crypto platform space,
[03:24:39.320 --> 03:24:41.200]   Ethereum will compete with Solana
[03:24:41.200 --> 03:24:44.520]   and Binance Smart Chain and the like.
[03:24:44.520 --> 03:24:46.560]   - Are there certain characteristics of any of them
[03:24:46.560 --> 03:24:48.040]   that kind of stand out to you?
[03:24:48.040 --> 03:24:51.520]   Don't you think the competition is based
[03:24:51.520 --> 03:24:53.080]   on a set of features?
[03:24:53.080 --> 03:24:57.480]   Also, so the set of features that a cryptocurrency provides,
[03:24:57.480 --> 03:24:59.840]   but also the community that it provides.
[03:24:59.840 --> 03:25:01.440]   Don't you think the community matters
[03:25:01.440 --> 03:25:04.200]   and sort of the adoption, the dynamic of the adoption,
[03:25:04.200 --> 03:25:06.120]   both across the developers and the investors?
[03:25:06.120 --> 03:25:08.920]   - If I'm looking at them, I mean, the first question is,
[03:25:08.920 --> 03:25:12.160]   what's the regulatory risk?
[03:25:12.160 --> 03:25:15.560]   How likely is it to be deemed a property versus security?
[03:25:15.560 --> 03:25:19.160]   And the second is, what's the competitive risk?
[03:25:19.160 --> 03:25:21.360]   And the third is, what's the speed and the performance?
[03:25:21.360 --> 03:25:26.320]   And all those things lead to the question
[03:25:26.320 --> 03:25:28.160]   of what's the security risk?
[03:25:28.160 --> 03:25:30.320]   How likely is it to crash and burn?
[03:25:30.320 --> 03:25:34.080]   And how stable or unstable is it?
[03:25:34.080 --> 03:25:36.680]   And then there's the marketing risk.
[03:25:36.680 --> 03:25:38.640]   I mean, there are different teams behind each
[03:25:38.640 --> 03:25:41.720]   of these things and communities behind them.
[03:25:41.720 --> 03:25:46.720]   I think that the big cloud looming over the crypto industry
[03:25:46.720 --> 03:25:51.160]   is regulatory treatment of cryptocurrencies
[03:25:51.160 --> 03:25:53.600]   and regulatory treatment of crypto securities
[03:25:53.600 --> 03:25:54.760]   and crypto platforms.
[03:25:54.760 --> 03:25:56.280]   And I think that won't be determined
[03:25:56.280 --> 03:25:58.480]   until the end of the first Biden administration.
[03:25:58.480 --> 03:26:01.480]   For example, there are people that would like
[03:26:01.480 --> 03:26:06.480]   only US FDIC insured banks to issue cryptocurrencies.
[03:26:06.480 --> 03:26:09.600]   They want JP Morgan to issue a crypto dollar
[03:26:09.600 --> 03:26:11.600]   backed one-to-one.
[03:26:11.600 --> 03:26:13.840]   But then in the US right now, we have Circle
[03:26:13.840 --> 03:26:17.640]   and we have other companies that are licensed entities
[03:26:17.640 --> 03:26:19.960]   that are backed by cash and cash equivalents,
[03:26:19.960 --> 03:26:22.360]   but they're not FDIC insured banks.
[03:26:22.360 --> 03:26:23.960]   There's also a debate in Congress
[03:26:23.960 --> 03:26:25.880]   about whether state chartered banks
[03:26:25.880 --> 03:26:27.600]   should be able to issue these things.
[03:26:27.600 --> 03:26:31.600]   And then we have Tether and others
[03:26:31.600 --> 03:26:34.520]   that are outside of the US jurisdiction.
[03:26:34.520 --> 03:26:36.880]   They're probably not backed by cash and cash equivalents.
[03:26:36.880 --> 03:26:40.280]   They're backed by stuff and we don't know what stuff.
[03:26:40.280 --> 03:26:44.520]   And then finally you have, you know, UST and DAI,
[03:26:44.520 --> 03:26:47.440]   which are algorithmic stable coins, right?
[03:26:47.440 --> 03:26:50.440]   That are even more innovative
[03:26:50.440 --> 03:26:52.520]   further outside the compliance framework.
[03:26:52.520 --> 03:26:56.680]   So if you ask who's gonna win, the question is really,
[03:26:56.680 --> 03:26:58.480]   I don't know, will the market decide
[03:26:58.480 --> 03:27:00.800]   or will the regulators decide?
[03:27:00.800 --> 03:27:02.240]   If the regulators get out of the way
[03:27:02.240 --> 03:27:03.280]   and the market fought out,
[03:27:03.280 --> 03:27:05.840]   well then it's an interesting discussion.
[03:27:05.840 --> 03:27:08.120]   And then I think that all bets are off
[03:27:08.120 --> 03:27:11.560]   if the regulators get more heavy handed with this.
[03:27:11.560 --> 03:27:13.160]   And I think you could have the same discussion
[03:27:13.160 --> 03:27:16.600]   with crypto properties, like the DeFi exchanges
[03:27:16.600 --> 03:27:18.200]   and the crypto exchanges.
[03:27:18.200 --> 03:27:20.840]   The SEC would like to regulate the crypto exchanges.
[03:27:20.840 --> 03:27:23.240]   They'd like to regulate the DeFi exchanges.
[03:27:23.240 --> 03:27:25.480]   That means they may regulate the crypto platforms
[03:27:25.480 --> 03:27:29.160]   and at what rate and in what fashion.
[03:27:29.160 --> 03:27:32.360]   And so I think that I could give you an opinion
[03:27:32.360 --> 03:27:34.880]   if it was limited to competition
[03:27:34.880 --> 03:27:37.880]   and the current regulatory regime.
[03:27:37.880 --> 03:27:42.880]   But I think that the regulations are so fast moving
[03:27:43.040 --> 03:27:48.040]   and it's so uncertain that you can't make a decision
[03:27:48.040 --> 03:27:55.720]   without considering the potential actions of the regulators.
[03:27:55.720 --> 03:27:58.120]   - I hope the regulators get out of the way.
[03:27:58.120 --> 03:28:00.960]   Can you steal me on the case that Dogecoin
[03:28:00.960 --> 03:28:03.720]   is I guess the second best cryptocurrency
[03:28:03.720 --> 03:28:06.520]   if you don't consider Bitcoin a cryptocurrency,
[03:28:06.520 --> 03:28:08.880]   but instead a crypto property?
[03:28:08.880 --> 03:28:11.240]   - I would classify it as crypto property
[03:28:11.240 --> 03:28:13.320]   because the US dollar is a currency.
[03:28:13.320 --> 03:28:17.240]   So unless your crypto asset is pegged algorithmically
[03:28:17.240 --> 03:28:20.200]   or stably to the value of the dollar, it's not a currency.
[03:28:20.200 --> 03:28:22.880]   It's a property or it's an asset.
[03:28:22.880 --> 03:28:25.360]   - So then can you steal me on the case
[03:28:25.360 --> 03:28:28.640]   that Dogecoin is the best cryptocurrency then?
[03:28:28.640 --> 03:28:32.800]   Because Bitcoin is not even in that list.
[03:28:32.800 --> 03:28:36.160]   - The debate is gonna be whether it's property or security.
[03:28:36.160 --> 03:28:39.120]   And there's a debate whether it's decentralized enough.
[03:28:39.120 --> 03:28:41.680]   So let's assume it was decentralized.
[03:28:41.680 --> 03:28:42.640]   - Yeah.
[03:28:42.640 --> 03:28:45.320]   - Well, it's increasing at not quite five,
[03:28:45.320 --> 03:28:47.480]   what 5% a year inflation rate,
[03:28:47.480 --> 03:28:49.880]   but it's not 5% exponentially.
[03:28:49.880 --> 03:28:54.440]   It's like a plus 5 million, 5% something,
[03:28:54.440 --> 03:28:57.560]   captain is less, I forget the exact number,
[03:28:57.560 --> 03:29:00.120]   but it's an inflationary property.
[03:29:00.120 --> 03:29:04.680]   It's got a lower inflation rate than the US dollar
[03:29:04.680 --> 03:29:06.840]   and it's got a much lower inflation rate
[03:29:06.840 --> 03:29:10.080]   than many other fiat currencies.
[03:29:10.080 --> 03:29:11.880]   So I think you could say that.
[03:29:11.880 --> 03:29:14.280]   - But don't you see the power of meme,
[03:29:14.280 --> 03:29:19.080]   the power of ideas, the power of fun
[03:29:19.080 --> 03:29:24.080]   or whatever mechanism is used to captivate a community?
[03:29:24.080 --> 03:29:27.360]   - I do, but there are meme stocks.
[03:29:27.360 --> 03:29:30.200]   It doesn't absolve you of your ethical
[03:29:30.200 --> 03:29:33.880]   and securities liabilities if you're promoting it.
[03:29:33.880 --> 03:29:36.120]   So like, I don't have a problem
[03:29:36.120 --> 03:29:38.200]   with like people buying a stock.
[03:29:38.200 --> 03:29:43.480]   It's just, the way I divide the world is, right?
[03:29:43.480 --> 03:29:46.160]   There's investment, there's saving,
[03:29:46.160 --> 03:29:49.720]   and there's speculation and there's trading.
[03:29:49.720 --> 03:29:53.200]   So Bitcoin is an asset for saving.
[03:29:53.200 --> 03:29:55.680]   If you wanna save money for a hundred years,
[03:29:55.680 --> 03:30:00.680]   you don't really want to take on execution risk or the like.
[03:30:00.680 --> 03:30:03.480]   So you're just buying something to hold forever.
[03:30:03.480 --> 03:30:07.640]   For you to actually endorse something as a property,
[03:30:07.640 --> 03:30:08.600]   like if you said to me,
[03:30:08.600 --> 03:30:11.240]   "Mike, what should I buy for the next hundred years?"
[03:30:11.240 --> 03:30:13.040]   I say, "Well, some amount of real estate,
[03:30:13.040 --> 03:30:15.440]   some amount of scarce collectibles,
[03:30:15.440 --> 03:30:17.560]   some amount of Bitcoin, right?
[03:30:17.560 --> 03:30:20.080]   You can run your company, right?
[03:30:20.080 --> 03:30:21.840]   But running your company is an investment.
[03:30:21.840 --> 03:30:24.320]   So the savings are properties.
[03:30:24.320 --> 03:30:25.640]   If you said, "What should I invest in?"
[03:30:25.640 --> 03:30:28.240]   I'd say, "Well, here's a list of good companies,
[03:30:28.240 --> 03:30:30.240]   private companies, you can start your own company.
[03:30:30.240 --> 03:30:32.840]   That's an investment, right?"
[03:30:33.840 --> 03:30:36.200]   If you said, "What should I trade?"
[03:30:36.200 --> 03:30:38.400]   Well, trading is like a proprietary thing.
[03:30:38.400 --> 03:30:42.640]   Like I don't have any special insight into that.
[03:30:42.640 --> 03:30:44.360]   If you're a good trader, you know you are.
[03:30:44.360 --> 03:30:47.600]   If you said to me, "What should you speculate in?"
[03:30:47.600 --> 03:30:51.560]   We talk about meme stocks and meme coins,
[03:30:51.560 --> 03:30:54.320]   and it's kind of sits up there.
[03:30:54.320 --> 03:30:55.800]   It sits right in the same space
[03:30:55.800 --> 03:30:57.720]   with what horse should you bet on
[03:30:57.720 --> 03:30:59.960]   and what sports team should you gamble on
[03:30:59.960 --> 03:31:02.480]   and should you bet on black six times in a row
[03:31:02.480 --> 03:31:04.760]   and double down each time.
[03:31:04.760 --> 03:31:09.440]   I mean, it's fun, but at the end of the day,
[03:31:09.440 --> 03:31:12.000]   it's a speculation, right?
[03:31:12.000 --> 03:31:14.680]   You can't build a civilization-
[03:31:14.680 --> 03:31:15.640]   On speculation.
[03:31:15.640 --> 03:31:16.480]   On it.
[03:31:16.480 --> 03:31:18.200]   It's not an institutional asset.
[03:31:18.200 --> 03:31:20.720]   And in fact, where I'd leave it, right,
[03:31:20.720 --> 03:31:23.520]   is Bitcoin is clearly digital private,
[03:31:23.520 --> 03:31:26.880]   which makes it an institutional grade investable asset
[03:31:26.880 --> 03:31:30.040]   for a public company, a public figure, a public investor,
[03:31:30.040 --> 03:31:31.760]   or anybody that's risk adverse.
[03:31:32.640 --> 03:31:37.320]   I think that the top 100 other cryptos
[03:31:37.320 --> 03:31:39.720]   are like venture capital investments.
[03:31:39.720 --> 03:31:41.080]   And if you're a VC
[03:31:41.080 --> 03:31:43.200]   and if you're a qualified technical investor
[03:31:43.200 --> 03:31:44.360]   and you have a pool of capital
[03:31:44.360 --> 03:31:46.760]   and you can take that kind of risk,
[03:31:46.760 --> 03:31:49.360]   then you can parse through that and form opinions.
[03:31:49.360 --> 03:31:52.520]   It's just orders of magnitude more risky
[03:31:52.520 --> 03:31:55.120]   because of competition, because of ambition,
[03:31:55.120 --> 03:31:56.680]   and because of regulation.
[03:31:56.680 --> 03:31:59.360]   And if you take the meme coins,
[03:31:59.360 --> 03:32:03.600]   it's like when some rapper comes out with a meme coin,
[03:32:03.600 --> 03:32:07.360]   it's like maybe it'll peak when I hear about it, right?
[03:32:07.360 --> 03:32:11.240]   I mean, SHIB was created as a coin
[03:32:11.240 --> 03:32:14.720]   such that it had so many zeros after the decimal point
[03:32:14.720 --> 03:32:17.720]   that when you looked at it on the exchanges,
[03:32:17.720 --> 03:32:20.920]   it always showed zero, zero, zero, zero.
[03:32:20.920 --> 03:32:24.200]   And it wasn't until like six months after it got popular
[03:32:24.200 --> 03:32:26.120]   that they started expanding the display
[03:32:26.120 --> 03:32:27.880]   so you could see whether the price had changed.
[03:32:27.880 --> 03:32:29.280]   - Yeah, that's speculation.
[03:32:29.280 --> 03:32:32.640]   Maybe you can correct me,
[03:32:32.640 --> 03:32:35.520]   but you've been critical of Elon Musk in the past
[03:32:35.520 --> 03:32:37.000]   in the crypto space.
[03:32:37.000 --> 03:32:39.840]   Where do you stand on Elon's effect on Bitcoin
[03:32:39.840 --> 03:32:42.440]   and cryptocurrency in general these days?
[03:32:42.440 --> 03:32:46.080]   - I believe that Bitcoin is a massive breakthrough
[03:32:46.080 --> 03:32:47.240]   for the human race
[03:32:47.240 --> 03:32:49.840]   that will cure half the problems in the world
[03:32:49.840 --> 03:32:52.040]   and generate hundreds of trillions of dollars
[03:32:52.040 --> 03:32:55.200]   of economic value to the civilization.
[03:32:55.200 --> 03:33:00.200]   And I believe that it's in an early stage
[03:33:00.200 --> 03:33:02.280]   where many people don't understand it
[03:33:02.280 --> 03:33:04.960]   and they're afraid of it and there's FUD
[03:33:04.960 --> 03:33:08.360]   and there's uncertainty, there's doubt and there's fear.
[03:33:08.360 --> 03:33:10.640]   And it's a very noisy crypto world
[03:33:10.640 --> 03:33:15.640]   and there's 15,000 other cryptos that are seeking relevance.
[03:33:15.640 --> 03:33:20.760]   And I think most of the FUD is actually fueled
[03:33:20.760 --> 03:33:22.880]   by the other crypto entrepreneurs.
[03:33:22.880 --> 03:33:27.600]   So the environmental FUD and the other types of uncertainty
[03:33:27.600 --> 03:33:28.560]   that surround Bitcoin,
[03:33:28.560 --> 03:33:30.880]   generally they're not coming
[03:33:30.880 --> 03:33:32.960]   from legitimate environmentalists.
[03:33:32.960 --> 03:33:36.200]   They don't come from legitimate critics.
[03:33:36.200 --> 03:33:39.800]   They actually are guerrilla marketing campaigns
[03:33:39.800 --> 03:33:42.240]   that are being financed and fueled
[03:33:42.240 --> 03:33:46.080]   by other crypto entrepreneurs
[03:33:46.080 --> 03:33:48.680]   because they have an interest in doing so.
[03:33:48.680 --> 03:33:52.760]   So if I look at the constructive path forward,
[03:33:52.760 --> 03:33:56.120]   first, I think it'd be very constructive
[03:33:56.120 --> 03:33:58.960]   for corporations to embrace Bitcoin
[03:33:58.960 --> 03:34:03.160]   and build applications on top of it.
[03:34:03.160 --> 03:34:05.600]   You don't need to fix it.
[03:34:05.600 --> 03:34:07.480]   There's nothing wrong with it, right?
[03:34:07.480 --> 03:34:09.720]   Like when you put it on a layer two and a layer three,
[03:34:09.720 --> 03:34:13.080]   it moves a billion times a second at the speed of light.
[03:34:13.080 --> 03:34:17.920]   So every beautiful, cool DeFi application,
[03:34:17.920 --> 03:34:19.720]   every crypto application,
[03:34:19.720 --> 03:34:22.160]   everything you could imagine you might wanna do,
[03:34:22.160 --> 03:34:26.880]   you can do with a legitimate company
[03:34:26.880 --> 03:34:31.000]   and a legitimate website or mobile application
[03:34:31.000 --> 03:34:36.000]   sitting on top of Bitcoin or lightning if you want to.
[03:34:36.000 --> 03:34:40.320]   So I think that to the extent that people do that,
[03:34:40.320 --> 03:34:42.800]   that's gonna be better for the world.
[03:34:42.800 --> 03:34:45.040]   If you consider what holds people back,
[03:34:45.040 --> 03:34:49.640]   I think it's just misperceptions about what Bitcoin is.
[03:34:49.640 --> 03:34:53.480]   So I'm a big fan of just educating people.
[03:34:53.480 --> 03:34:57.080]   If you're not going to commercialize it,
[03:34:57.080 --> 03:34:59.320]   then just educate people on what it is.
[03:34:59.320 --> 03:35:02.880]   So for example, Bitcoin's the most efficient
[03:35:02.880 --> 03:35:07.040]   use of energy in the world by far, right?
[03:35:07.040 --> 03:35:07.880]   Most people don't,
[03:35:07.880 --> 03:35:10.200]   they don't necessarily perceive that or realize that,
[03:35:10.200 --> 03:35:13.440]   but if you were to take any metric, energy intensity,
[03:35:14.360 --> 03:35:17.320]   you put like $2 billion worth of electricity
[03:35:17.320 --> 03:35:22.240]   in the network every year, and it's worth $850 billion.
[03:35:22.240 --> 03:35:25.960]   There is no industry in the real world, right?
[03:35:25.960 --> 03:35:28.720]   That is that energy efficient.
[03:35:28.720 --> 03:35:30.120]   Not only that energy efficient,
[03:35:30.120 --> 03:35:32.120]   it's also the most sustainable industry.
[03:35:32.120 --> 03:35:34.160]   We just, we do surveys,
[03:35:34.160 --> 03:35:38.200]   58% of Bitcoin mining energy is sustainable.
[03:35:38.200 --> 03:35:40.840]   So there's a very good story.
[03:35:40.840 --> 03:35:42.760]   In fact, every other industry, planes, trains,
[03:35:42.760 --> 03:35:47.760]   automobiles, construction, food, medicine, everything else,
[03:35:47.760 --> 03:35:50.600]   it's less clean, less efficient.
[03:35:50.600 --> 03:35:56.200]   So I would like to, I wouldn't say there is a debate.
[03:35:56.200 --> 03:35:58.080]   I would just say that to the extent
[03:35:58.080 --> 03:36:00.120]   that the Bitcoin community had any issue with Elon,
[03:36:00.120 --> 03:36:04.680]   it was just, you know, the, just this environmental,
[03:36:04.680 --> 03:36:07.720]   you know, uncertainty that he fueled
[03:36:07.720 --> 03:36:09.960]   in a couple of his tweets, right?
[03:36:10.920 --> 03:36:13.320]   Which I think just is very distracting.
[03:36:13.320 --> 03:36:14.360]   - But that was one of them.
[03:36:14.360 --> 03:36:17.080]   But I think it's like the Bitcoin maximalists,
[03:36:17.080 --> 03:36:18.480]   but generally the crypto community,
[03:36:18.480 --> 03:36:22.720]   what you call the crypto entrepreneurs are,
[03:36:22.720 --> 03:36:26.280]   you know, it's also, they're using it for,
[03:36:26.280 --> 03:36:29.840]   I mean, for investment, for speculation,
[03:36:29.840 --> 03:36:31.920]   and therefore get very passionate
[03:36:31.920 --> 03:36:35.320]   about people's kind of celebrities,
[03:36:35.320 --> 03:36:37.560]   including you, like famous people.
[03:36:37.560 --> 03:36:38.760]   - Right.
[03:36:38.760 --> 03:36:43.760]   - Saying positive stuff about any one particular crypto,
[03:36:43.760 --> 03:36:48.600]   thing you can buy in Coinbase.
[03:36:48.600 --> 03:36:51.680]   And so they might be unhappy with Elon Musk
[03:36:51.680 --> 03:36:54.600]   that he's promoting Bitcoin and then not,
[03:36:54.600 --> 03:36:57.000]   and then promoting Dogecoin, then not,
[03:36:57.000 --> 03:37:02.000]   and this kind of, there's so much emotion tied up
[03:37:02.000 --> 03:37:05.440]   in the communication on this topic.
[03:37:05.440 --> 03:37:08.640]   And that's, I think that's where a lot of the-
[03:37:08.640 --> 03:37:11.800]   - Look, I don't have a criticism of Elon Musk.
[03:37:11.800 --> 03:37:13.720]   He's free to do whatever he wishes to do.
[03:37:13.720 --> 03:37:14.560]   It's his life.
[03:37:14.560 --> 03:37:17.680]   In fact, Elon Musk is the, you know,
[03:37:17.680 --> 03:37:21.440]   the second largest supporter of Bitcoin in the world.
[03:37:21.440 --> 03:37:22.920]   I think that the Bitcoin community
[03:37:22.920 --> 03:37:24.920]   tends to eat its own quite a bit.
[03:37:24.920 --> 03:37:25.760]   - Yeah.
[03:37:25.760 --> 03:37:29.160]   - Like it tends to be very, very self-critical.
[03:37:29.160 --> 03:37:33.720]   And instead of saying, well, Elon is more supportive
[03:37:33.720 --> 03:37:38.600]   of Bitcoin than the other 10,000 people in the world,
[03:37:38.600 --> 03:37:40.240]   you know, with serious amounts of money,
[03:37:40.240 --> 03:37:43.000]   they're like, they focus upon, you know.
[03:37:43.000 --> 03:37:44.480]   - Yeah, this is strange.
[03:37:44.480 --> 03:37:46.200]   Eating your own is just-
[03:37:46.200 --> 03:37:47.760]   - Yeah, so I mean, I think he's free
[03:37:47.760 --> 03:37:48.880]   to do what he wants to do.
[03:37:48.880 --> 03:37:52.080]   Like, and I think he's done a lot of good for Bitcoin
[03:37:52.080 --> 03:37:56.100]   in putting it on the balance sheet of Tesla and holding it.
[03:37:56.100 --> 03:37:58.940]   And I think that sent a very powerful message.
[03:37:58.940 --> 03:38:02.440]   - Do you have advice for young people?
[03:38:02.440 --> 03:38:04.720]   So you've had a heck of a life.
[03:38:04.720 --> 03:38:08.000]   You've done quite a lot of things,
[03:38:08.000 --> 03:38:11.720]   start before MIT, but starting with MIT.
[03:38:11.720 --> 03:38:13.200]   Is there advice you have for young people
[03:38:13.200 --> 03:38:15.280]   in high school and college,
[03:38:15.280 --> 03:38:20.280]   how to have a career they can be proud of,
[03:38:20.280 --> 03:38:24.000]   how to have a life they can be proud of?
[03:38:24.000 --> 03:38:28.600]   - I was asked by somebody for quick advice
[03:38:28.600 --> 03:38:31.080]   for his young children.
[03:38:31.080 --> 03:38:34.040]   He had twins when they enter adulthood.
[03:38:34.040 --> 03:38:37.640]   He said, "Give me your advice for them in a letter.
[03:38:37.640 --> 03:38:41.840]   "I'm gonna give it to them when they turn 21 or something."
[03:38:41.840 --> 03:38:44.920]   So then he handed, I thought, I was at a party,
[03:38:44.920 --> 03:38:46.560]   and then he handed me this sheet of paper.
[03:38:46.560 --> 03:38:48.080]   I thought, oh, he wants me to write it down right now.
[03:38:48.080 --> 03:38:49.800]   So I sat down, I started writing,
[03:38:49.800 --> 03:38:51.680]   and I figured, well, what would you wanna tell
[03:38:51.680 --> 03:38:53.040]   someone at age 21?
[03:38:53.040 --> 03:38:55.200]   - You wrote it down.
[03:38:55.200 --> 03:38:56.040]   - So I wrote it down.
[03:38:56.040 --> 03:38:56.880]   - Awesome. - And then I tweeted it,
[03:38:56.880 --> 03:38:58.880]   and it's sitting on Twitter, but I tell you what I said.
[03:38:58.880 --> 03:39:00.400]   - Mm-hmm. - My advice
[03:39:00.400 --> 03:39:02.400]   if you're entering adulthood.
[03:39:02.400 --> 03:39:06.680]   Focus your energy, guard your time,
[03:39:06.680 --> 03:39:12.360]   train your mind, train your body,
[03:39:12.360 --> 03:39:17.940]   think for yourself, curate your friends,
[03:39:17.940 --> 03:39:24.120]   curate your environment, keep your promises,
[03:39:24.120 --> 03:39:27.700]   stay cheerful and constructive,
[03:39:28.700 --> 03:39:30.260]   and upgrade the world.
[03:39:30.260 --> 03:39:32.540]   Like that was the 10.
[03:39:32.540 --> 03:39:35.780]   - Upgrade the world, that's an interesting choice of words.
[03:39:35.780 --> 03:39:39.900]   Upgrade the world, upgrade the world.
[03:39:39.900 --> 03:39:40.740]   - It's like an engineer's training.
[03:39:40.740 --> 03:39:41.580]   - Focus your energy.
[03:39:41.580 --> 03:39:45.300]   It's a very, yeah, it's a very engineering-themed,
[03:39:45.300 --> 03:39:49.260]   keep your promises too.
[03:39:49.260 --> 03:39:50.660]   That's an interesting one.
[03:39:50.660 --> 03:39:54.340]   - I think most people suffer because they just,
[03:39:54.340 --> 03:39:56.300]   they don't focus.
[03:39:56.300 --> 03:39:57.300]   Like you gotta figure out,
[03:39:57.300 --> 03:39:59.380]   I think the big risk in this world
[03:39:59.380 --> 03:40:00.980]   is there's too much of everything.
[03:40:00.980 --> 03:40:01.900]   - Yeah.
[03:40:01.900 --> 03:40:06.100]   - Like you can sit and watch chess videos 100 hours a week,
[03:40:06.100 --> 03:40:08.940]   and you'll never get through all the chess videos, right?
[03:40:08.940 --> 03:40:13.460]   There's too much of every possible thing,
[03:40:13.460 --> 03:40:14.760]   too much of every good thing.
[03:40:14.760 --> 03:40:18.440]   So figuring out what you wanna do,
[03:40:18.440 --> 03:40:21.620]   and then everything will suck up your time, right?
[03:40:21.620 --> 03:40:24.500]   There's 100 streaming channels to binge watch on.
[03:40:24.500 --> 03:40:26.300]   So you gotta guard your time,
[03:40:26.300 --> 03:40:30.260]   and then train your body, train your mind,
[03:40:30.260 --> 03:40:35.080]   and control who's around you, control what surrounds you.
[03:40:35.080 --> 03:40:37.700]   So ultimately, in a world
[03:40:37.700 --> 03:40:39.960]   where there's too much of everything,
[03:40:39.960 --> 03:40:42.900]   then your success--
[03:40:42.900 --> 03:40:44.300]   - It's like those laser eyes.
[03:40:44.300 --> 03:40:45.460]   It's like those laser eyes.
[03:40:45.460 --> 03:40:50.460]   You have to focus on just a few of those things.
[03:40:50.460 --> 03:40:55.020]   - Yeah, I mean, I got 1,000 opinions we could talk about,
[03:40:55.020 --> 03:40:56.580]   and I could pursue 1,000 things,
[03:40:56.580 --> 03:40:58.380]   but I don't expect to be successful.
[03:40:58.380 --> 03:41:03.380]   And I'm not sure that my opinion in any of the 999
[03:41:03.380 --> 03:41:08.620]   is any more valid than the leader of thought in that area.
[03:41:08.620 --> 03:41:13.700]   So how about if I just focus upon one thing,
[03:41:13.700 --> 03:41:17.780]   and then deliver the best I can in the one thing?
[03:41:17.780 --> 03:41:20.780]   That's the laser eye message.
[03:41:20.780 --> 03:41:22.580]   The rest get you distracted.
[03:41:22.580 --> 03:41:24.140]   - Well, how do you achieve that?
[03:41:24.140 --> 03:41:26.820]   Do you find yourself, given the way you are in life,
[03:41:26.820 --> 03:41:28.420]   having to say no a lot?
[03:41:28.420 --> 03:41:31.820]   Or just focus comes naturally
[03:41:31.820 --> 03:41:34.100]   when you just ignore everything around you?
[03:41:34.100 --> 03:41:35.740]   So how do you achieve that focus?
[03:41:35.740 --> 03:41:40.300]   - I think it helps if people know what you're focused on.
[03:41:40.300 --> 03:41:43.460]   - So everything about you just radiates that people know.
[03:41:43.460 --> 03:41:44.300]   People know this is--
[03:41:44.300 --> 03:41:46.020]   - If they know what you're focused on,
[03:41:46.020 --> 03:41:50.460]   then you won't get so many other things coming your way.
[03:41:50.460 --> 03:41:55.460]   If you dally, or if you flirt with 27 different things,
[03:41:55.460 --> 03:42:00.980]   then you're gonna get approached by people
[03:42:00.980 --> 03:42:03.900]   in each of the 27 communities, right?
[03:42:03.900 --> 03:42:06.300]   - You mentioned getting a PhD,
[03:42:06.300 --> 03:42:09.460]   and giving your roots at MIT.
[03:42:09.460 --> 03:42:12.620]   Do you think there's all kinds of journeys
[03:42:12.620 --> 03:42:14.740]   you can take to educate yourself?
[03:42:14.740 --> 03:42:18.720]   Do you think a PhD or school is still worth it?
[03:42:20.300 --> 03:42:23.500]   Or is there other paths through life that--
[03:42:23.500 --> 03:42:24.940]   - Is it worth it if you have to pay for it?
[03:42:24.940 --> 03:42:27.300]   Is it worth it if you have to spend the time on it?
[03:42:27.300 --> 03:42:31.020]   - The time and the money is a big cost.
[03:42:31.020 --> 03:42:32.940]   - I think--
[03:42:32.940 --> 03:42:34.780]   - Time probably the bigger one, right?
[03:42:34.780 --> 03:42:39.780]   - It seems clear to me that the world wants more specialists.
[03:42:39.780 --> 03:42:46.340]   It wants you to be an expert and to focus on one area.
[03:42:47.340 --> 03:42:52.340]   And it's punishing generalist jack of all trades,
[03:42:52.340 --> 03:42:54.540]   especially people that are generalists
[03:42:54.540 --> 03:42:55.880]   in the physical realm.
[03:42:55.880 --> 03:42:57.900]   'Cause if you're a specialist in the digital realm,
[03:42:57.900 --> 03:42:58.780]   you might very well,
[03:42:58.780 --> 03:43:03.700]   you're the person with 700,000 followers on Twitter,
[03:43:03.700 --> 03:43:05.900]   and you show them how to tie knots.
[03:43:05.900 --> 03:43:10.480]   Or you're the banjo player with 1.8 million followers,
[03:43:10.480 --> 03:43:14.220]   and whenever everybody types banjo, it's you, right?
[03:43:14.220 --> 03:43:19.220]   And so the world wants people that do something well,
[03:43:19.220 --> 03:43:24.560]   and then it wants to stamp out 18 million copies of them.
[03:43:24.560 --> 03:43:28.540]   And so that argues in favor of focus.
[03:43:28.540 --> 03:43:30.980]   Now, I mean, the definition of a PhD
[03:43:30.980 --> 03:43:33.500]   is someone with enough of an education
[03:43:33.500 --> 03:43:35.580]   that they're capable of or have made.
[03:43:35.580 --> 03:43:37.220]   I guess to get a PhD,
[03:43:37.220 --> 03:43:40.860]   technically you have to have done a dissertation
[03:43:40.860 --> 03:43:43.480]   where you made a seminal contribution
[03:43:43.480 --> 03:43:45.780]   to the body of human knowledge, right?
[03:43:45.780 --> 03:43:47.180]   And if you haven't done that,
[03:43:47.180 --> 03:43:49.340]   technically you have a master's degree,
[03:43:49.340 --> 03:43:51.180]   but you're not a doctor.
[03:43:51.180 --> 03:43:56.180]   So if you're interested in any of the academic disciplines
[03:43:56.180 --> 03:43:59.080]   that a PhD would be granted for,
[03:43:59.080 --> 03:44:02.420]   then I can see that being a reasonable pursuit.
[03:44:02.420 --> 03:44:04.920]   But there are many people that are specialists.
[03:44:04.920 --> 03:44:07.500]   You know the Agimator?
[03:44:07.500 --> 03:44:09.220]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:44:09.220 --> 03:44:10.260]   The Agimator on YouTube?
[03:44:10.260 --> 03:44:11.100]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:44:11.160 --> 03:44:13.960]   He's the world's greatest chess commentator.
[03:44:13.960 --> 03:44:14.800]   Yeah.
[03:44:14.800 --> 03:44:16.280]   And I've watched his career
[03:44:16.280 --> 03:44:18.880]   and he's got progressively better and he's really good.
[03:44:18.880 --> 03:44:20.800]   He's gonna love hearing this.
[03:44:20.800 --> 03:44:22.600]   Yeah, the Agimator over here is this,
[03:44:22.600 --> 03:44:24.520]   I'm a big fan of the Agimator.
[03:44:24.520 --> 03:44:26.120]   I have to cut myself off, right?
[03:44:26.120 --> 03:44:27.480]   Because otherwise you'll watch
[03:44:27.480 --> 03:44:30.840]   the entire Paul Morphy saga for your weekend.
[03:44:30.840 --> 03:44:34.960]   But the point really is YouTube is full of experts
[03:44:34.960 --> 03:44:37.600]   who are specialists in something
[03:44:37.600 --> 03:44:40.360]   and they rise to the top of their profession.
[03:44:40.360 --> 03:44:45.360]   And Twitter is too and the internet is.
[03:44:45.360 --> 03:44:50.140]   So I would advocate that you figure out
[03:44:50.140 --> 03:44:54.620]   what you're passionate about and what you're good at
[03:44:54.620 --> 03:44:57.420]   and you do focus on it,
[03:44:57.420 --> 03:45:02.000]   especially if the thing that you're doing can be automated.
[03:45:02.000 --> 03:45:04.680]   The problem is,
[03:45:04.680 --> 03:45:08.880]   you know, back to that 500,000 algebra teacher type comment.
[03:45:08.880 --> 03:45:12.280]   The problem is if it is possible to be automated,
[03:45:12.280 --> 03:45:16.000]   then over time, someone's probably gonna automate it.
[03:45:16.000 --> 03:45:20.660]   And that squeezes, you know,
[03:45:20.660 --> 03:45:22.760]   the state space of everybody else.
[03:45:22.760 --> 03:45:25.300]   It's like, like after the lockdowns,
[03:45:25.300 --> 03:45:28.080]   it used to be there are like all these local bands
[03:45:28.080 --> 03:45:30.840]   that played in bars and everyone went to the bar
[03:45:30.840 --> 03:45:32.400]   to see the local band.
[03:45:32.400 --> 03:45:33.800]   And then during the lockdown,
[03:45:33.800 --> 03:45:36.840]   you would have like the six super groups
[03:45:36.840 --> 03:45:40.540]   and they would all get 500,000 or a million followers
[03:45:40.540 --> 03:45:42.980]   and all these smaller local bands
[03:45:42.980 --> 03:45:47.840]   just got no attention at all.
[03:45:47.840 --> 03:45:49.320]   - Well, the interesting thing is
[03:45:49.320 --> 03:45:52.040]   one of those 500,000 algebra teachers
[03:45:52.040 --> 03:45:54.360]   is likely to be part of the automation.
[03:45:54.360 --> 03:45:57.040]   So it's like, it's an opportunity for you to think,
[03:45:57.040 --> 03:46:02.040]   where's my field, my discipline evolving into?
[03:46:02.040 --> 03:46:04.460]   I talked to a bunch of librarians,
[03:46:04.460 --> 03:46:06.640]   just happened to be friends with librarians.
[03:46:06.640 --> 03:46:10.620]   And that's, libraries will probably be evolving
[03:46:10.620 --> 03:46:12.140]   and it's up to you as a librarian
[03:46:12.140 --> 03:46:17.140]   to be one of the few that remain in the rubble.
[03:46:17.140 --> 03:46:20.900]   - If you're gonna give commentary on Shakespeare plays,
[03:46:20.900 --> 03:46:23.640]   I want you to basically do it for every Shakespeare play.
[03:46:23.640 --> 03:46:25.600]   Like I want you to be the Shakespeare dude
[03:46:25.600 --> 03:46:29.880]   because once, just like Lex, you're like-
[03:46:29.880 --> 03:46:31.400]   - I don't know what kind of-
[03:46:31.400 --> 03:46:35.440]   - You're the deep thinking podcaster, right?
[03:46:35.440 --> 03:46:38.140]   You're the podcaster that goes
[03:46:38.140 --> 03:46:42.620]   after the deep intellectual conversations.
[03:46:42.620 --> 03:46:47.120]   And once I get comfortable with you and I like you,
[03:46:47.120 --> 03:46:49.120]   then I start binge watching Lex.
[03:46:49.120 --> 03:46:55.220]   But if you changed your format through 16 different formats
[03:46:55.220 --> 03:46:57.400]   so that you could compete with 16 different
[03:46:57.400 --> 03:46:59.640]   other personalities on YouTube,
[03:46:59.640 --> 03:47:02.900]   you probably wouldn't beat any of them, right?
[03:47:02.900 --> 03:47:04.740]   You would probably just kind of sink into the,
[03:47:04.740 --> 03:47:07.120]   you're the number two or number three guy.
[03:47:07.120 --> 03:47:09.960]   You're not the number one guy in the format.
[03:47:09.960 --> 03:47:14.440]   And I think that the algorithm, right?
[03:47:14.440 --> 03:47:16.720]   The Twitter algorithm and the YouTube algorithm,
[03:47:16.720 --> 03:47:19.840]   they really reward the person that's focused,
[03:47:19.840 --> 03:47:22.440]   on message, consistent.
[03:47:22.440 --> 03:47:24.560]   The world wants somebody they can trust
[03:47:24.560 --> 03:47:27.120]   that's consistent and reliable.
[03:47:27.120 --> 03:47:29.560]   And they kind of wanna know what they're getting into
[03:47:29.560 --> 03:47:33.320]   because, and this is taken for granted maybe,
[03:47:33.320 --> 03:47:37.240]   but there's 10 million people
[03:47:37.240 --> 03:47:40.100]   vying for every hour of your time.
[03:47:40.100 --> 03:47:43.980]   And so the fact that anybody gives you any time at all
[03:47:43.980 --> 03:47:46.120]   is a huge privilege, right? - It's amazing.
[03:47:46.120 --> 03:47:48.140]   - And you should be thanking them
[03:47:48.140 --> 03:47:50.620]   and you should respect their time.
[03:47:50.620 --> 03:47:51.900]   - It's interesting.
[03:47:51.900 --> 03:47:53.540]   Everything you said is very interesting.
[03:47:53.540 --> 03:47:55.020]   But of course, from my perspective
[03:47:55.020 --> 03:47:57.260]   and probably from your perspective,
[03:47:57.260 --> 03:48:00.040]   my actual life has nothing to do with,
[03:48:00.040 --> 03:48:01.880]   it's just being focused on stuff.
[03:48:01.880 --> 03:48:03.940]   And in my case, it's like focused on
[03:48:03.940 --> 03:48:08.140]   doing the thing I really enjoy doing
[03:48:08.140 --> 03:48:11.340]   and being myself and not caring about anything else.
[03:48:11.340 --> 03:48:13.940]   Like I don't care about views or likes or attention.
[03:48:13.940 --> 03:48:17.380]   And that just maintaining that focus
[03:48:17.380 --> 03:48:19.280]   is the way from an individual perspective,
[03:48:19.280 --> 03:48:20.920]   you live that life.
[03:48:20.920 --> 03:48:24.580]   But yeah, it does seem that there's the world
[03:48:24.580 --> 03:48:27.980]   and technology is rewarding the specialization
[03:48:27.980 --> 03:48:29.820]   and creating bigger and bigger platforms
[03:48:29.820 --> 03:48:31.860]   for the different specializations.
[03:48:31.860 --> 03:48:35.180]   And that lifts all both actually,
[03:48:35.180 --> 03:48:37.820]   'cause the specializations get better and better and better
[03:48:37.820 --> 03:48:40.260]   at teaching people to do specific things
[03:48:40.260 --> 03:48:41.540]   and they educate themselves.
[03:48:41.540 --> 03:48:44.820]   And it's just everybody gets more and more knowledgeable
[03:48:44.820 --> 03:48:46.460]   and more and more empowered.
[03:48:46.460 --> 03:48:50.380]   - The reward for authenticity more than offsets
[03:48:50.380 --> 03:48:53.120]   the specificity with which you pursue your mission.
[03:48:53.120 --> 03:48:56.580]   Another way to say it is like,
[03:48:56.580 --> 03:48:58.860]   nobody wants to read advertising.
[03:48:58.860 --> 03:49:03.020]   Like if you were to spend $100 million advertising
[03:49:03.020 --> 03:49:05.700]   your thing, I probably wouldn't wanna watch it.
[03:49:05.700 --> 03:49:08.860]   But if you-- - That's so fascinating.
[03:49:08.860 --> 03:49:11.260]   - Yeah, we see the death of that.
[03:49:11.260 --> 03:49:16.020]   And so the commercial shows are losing their audiences
[03:49:16.020 --> 03:49:20.340]   and the authentic specialist or the authentic artist
[03:49:20.340 --> 03:49:24.540]   are gaining their audience.
[03:49:24.540 --> 03:49:26.420]   - And that's a beautiful thing.
[03:49:26.420 --> 03:49:28.000]   Speaking of deep thinking,
[03:49:29.000 --> 03:49:31.960]   you're just a human, your life ends.
[03:49:31.960 --> 03:49:37.400]   You've accumulated so much wisdom, so much money,
[03:49:37.400 --> 03:49:38.560]   but the ride ends.
[03:49:38.560 --> 03:49:39.760]   Do you think about that?
[03:49:39.760 --> 03:49:43.560]   Do you ponder your death, your mortality?
[03:49:43.560 --> 03:49:44.720]   Are you afraid of it?
[03:49:44.720 --> 03:49:51.040]   - When I go, all my assets will flow into a foundation
[03:49:51.040 --> 03:49:53.780]   and the foundation's mission is to make education free
[03:49:53.780 --> 03:49:55.360]   for everybody forever.
[03:49:55.360 --> 03:50:00.360]   And if I'm able to contribute to the creation
[03:50:00.360 --> 03:50:05.720]   of a more perfect monetary system,
[03:50:05.720 --> 03:50:08.400]   then maybe that foundation will go on forever.
[03:50:08.400 --> 03:50:12.640]   - The idea, the foundation of the idea.
[03:50:12.640 --> 03:50:17.040]   So not just the, each of the foundations.
[03:50:17.040 --> 03:50:19.920]   - It's not clear we're on the S-curve of immortal life yet.
[03:50:19.920 --> 03:50:21.860]   Like that's a biological question
[03:50:21.860 --> 03:50:25.120]   and you ask that on some of your other interviews
[03:50:25.120 --> 03:50:26.160]   a lot.
[03:50:26.160 --> 03:50:28.160]   I think that we are on the threshold
[03:50:28.160 --> 03:50:33.160]   of immortal life for ideas or immortal life
[03:50:33.160 --> 03:50:38.120]   for certain institutions or computer programs.
[03:50:38.120 --> 03:50:40.480]   So if we can fix the money,
[03:50:40.480 --> 03:50:45.480]   then you can create a technically perfected endowment.
[03:50:45.480 --> 03:50:49.200]   And then the question really is what are your ideas?
[03:50:49.200 --> 03:50:51.040]   What do you want to leave behind?
[03:50:51.040 --> 03:50:54.480]   And so if it's a park, then you endow the park, right?
[03:50:54.480 --> 03:50:56.960]   If it's free education, you endow that.
[03:50:56.960 --> 03:51:01.960]   If it's some other ethical idea, right?
[03:51:01.960 --> 03:51:06.080]   - Does it make you sad that there's something
[03:51:06.080 --> 03:51:11.080]   that you've endowed some very powerful idea
[03:51:11.080 --> 03:51:14.200]   of digital energy that you put out into the,
[03:51:14.200 --> 03:51:19.080]   you help put it into the world and your mind,
[03:51:19.080 --> 03:51:22.440]   your conscious mind will no longer be there
[03:51:22.440 --> 03:51:25.360]   to experience it.
[03:51:25.360 --> 03:51:27.280]   It's just gone forever.
[03:51:27.280 --> 03:51:31.960]   - I rather think that the thing that Satoshi taught us
[03:51:31.960 --> 03:51:36.160]   is you should do your part during some phase of the journey
[03:51:36.160 --> 03:51:37.760]   and then you should get out of the way.
[03:51:37.760 --> 03:51:39.080]   (laughing)
[03:51:39.080 --> 03:51:43.120]   And I think Steve Jobs said something similar
[03:51:43.120 --> 03:51:46.880]   to that effect in a very, very famous speech one day,
[03:51:46.880 --> 03:51:49.960]   which is, you know, death is a natural part of life
[03:51:49.960 --> 03:51:52.280]   and it makes way for the next generation.
[03:51:52.280 --> 03:51:57.800]   And I think the goal is you upgrade the world, right?
[03:51:57.800 --> 03:52:00.440]   You leave it a better place, but you get out of the way.
[03:52:00.440 --> 03:52:05.440]   And I think when that breaks down,
[03:52:05.440 --> 03:52:09.200]   you know, bad things happen.
[03:52:09.200 --> 03:52:12.040]   I think nature cleanses itself.
[03:52:12.040 --> 03:52:13.520]   There's a cycle of life.
[03:52:13.520 --> 03:52:17.400]   - And speaking of one of great people
[03:52:17.400 --> 03:52:19.880]   who did also get out of the way is George Washington.
[03:52:19.880 --> 03:52:21.800]   So hopefully when you get out of the way,
[03:52:21.800 --> 03:52:26.800]   nobody's bleeding you to death in hope of helping you.
[03:52:26.800 --> 03:52:32.600]   What do you think, to do a bit of a callback,
[03:52:32.600 --> 03:52:34.920]   what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?
[03:52:34.920 --> 03:52:36.280]   What's the meaning of life?
[03:52:36.280 --> 03:52:37.440]   Why are we here?
[03:52:37.440 --> 03:52:40.040]   We talked about the rise of human civilization.
[03:52:40.040 --> 03:52:42.320]   It seems like we're engineers at heart.
[03:52:42.320 --> 03:52:43.780]   We build cool stuff.
[03:52:43.780 --> 03:52:47.120]   Better and better use of energy,
[03:52:47.120 --> 03:52:49.680]   channeling energy to be productive.
[03:52:49.680 --> 03:52:50.960]   Why?
[03:52:50.960 --> 03:52:52.320]   What's it all for?
[03:52:52.320 --> 03:52:57.040]   - You're getting metaphysical on me.
[03:52:57.040 --> 03:52:59.360]   - Very, there's a beautiful boat to the left of us.
[03:52:59.360 --> 03:53:00.560]   Like, why do we do that?
[03:53:00.560 --> 03:53:04.000]   This boat that sailed the ocean.
[03:53:04.000 --> 03:53:06.000]   Then we build models of it to celebrate
[03:53:06.000 --> 03:53:08.560]   great engineering of the past.
[03:53:08.560 --> 03:53:11.000]   - To engineer is divine.
[03:53:11.000 --> 03:53:14.360]   You can make lots of arguments as to why we're here.
[03:53:14.360 --> 03:53:16.480]   We're either here to entertain ourself
[03:53:16.480 --> 03:53:19.340]   or we're here to create something.
[03:53:19.740 --> 03:53:22.340]   That's beautiful or something that's functional.
[03:53:22.340 --> 03:53:23.380]   I think if you're an engineer,
[03:53:23.380 --> 03:53:25.340]   you entertain yourself by creating something
[03:53:25.340 --> 03:53:27.600]   that's both beautiful and functional.
[03:53:27.600 --> 03:53:29.340]   So I think all three of those things,
[03:53:29.340 --> 03:53:32.040]   it's entertaining, but it's ethical.
[03:53:32.040 --> 03:53:35.260]   You know, you got to admire, you know,
[03:53:35.260 --> 03:53:38.260]   the first person that built a bridge,
[03:53:38.260 --> 03:53:41.300]   crossing a chasm or the first person
[03:53:41.300 --> 03:53:42.780]   to work out the problem of how to get
[03:53:42.780 --> 03:53:44.460]   running water to a village.
[03:53:44.460 --> 03:53:47.480]   On the first person to figure it out,
[03:53:47.480 --> 03:53:50.540]   how to, you know, dam up a river.
[03:53:50.540 --> 03:53:54.300]   Or mastered agriculture.
[03:53:54.300 --> 03:53:55.740]   The guy that figured out, you know,
[03:53:55.740 --> 03:53:58.420]   how to grow fruit on trees or created orchards,
[03:53:58.420 --> 03:54:00.980]   you know, and maybe one day had like 10 fruit trees.
[03:54:00.980 --> 03:54:02.680]   He's pretty proud of himself.
[03:54:02.680 --> 03:54:05.700]   - So that's functional.
[03:54:05.700 --> 03:54:07.340]   There is also something to that,
[03:54:07.340 --> 03:54:10.020]   just like you said, that's just beautiful.
[03:54:10.020 --> 03:54:12.180]   It does get you closer to,
[03:54:12.180 --> 03:54:15.580]   like you said, the divine.
[03:54:15.580 --> 03:54:20.560]   Something, when you step back
[03:54:20.560 --> 03:54:22.880]   and look at the entirety of it,
[03:54:22.880 --> 03:54:27.880]   a collective of humans using a beautiful invention
[03:54:27.880 --> 03:54:32.920]   or creation or just something about this instrument
[03:54:32.920 --> 03:54:36.760]   is creating a beautiful piece of music.
[03:54:36.760 --> 03:54:40.220]   That seems just right.
[03:54:40.220 --> 03:54:41.680]   That's what we're here for.
[03:54:41.680 --> 03:54:44.920]   Whatever the divine is, it seems like we're here for that.
[03:54:44.920 --> 03:54:46.540]   And I, of course, love talking to you
[03:54:46.540 --> 03:54:48.880]   because from the engineering perspective,
[03:54:48.880 --> 03:54:50.920]   the functional is ultimately the mechanism
[03:54:50.920 --> 03:54:51.920]   towards the beauty.
[03:54:51.920 --> 03:54:56.140]   - Isn't there something beautiful about
[03:54:56.140 --> 03:54:59.180]   making the world a better place for people that you love?
[03:54:59.180 --> 03:55:02.100]   Your friends, your family, or yourself?
[03:55:02.100 --> 03:55:08.860]   You know, when you think about the entire arc
[03:55:08.860 --> 03:55:13.360]   of human existence and you roll the clock back
[03:55:13.360 --> 03:55:16.800]   500,000 years and you think about every struggle
[03:55:16.800 --> 03:55:18.880]   of everyone that came before us
[03:55:18.880 --> 03:55:20.840]   and everything they had to overcome
[03:55:20.840 --> 03:55:22.980]   in order to put you here right now,
[03:55:22.980 --> 03:55:28.120]   you know, you kind of, you got to admire that, right?
[03:55:28.120 --> 03:55:30.160]   You got to respect that.
[03:55:30.160 --> 03:55:32.040]   - That's a heck of a gift they gave us.
[03:55:32.040 --> 03:55:35.380]   It's also a heck of a responsibility.
[03:55:35.380 --> 03:55:37.400]   Don't screw it up.
[03:55:37.400 --> 03:55:41.600]   - If I dropped you 500,000 years ago
[03:55:41.600 --> 03:55:44.320]   and I said, figure out steel refining,
[03:55:44.320 --> 03:55:49.320]   or, you know, figure out silicon chips, fabric production,
[03:55:49.320 --> 03:55:52.440]   or whatever it is.
[03:55:52.440 --> 03:55:54.600]   - Fly or fire.
[03:55:54.600 --> 03:55:56.000]   - And so now we're here.
[03:55:56.000 --> 03:55:58.200]   And I guess the way you repay them is
[03:55:58.200 --> 03:56:01.560]   you fix everything in front of your face you can, right?
[03:56:01.560 --> 03:56:05.440]   And that means to someone like Elon,
[03:56:05.440 --> 03:56:08.900]   it means get us off the planet, right?
[03:56:08.900 --> 03:56:11.540]   To someone like me, it's like, I think,
[03:56:11.540 --> 03:56:14.900]   you know, fix the energy in the system.
[03:56:14.900 --> 03:56:16.100]   - And that gives me hope.
[03:56:16.100 --> 03:56:18.060]   Michael, this was an incredible conversation.
[03:56:18.060 --> 03:56:19.260]   You're an incredible human.
[03:56:19.260 --> 03:56:21.860]   It's a huge honor you would sit down with me.
[03:56:21.860 --> 03:56:23.860]   Thank you so much for talking to me.
[03:56:23.860 --> 03:56:26.020]   - Yeah, thanks for having me, Lex.
[03:56:26.020 --> 03:56:27.540]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:56:27.540 --> 03:56:28.880]   with Michael Saylor.

[03:56:35.460 --> 03:56:37.420]   from Francis Bacon.
[03:56:37.420 --> 03:56:41.940]   Money is a great servant, but a bad master.
[03:56:41.940 --> 03:56:45.840]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[03:56:45.840 --> 03:56:48.420]   (upbeat music)
[03:56:48.420 --> 03:56:51.000]   (upbeat music)
