[00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.620]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, part one of a three-part series.
[00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.820]   Today, financial lessons learned from Ukraine.
[00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:53.980]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.260]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.660]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.660]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.900]   My name is Josh Raschitz, and today we're going to talk about financial lessons learned
[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.900]   from Ukraine.
[00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.260]   Our TV screens, our mobile screens have been filled with lessons, and I want to categorize
[00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.540]   them and archive them and get them into your and my head, so at least we can gain some
[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.260]   good from the suffering of our fellow humans.
[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:31.940]   One of the most important things about when bad things happen is learning from them, because
[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.980]   so frequently things happen and they're awful, but at least if you can gain some lessons
[00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.260]   from your own suffering and from the suffering of others, then we can minimize human suffering
[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.260]   in the future.
[00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.220]   So let's do that today by talking about Ukraine.
[00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.340]   Before we begin, though, today's podcast is brought to you by BitcoinPrivacyCourse.com.
[00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:59.660]   This is a brand new course that my friend Gabriel Custodiat and I have developed, which
[00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.860]   basically seeks to answer this question, the question of the dream of Bitcoin.
[00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.660]   Listen, if you were cut off from your money, if banks were collapsed, if everything stopped
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.820]   and you were totally cut off, could you still gain access to spending power?
[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.820]   If you had to flee your country because of war and run away with nothing but the clothes
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:25.940]   on your back, could you go into a foreign country, sit down at a computer and with nothing
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.340]   more than a simple passphrase stored in your head, access your life savings?
[00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.980]   This is one of the goals that we have for Bitcoin, but in the modern world, even though
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.820]   the market has developed, it's actually harder to achieve this goal than previously thought.
[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.700]   So at BitcoinPrivacyCourse.com, we have developed a course teaching you how to anonymously,
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:59.020]   privately and securely buy, own and use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for yourself and
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.780]   for your family.
[00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.260]   That sounds like the kind of thing you're interested in.
[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.540]   Trust me, it is not easy to figure out how to do this.
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.780]   Go to BitcoinPrivacyCourse.com, sign up for the course there, BitcoinPrivacyCourse.com,
[00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.360]   and you'll want to do it as quickly as possible within the next 12 days before the course
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.460]   goes live because the first version is going to feature a live Q&A, so you'll have a chance
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.380]   if you're signed up by then to participate in the live Q&A and make sure that all of
[00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.740]   your specific questions are answered.
[00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.380]   Go to BitcoinPrivacyCourse.com.
[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.060]   We go to Ukraine.
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.780]   In this series, we're going to have part one is financial lessons from Ukraine, part two
[00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.700]   is going to be lessons from Russia, part three is going to be lessons in the United States.
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.640]   What you'll observe as we build is you'll observe the increasing financialization of
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.640]   my advice.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.860]   I'm titling this "Financial Lessons from Ukraine."
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.560]   These are financial lessons, but what you'll notice as I go through these is how non-financial
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.680]   markety they are.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.160]   We're not going to talk about stocks, bonds, even insurance policies because what you see
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.280]   is there are things that can happen that cause all of the financial stuff to basically disappear
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.280]   in importance.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.520]   Let's begin with lesson one.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.800]   When your life is threatened, your physical security is threatened, everything else disappears
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.800]   in importance.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.420]   Here, I always think of the classic Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.360]   At the bottom of the pyramid, those fundamental foundational needs, we have physical needs,
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.360]   the needs of your body.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.440]   Then we have safety needs.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.520]   Then we build up to love and belonging and esteem and self-actualization.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.520]   What happens is most of us spend most of our time thinking about the fact that we want
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.200]   to self-actualize.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.560]   How can I express myself more fully in my career?
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.240]   This particular job doesn't bring me pleasure.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.600]   How can I become financially independent so I can experience what it truly means to be
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.240]   an independent and self-directed person?
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.360]   Hey, that's important.
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.880]   I'm all for it.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:14.160]   But what happens is we take for granted the fact that all of our basic needs are met by
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.280]   a functional society.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.200]   And because of our recent experience, for most of us, we think that a functional society
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.760]   is the normal way that life is experienced.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.560]   That's actually not really true.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.520]   Throughout virtually all of human history, uncertainty about those basic level needs
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.120]   has been the key feature of life.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.040]   Uncertainty about what am I going to eat tomorrow or today?
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.520]   Will I be cold tonight?
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.520]   Will my neighbor come and try to steal from me?
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.720]   Will a neighboring village try to invade our village and take our stuff and steal our women
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.880]   and kill us all?
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.040]   That's the normal feature of life.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:05.160]   That's the normal way that life has been experienced by virtually all of our fellow humans through
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:11.360]   virtually all of human civilization, or I should say human existence.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.360]   So civilization is actually a gift.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.400]   It's an accomplishment.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.680]   And we need to stop and ask ourselves, how did that happen?
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.680]   How did we build civilization?
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.840]   How did we build a civilized world where so many of us give virtually no thought to what
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.400]   we're going to eat, what we're going to drink, how we're going to afford it, etc.?
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.180]   How does that happen?
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.200]   Because that's the aberration in human history.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.680]   Now it's my hope and prayer that in the fullness of time it will not be the aberration, that
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.680]   will become the norm.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.480]   But we're in a transition point.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.400]   We're in a transition point in human history.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:52.320]   And at this time it's important that we stop and recognize that when your life is threatened,
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.740]   everything else disappears in importance.
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:02.560]   So we need to actually think carefully about security, both the security of our bodies,
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:09.160]   not to be impaled from above by a bomb or hit by a piece of shrapnel or shot by some
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:15.200]   dude with a gun, and then also the greater extension of that, our security of our basic
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.200]   needs.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.560]   We need to make plans for those things.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:24.360]   This is, I think, one of the interesting differentiating factors of radical personal finance, is that
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.260]   I always saw as a financial planner, professional financial planner, I always saw the usefulness
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.440]   of modern financial instruments in most circumstances.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.640]   But I always felt that fundamentally at its core, financial planning should encompass
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.580]   these basic needs.
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:47.300]   And because of the specialization of labor and the economies that most of us live in,
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.820]   we don't think much about those things.
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.500]   And yet they're fundamentally part of it.
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.980]   When we think financial planning, we fundamentally at its core, always consider the things that
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.860]   the financial industry can sell a product to.
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.780]   That's what we're trained and conditioned to believe is the most important.
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.820]   We're fundamentally trained and conditioned to believe that financial planning means having
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:10.980]   a budget, life insurance, making sure we put money in our retirement account, et cetera.
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:11.980]   And that's good.
[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:12.980]   That's well and good.
[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.860]   We're never going to get, nor should financial planners be necessarily comprehensive.
[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.580]   But for you and me, I want us to think about financial planning beyond that.
[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:25.660]   I always think about the fact that my physical health is what allows me to make money.
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:30.020]   And yes, I want to have disability insurance, but I also want to focus on my physical health.
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:34.180]   Because while I appreciate the fact, the miracle of the modern financial world that I can buy
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:39.540]   a life insurance policy for a few shekels per month, and then wind up that in the fullness
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:44.460]   of time, my family is cared for if I'm dead, I have a greater interest in actually not
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.500]   being dead in the first place.
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:52.040]   And so my financial planning needs to include taking care of my physical health.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.700]   My financial planning needs to take care, make sure that it includes taking care of
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.860]   my physical security.
[00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:03.380]   And what happens is when you come back to an acute circumstance, that it becomes obvious.
[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:10.580]   In the same way that when a guy gets diagnosed with cancer, he'll spend every dollar of his
[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.420]   savings to try to get free of cancer.
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:17.740]   Or a guy has a heart attack, he'll quickly recognize, "Man, I got to get this cared for."
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:24.620]   And all of a sudden, the $200 or the $1,000 a month nutrition coach and personal trainer,
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.140]   et cetera, all of a sudden now it feels like a steal of a deal.
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.820]   Whereas before it felt like, "Oh, I got to be frugal.
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.500]   I don't want to spend the money on that."
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:36.940]   Well, in the same way that that applies in more ordinary circumstances, things like war
[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:41.020]   come in, and that lesson is magnified times 10.
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:45.140]   When your life is threatened, everything else disappears in importance.
[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:53.140]   So always make sure that your financial planning doesn't ignore those basic things.
[00:09:53.140 --> 00:10:02.500]   Financial planning in an intensely financialized manner with financial instruments is good,
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:06.020]   but it needs to be built on a strong foundation.
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.140]   And again, you'll hear that emphasis expanded.
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:12.780]   Ukraine is the tip of the spear right now, quite literally.
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:21.660]   And our friends in Ukraine are facing a complete obliteration of all the normal stuff.
[00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:29.780]   And you see how in these most desperate of circumstances, it goes back to those fundamentals.
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.940]   Number two, war is hell.
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.940]   War is absolute hell.
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.500]   And I know that sounds like, "Obviously," but I mean it.
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.500]   Like war is awful.
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.460]   I think it's important that we recognize this.
[00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.420]   It's important that we teach our children this.
[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:48.740]   I remember when I was a young boy, you think about war, you hear about war, and it sounds
[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.620]   exciting I guess to boys.
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:58.860]   That's why they let young boys, teenagers, 18-year-old, 20-year-old men sign up and fight
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:10:59.860]   war.
[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.500]   They're the ones who fight most wars.
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.540]   Sounds exciting.
[00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.300]   The reality of war is hell.
[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.780]   It is absolute hell.
[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:09.900]   And to expand that, you cannot...
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.220]   Let me say it in this order.
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:15.940]   First, you definitely cannot thrive in war.
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:19.140]   And you can't survive in war.
[00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.780]   War is not really survivable.
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:24.540]   Now I understand you say, "Yes, well if you make it through, you make it through, yeah,
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.380]   and you physically survive."
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:30.260]   But what happens is even that, even the very best case, right?
[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:35.580]   You're living in a city where it is under war, under siege from an invading army.
[00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:41.460]   In the very best case, this is going to be a nightmare that will haunt you the rest of
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:42.820]   your life.
[00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:50.560]   Even if you can physically maintain your breath and your beating heart, physically alive,
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.940]   this is a nightmare that will haunt you the rest of your life.
[00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:58.820]   You'll have trouble sleeping because you worry about, "Is a bomb going to come in and obliterate
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.460]   my house?"
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:01.700]   You have trouble trusting.
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.340]   You have trouble thinking long-term.
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:10.060]   When you go through war and you experience the trauma of wondering if today my life ends,
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:14.620]   when you experience the trauma of killing somebody, even if you're fully justified in
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:19.260]   the defense of your home, this destroys your life.
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:24.460]   And it takes your capacity as a human being, which was very high, and it brings it down
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:29.500]   to something significantly less than what it was.
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.420]   War is not really survivable.
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:38.180]   You certainly are not going to thrive.
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.260]   Thriving means that you're going to make progress on long-term goals.
[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:49.260]   But what you see when war comes is that immediately everything shortens up to today, to literally
[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.300]   today.
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.540]   You're not thinking about, "What am I going to do when I retire?"
[00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.340]   You're not thinking about, "What are we going to do for vacation next year?"
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:58.900]   You're not thinking about, "How can I expand my business and improve my profits over the
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:12:59.900]   next quarter?"
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:03.460]   You're wondering, "Can I survive today?"
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:08.180]   And what happens is this takes an intense toll on a man.
[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:10.420]   This hurts you.
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:13.980]   You start to make very short-term decisions.
[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:17.820]   You start to think about today because it's all you have.
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:21.540]   We always see this in the classics of war movies.
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:27.700]   "Okay, well, I quit smoking, but give me the pack of cigarettes because I need that release
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.100]   today."
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:33.980]   Very passionate love affairs, stupid decisions that people make because life is reduced to
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.940]   the here, to the now.
[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:41.380]   This is really bad for your long-term success because one of the success markers for those
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:47.540]   who build empires and legacies is always the ability to think long-term.
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:53.500]   People who go through war get scarred and they lose a significant part of their long-term
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.940]   thinking and planning capacity.
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:04.140]   If at all possible, always avoid war.
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:11.420]   You cannot thrive and you cannot really even survive in war.
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:18.420]   Now the number three lesson is this, prepping works, sort of.
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:22.780]   And here I mean the traditional sense of prepping.
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:29.180]   When you look at prepping, just like financial planning has its blinders, I love the world
[00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:34.980]   of preparedness, prepping, survivalism, but it also has its blinders.
[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:40.660]   But there are some senses in which prepping in the traditional sense works.
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:44.780]   Here's what has worked thus far.
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:50.140]   Having a plan to get out from where you are, and especially to get out of the cities to
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:56.100]   a safer, more rural destination, that has been unbelievably important.
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:06.140]   I think you see here that while we usually lean on cities as a fundamental part of our
[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.500]   careers, our family life, et cetera, right?
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:12.580]   You see the growth all over the world of mega cities and everyone moving from the country
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:13.760]   to the city.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:18.340]   You see also how cities are basically unsurvivable in difficult times.
[00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.140]   And again, war is a perfect example.
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:21.140]   Why?
[00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.140]   Well, number one, they're targeted.
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.580]   You see, what is the Russian army targeting?
[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.080]   They're targeting the cities.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:31.420]   They're targeting the places where the people are, where the infrastructure is.
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:32.860]   And they're obliterating it.
[00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:37.900]   You get a much more bang for your buck in terms of the effectiveness of your munitions
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:42.540]   and your gunpowder if you target them to cities where they can destroy massive amounts of
[00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:46.380]   infrastructure versus out in the country.
[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.820]   And in addition to that, that's where the people are.
[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:55.420]   If you had a little country retreat in Ukraine and you could get out of the city, you're
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.700]   in a much better situation today.
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.740]   Your family, if you could get your family out, even if you need to come back and fight
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:05.220]   in the city because that's where the soldiers are, if you can get your family out to the
[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:08.820]   city, they're in a much better situation.
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:12.900]   In addition, modern cities are just not survivable if the infrastructure goes down.
[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:17.040]   And what do invading armies tackle?
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.780]   Either on a physical attack or a cyber attack, they tackle infrastructure.
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:26.940]   If you have a flat on the 10th floor of an apartment in downtown Kiev and your electricity
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:32.180]   goes out and your municipal water supply goes out, your apartment quickly becomes a health
[00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:33.220]   nightmare.
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:37.380]   You may be able to stay there for a few days, but you're not going to make it being there
[00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:39.620]   week after week.
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:44.760]   Your apartment will become a disease infested hell hole.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.620]   And so you need to have a plan.
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:49.720]   If you live in a city, you need to have a plan to get out of the city.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:55.820]   And so that should be a fundamental part of your preparations.
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:59.860]   At the very least, think about where you could go and how you could get there.
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.700]   Maybe you have a country cousin you could go and see, a relative.
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.620]   Maybe you have a little piece of land that you put a camper on.
[00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:08.780]   Maybe you have a little vacation house out by the lake.
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:14.260]   But what you see is that almost any vacation house, lake house, little rural retreat is
[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.140]   a better place to be than in a city.
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.680]   What about a stockpiling of supplies?
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:24.740]   Having a plan to have supplies stockpiled is extremely important.
[00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:29.980]   And you see the impact of it right now in the Ukrainian situation.
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:34.900]   Now the amazing thing is to see that it seems that many of the Ukrainian systems are still
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:35.900]   working.
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.100]   Stores still have food.
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:42.460]   I've seen interesting videos of people going around showing the shelves in the supermarket
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:46.660]   and you hear shells going off and being dropped outside and yet you see that hey, the supermarket
[00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.300]   still has provisions.
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:50.340]   It's wonderful.
[00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:56.660]   But I think you see that the stockpiling of provisions is a really, really important deal.
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:01.140]   Making sure that you have supplies of food, supplies of medicine, medical equipment is
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.820]   a big, big deal.
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:06.100]   So preparedness has worked and is working.
[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:12.380]   And those who are well prepared in Ukraine are going to be able to protect those that
[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:13.380]   are closest to them.
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:19.620]   They're going to be able to help their fellow citizens to rebuild, et cetera.
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:25.220]   I think I even extend this to the military aspects.
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.780]   I've always enjoyed the gun thing.
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:29.780]   I enjoy shooting.
[00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:30.860]   I always have.
[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:37.540]   But I've often wondered, is it really worth it to prep for military invasion?
[00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:43.700]   And it just seems so far-fetched to me that it's just not been that big of a factor.
[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:49.000]   But when you watch in Ukraine, you watch them handing out AK-47s on the street to whoever
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.860]   will come, and you think about all the second-order effects of that, you all of a sudden realize,
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:58.260]   yeah, those martial preparations are really valuable.
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.940]   And so recognize that prepping works.
[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:05.260]   But I think the bigger plan is next, number four.
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:09.420]   Having a plan to get out of the country entirely is still the best possible thing that you
[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:10.420]   could do.
[00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:15.060]   In my course that I first started teaching a couple of years ago, which by the way, it's
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:18.780]   not been on the market for the last year, I'm revising it and splitting it out.
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:22.620]   But in that course called How to Survive and Thrive During the Coming Economic Crisis,
[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:28.060]   what I did was I talked about basically the two aspects of how to survive and thrive during
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.900]   the coming economic crisis.
[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:34.340]   Part number one is what I just talked about, what we call preparedness.
[00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:40.700]   And basically, preparedness involves stockpiling supplies, making preparations to do without
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.700]   systems of support, infrastructure.
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:46.660]   It's everything from having a couple of solar panels so that you can have some electric
[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:51.700]   light in your house if the grid power goes down, having water, water purifier so that
[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:57.620]   if the grid water goes down, you can have access to clean drinking water for your family
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:58.620]   and water for sanitation.
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:01.040]   It means having supplies.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.900]   But then the second part of the course has all been about getting out, getting out of
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:07.660]   the disaster zone.
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:12.100]   I have for years, I've watched, you go on YouTube and you watch people do tours of their
[00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.100]   bug out bag.
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.220]   And you know what I almost never see in those bags?
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:20.760]   It's these things, passport and a credit card.
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.980]   To me, that's number one, passport and a credit card.
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:28.620]   Give me a passport and a credit card and I'm going to the airport and I'm out of here.
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:34.420]   Because the best way to do well in a crisis is not to be in that crisis place at all.
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:37.940]   I want you to think about those things that I articulated a little bit earlier about the
[00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:40.600]   damaging effects of war.
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:48.080]   Imagine how destructive it is to you, to your family, to watch, to be involved in war.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:55.560]   Even if you personally escape with your life still technically going, the psychological
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:00.520]   destruction and trauma that you experience being in a war zone will haunt you for the
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.720]   rest of your life.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.200]   Now imagine that you can avoid that.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.120]   Imagine you can protect your children from that.
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:12.520]   Imagine you can get your family members out of that.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:19.040]   It's infinitely better to be in that situation than to experience that trauma for the rest
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.080]   of your life.
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:28.000]   Now I think one of the things that's so fascinating about the Ukrainian situation is you see such
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:37.900]   a clear and obvious example of a war defense that is actually morally justified.
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:42.820]   The majority of the wars that my own nation has been involved in over the years have been
[00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:47.640]   very difficult to justify ethically and morally.
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:54.560]   But it is absolutely justified ethically and morally for you to defend your own home, for
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:22:00.480]   you to defend your own village from invading attackers who are coming in and destroying
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:05.540]   and stealing and killing and raping and looting.
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.300]   That is absolutely morally justifiable.
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:12.200]   So here's what's amazing to me to look at and to think about.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:18.980]   Even in that situation, the most morally justified war effort, defense of your own village, your
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:27.100]   own home, is it better to be there and fight it out or is it better to not be there?
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:34.580]   And I think that although when I was 20 I would have said, "Fight it out," today at
[00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:40.500]   20 plus a decade and a half, I look at it and I say, "I'm not doing it.
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.980]   I'm not doing it."
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:49.140]   Now on the one hand, that can be seen as a point of cowardice, right?
[00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.140]   And I've asked myself even thoroughly, searched, like, "Okay, Joshua, you're a coward.
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:53.980]   Are you scared to do it?"
[00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:57.660]   I just look at it and say, "What is it for?
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.860]   What is it worth?"
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:01.980]   Right?
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:06.740]   If my children grow up as orphans, why did they grow up as orphans?
[00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:07.980]   What was the benefit of that?
[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:12.620]   If my wife is widowed because I'm killed, what is the benefit?
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:16.160]   If I had the choice to get out of the way.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:20.380]   So why not start with what is better, which is to make sure that my children don't grow
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:28.500]   up fatherless, to make sure that my wife is not widowed, and make a plan to leave.
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:34.980]   Having a plan to get out of a region that's under severe effect is the very best plan
[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:35.980]   possible.
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:39.420]   It's the best thing that you can possibly do.
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:44.020]   You must have a plan to get out, to escape your country.
[00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.940]   Coming up soon.

[00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:07.500]   Marketing speak got all mixed up there.
[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.540]   You need an international escape plan.
[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:13.780]   You need a plan to get out of a war zone.
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:16.940]   You can always come back if you decide that's the right thing to do.
[00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:23.980]   But you see these heartbreaking videos of men putting their wives and children on a
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:24.980]   bus.
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:28.340]   You've got to have a plan to get out.
[00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:32.700]   And that's what my newest course, which should be live in hopefully just a very couple of
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:35.820]   days, will teach you how to do.
[00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:38.500]   Simple, straightforward, actionable, totally doable.
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.620]   More about that coming soon.
[00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:47.020]   Having a plan to get out of your country entirely is the best possible thing you could do.
[00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:53.860]   Even if you yourself choose later to go and fight, that's fine.
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:25:01.380]   But you'll be in a much better situation doing that from a place of strength, knowing your
[00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:08.340]   family at least is safe and secure, minimizing the trauma that your family faces, knowing
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:13.340]   at least that your grandparents are perhaps out of danger.
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:17.020]   Then you can go in yourself and fight.
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:19.060]   But you've got to have a plan to get out.
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:25.300]   You see so clearly right now in the Ukrainian situation that every Ukrainian family that
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:32.260]   has gotten out of Ukraine is not facing those same horrific situations that those who are
[00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.380]   still in Ukraine are facing.
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:41.260]   And it's indescribably better for your long-term success, for the long-term thriving of your
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:48.560]   family, for the long-term strength of your community for you to be out.
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:52.740]   Lesson number five, pay attention to the warning signs.
[00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:57.080]   Leave early when leaving is easy.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:01.620]   Leave early when leaving is easy.
[00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:06.940]   I had a regular listener of Radical Personal Finance know that in several previous Q&A
[00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:13.860]   episodes over the last couple of months, I've had a Ukrainian listener who called and inquired
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:20.780]   my opinion on whether or not his parents who were living in Ukraine should leave.
[00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:24.940]   And I gave the advice, "Yes, they should leave."
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:30.820]   I said, "If you are at all concerned that there is any reasonable threat that the Russian
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:34.340]   army next door might invade, you should leave.
[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:39.620]   Because number one, it's better to be months too early than it is a day too late.
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:44.660]   And number two, as long as the cost of leaving is not too high," right?
[00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:48.100]   In his case, his parents were retired, not trying to run an active business, not trying
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:50.660]   to keep a job, had a place to go.
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:54.820]   They could go with their son, had the appropriate visas and such to be able to travel to the
[00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:57.860]   United States where their son was, be welcomed with family.
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:59.300]   I said, "Leave."
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:03.980]   The cost of leaving is very low compared to the potential cost of staying.
[00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:08.260]   But you have to get out early, so you have to pay attention to the warning signs.
[00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:11.940]   Now what's interesting is I gave that advice and then I went back and I started looking
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.980]   at the situation because I hadn't been following it closely.
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:17.060]   And I was like, "Wait a second, maybe they're not going to invade.
[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.780]   Maybe it's overkill.
[00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.940]   They're probably not going to invade.
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:25.860]   And maybe this is just the United States intelligence pumping this up, or maybe it's the Western
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:26.860]   media."
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:29.780]   And I was like, "Yeah, the US intelligence agencies were right.
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:35.060]   Turns out that those that said that Russia was going to invade, they were right."
[00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:38.260]   And so the interesting thing was I wondered, right?
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:39.420]   And many analysts got it wrong.
[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:40.820]   They said, "No, Russia's not going to invade.
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:42.900]   It's just there's no benefit for them."
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:46.140]   But still the simple practical philosophy of get out early, it worked.
[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:51.020]   By the way, if you were wondering, yes, that listener was able to get his parents out.
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.020]   They did leave.
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:53.100]   They left early enough.
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.180]   They went to the United States and they were safely there.
[00:27:55.180 --> 00:28:00.260]   Unfortunately, faced some other compounding difficulties, very serious medical conditions
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.260]   emerged.
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:04.980]   But they were at least able to get out of Ukraine.
[00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:12.060]   And I think the next aspect of that is when Ukraine imposed restrictions on who could
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.380]   leave.
[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:18.500]   What happened is the Ukrainian government, once the invasion happened, they passed a
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:25.100]   law or a policy that said that no male of fighting age was allowed to leave the country.
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:29.620]   Basically no male from say 18 to 50 something was allowed to leave the country.
[00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:33.620]   And then the neighboring countries enforced that.
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:39.420]   So the Polish immigration authorities were not letting any males of fighting age into
[00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:40.900]   the country.
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.300]   And I think this is a classic example.
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.620]   You have to get out before you're conscripted.
[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:50.540]   Now conscription is something that we don't talk much about.
[00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:59.020]   But conscription has been a... because in most places in the modern world military service
[00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:02.300]   is on a volunteer basis.
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:08.580]   And in the places where military service is not on a volunteer basis, such as Singapore
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:13.340]   and Switzerland, they're generally neutral in Brazil.
[00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:15.660]   The risk of going to war is not very significant.
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:22.220]   I guess the most significant exception would be Israel that puts forced military service
[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:30.980]   on all of its citizens and faces significant security threats on a daily basis.
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:34.460]   But conscription has been something that's affected mankind throughout history.
[00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:40.140]   Now again we get into this interesting moral dilemma here with regard to Ukraine.
[00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:45.780]   I think Ukrainian military service and Ukrainian military defense is the most obviously morally
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:49.900]   justified defense in a very long time.
[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:55.900]   When I was younger... well the United States had a military draft in Vietnam.
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:30:01.100]   When I was younger I was not drafted, but my father would have been drafted if he hadn't
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.140]   been serving in the military.
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:04.620]   And I often wondered what would I do.
[00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:09.420]   And I grew up with a significant disdain for draft dodgers.
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:16.140]   You've got this kind of more conservative right-wing sense that I absorbed politically
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.340]   speaking when I was younger.
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:21.740]   And you get this distaste of draft dodgers.
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:27.940]   I remember in presidential elections it was a big thing about well George W. Bush, later
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.660]   President George W. Bush, went and served in a safe place.
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:35.940]   And I knew most of my friends, my dad, most of my parents' friends, they were people who
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:39.020]   were drafted during the Vietnam War.
[00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:47.860]   And after wrestling with it and after getting past the bellicose personality of a young
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:51.180]   man, I came to the point and I said, "You know what?
[00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:54.300]   A draft like this for a war like this, I wouldn't serve."
[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:59.700]   And there was a time in which I thought, "Well, if I were drafted I would be a conscientious
[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:00.700]   objector."
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:04.220]   And I eventually came to the point, I said, "If the United States imposed a draft like
[00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:07.740]   that for a war like Vietnam, I would flee.
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:08.740]   I would leave.
[00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:10.460]   I would be the one who went to Canada."
[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:15.900]   I came to the point where I realized, "Yeah, that was the better place to leave my country."
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.500]   And then this brought the same thing for my children.
[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:19.500]   I started thinking about my children.
[00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:22.260]   And it was one of the things that influenced my own internationalization.
[00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:28.580]   Because I thought, "Would I want my children to be conscripted for an immoral, worthless
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:33.220]   war that claims lives with no redeeming benefit whatsoever?"
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:37.420]   I thought, "No, so I need to build a plan for them so that they're not conscripted."
[00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:40.420]   And so I've thought a lot about conscription over the years.
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:46.220]   And what's interesting about the Ukrainian situation is it's such a different scenario.
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:50.340]   It's such a different scenario than something like the Vietnam War that I thought a lot
[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:53.180]   about.
[00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:54.900]   It's a justified scenario.
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:59.580]   It's a scenario in which you say, "This is our home and we're being invaded.
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.080]   And yes, you're going to be in the local militia.
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:05.260]   You're going to be in the local militia and you're going to defend our home.
[00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:07.300]   And if you don't, you're not a fellow compatriot.
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.260]   You're not a fellow citizen."
[00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:12.460]   And yet even so, I still have a rough time with it.
[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:16.140]   I still have a rough time of thinking, "They're going to conscript me?
[00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:17.500]   They're going to say I can't leave?
[00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.540]   They're going to say I have to fight?"
[00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:28.340]   Now, if it were my hometown, my country invaded, I would probably be very persuaded by that
[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:33.620]   general sense of patriotism, that sense of defending those that I love, that house that
[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:38.540]   I've built, that land that I've cultivated, my neighbors.
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:42.740]   It feels like that proper duty that you have to your neighbors to defend.
[00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:51.640]   But from an outside perspective, not experiencing those emotions of patriotism and fealty to
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:56.420]   my neighbors, you look at it from the outside and it's an astonishing thing.
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:59.700]   You say, "You're going to force me into the army?"
[00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:05.740]   And what we often forget is that in the modern world, conscription has been a standard part.
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:13.540]   I've been reading a story with my children, and it's set back in the 1700s.
[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:19.940]   And in the plot line, it's accepted as a normal feature that you had press gangs.
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:25.540]   Press gangs were literally groups of soldiers that would go along—usually it was soldiers,
[00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:28.360]   it wasn't always, sometimes it was private ships.
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:34.980]   But they would go along in a coastal town and they needed people on their ships.
[00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:39.500]   And so they would go out, they would find young men, boys, who seemed like they could
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:43.140]   serve and they would literally kidnap them and put them on the ship and force them to
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.000]   serve on the ship.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.700]   And so military conscription is a form of kidnapping.
[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:52.420]   I understand that it's a form of kidnapping that might be morally justified, as you can
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:34:02.100]   see in Ukraine, in this situation where you're defending your most literal neighbors.
[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:07.880]   It might be morally justified in that sense, but most of the time it's not.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:14.100]   It's simply a form of kidnapping that the state enacts, and it's something that I don't
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:15.100]   want to be a part of.
[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:20.780]   And so what's interesting is when you watched the bar come down, when you watched the boom
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:26.780]   get lowered, you saw how you needed to be out early.
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:34.220]   Any Ukrainian who was abroad, be it a 20-year-old male of fighting age, has the choice.
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:39.700]   He can go back to Ukraine and he can fight for his neighbors, which would be an honorable
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:46.760]   thing for him to do if that was what he believed he should do, or he can choose not to.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:54.000]   But there are a whole lot of 20-year-old men in Ukraine who no longer have that choice,
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.940]   who didn't get out, who couldn't get out.
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:02.580]   And what's, to me, I think the most frustrating thing about it, and I'm trying to articulate
[00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:07.480]   at the risk of being overly verbose, I'm trying to articulate some of the emotions and the
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.060]   ethics involved in the situation.
[00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:14.720]   But I'm also trying to bring it back to your and my agency as human beings.
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:23.740]   What bothers me the most about the concept of conscription is how needlessly bloody and
[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:26.660]   destructive that usually winds up being.
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:31.360]   I shared a picture on my Twitter feed, which by the way, I've been doing a lot on Twitter.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:35.900]   So go to twitter.com/joshuasheets, make sure that you follow me on Twitter, I try to keep
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.780]   you informed on a lot of issues.
[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:43.220]   But I've been sharing, I shared a picture on Twitter feed of some young, maybe 18, 19-year-old
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:44.720]   boys.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:48.240]   And it's the most disheartening picture you ever see.
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:54.360]   It's kind of the class, it will become a classic picture of what you see at war, young, doe-faced
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.840]   boys getting ready to head off to war.
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:00.840]   But in this situation, they've got no uniforms, just four guys hanging out, and they got a
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:04.580]   gun and basically that's it.
[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:10.900]   And the problem is that these are the kinds of soldiers who are completely decimated in
[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:12.700]   a war effort.
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:16.800]   And it's just a need, it winds up being a needless loss of life.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:22.680]   It winds up being something where they get destroyed by trained, experienced troops.
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:28.260]   And a country or an army will make up in numbers what they lack in training.
[00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:33.280]   But I still don't see how that's of any comfort or any significant comfort to the families
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:36.160]   and the loved ones of those who wind up dying.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:42.920]   And it's my contention that if I'm going to go to war, I'm going to go to war in an intelligent
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:43.920]   way.
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.960]   I don't want to be just part of the meat grinder.
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:47.480]   I don't see any point in that.
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:52.160]   So I want to go to war in a trained way, or I want to go to war on my own terms.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:56.880]   I always saw myself, I remember when I was a boy I read the biography of, I think his
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:00.480]   name was Carlos Hatcock, it was something like, I've forgotten the exact name, but he
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:07.040]   was a Marine sniper in Vietnam and I think he had something like 73 confirmed kills,
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.760]   one of the most decorated snipers.
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:15.160]   And again, this is going back 20 years, more than 20 to 25 years in my memory.
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:18.640]   So if I got that data wrong, please don't hold me to it.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:22.040]   But it was a remarkable story.
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:28.040]   But I guess for me, because I read his biography when I was a boy, I was like, I would be the
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:29.040]   sniper.
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:34.200]   I would be the guy who's committing guerrilla attacks from afar.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:41.160]   And that background I think just makes me so distasteful to the idea of being used as
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:42.160]   cannon fodder, right?
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.080]   That was the classic term, cannon fodder.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:48.960]   Just put them out there and cannon fodder was basically, let's just stuff anything we
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:53.560]   can into the cannon, any kind of shrapnel, glass, things, et cetera, and put it in there
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:54.880]   and they'll take it.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:38:00.640]   And then all the troops are coming across that you see the pictures of the Civil War
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:04.000]   battlefields, line them all up up front and let's just blow into them.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.520]   It doesn't make any sense to me, but that's what you wind up with in the modern era.
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:12.960]   Now those guys who survive, who are very quick-witted and very smart, they will quickly develop
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:17.560]   new tactics, new teams, and they'll develop into battle-hardened veterans who will be
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:21.920]   very effective within a period of weeks or months.
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:30.360]   But as I think about sending my sons into that, even with the most intense sense of
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:37.800]   patriotism and loyalty to defend my neighbors, I don't want my boys being sent untrained
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.240]   into battle in that sense.
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:45.720]   I don't want to have empty places at my dining table and say, "What was it worth?
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.040]   What was it for?"
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.760]   I'm not interested in that.
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.600]   And so what's the solution?
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:54.400]   You got to get out before you're conscripted.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:59.160]   You got to get out before you're kidnapped by your country.
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:05.520]   If you choose to sign up and serve, and you choose to do that, that's an appropriate choice.
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:11.280]   And I think, again, hopefully I'm emphasizing this enough, a very understandable, morally
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:20.440]   correct choice, and a very noble and laudable choice to stand up and defend your neighbors.
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:25.200]   But you got to make sure that's actually your choice, and it's actually your choice coming
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:30.560]   from a place of strength, not coming from a place of blinded emotionalism, getting caught
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:35.280]   up in the sense of, "Yeah, it's us versus them," and going out in a fit of emotion,
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:38.300]   and not getting caught up and being forced into it.
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:41.880]   Make sure it's your choice and you're coming from a place of strength.
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:47.280]   Next lesson, when you leave, you may literally be leaving with the clothes on your back.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.640]   That's it.
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:54.200]   I've watched a number of videos of refugees fleeing Ukraine.
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:57.760]   And it's so amazing in the modern world with YouTubers and et cetera.
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:58.760]   It's just such...
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.240]   We live in an amazing world for access.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:04.680]   And I watched them fleeing, and you may literally be leaving with the clothes on your back.
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:08.320]   And you may be walking away from everything you've built, the business you've built, the
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:12.040]   houses you've bought, the money you've saved, everything.
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:15.400]   And you'll be grateful to get out with the clothes on your back.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:19.320]   And we think often, "Oh, well, I'll just have all my money."
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:20.400]   Everything will work.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:24.760]   And at the end of the day, quite literally when you leave, the money that you have is
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:28.160]   the money that you have in your possession, and that's it.
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:30.200]   Or it's something that you have abroad.
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.600]   We'll talk about this more in the next session.
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:35.860]   We'll talk about Russia, where we'll talk more about the financialization.
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:40.460]   Because the Russians in Russia are not being bombed right now, but they're facing more
[00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:42.440]   financial problems.
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:46.520]   But you see people fleeing from Ukraine, and the money that you have is the money that
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.520]   you have.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.440]   And you might be out with just the clothes on your back.
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.460]   So make a plan.
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.440]   Make a plan for that.
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:58.040]   And again, that's where internationalescapeplan.com is going to come in.
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:40:59.440]   Next lesson is...
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.960]   I guess I beat myself up.
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.560]   I'm going to beat myself to it.
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:06.920]   You must have a plan to get your loved ones and your pets out.
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:08.640]   You need a plan.
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:12.400]   You need a place to go that's far away.
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:17.960]   One of the things that is so amazing to see is the outpouring of support for the Ukrainian
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:18.960]   refugees.
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:23.640]   It just thrills your heart to see the pictures of the Germans at the train station holding
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:24.640]   up a sign.
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.320]   It brings tears to my eyes just thinking about it.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:32.120]   You see the picture of a guy holding a sign and says, "I can take a mother and two children.
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:33.920]   We have beds for a mother and two children.
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:35.280]   Come to my home."
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:44.560]   And it's just such an amazing feeling to see the outpouring of love and care for those
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:49.360]   neighboring countries opening their borders, minimal documentation requirements, giving
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:54.560]   officially refugee status, allowing Ukrainians to stay in the European Union, giving work
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:55.560]   permission.
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:42:02.560]   Poland has absorbed I think something like 2 million refugees and they're giving work
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:07.400]   permission and opening up houses, etc.
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:11.520]   But here's what I think you're going to see.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:14.440]   Massive tension is going to come.
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:21.600]   In the short term, you can open up your house and welcome somebody who would otherwise be
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.120]   homeless.
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:29.720]   But I think most of us understand how difficult it can be to have those same house guests
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:32.720]   day after day, week after week, month after month.
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:41.600]   Similarly, in the short term, a country can pass a law saying that refugees from Ukraine
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:45.600]   – I'm thinking of Poland here – refugees from Ukraine can work.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:51.240]   But I want you to imagine a situation months from now as this conflict drags on and as
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:58.040]   this situation continues to be bad when Poland is still filled with Ukrainian refugees and
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:06.200]   the Polish citizenry that's out of work and stretched and struggling will have a much
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:13.240]   harder time maintaining that same sense of magnanimity and kindness towards the Ukrainian
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:14.960]   refugees.
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:23.760]   The realities of life have a way of blunting the acute emotions of a moment.
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:30.920]   And so you need to have a plan and you need a place to go where you have things established.
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:39.920]   Being a refugee is brutal and even in this very generous outpouring of support, all of
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:46.160]   the refugees who are relying on that outpouring of support are going to find their lives continually
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.760]   very very difficult.
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:54.440]   And so this is where I think it's so important – again, this is why I've been pouring
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:44:01.520]   myself into finishing the course at internationalskateplan.com.
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:06.960]   Next lesson – diversification works.
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:08.480]   Diversification works.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:19.200]   As long as your diversification involves geographic diversification and international diversification.
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:28.040]   We are so blinded frequently by our situation, by our own personal experience, and we think
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:32.400]   "Oh, everything is great, but I'm trying not to go into the Russia stuff."
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:40.000]   But the Russian stock market has been obliterated, literally destroyed, did nothing.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   So you could say "I have the most diversified strategy being in Russia, that I own dozens
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.560]   and dozens and dozens of different companies."
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:54.880]   But if all of your investments were in the Russian stock market, then you got destroyed.
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:58.080]   Your life savings gone, everything gone.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:59.640]   Ukraine, similarly.
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:05.760]   If all of your stuff was in one place, meaning your physical possessions, if all your physical
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:10.760]   possessions were in one place, you may have been very well prepped in your apartment,
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:15.820]   and you've got some food and water and you've got some plastic bags and chemical
[00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:20.120]   treatments so that when your toilet stops working you can dispose of your family's
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:22.060]   waste, etc.
[00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:26.400]   But if your apartment building is one that's leveled in a cluster bomb attack, you're
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:27.400]   done.
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:30.400]   Even if you get out with your life because you were in a bomb shelter, you're done.
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:34.660]   So apply the concept of diversification to every area.
[00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:37.820]   Make sure that your physical supplies are not just in one place.
[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:40.440]   Make sure that you have other options.
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:43.740]   Same things with your money.
[00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:48.880]   One of the things that you have seen so much of over the last days is picture after picture,
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:55.920]   video after video of Ukrainians and Russians standing in front of ATM machines and ATM
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.160]   lines.
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:04.600]   All of the time that you spend standing in front of an ATM waiting in a line is time
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:09.680]   that is being wasted in your attempt to cross borders.
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:13.760]   So if all of your money is not in your country, if all of your assets are not in the country,
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:17.740]   if all of your investments are not in one country, you have other options all around
[00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:18.740]   the world.
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:23.080]   And this is the point about diversification.
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:27.600]   If you were physically present in France right now, if you have assets in the American stock
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:30.960]   exchange, you're not destroyed.
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:35.760]   But if everything is in Ukraine, it's pretty well destroyed.
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:41.460]   Or at least even if it winds up maintaining some semblance of order, even if it's not
[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:48.000]   as destroyed as the Russian markets, you're still not going to be growing.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.600]   You're lucky to walk away with something.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:55.720]   But any Ukrainian that had money in the American stock market, yeah, there may be a decline,
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:47:01.720]   but it's nothing catastrophic like you are experiencing right now in Ukraine.
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:05.600]   Diversification works.
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:07.920]   So pay attention to this stuff.
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:11.500]   When things go sideways, the money that you have is the money that you have.
[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:14.440]   You don't want to be standing in that ATM line if you can avoid it.
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:17.040]   Have a plan for getting money out.
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:21.960]   All your paper money, all your banking institutions in Ukraine, all of that stuff, they're going
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:26.720]   to work, they're going to do their very best to provide the most basic of services.
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:31.840]   But in terms of any kind of reasonable service, reasonable safety, reasonable security, it's
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:37.160]   destroyed for a very long time.
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:38.760]   Study Ukrainian situation.
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:39.760]   Think about what you would do.
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:44.080]   Remember, it's totally fine for you to make different choices than I would.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:51.320]   I was touched, there was that MMA fighter from Arkansas who had the viral video clip
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:54.400]   over the last week talking about the Ukrainian situation.
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:59.400]   He said, "If this war comes to Arkansas, I will die for this piece of ground in Arkansas."
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:06.960]   If that's you and you will die for this piece of ground, be it in Arkansas or in Kiev, fine,
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:10.360]   fair, wonderful.
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:11.760]   Think it through, though.
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:16.320]   Learn from the lessons.
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:22.120]   As I stated at the very opening of this show, one of the worst things that you can do is
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:30.960]   experience suffering yourself and not learn a lesson from it.
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:36.240]   One of the worst things you can do is observe others experiencing suffering and not at the
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:38.760]   very least learn a lesson from it.
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:42.400]   If you have the ability to help, then help.
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.240]   If you have the ability to give, give.
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:48.000]   If you have the ability to support, support.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   But at the very least, learn from the lessons of others because it is your duty to yourself,
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.960]   to your family, to your neighbors.
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:03.920]   It is your duty to be strong and to be prepared.
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:07.560]   Don't think it can't happen here.
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:09.320]   Friend, it is happening here.
[00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:14.760]   Now, we'll make this point quite convincingly in the next episode when we talk about Russia.
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:21.240]   But one of the things that I've struggled with to get people to understand when I teach
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:28.880]   about these things is simply how it does happen here.
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:30.800]   It doesn't just happen to people on the other side of the world.
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:32.760]   It happens here.
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:34.720]   It doesn't just happen 100 years ago.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:37.040]   It's happening now.
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.960]   So prepare accordingly.
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:47.760]   Russia, Ukraine, these are sophisticated, very sophisticated, very cultured, very historic
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:55.800]   civilizations with knowledgeable, connected, intelligent people.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.720]   Take the lessons to heart for yourself.
[00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:01.960]   Remember, as we go, go to bitcoinprivacycourse.com.
[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:11.760]   Sign up to figure out if you had $5,000 of Bitcoin abroad, it solves a lot of problems.
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:15.200]   But you had a few hundred thousand dollars of Bitcoin tucked away abroad, it solves all
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.200]   the problems.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.200]   Bitcoinprivacycourse.com.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.200]   And again, internationalescapeplan.com.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:19.200]   Talk with you soon.
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.200]   Do more together this holiday in a new Chevy.
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:21.200]   Take on more adventure in the strong and capable Chevy Silverado.
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:22.200]   More confidence in the Chevy Equinox.
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:23.200]   Winner of the JD Power Award.
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:33.200]   For initial quality among compact SUVs, two years running.
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:40.200]   And more value in the all new Chevy Trax with an available 11-inch diagonal touchscreen.
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:43.200]   Bring the holidays together in the new Chevy.
