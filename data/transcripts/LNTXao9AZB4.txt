[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960]   Hey, everybody. Hey, everybody. Welcome to another episode of
[00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:07.200]   the all in podcast. We have a new bestie yesti filling in for
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.960]   the Prince of panic attacks. The Queen of quinoa, the Sultan of
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.960]   science can't make it this week. I think after his incredible
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.400]   performance last week, and him trending on Tiktok with his
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.200]   incredible insights over sadly, the the potential famine that
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.240]   could come after this Ukraine war, he decided he would take a
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.240]   week off. I think it's just a little too much attention for
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.000]   him. So we have a bestie yesti today. Yes, the shaman of stocks
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.060]   is with us. He brings the equanimity to equities, you
[00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.640]   know him, he'll bring that namaste to your payday.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.600]   predictions are the anti Galloway. Brad Gerstner. Welcome
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.480]   back to the program. Thanks for having me. Namaste. And also
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.320]   with us, of course, the rain man, man himself. He's bitter
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.240]   on Twitter. He's brawling on calling. He's the Bill of Rights
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.160]   from Pack Heights.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.480]   David Sachs. Boy, you've really outdone yourself today. And the
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.660]   Prince of Palo Alto, the overlord of the Overton window.
[00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.000]   Polly hop it to you.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.280]   J.K.L. Are you the stinker of stonks? Oh, God, relax. You
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.180]   don't leave the comedy to me. All right.
[00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.480]   Let your winners ride. Rain man, David Sachs.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.720]   And instead, we open source it to the fans.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:35.640]   set to the fans and they've just gone crazy love you queen of king it's been a pretty pretty crazy
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.000]   couple of weeks here uh we are not a political show here but obviously when world affairs become
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.800]   acute as they have we cannot ignore uh the war uh that is occurring in ukraine uh we're going
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.600]   to talk a little bit about markets i think we'll start with those uh with brad gerson here uh the
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.720]   sas market and the index uh why don't you walk us through this chart here because everybody's
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:08.680]   wondering what's happening with the markets given the war given interest rate hikes and the repricing
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.400]   of stocks i don't know how you would look at what happened in november december january brad how do
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.880]   you contextualize well certainly a repricing there's certainly a repricing but i i think of
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.320]   it more as normalization okay right chamath was saying it november i was i was on cnbc talking
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.580]   about the fact that when you're doing a lot of things in the market you're doing a lot of things
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.900]   in the market you're doing a lot of things in the market you're doing a lot of things in the market
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.580]   when we got to a post-covered world rates were going to normalize go back to where they were
[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.860]   in january 2020 that was around two percent and the growth multiples would have to come off of
[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:41.540]   this historic red bull high that we were on during most of 2020 and 2021 so we were 30 to 50 percent
[00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.620]   depending upon the index above the five-year average growth multiple pre-covet so that just
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.980]   needed to happen like we should be celebrating in one sense that that happened because that means
[00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.500]   that we overcame a global problem and we're going to have to do something about it and we're going to
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.520]   have to do something about it and we're going to have to do something about it and we're going to
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.340]   pandemic the downside is we couldn't play with artificial money zero percent rates trillions of
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.740]   dollars you know of of of congressional and fed injection in order to prop up valuations
[00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.460]   and when it happened in and of itself that was going to be extraordinarily painful
[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.140]   what i didn't anticipate and what most people didn't anticipate is that on top of that we're
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:24.180]   going to have increasing fears of hyperinflation not just getting back to normal rates and that we
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.420]   were
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.440]   going to have increasing fears of hyperinflation not just getting back to normal rates and that we
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.440]   were going to have increasing fears of hyperinflation not just getting back to normal rates and that we
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.940]   going to find ourselves in the middle of an incredibly devastating war in ukraine
[00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.960]   going to find ourselves in the middle of an incredibly devastating war in ukraine
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.340]   those two things added to the uncertainty the risk premiums
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.360]   those two things added to the uncertainty the risk premiums
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.260]   those two things added to the uncertainty the risk premiums um added to uncertainty around future
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.280]   um added to uncertainty around future
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.940]   um added to uncertainty around future inflation the dot plot exploded higher and
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.960]   inflation the dot plot exploded higher and
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.260]   inflation the dot plot exploded higher and expectations of forward rates went higher
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.280]   expectations of forward rates went higher
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.260]   expectations of forward rates went higher now why the hell does this matter it
[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.280]   now why the hell does this matter it
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.240]   now why the hell does this matter it matters because when you take you know if
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.240]   matters because when you take you know if
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.920]   matters because when you take you know if you're looking at that chart
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.920]   you're looking at that chart
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.000]   you're looking at that chart the five-year average the 10-year was
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   the five-year average the 10-year was
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.680]   the five-year average the 10-year was two and a half percent like we all got
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.680]   two and a half percent like we all got
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.040]   two and a half percent like we all got comfortable
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.040]   comfortable
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.440]   comfortable investing in this period of time the
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.440]   investing in this period of time the
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.000]   investing in this period of time the markets hate uncertainty we had a
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   markets hate uncertainty we had a
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.880]   markets hate uncertainty we had a predictable way for us to estimate where
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.880]   predictable way for us to estimate where
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.480]   predictable way for us to estimate where we thought our wax should be in our
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.500]   we thought our wax should be in our
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.560]   we thought our wax should be in our discounted cash flow models
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.580]   discounted cash flow models
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.520]   discounted cash flow models all of a sudden that was thrown into uh
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.540]   all of a sudden that was thrown into uh
[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.120]   all of a sudden that was thrown into uh thrown into the air oh my god look what
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.140]   thrown into the air oh my god look what
[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.200]   thrown into the air oh my god look what we got going on i can't do that
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.220]   we got going on i can't do that
[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.200]   we got going on i can't do that look at this oh yeah i never compete
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.220]   look at this oh yeah i never compete
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.920]   look at this oh yeah i never compete with babies or animals yeah no chance
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.940]   with babies or animals yeah no chance
[00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.280]   with babies or animals yeah no chance no chance hey this is talita talita
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.300]   no chance hey this is talita talita
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.580]   look at this little look at this little
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.580]   look at this little look at this little
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.740]   look at this little look at this little butterball oh my goodness lord look at
[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.740]   butterball oh my goodness lord look at

[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.820]   those are babies and what you're seeing there is affection from a father and a
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.820]   there is affection from a father and a
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.820]   there is affection from a father and a child look at how cute this little baby
[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.820]   child look at how cute this little baby
[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.940]   child look at how cute this little baby is like well this is taking from my time
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.960]   is like well this is taking from my time

[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.880]   get that baby out of here
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.340]   get that baby out of here ah so cute so brad i guess what
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.360]   ah so cute so brad i guess what
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.180]   ah so cute so brad i guess what everybody wants to know now that we see
[00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.200]   everybody wants to know now that we see
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.260]   everybody wants to know now that we see this repricing occur
[00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.280]   this repricing occur
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.700]   this repricing occur is what do you think is going to happen
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.720]   is what do you think is going to happen
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.020]   is what do you think is going to happen in 2022
[00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.040]   in 2022
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.860]   in 2022 uh and then into 2023 so
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.880]   uh and then into 2023 so
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.940]   uh and then into 2023 so we're now multiples are now below the
[00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.960]   we're now multiples are now below the
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.320]   five-year average for for software we're about at the five-year average for internet we're well
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:09.200]   below the five-year average i said on twitter that the rate path last week became a lot more
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.240]   certain the fed said something last week that i think is still not well reported well understood
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:21.200]   the fed said at the end of the year we're going to have two percent negative real rates
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:29.040]   they said we expect inflation exiting the year to be 4.3 and we expect the tenure to be around 2.3
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:37.840]   the reason the market exploded higher is because under the fed's prior protocol a four percent
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.480]   uh a four percent inflationary rate would mean that rates would have to go to four and a half
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:48.400]   and if you take rates to four and a half then growth multiples need to be about 30
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.840]   below the five-year average okay so
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.080]   as
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.640]   investors whether we're investing in mid-stage venture late stage venture whether we're investing
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:02.960]   in the public markets like we need to know what exit multiples are and it was bad enough that we
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:09.440]   had to bear the drawdown coming off of you know this this red bull high of 2020 and 21
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:15.760]   but if you think we're durably going to an inflation rate of three percent or four percent
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:21.760]   and an interest rate environment of three percent or four percent then you simply have to adjust
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:27.840]   what you're willing to pay for growth assets and so as i look ahead right we don't we don't know
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:33.760]   with certainty the question is what's the distribution of probabilities and you know
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:41.120]   just this morning city goldman sachs raised their exit year their their exit tenure for 2022
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:47.760]   to 2.7 percent and took it as high as three and a half percent for 2023 i think it's gonna this
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.440]   period is going to be marked by a lot of uncertainty around inflation and rates and the way that we're
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.680]   going to be dealing with inflation and rates until we have more clarity and what that means is
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.640]   allocators of capital are going to allocate less to risk assets and they're going to pay less for
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:04.320]   risk assets but you know listen if i look out over the five ten year horizon i don't believe in
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.440]   global stagflation i don't believe that we're in this new hyperinflation environment um but we're
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.760]   going to have to get through this next uh 6 12 18 months and it's going to be filled with a lot of
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.400]   volatility and a lot of uncertainty jamath what rings most true about what brad just said and
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.360]   then what can you add to the prediction for this coming year um well i think it's going to be a lot
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:27.200]   of uncertainty this year i mean i don't know what the prediction for this year is um i i think the
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:34.240]   markets are mostly moving upwards for the short term and then i think volatility is going to come
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:41.760]   back i'm just trying to find good long-term businesses and just kind of close my eyes and
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:48.000]   not have to look at these stock prices every day and as long as i can manage my own psychology i
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.120]   think i'll be fine and i think that's probably the thing that most of us need to be doing
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:56.400]   the interesting thing about brad said is that um the implication of that is that it means that
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:04.080]   late stage venture is pretty badly mispriced and i think you're going to have to knock these things
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:12.160]   back by 50 60 percent i think you saw the first real big movement there um yesterday which was
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:21.200]   the instacart print right we went from a 40 billion dollar valuation uh to i think it was 24. if you look
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.760]   at from february of last year which was really the high for all of us right that's when we all thought
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:31.760]   we could do no wrong you know the comps to uh instacart are off anywhere between 50 and 70
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.640]   percent you know takeaway is off 70 percent uber's down 60 percent doordash was down 55
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:43.120]   so these are some big moves and so you know uh it made sense that instacart had to get kind of
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:50.480]   like reset the problem that it has is that it's now the nth player trying to get public
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:57.680]   into a space with many players who've guzzled up a lot of capital in a low rate environment and so
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.360]   if you think about company building this is why entrepreneurs have to pay attention to this stuff
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:08.000]   you want to get money when money is cheap but the problem is you can't control that timing and so if
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.240]   you can't control your operating margins and your profitability then you're gonna have to go and
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:19.520]   basically pay somebody an enormously high price to get their money and i think that's what setting
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.040]   itself up to have
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:26.240]   happened in a bunch of these markets i think enterprise sas has always claimed long-term
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:32.880]   profitability um the thing is when you look at sort of like the real long-term companies
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.200]   they've built some enormous moats right like if you look at a service now or a sales force
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:43.040]   at the high end and then there's a crop of a couple of companies like palo alto networks
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.720]   who are the next ones coming after who seemed like behemoths in the making
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.960]   but everybody else i think people have to really question like where the long-term
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.400]   profitability going to come from and so if that's true then the late stage private
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:59.200]   sas companies are in trouble similarly in places like delivery where again you've had a bunch of
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:04.560]   comps come out they've been curing in the public markets for years you know uber doordash there's
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.960]   a couple of these behemoths getting built doordash being the most obvious and then there's a bunch of
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.520]   more kind of question mark business models including uber which is not really hanging
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:18.240]   together in the public markets so i think the real question for entrepreneurs is if you have
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.880]   the nth business and the business business is not going to be the same business as the nth business
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:21.440]   and so i think the real question is if you have the nth business and the business business is not going to be the same business as the nth business
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:26.560]   being not the first not the second but you're the seventh or eighth or tenth trying to go public
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:33.840]   and all the seven or eight before you are gas guzzling machines you're going to pay a very heavy
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.800]   price to get public um and i think that that's the reckoning that we're starting to see so i'm really
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:45.440]   interested to see how that plays out you know the instacart valuation could easily be cheap at 24
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:50.800]   but it could just as easily be overpriced by another 10 billion dollars depending on how people think about it
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:55.600]   about who the last buyer of resort is in the public markets sax did uh instacart missed their
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:00.000]   window to go public and then what does this say about the backlog of hundreds of unicorns
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.400]   that the venture community is investing heavily in some of them are probably gonna have to ipo at
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:11.200]   down rounds um i think that's sort of the takeaway explain what that is to uh to neophytes well it
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.360]   just means that they're gonna have to go public at a valuation lower than what the last private
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:20.720]   round was so all these late-stage private investors who assumed that they would always make money in
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.960]   investing in a company in the last private round before went public they they thought that was sort
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:31.760]   of an automatic gain an arbitrage and it's not and there's going to be some disappointment there
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:38.400]   brad's been sharing these charts with me since i guess what december brad um where then the charts
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:44.960]   basically show uh public sas valuations as a multiple of arr and then he's got a similar chart
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:50.640]   for it sort of the internet companies that sort of non-sas internet companies as a function of
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:55.280]   revenue and we've been looking at these charts you know once brad showed these to me again four
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:01.840]   months ago it became so obvious what was going on which is that valuations were reverting back to
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:07.520]   the historical mean if you look at you know during the two-year period during covet the they the
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:12.960]   multiples had risen to some insane level right and because of all the liquidity that had been
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.640]   pumped into the system so as soon as you saw the the charts that way
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.560]   you could just see where things were headed which is back to historical average
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:27.120]   is now we're below those averages um partly because no no no no not really the multiples are
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:32.400]   can i summarize brad's chart because it is extremely elegant and simple for the layman
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:39.280]   to understand so here's the layman's understanding of of brad's uh uh analysis
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:43.760]   technical analysis and and and balance sheet and p l analysis which is accurate
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:50.480]   when rates are zero typically people are willing to pay eight times revenue
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:56.080]   for a company okay so if you're generating 100 million revenue top line revenue you're generating
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.920]   100 million dollars revenue in your reasonably high margin reasonably high growth software
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:06.720]   business that's worth 800 million dollars in the public markets for every 100 basis point increase
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:15.760]   in rates you decrease the valuation between 15 and 20 percent so if you think rates are 2.75
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:20.240]   the price is somewhere between 30 to 40 percent cheaper
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:26.320]   than what it was when rates were at zero so if you go back and you look at every tech crunch article
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.480]   and every bloomberg article and every information article
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:36.800]   and you look at all those headline valuations when rates were at zero we all just said rates are
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:43.040]   going to be somewhere between you know 2.5 to 3 percent at the end of this year at a minimum you
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:49.040]   have to haircut those things by 30 to 40 percent steady state meaning the company is continuing to
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.160]   execute on all of the values that are in the stock market and that's what we're going to do in the next couple of years
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:57.440]   on all cylinders if they have a downtick in their performance then it it increases that discount if
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:02.320]   rates go higher it increases the discount but the basic way to think about this is for every hundred
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:08.800]   basis point increase in rates you got to down take that valuation by 15 to 20 percent and i think
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:13.040]   you know just to be fair i think i don't think there's any daylight between you and sax on this
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:17.760]   what what's actually saying is the 40 percent just giving the numerical rule that that's right i think
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:24.400]   you're right that is the that is the the the correlation and so this idea listen we all get
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:29.120]   paid to find good companies and avoid bad companies that's generally what we get paid to do we're
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:34.080]   decent at it all of a sudden in fact most fundamental investors say hey i'm not a macro
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.360]   expert i don't know where inflation's going i don't know where interest rates going i just find
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:44.480]   good companies we've had a decade or longer where that was okay to do that was easy to do because
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:51.040]   guess what inflation was at two and we had two and a half percent tenure when all of a sudden you
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:56.320]   have massive volatility in that it's not acceptable as an investor just to say well none of this
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:03.520]   matters because it does matter right price matters because what you can exit for is essential to the
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:11.760]   game and there are a lot of people invest in 2013 14 and 15 when when the cost of entry was low and
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.000]   exited when the cost of entry was high
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:21.520]   multiple expansion hides many sins right and now just the opposite is happening in a dramatic and
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:27.120]   historic way in that multiples were higher than they've ever been caused by a global pandemic
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:33.040]   and the exit rate for a lot of those companies right is going to be very painful i think that
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:37.920]   saxe's point about down round ipos i don't think this is the exception david no reddit right i
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:42.560]   think the vast majority of companies that come public in the next 12 months are going out
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.760]   below their last rounds
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:50.480]   valuation yes the reddit rumor was that goldman put a 10 billion dollar price on the cover
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:55.760]   and that you know it effectively been cut in half again these are all rumors so these could
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:00.560]   completely not be true i don't i don't have any knowledge one way or the other uh to five billion
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:05.920]   and that may actually end up being too expensive it just depends on where the market is
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:10.080]   well just so people are clear when investors sophisticated investors make these late stage
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.520]   valuations at very high multiples like they have they do have some
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:18.720]   downside protections in other words they cannot lose more than the money that was put in when this
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:24.160]   thing ipos or they may get kickers of additional shares so maybe now these ipo no no in fairness
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.920]   you're talking about something very important but they're very rarely in these high price
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:32.640]   rounds because most of these high price rounds are in go-go companies where all of those rights
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:38.080]   get stripped away this is why i do think jason what you're actually bringing up is in in the last
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:43.280]   innings of a bull market you have incredibly irresponsible behavior by a bunch of these investors
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.720]   and that's also going to get exposed as well so jason what you're talking about is what's called an
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:52.880]   ipo ratchet yeah which means i'm giving you this money at this price but if you can't ipo at this
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:57.840]   price then you're going to give me an equivalent number of shares that makes me whole right right
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:04.400]   so it's as if i am i am indifferent to what price you ipo at that's extremely dilutive to really one
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:09.040]   really important class of individual which is the employees of the company it's also really
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.800]   dilutive to other investors who've come in before them and so
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.800]   but jason you're probably right to the extent that there were ipo ratchets they'll get triggered
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:21.520]   but i think in many of these go-go companies and you know brad and sax can confirm but i see it
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:25.920]   all those rights get stripped away it's like come in at this crazy price yeah we're not negotiating
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:31.840]   it this is your chance no governance get our get our logo on your fundraising deck for the next
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:36.640]   round and so this is the price of the capital it's been a little bit of sloppy behavior just
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:42.160]   so people understand this if the reddit valuation was 10 billion somebody put in you know 100 million
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:46.240]   in this late stage round if it came out at 5 billion they would get twice as many shares to
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:52.320]   make up for that difference that doesn't exist in the case of reddit jcal you know it was fidelity
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:57.200]   who led that last round so they're going to be price takers at whatever price the company comes
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:01.680]   public what does that mean explain that price takers so you know if they come public at five
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:06.160]   billion dollars and you put in a hundred million dollars your stake is now worth 50 million right
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:11.920]   right so you lost 50 million didn't they have the discipline to put in these protective provisions
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.960]   and you know they're going to be a little bit more expensive than they were before but you know
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.680]   they're going to be a little bit more expensive than they were before but you know they're going
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.240]   to be a little bit more expensive than they were before but you know they're going to be a little
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.800]   bit more expensive than they were before but you know they're going to be a little bit more expensive
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.200]   than they were before but you know they're going to be a little bit more expensive than they were
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.840]   before but you know they're going to be a little bit more expensive than they were before but you
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.480]   know they're going to be a little bit more expensive than they were before but you know
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.040]   they're going to be a little bit more expensive than they were before but you know they're going
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.600]   to be a little bit more expensive than they were before but you know they're going to be a little
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.080]   bit more expensive than they were before but you know they're going to be a little bit more expensive
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:42.960]   know that groupon raised it 20 billion dollars went public and a year later is worth 2 billion
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:48.160]   i mean it's not as though this hasn't happened before uh but yes uh people people got a little
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.080]   lackadaisical i just wanted to i just want to say one other thing though because multiples
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:59.040]   coming down is a problem what this really reveals is the importance of stock and company selection
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:05.680]   right because if you were a shitty company with an unproven business model way out on the risk
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:11.360]   curve okay and you had a super high valuation last year and you don't you know there's a good
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:16.880]   chance you never grow in it grow into it you never get back to that valuation example your example
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:22.000]   your growth will de-sell well give us an example company okay discord ripple
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:31.760]   in the 15-minute delivery space in europe go puff you know i i i would say gopuff is one of the best
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:35.520]   of them there are a lot of startups that got funded with billions of dollars in europe
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:35.600]   unfortunately they're not going to be able to get back to the market in the next 15 years
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:35.660]   i'm not saying that's the case but i'm saying that's the case because you know
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:40.860]   unproven business models burning tremendous amount of cash right like i don't know why they
[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:46.300]   need to exist i don't think they're going to get funded right maybe one or two of them do but when
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:51.420]   you have doordash and uber that are free cash flow positive that have strong brands and that can
[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:55.980]   redeploy those profits back in to compete in those markets i think it's very tough neobanks are
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:01.900]   another example neobanks you know the number of neobanks that have been funded at exorbitant
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.640]   valuations where um you know the profit margin is going to be higher than the net profit margin
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:05.660]   and so you know the number of neobanks that have been funded at exorbitant valuations are going to
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:05.660]   be higher than the net profit margin and so you know the number of neobanks that have been funded
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:06.260]   at exorbitant valuations are going to be higher than the net profit margin and so the problem is all of
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:06.260]   and so you know the number of neobanks that have been funded at exorbitant valuations are going to
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:11.020]   these financial services companies are essentially an arbitrage on rates right when rates are zero
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:16.420]   they take that money at zero percent and then they can go and execute a business model you know and
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:20.940]   sell that money at one percent and take the difference but when their cost of capital is two
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:24.140]   or two and a half or three percent the whole business implodes on them so you're going to see
[00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:29.740]   a bunch of these financial services companies get under pressure another example jason is like all
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:35.820]   the low-end you know bottoms-up sas companies and the reason is because they spend their time inside
[00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:41.420]   of google and facebook doing customer acquisition and managing this very intricate dance of ltv to
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:48.220]   cac and when all of those input costs go up their business implodes because you can't raise rates
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:52.940]   faster or you can't raise prices i would say faster than the input costs are and then all of a sudden
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:59.260]   your unit economics blow up and in all of this what is the salvation in a moment like this it's
[00:20:59.260 --> 00:20:59.720]   being
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:07.620]   healthy gross margins healthy contribution margins and a and a realistic path to profitability which
[00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:12.980]   means being ebit deposited this year or within the next two years said another way if you're
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:17.300]   profitable you're not going to go away if you can't if you can't show that you're you know to
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:24.220]   use the famous paul graham adage default alive in a moment like this then you are a price taker
[00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:29.700]   which means that you will have to pay probably a very high cost of capital to raise
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:35.320]   incremental capital to support a fundamentally fragile and non-resilient business model here's
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:41.720]   the issue here sax that when you see the getter gorillas zap all these instant delivery companies
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:47.920]   get funded at exorbitant prices and they're the seventh eighth ninth as chamath is pointing out
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:53.560]   no no instacart was the seventh those are like the 10th 11th okay so now here we are this to me
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:59.680]   seems like the fault of poor judgment by capital allocator sacks are there two
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:06.960]   many venture funds chasing too few deals and not thinking through what investing in the 10th 11th or
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:13.040]   12th player in a market is going to be able to do is it too much i think part i think part of what's
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:17.120]   going on with the companies you mentioned is that they're physical world companies they are very
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:20.480]   capital intensive they burn a lot of money they're operationally intensive
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:24.960]   i have sort of sour i soured on those businesses years ago
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:29.660]   and that's why i just focus on sas because they're basically perfect gross margin businesses um they
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:34.780]   are very they can be very capital efficient if the founders want to run them that way
[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:41.020]   so what we're doing now is telling founders lengthen your runway be more capital efficient
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:46.220]   you need to understand that you know multiples if you raise last year at 100 times arr
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.580]   you need to understand that the next time you raise it maybe at 20 times arr so
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:55.180]   now you can grow into that right if you're tripling and then triple again the next year
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:59.640]   you'll be able to grow into that valuation but you know make your money last two three
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:04.220]   four years instead of you know burning it in 12 to 18 months unless you want a down round
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:07.420]   i think this is this is the point that now
[00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:12.900]   allocators venture capitalists are going to spend the next six months thinking about
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:20.100]   what's in bucket one low quality companies burning a lot of cash that may very well not
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:25.580]   make it across the chasm no path to profitability what are the high quality companies that yeah
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:29.620]   the multiples down because public market multiples are down risk premiums have changed inflation
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:35.640]   change but they have plenty of cash on the balance sheet and think about it this way snowflake became
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:41.480]   a poster child in the public markets of a high-priced uh sas business snowflake this year
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:46.680]   will grow its free cash flow at over a hundred percent a year next year probably you know 80 or
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:53.040]   90 percent free cash flow not just revenue free cash flow in q4 i think they booked 1.4 billion
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:59.600]   of revenue q4 on a business that entirely in last year did 1.2 billion in revenue right it's
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:04.100]   a lot of money to think about that the incremental was more than what they had generated in the prior
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:10.660]   many years that business so let's say we reduce the multiple by 50 percent but the company's
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:15.780]   growing top line and free cash flow by a hundred percent doesn't take you very long to grow through
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:21.980]   the multiple compression so snowflake's multiple is plummeting for two reasons one because the stock
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:28.940]   price came down number two because right their growth rate and free cash flow growth is so high
[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:29.580]   and so now i'm going to go ahead and talk about the increase in cash flow and the increase in
[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:30.080]   cash flow and the increase in cash flow and the increase in cash flow and the increase in cash flow
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:34.480]   if you look at the multiple it's similar to what we would expect of a regression of the five-year
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:39.320]   analysis unless these companies unless these private companies want to go dark for the next
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:45.840]   three to five years meaning nine you know no sophisticated late stage investor doing around
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:50.680]   or going public they'll be okay but otherwise they're going to have to reckon with a version
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:55.760]   of what brad just said which is the high the flight to quality problem you know when in
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:59.560]   moments of uncertainty and high volatility it's just more and more and more and more and more and
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:06.060]   more straightforward to go to the things that are reliable and so you know when you think in the
[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:12.140]   public tech markets what is a reliable must-own company well i would put snowflake in the list
[00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:19.660]   of these must-own high growth software businesses right you know the fangs tend to be in the must-own
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:23.460]   category but then there are all these other businesses that then get orphaned because
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:29.540]   they're kind of nice to own would love to own would be great in any other circumstance and that
[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:35.220]   gets even more exacerbated in the in the private markets you have to remember right now like the
[00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:43.220]   private markets cannot really exist without an incremental buyer of equity right aka bag holder
[00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:49.700]   somebody has somebody needs to be the bag somebody needs to be the bag holder after you and the
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:58.420]   problem right now is that those folks have a lot more credible safe durable assets that they can own
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:03.840]   and they're not going to have to deal with all the crazy anxiety that comes with owning something
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:08.160]   that's that's high volatility like or chamath correct me if i'm wrong or brad if they don't
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:12.560]   want to even be involved in this mashogana they could just be in cash and the interest rates are
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:16.480]   going up so maybe they could say you know what i'll just sit this out for a year is that also
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:21.040]   happening with those folks well is that too hard to do because of inflation knows a bunch of these
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:29.500]   folks but like take for example d1 you know it's uh dan sunheim's great investor i mean my understanding is that
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:36.520]   they are sort of off privates completely because why invest in a private company at x times ar when
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:41.960]   you can invest in a public sas company for six times so they've substituted i think tiger is
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:46.720]   still in market with a gigantic fund for privates but the valuations have come down so they're
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:51.520]   essentially re pricing everything i think those are probably the two broad reactions you could
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:58.080]   have right brad certainly i i would say this broadly speaking the late stage private financing
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.480]   market in venture is clearly a big part of the market and i think that's a big part of the market
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:26:59.500]   right and so i think that's a big part of the market and i think that's a big part of the market
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:26:59.500]   right and so i think that's a big part of the market and i think that's a big part of the market
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:02.780]   closed um because there hasn't been closed um because there hasn't been
[00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:06.540]   right we're in this this buyer seller standoff right we're in this this buyer seller standoff
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:08.340]   sellers aren't to the point where they're sellers aren't to the point where they're
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:10.420]   willing to accept that a new rate a new willing to accept that a new rate a new
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.140]   regime of multiples exist right it's regime of multiples exist right it's
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.780]   painful we saw you know the instacart painful we saw you know the instacart
[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:19.140]   news here recently but i think you know news here recently but i think you know
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.380]   like listen we're not even 10 or 20 percent like listen we're not even 10 or 20 percent
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.380]   of the way into the psychic reset that of the way into the psychic reset that
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:26.420]   needs to occur in order for us to see real needs to occur in order for us to see
[00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:29.140]   price discovery that's not going to price discovery that's not going to
[00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:32.740]   occur until these companies need money or that's not going to occur until these companies need money or want to go public that's right this
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:32.740]   fall is when we'll start to see real price need money or want to go public that's right this
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:34.980]   fall is when we'll start to see real price
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.540]   discovery you couldn't pry a late stage discovery you couldn't pry a late stage
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:39.940]   dollar out of my hand right now because i dollar out of my hand right now because i
[00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:41.380]   don't think we have real price discovery don't think we have real price
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.220]   discovery going on early stage venture if we're discovery going on early stage
[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:46.180]   venture if we're investing in an incredible you know investing in an incredible you know
[00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:48.100]   software business at 300 million 400 software business at 300 million 400
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.780]   million 500 billion we think can be worth million 500 billion we think can be worth
[00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:51.620]   tens of billions you can withstand a tens of billions you can withstand a
[00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:53.940]   little inflation but the later you get in little inflation but the later you get
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.020]   in the life cycle of a business it's about the life cycle of a business it's about
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:59.620]   irrs and irrs in late stage at last year's irrs and irrs in late stage at last year's
[00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:03.860]   valuations relative to today's public market valuations that is a negative
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:07.060]   arbitrage explain irr why that matters yeah
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.540]   just for the language you know we expect just for the language you know we expect
[00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.380]   our herder rate in the public markets is our herder rate in the public markets is
[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:14.580]   a 20 risk-adjusted rate of return so if a 20 risk-adjusted rate of return so if
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.100]   i'm you know like i'm you know like
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:18.180]   you know you look at these late stage you know you look at these late stage
[00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:21.780]   private valuations from last year i mean private valuations from last year i mean
[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:23.140]   you know sachs just talked about companies you know sachs just talked about
[00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:26.260]   repricing down 40 or 50 or 60 percent so repricing down 40 or 50 or 60 percent so
[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:27.940]   if they haven't done that if they haven't done that
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:30.180]   now you can't even have a conversation now you can't even have a conversation
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:31.700]   just to uplevel this what brad is saying just to uplevel this what brad is saying
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.300]   is the following jason is the following jason
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.780]   any person can wake up tomorrow and by any person can wake up tomorrow and by
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:37.860]   the s p index right what buffett would the s p index right what buffett would
[00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:41.300]   tell you to do just by the s p 500 index tell you to do just by the s p 500 index
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:45.140]   that historically that historically has compounded at around eight percent a
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:47.620]   year if you reinvest the dividends so year if you reinvest the dividends so
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:49.620]   you can do nothing you can do nothing
[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:51.540]   right get a basket of the 500 best right get a basket of the 500 best
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:52.980]   companies in the world that are companies in the world that are
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.980]   automatically selected for you based on automatically selected for you based on
[00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:56.500]   revenue and profitability you don't have revenue and profitability you don't have
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:57.700]   to do anything to do anything
[00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.060]   and that'll compound at eight percent and that'll compound at eight percent
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:00.820]   that is effectively the risk-free rate that is effectively the risk-free rate
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:02.580]   if you want to own an equity if you want to own an equity
[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:03.860]   so if you're going to step into the late so if you're going to step into the late
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:06.100]   stage private markets and you know stage private markets and you know
[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:09.460]   buy some shares and you know dingdong buy some shares and you know dingdong.com
[00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:12.180]   you got to be you got to be rewarded for that which
[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.460]   typically means that there is a premium above the eight percent and what brad is
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:18.420]   saying like you know it's it's actually more than double in
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:20.740]   his case what he's saying is it's two and a half times
[00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:24.500]   you know you've got to clear 20 to you otherwise you're better off on a risk
[00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:27.860]   adjusted basis is what's likely to happen i'm looking here at a list
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:31.380]   gopuff at 40 billion canva at 40 billion gopuff at 40 billion canva at 40 billion
[00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:35.620]   clarna at 45 billion discord at 15 billion ripple at 15 billion these
[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:39.940]   grammarly at 13 billion these don't make sense given that if they were public
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:42.020]   they would be trading at well here's what you would be trading at well here's what
[00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:45.300]   you can say 50 of that here's what you can say
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:48.020]   if if everything is held equal if everything is held equal
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:52.500]   just with the rise of rates you have to reset those valuations between probably
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:58.340]   15 and 40 percent okay at a minimum minimum but what brad said is also true
[00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:01.940]   which is if they then keep growing at a superior rate
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:06.500]   they can get back to even so meaning 18 months they could also show up again at
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:11.860]   40 and be net net awash they could get unstuck but a lot of hard work will
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:15.700]   need to happen underneath the covers of these businesses in the next two years
[00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:18.500]   okay for that to happen and that's what's going to happen with a lot of
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:22.500]   these early stage private companies right is let's say the error multiple
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:30.740]   has gone from 100 times to 20 or 30 times they have to grow their ar 5x to get the same valuation
[00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:35.940]   so the question is can they grow their ar 5x before having to return to market that's just
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:41.700]   to get a flat round now if they are tripling this year and then doubling next year then that's six
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:47.860]   x growth in arr so even if you know the multiple has gone down 5x they could still get a slight up
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:52.100]   round so that's the game i think all these companies are going to be playing is lengthen
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:57.300]   your runway so that you can grow into your valuation and not take a down round because
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:03.140]   the problem is if you're ever in a situation where you take a down round it's way worse than just the
[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:07.940]   dilution because now the psychology of everyone in the company changes everyone has to worry that
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:11.540]   you're gone sideways it's hard to recruit but here's the thing
[00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:16.420]   this is difficulty of what sax is saying though in order to grow revenue you have to invest right
[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:21.140]   you have to invest in sales people and account management functions in engineers and product
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:27.220]   managers right and all of those people uh need to exist which actually increases opex right it
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:32.020]   increases burn it doesn't maintain burn and so this is the death spiral jason you're talking
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:36.660]   about which is in order to actually grow by those multiples you actually don't have more fuel you
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:40.900]   got to increase your speed burn more fuel you don't actually have the money to to withstand two
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:41.380]   or three years
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:45.780]   the altitude you're now so it's going to be a very precarious balancing act of trying to figure out
[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:50.980]   how these companies actually get to the other side because again i think the the buyers in this case
[00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:58.180]   will be will drive a hard bargain you know i mean like look organizations like you know durable d1
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:01.780]   tiger altimeter these guys are the smartest of the smart they're not dumb
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:06.420]   and so you know the price of capital is going up in that case and so you know they're going
[00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:11.220]   to strike really good opportunities for their investors right for their lps
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:14.100]   i don't know if you're in the same boat as i am but i think it's going to be a big deal for them
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:16.900]   and they're going to be a big deal for the next generation of companies because they're going to
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.460]   be a big deal for the next generation of companies and they're going to be a big deal for the next
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.100]   generation of companies right and so you know the price of capital is going to be a big deal for them
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.900]   and so you know that's what i'm saying it's not a big deal for them it's a big deal for the next generation
[00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:27.940]   of companies but i think it's going to be a big deal for the next generation of companies and so i
[00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:31.060]   think that's a big deal for the next generation of companies and i think that's a big deal for the next
[00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:33.220]   generation of companies and i think that's a big deal for the next generation of companies and i think
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:36.020]   that's a big deal for the next generation of companies and i think that's a big deal for the
[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:39.620]   next generation of companies and i think that's a big deal for the next generation of companies and
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:41.620]   i think that's a big deal for the next generation of companies and i think that's a big deal for the
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:43.860]   next generation of companies and i think that's a big deal for the next generation of companies and
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:45.940]   i think that's a big deal for the next generation of companies and i think that's a big deal for the
[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:48.100]   next generation of companies and i think that's a big deal for the next generation of companies and
[00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:50.100]   i think that's a big deal for the next generation of companies and i think that's a big deal for the
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.260]   next generation of companies and i think that's a big deal for the next generation of companies and
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:55.060]   i think that's a big deal for the next generation of companies and i think that's a big deal for the
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:56.380]   Up markets- Layoffs.
[00:32:56.380 --> 00:33:00.180]   Well, in an up market or a boom market, the three things that matter are growth,
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:04.420]   growth, and growth. In a down market, the three things that matter are growth,
[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:09.540]   burn, and margins. It's not that growth stops mattering, it's just that burn and margins also
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:13.380]   matter. And now there's going to have to be real trade-offs. Before, it was just how much
[00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:17.940]   money can we spend how quickly to get growth. Now it's, wait a second, is this growth efficient?
[00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:23.620]   And will we have enough runway to get to the next round without having to take a down round?
[00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:28.820]   Brad, when we saw at the peak of the pandemic, some leadership, I'd say, you know,
[00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:34.900]   seasoned or well informed leadership, Airbnb and Uber come to mind, cut their staffs massively.
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:40.100]   They use that crisis to reset their cost structure and get to profitability quicker. Those were money
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:45.300]   losing businesses for a long time, maybe, you know, taking advantage of these hot markets.
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:48.900]   Is that what needs to happen here? Are we going to see a cascade of companies
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:52.580]   lowering their valuation, lowering their costs, sharpening their pencils, cutting staff,
[00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:53.540]   and then becoming more and more?
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:53.540]   Yeah, I think that's a great question. I think that's a great question.
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:54.260]   I think that's a great question. I think that's a great question.
[00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:57.300]   And more ruthless at, you know, the sixth, seventh, eighth product,
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:01.620]   they're launching saying, Hey, let's go to the core product and make it sing, make it profitable.
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:06.500]   You know, Frank Slootman has said that Silicon Valley is full of
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:08.980]   companies that are walking dead, and they don't even know it.
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:16.580]   Right? You know, Frank is, you know, he says in tape socks, he says, Listen, I'm a wartime CEO,
[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:22.260]   not a peacetime CEO. Right? He came into he came into snowflake when it was growing over 300%.
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:30.580]   And he, you know, he reconstituted what what that culture was about to prepare for wartime.
[00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:34.820]   Right? Because he says, when wartime comes, right, and it gets challenging,
[00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:38.980]   I want to run the field. Right? I don't want to be laying off employees, I want to be
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:43.860]   that's the time to hire. That's the time to press the advantage. That's the time to invest
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:47.860]   in product. That's the time to win the new customers. Unfortunately,
[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:53.220]   over the course of the last 12 to 18 months, a lot of people without that experience, right took a
[00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:58.820]   negative signal. And the signal was money will always be available. And it will be available
[00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:04.180]   at ever increasing valuations. And of course, anybody who's been at this for 20 years, like
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:10.260]   the four of us, we know that isn't true. But it's amazing. I mean, the behavioral psychology,
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:16.020]   our ability to gaslight ourselves totally in these moments and move out on the risk curve
[00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:23.140]   and ignore these lessons. Right. And so I really actually hurt and I've spent a lot of time on
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:29.860]   Zooms lately, with founders and with their teams, talking them through this, because like, we talk
[00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:34.980]   about it in the abstract and in through the lens of a spreadsheet. But there are a lot of people's
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:40.020]   lives at stake. If you're an employee, and you went to this company, you took everything in stock
[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:46.580]   at 15 billion, that's now worth 5 billion, you're totally underwater. At the same time, the cost of
[00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:52.100]   buying a home and mortgage rates and everything else is going up against you. This is a massive
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:53.060]   morale problem.
[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:59.620]   Right. You know, for companies that frankly, we want to invest in these are the innovators. But
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:05.060]   this is what happens when you have government intrusion, right, that we can all debate whether
[00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:10.340]   or not it's worthwhile, but it was hugely distortive. What we know to be true is that we
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:16.020]   had more distortion in markets the last two years than probably any time since post World War Two.
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:22.260]   And the consequence of that is dramatic. And you know, we all kind of saw it, but we all kind of
[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:22.980]   gaslighted ourselves.
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:27.940]   As well, because you were like, well, maybe there is a new normal, maybe we have accelerated
[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:33.700]   digitization. The truth of the matter is the law of economic gravity is interest rates and inflation,
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:34.980]   and it remains.
[00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:38.740]   Yeah, and, and this time turns out is not really that much different.
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:43.300]   I think Jason, if you take your list of these high price startups,
[00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:47.860]   yep, I think it would be a good useful exercise for somebody to do somebody in the press should
[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:52.900]   probably do it. But if you take that list and just rank companies based on valuation, the last
[00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:58.660]   announced date, yep. And then if they are not announcing layoffs of any kind,
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:05.060]   you can probably forecast when they're going to burn through the money,
[00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:09.940]   especially if they're hiring. And the reason that you can probably forecast that accurately is you
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:14.660]   can pretty much predict what OpEx will be, especially knowing the fact that their input
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:18.500]   costs are actually going up. So for example, most of these businesses that rely on Facebook
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:22.820]   and Google and Instagram for customer acquisition, those input costs are going up. And the reason you
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:28.100]   know that is that's $2 trillion of market cap that doesn't give a flying fuck what's happening in
[00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:33.860]   startup land. They're going to make their numbers, right? Okay, those are the most important companies
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:40.020]   in the world, they will ratchet up the prices. And so your input costs are going up. It's not just
[00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:44.820]   the physical supply of materials that I think is going up. It's just the cost of customer acquisition
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:50.820]   is going to probably go up by 2030 40%. Right. And you know this because Facebook and Google guide
[00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:52.740]   to where they need to perform.
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:57.460]   And so if you pass that through the venture ecosystem, that all of a sudden now upticks
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:02.020]   your burn. Yeah, if you're adding more people, it upticks your burn. Yeah. And now back to David's
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:06.580]   math, you then also have to grow five or six x that it none of this hangs together. So we are
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:12.180]   at the beginning of probably a very complicated process of unwinding the distortion that we've
[00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:15.860]   lived through in the last couple years. At this point, I mean, you have to blame the capital
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:21.780]   allocators in this instance, they bought these logos, they suspended disbelief. We've had this
[00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:22.660]   ridiculous culture of, you know, we're going to make this money, we're going to make this money,
[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:23.220]   we're going to make this money. And so we're going to have to do this. And so we're going to have to
[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:23.940]   do this. And so we're going to have to do this. And so we're going to have to do this. And so we're
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:24.340]   going to have to do this. And so we're going to have to do this. And so we're going to have to do this.
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:29.860]   Uncapped notes, just pushing I see it on the boards I'm on you guys probably see to some people just
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:34.820]   pushing top line growth, never discussing unique economics, never discussing the bottom line.
[00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:39.300]   And they created these crazy fugazi markups. They raised bigger funds based on it.
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:42.980]   And they just were never the adults in the room, the stewards of capital. It's infuriating.
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:46.580]   I'll tell you an incredible conversation I had yesterday with one of my partners. So he's been,
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:52.740]   you know, with me for 10 years. He was really the one that pushed us very early on to go into deep,
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:57.220]   deep, deep tech when nobody else is doing 3d printing of rockets, satellites, all that stuff.
[00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:02.340]   And it's been so I really trust and respect his perspective. And he was telling me a story.
[00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:11.380]   He called a recruiter, you know, because we've been toying with, you know, helping get some folks to
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:16.100]   help us manage some of our early stage deal flow. And he asked her essentially something to the
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:16.500]   point of like,
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:20.500]   who are the types of GPS that are getting hired today in early stage.
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:25.300]   And he said, you know, this is how we approach our business, right? We have a permanent capital
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:29.620]   balance sheet, you know, we do, you know, at most one deal a year per partner. And she said,
[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:34.180]   well, you're never going to get anybody. Because a mid level executive at one of these high flying
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:41.060]   startups that then goes and joins a venture firm. She said the consistent single thing that they
[00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:46.420]   make their decision on, are you ready for this is how many deals will I be allowed to do per year?
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:47.380]   What?
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:53.140]   And so you know, these people are make work construction workers,
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:57.620]   right? That's dig a ditch, fill a ditch, that is not what investing is.
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:02.580]   That's not about having a discerning philosophy on what a business should be or a market.
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:06.020]   So if you have a bunch of capital allocators, Jason, to your point, who are
[00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:11.220]   unsophisticated about investing, probably very sophisticated operationally, but fundamentally
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:16.340]   don't know what they're doing. And they're coming and transforming an organization that should be an
[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:22.420]   organization that should be a disciplined, discerning allocator of capital and turning
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:25.940]   them into a velocity deal machine. This is what you're going to get.
[00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:30.820]   I mean, sometimes the best money sacks is money you put into a bet you've already made
[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:35.300]   continuing to build the pot with a startup that's already proven themselves, correct. So I think
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:39.620]   we're gonna see we have a fall on fund. Yeah, I mean, I gotta say the things you guys are saying
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:46.260]   are making me feel great about our portfolio. Explain. Not not because we won't get hit with the
[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:46.900]   money. I mean, we're not gonna get hit with the money. We're not gonna get hit with the money.
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:52.180]   But because, you know, a few years ago, we decided we were going to invest in a certain kind of
[00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:57.780]   company. I mean, high margin, SaaS and marketplace businesses that were not capital intensive,
[00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:03.060]   we defined a new metric that didn't exist called burn multiple, which is the amount of money you
[00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:10.260]   burn for every dollar of incremental ARR that you generate incremental subscription revenue. And,
[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:13.780]   you know, we turned down investments that were growing fast, but they had a horrible burn
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.180]   multiple. And so we're going to see how we can do that. And I think that's what we're going to
[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:21.700]   do. So and I do think most of our companies raised last year when, you know, they made Hey,
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:27.780]   while the sun shine, so there's gonna be, they need to manage their cash flow, so they don't
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:32.740]   have to raise too quickly. But as long as they do that, and they keep growing, they're gonna
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:37.540]   weather the storm. What's the right number, spend $3 to make one spend $2 to add one,
[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:43.300]   what's what's your ratio. So what I've said is that if you can spend a dollar or less to generate
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:46.100]   an incremental dollar of ARR, you're doing amazing.
[00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:50.260]   And between one and two is good. So in other words, if you're burning
[00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:55.700]   20 million in a year to add an incremental 10 million of ARR, you're doing quite well
[00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:59.700]   and start a plan. And then when you start getting into two and a half, three,
[00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:02.500]   that's a problem. And then above three is just bad.
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:07.300]   Horrible. Spending 30 million to add 10 million in ARR. It means it takes three
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:10.900]   years or probably four or five because you'll have turn to get that money back.
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:16.020]   Yeah. And that's just a lack of discipline. And how many VCs are we on the boards? Or you know,
[00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:20.020]   other investors? Are we on the board and having that nuanced of a discussion? It's always just
[00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:22.500]   top line, top line, top line, who's gonna be the next stakeholder?
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:26.980]   I think it's very difficult, because I think the number of qualified investors have gone way down
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:32.180]   as the surface area of investing has gone way up. So again, just going back to this conversation,
[00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:36.580]   this woman is staffing most of these venture firms with their junior and mid level partners.
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:41.300]   And again, the qualification to become a venture capitalist at this point is not that you
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:45.940]   have an ability to pick or, you know, in David's case have operated
[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:51.140]   it and actually run a business and then actually have developed a methodical framework or Brad's
[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:54.420]   business, which is Brad had to start from literally zero in the public markets and work
[00:42:54.420 --> 00:43:00.580]   his way backwards to end up with 15 or 20 billion assets. It's none of that. It's are you a VP at an
[00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:05.860]   XYZ unicorn that may also be poorly run. And all of a sudden, that, you know, gives you the
[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:11.940]   qualification to go into a job where and it's not their fault, where what they are told is,
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:15.860]   what you want is what we're going to give you, which is the ability to write
[00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:21.620]   you know, X number of checks per year. That is insanity. That's not what makes a good investor.
[00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:27.380]   And then your ability to then give advice, I don't know, it's probably zero, or less than zero,
[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:32.180]   your ability to give advice is, I think we have to qualify bad advice is being given. So
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:36.420]   the ability to give quality advice as that was what's missing in this formula.
[00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:40.740]   I just think these people are really naive, like, you know, it's not their fault. But, you know,
[00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:45.780]   they're given way too much rope to hang themselves with. And they're and the the unfortunate byproduct
[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:51.220]   is going to be the the companies who gets bad advice or the bad businesses that get funded.
[00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:55.060]   And that's not what you know, an efficient capital market should do.
[00:43:55.060 --> 00:44:01.780]   So one of the things I'm seeing our portfolio companies do is use burn multiple as a governor
[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:07.940]   for how fast they're going to grow. So for example, they will say that the burn multiple
[00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:14.980]   should not exceed two in the next quarter. So you know, we want to so the old way of doing it would
[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:15.700]   be that the company is going to be the one that gets the most bad advice. And then the company
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:18.980]   would just have a forecast and say, we're going to grow three x's here, we're going to grow
[00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:23.620]   ARR from 10 million to 30 million. And whatever that costs, it costs,
[00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:28.420]   right? That was basically how companies did it. Now, what I'm seeing from some of our portfolio
[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:33.700]   companies is they are saying, yeah, our goal is to grow from 10 to 30. But we will not spend
[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:40.980]   so much money that our burn multiple exceeds two. So you know, if it turns out that there's
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:45.620]   a trade off here between growth and burn, burn is going to win, we're not going to exceed
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:52.260]   that level of that ratio of spending. And that's actually a good I mean, I've seen a few companies
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:55.380]   implement that already. And it's probably something they should all be doing.
[00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:59.300]   I mean, if these are pilots, they basically created a rule to not stall the plane.
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:04.980]   Right? You got to keep a certain altitude a certain speed. So what is the opportunity here,
[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:08.740]   then if we're going to have too many companies, too high valuations,
[00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:11.620]   if we're going to hang around the rim and try to get some rebounds here and try to
[00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:15.540]   find opportunities, what are the opportunities? What are the layups here for capital?
[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:19.300]   capital allocators and for founders, if we have there are no great advice for them, there's not
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:26.100]   there, there've never been layups. And the problem is, you know, in up markets,
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:31.780]   whenever we think that there are, it ends up being what causes our downfall later,
[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:36.020]   because we just take the wrong signal away. I don't think that there are,
[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:41.460]   I don't want to be investing incremental capital into a late stage startup that's poorly run that
[00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:45.460]   doesn't have their margins in line, and then having to work it out. Why do that? Again,
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:51.540]   I can just go in the S&P 500 and get 8%. And yeah, it's not 30%. But it's 8%. And I don't have to deal
[00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:55.700]   with all this nonsense, like, well, a bunch of people, because you're a crossover investor,
[00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:59.380]   right? I mean, you have the ability to choose between public privates or wherever you want to
[00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:05.380]   play. I actually think what I am is an investor, right? You don't have LPS for a VC fund like
[00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:10.740]   Saxon I do. But but this but this is my point, like, I think investing irrespective of whatever
[00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:15.380]   stage you do, it still fundamentally comes down to the following, which is do you have
[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:21.460]   the judgment to understand whether these decisions are marginally good, marginally average,
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:26.420]   or marginally destructive for the short, medium and long term of a business. And I just don't
[00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:31.860]   think that enough people steep themselves in the practice that it takes to get good at that
[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:39.700]   kind of a game. And I think what these moments expose is that the status games that come around
[00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:44.820]   investing, because it just seems like it's easy, it just seems like you don't do much work. That's
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:45.300]   what ruins it.
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:50.500]   These periods and the implications I think, as Brad said, is really right. It affects
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:53.860]   the employees, it affects the entrepreneurs, it affects the startup culture, it affects the
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:58.740]   incremental desire for people to take a shot at things. You can overcome all of it we have and we
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:04.820]   will again. But I really think like to the entrepreneur, the messages if you're, you know,
[00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:09.380]   taking a term sheet, I think you have to have better judgment to really look at that on that
[00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:15.220]   investor and say, Is this person really qualified to help me? Because in these moments, in the app
[00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:20.820]   sense of help, you're probably going to basically have a valuation reset at the minimum case and the
[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:22.180]   worst cases you go out of business.
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:24.900]   What's insightful about what you said, Shamath, and I'll hand it to you, Brad,
[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:30.820]   is that a lot of the founders picked based on the highest valuation who their next investor should
[00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:36.020]   be. And now we see what a trap that is, Brad. You know, the takeaway for me is we return to a
[00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:44.420]   place we've always been, which is about selection. Look at the mean returns for ventures for 20 years.
[00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:45.140]   They're lousy.
[00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:46.260]   Lousy.
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:49.700]   Right. 90% of the of the spoils.
[00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:52.660]   They barely barely map to the public market.
[00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:57.540]   5 to 10% of the investments. And that's the way it's always been. Look at look at Buffett,
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:02.820]   right? By superior companies at good prices. What are the two technology companies Buffett
[00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:04.100]   bought in the public markets?
[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:04.820]   Apple.
[00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:06.500]   Right. Apple and Snowflake.
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:07.220]   Snowflake.
[00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:14.180]   Apple and Snowflake. He doesn't own a broad basket of long tail internet or long tail software. And
[00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:15.060]   so I think what
[00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:21.620]   you're going to see, and to Sax's point, I think even running a recipe on software as though all
[00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:26.980]   ARR is created equal. I mean, I can show you five companies each with 100 million of ARR,
[00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:31.460]   each growing at 30%. And there's massive dispersion in future outcomes.
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:32.020]   Yeah.
[00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:38.180]   Right. And so like, I just think that this at the end of the day is a craft business. It's an
[00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:44.500]   essentialist business. It's about finding and identifying those very, very, very few companies
[00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:44.980]   that ever
[00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:50.020]   are durably are worth more than $10 billion. You know, on my screen today, Chamath was just
[00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:55.860]   talking. There are four internet companies that are green today. Amazon, Google, Apple and
[00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:59.300]   Facebook. Everything else on my screen is bleeding.
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:00.980]   Must own. Must own versus?
[00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:08.580]   Everything else is red and my growth internet stocks are down 400 basis points. Right? The
[00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:13.940]   market is voting with its wallet where it wants to sit on the risk curve. Right? And I think we're
[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:14.900]   just going to go there's
[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:19.060]   no new normal here. This is just back to the future, right? This is what we've always done.
[00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:24.260]   And you know, the reset is always painful. The only surprising thing is how often we have to go
[00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:24.660]   through it.
[00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:29.700]   If opportunities do arise, where will they where will they be bred? I mean, I was watching Peloton,
[00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:34.020]   I always loved that company. I see the change in management, I see the management, you know,
[00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:38.660]   thinking about profitability, thinking about creating it into a marketplace, maybe having
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:44.740]   more hardware available, disconnected from the software, etc. Do you think there's opportunities
[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:48.980]   there? Or there will be opportunities over the next year to buy some of the names that aren't the
[00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:49.380]   fangs?
[00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:57.220]   What we do in the first instance, Jason, and listen, we outperformed last year,
[00:49:57.220 --> 00:50:03.300]   because we owned quality and we're short, lower quality stuff. Unfortunately, this year,
[00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:07.700]   the market said, Guess what, it's all overvalued quality, low quality doesn't matter.
[00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:14.180]   We're taking it all lower. And so for us in moments like this, and I've lived probably through
[00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:14.660]   five of a million years, I've lived probably five of a million years, I've lived probably five of a
[00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:14.740]   million years, I've lived probably five of a million years, I've lived probably five of a million years,
[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:22.260]   in the public markets, we always do the same thing. D gross, take risk down. First thing is,
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:29.700]   like have less chits on the board. Number two, reduce the number of outliers pull in the risk
[00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:35.060]   curve. Right? For me, I want to own five or six things. Because remember, I'm the biggest LP in
[00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:40.660]   the fund. This is my money, I want to sleep well at night, and I want to protect the foundations,
[00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:44.580]   the endowments, the good causes we represent, I can't do that. I can't do that. I can't do that. I
[00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:49.380]   can't do that with a company that has an unproven business model. I may think that it's going to be
[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:54.580]   great in the future, but I don't know. So the problem with for the pelotons of the world,
[00:50:54.580 --> 00:51:01.220]   right, they may be incredible returners. But what every portfolio manager on the planet is
[00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:06.580]   doing today is compressing the number of names in their portfolio, saying what are the companies I
[00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:10.980]   know with absolute certainty, whether rates are two and a half, three and a half, four and a half,
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:14.500]   five and a half is going to be worth more over the course of the next two to three
[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:19.540]   years. That's what I want to own. Right. And so wait, what I was just gonna say,
[00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:23.380]   not to interrupt, Brad, but Jason, what you're talking about is what a lot of people do.
[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:29.700]   You see a lot on Twitter, and I call it clapping as a strategy. What about this? And what about
[00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:32.820]   that? And what about if they do this? And what about clapping is not a strategy.
[00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:37.380]   clapping is something people do with the blackjack table. It turns out it doesn't
[00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:43.700]   actually influence the cards. Sure. And so I think you have to stop with the clapping strategy.
[00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:47.620]   That's not my strategy. I was asking that as the moderator. Is there?
[00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:50.820]   Just to be clear, I'm not advising that as a strategy.
[00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:54.580]   I'm saying I think you're representing a psychological reaction that a lot of people have.
[00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:57.940]   And I think what Brad is trying to tell you is clapping is not a strategy.
[00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:01.940]   I'm asking that on behalf of the audience is not my belief, just to be clear.
[00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:04.660]   My commentary to the audience is clapping is not a strategy.
[00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:09.140]   Yes, correct. Yes. If enough people though, do what you're saying, Brad,
[00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:14.340]   and they just retreat to quality at some point that quality those quality companies with
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:20.100]   then become fully valued, maybe even overvalued. And thus the cycle begins again or not. So how
[00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:25.940]   long does that take? No, you nailed it. What happened last year 2021 dispersion collapsed.
[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:31.940]   Go check out jam and ball who does incredible software analysis on our team. dispersion
[00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:37.060]   collapse between the best cohort and the worst cohort of software companies last year. The first
[00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:43.060]   thing that happened is dispersion returns, we pay a higher price for the best shit, we pay a lower
[00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:44.260]   price for the local.
[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:49.940]   Quality stuff, right? Then when we start to recover, when there's more predictability in
[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:54.340]   the world, when we resolve the war, when we understand the path of inflation,
[00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:59.060]   right, the stuff close in on the risk curve, that'll start being fully valued.
[00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:03.540]   So then we will be brave enough to walk a little further out on the ice on the lake,
[00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:09.700]   testing it, is it safe to walk here, and then you walk out a little further and sadly,
[00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:14.180]   right, eventually, we're in the exact same patterns we've been before, which is,
[00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:19.780]   we'll know we're at a market top five or six or seven years from now, when we repeat the same
[00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:24.820]   asinine behavior that we just went through when everybody becomes complacent again, and overbidding
[00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:29.700]   this stuff way out on the risk curve. I'm just suggesting to you the number one question I get
[00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:34.580]   from GPS venture capitalists and others right now is when are we going to bounce back? Let me be
[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:40.260]   absolutely clear. There is no bouncing back to where we were the last 18 months. That was the
[00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:44.100]   outlier. That was the make believe. What I hope and expect is that we're going to bounce back.
[00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:49.940]   expect is that we can back bounce back to the five year average. But even to durably trade at
[00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:55.220]   the five year average, we have to have a lot more clarity on the war in Ukraine on inflation and
[00:53:55.220 --> 00:54:00.900]   rates. So that's a perfect place to pivot sacks. We are now here and I think this is the fourth or
[00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:05.620]   fifth episode where we've been discussing the war and we flipped it today just to do markets first
[00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:09.860]   for a little change of pace. And since we had Brad here, where are we at with the war?
[00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:14.020]   And what are your what is your expectation of it right
[00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:17.300]   now? Is it wrapping up or it escalating? Well, actually, there's a tweet storm this morning
[00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:26.500]   that Matthew sent to the group that from a Russian official and it seemed to indicate well indicate
[00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:31.620]   what we've kind of known for a few weeks now, which is what the broad contours of what a peace
[00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:37.700]   deal would look like, which is there's three main pieces. neutrality for Ukraine, the Russians
[00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:43.300]   insist that it not be part of NATO. They get to keep Crimea which they annexed in 2014. That's been
[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:43.940]   a fait accompli.
[00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:50.180]   And then some version of independence for these sort of breakaway territories
[00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:56.020]   in eastern Ukraine, the in the Donbas region, everyone kind of knows that's the
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:59.620]   the broad strokes of the deal, then there's, you know, a lot of details are going to matter
[00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:05.060]   a lot to the people who live there, like is there this land bridge from Crimea to Donbas,
[00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:09.220]   but frankly, don't matter as much to all of us the United States of America. So
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:12.740]   the question is, you know, what is the administration going to do about it? Biden just
[00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:13.860]   went to Europe. He's going to go to the United States. He's going to go to the United States.
[00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:20.500]   And, you know, my concern is that no one in Washington, I talked about this last week seems
[00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:27.940]   to be pushing for a ceasefire. It seems like their preferred position is for Russia to bleed out as
[00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:36.900]   long as possible in Ukraine for the US to fund an insurgency Allah Afghanistan, where you know,
[00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:39.780]   these fighters in eastern Ukraine are sort of like the muzhar.
[00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:40.980]   Insurgency? Is that the right word?
[00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:43.780]   Well, sure. Because, you know, if they're defending Ukraine, they're defending Ukraine.
[00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:44.500]   They're defending their own land.
[00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:47.540]   And so we're the mujahideen. I mean,
[00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:49.460]   I know, but why would you call it an insurgency?
[00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:55.380]   Well, because if the government of Ukraine falls, then it becomes an insurgency. So the point is
[00:55:55.380 --> 00:56:00.020]   that the administration, the question is, what's the administration's endgame here?
[00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:04.740]   Do they want to lead the world to a ceasefire? Or do they want to protract the conflict
[00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:13.700]   to impose on the Russian state, a Afghan style, you know, debilitating defeat to destabilize the Russian
[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:18.900]   regime? Neil Ferguson had a column this week in his Bloomberg column.
[00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:20.340]   He's from the Brookings Institute at Stanford?
[00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:21.540]   No, he's from he's from Hoover.
[00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:22.900]   Hoover, rather. Sorry.
[00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:24.740]   Yeah. So I'll read I'll read this part.
[00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:28.900]   Hoover is at it. Can you just explain to people what the Hoover Institute is and how that leans?
[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:36.980]   Hoover Institution for War and Peace, I would say it sort of leans idealistic and foreign policy.
[00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:39.620]   I would describe Neil as sort of the most realistic idealist.
[00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:40.660]   Got it. Okay.
[00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:43.620]   So context, but he's quite well sourced, I think. And I think that's a good point.
[00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:48.660]   With, you know, and with, you know, various people in Washington and Europe,
[00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:55.220]   and what he wrote is, the US intends to keep this war going, the administration will continue to
[00:56:55.220 --> 00:57:01.380]   supply the Ukrainians with anti aircraft stingers, anti tank javelins, explosive switchblade drones,
[00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:06.740]   it will keep trying to persuade other NATO governments supply heavier defensive weaponry,
[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:13.540]   and so on. He says Washington will revert to the Afghanistan after 1979 playbook of supplying
[00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:18.740]   an insurgency, only if the Ukrainian government loses the conventional war. So the concern here
[00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:25.620]   is that the US government has an incentive, actually, that they don't want a quick end to
[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:30.740]   this war is basically the theory is they want the Russian state to bleed out and be destabilized.
[00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:36.100]   In a way, it's the one chance we have for like regime change there without us actually starting
[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:39.540]   a war is that they have this self inflicted wound. That is the theory.
[00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:43.460]   Yeah. And I think a lot of people are saying that that is what a lot of people want in
[00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:47.300]   Washington. I don't you know, this is not like conspiracy theory, people are saying this is our
[00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:53.060]   chance to topple the Russian state destabilize it. There was a Rand Corporation. How do you
[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:57.300]   survey years ago, hold on, there's a rent corporation study done a few years ago,
[00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:01.220]   that was commissioned by somebody probably in our State Department, or someone like that,
[00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:05.300]   where they talked about this, that if we want to destabilize the Russian regime,
[00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:09.380]   Ukraine is the way to do it. Right, they would fall for it, right, they would actually fight
[00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:13.380]   that fight, that is an unwinnable fight, we would basically be putting an F, we'd be surprised
[00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:18.420]   if we were supporting an Afghanistan like path for them to go down like we did. And they did
[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:22.740]   previously to that. Right. And the problem, the problem that I see is just this, which is
[00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:28.100]   we've discussed on on this program, the downsides of this war. First, it's a humanitarian disaster.
[00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:32.580]   Second, we've talked about the risks of recession later in the year. Third,
[00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:37.220]   Freeberg talked about famine, the risk of famine later this year, if the spring planning doesn't
[00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:43.300]   happen. And then fourth, we have this always we have this risk that the war spins out of control,
[00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:48.500]   right, and leads into war three, those are some vital American interests to avoid all of those
[00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:53.860]   scenarios. I don't see an equivalent vital American interest in determining the exact
[00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:58.740]   nuances of who rules the Donbass. In other words, the broad strokes of this agreement are there.
[00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:05.060]   You know, what the US should be doing is leading, they should be pushing for lead not bleed lead
[00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:09.460]   the way to a ceasefire, not to inflict maximum damage on the Russian regime,
[00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:13.220]   which we don't know exactly what their intent is, because they're doing
[00:59:13.220 --> 00:59:15.380]   this behind closed doors. Brad, what's your take on this?
[00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:18.180]   I think there Dave and I talked about this at dinner the other night, I think there's
[00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:22.500]   something bigger playing out here. I mean, clearly, he's the expert on real politic and,
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:32.260]   you know, but it seems to me that we have had decades of military diplomacy. Right. And and
[00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:36.500]   most recently, the PAL doctrine of overwhelming force, we don't want to make the same mistake we
[00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:42.820]   made in Vietnam. So like, we're gonna go in with full force. And, you know, basically, the public
[00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:49.300]   support, you know, military adventure ism anymore. Right. And so now we have maybe we'll call it the
[00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:55.060]   Blinken doctrine, which is the PAL doctrine equivalent, but for economic force. It's the
[00:59:55.060 --> 01:00:01.140]   nuclear economic weapon that is on full display by the West right now that I think has really
[01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:08.740]   significant implications. Right. It's reunited the West. And I don't think this is just about Putin.
[01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:13.060]   And I think the reason that the US and Western Europe is slow playing
[01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:19.780]   this a bit is they're sending a message to the Chinese as well, which is that we are unified,
[01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:26.820]   and we will use an economic weapon of mass destruction. If, right, you don't play by
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:32.020]   global norms. And so the box I think we're in from a negotiating perspective, right,
[01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:37.300]   in Ukraine right now is not a box around neutrality. I mean, neutrality is already clear.
[01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:42.980]   I mean, we had Zelensky didn't even ask for a no fly zone. He's not even asking for NATO membership.
[01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:48.420]   They've already seeded neutrality. I think the real question is sanctions. I don't think the
[01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:53.620]   West wants to roll back sanctions. And I think Putin saying I can't hightail it out of here,
[01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:57.060]   unless you roll back all the sanctions and give me a little bit of the Donbass.
[01:00:57.060 --> 01:01:00.900]   And so watch the next week or two like in any good negotiation.
[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:05.860]   Unfortunately, I think both sides are going to amp up their current strategies,
[01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:12.900]   we may see missiles coming out of Russia, and we may see European, complete European embargo of
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:18.740]   Russian oil 3 million barrels a day. Those will be the final straws right before we enter
[01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:24.420]   negotiations, because then they can see the last things that they took as part of the negotiation.
[01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:32.420]   But this I think is going to be all about economic sanctions. And, and I think the West is playing a
[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:36.580]   really strong game. What I worry about, and Sachs has talked about this at length,
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:42.820]   is that we overreach, we overplay our hand here in an effort to send a signal to
[01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:48.420]   other parties around the world. Right. And that has fat tail risk associated with it.
[01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:50.500]   You're referencing China and Taiwan?
[01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:55.380]   Let me ask a question. How many of us woke up or this at the beginning of this year,
[01:01:55.380 --> 01:02:02.980]   or in making our New Year's resolutions and said that we need to risk recession,
[01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:07.780]   famine and war in order to destabilize and topple the Russian regime?
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:12.740]   When did this become a vital American interest? No one at the beginning of year thought this was an
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:18.580]   important goal of America. What's more important is is basically getting our economy back on track
[01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:25.780]   and back on track after this long, this long, this this plague we've had. I mean, nobody needed this
[01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:31.780]   problem. And what the administration should have done was use diplomacy and all the resources to
[01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:36.820]   try and prevent the conflict. And now the conflict has occurred, we should be pushing for a negotiated
[01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:42.660]   peace and ceasefire. We do not have a vital national interest in the details of who
[01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:48.260]   rules rules the Donbass. Yeah, the problem with your setting up of that question is that we did
[01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:53.380]   not start the war Putin did. Shamath, you've been silent so far. What are your thoughts on this war
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:57.460]   that Jason, I'm not saying we started the war? Well, you're saying did we wake up and say that
[01:02:57.460 --> 01:03:03.220]   we should do this? We did not listen. The people in the media woke up on February 24. And you
[01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:07.780]   think Putin went mad and there's no pre history to this conflict. Now here's the deal. Hold on
[01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:12.580]   a second. This is a war of Russian aggression. It's true that Putin started it. He's the
[01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:18.820]   invader. However, there were things we could have done to prevent or to avoid this war,
[01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:24.420]   and American diplomacy completely failed. And we even discussed it the month before this war
[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:30.580]   started. We talked about how the US could have given a written guarantee to Russia that Ukraine
[01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:34.900]   would not be part of NATO. Just this week, Zelenskyy in an interview with Fried Zakaria
[01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:39.460]   admitted he was told by Blinken, you will not be part of NATO, but we don't want to admit that
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:42.500]   publicly. What games were they playing? What is the point of
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:48.100]   playing that kind of game with the grave issue of war and peace? Why didn't Blinken say publicly
[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:54.180]   what he said to Zelenskyy? This administration did not do everything it could do to prevent war.
[01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:58.740]   And now we are faced with all of these existential risks. Why? For what reason?
[01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:03.700]   The reason is that it gave the United States an opportunity to topple Russia.
[01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:08.580]   I mean, exactly. Who of us thought we needed that at the beginning of this year?
[01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:12.420]   Well, I think that, you know, the thing to keep in mind, and again,
[01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:18.340]   I don't I don't, I'm not saying that this is right, but I'm just game theorizing that these
[01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:25.620]   are like, you know, grudges that these guys have held for a very long time. And I think it started
[01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:31.460]   when they were in the Obama White House, and it carried over to now. And I think they saw an
[01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:36.740]   opportunity to basically execute a strategy that essentially now I think we're moving into the
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:41.220]   second phase of this war, which is effectively trying to bait Russia into doing something really
[01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:42.340]   egregiously bad. And I think that's the point. And I think that's the point. And I think that's
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:44.260]   the point. And I think that's the point. And I think that's the point. And that is terrible,
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:50.100]   David, to your point, I think we're willing to, you know, sacrifice a lot. I think we've decided that
[01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:56.580]   implicitly by based on the actions of the American government. And and it's weird. It's like we're
[01:04:56.580 --> 01:05:03.540]   trying to get Russia to react. And so the rhetoric, in fact, the rhetoric since that, do you guys
[01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:08.660]   remember, I think it was only 10 days ago that both Russia and Ukraine said the surface area of
[01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:12.260]   a deal is pretty much in sight. David Elikwu:
[01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:17.140]   Oh, Friedberg from the top rope coming in. Look at you, Friedberg. I mean, like you,
[01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:21.620]   you look like an everyman. I mean, I'm so proud of you. Are you actually driving your own car?
[01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:22.100]   Friedberg:
[01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:24.980]   Gas guzzling car SUV in the mountains.
[01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:25.300]   David Elikwu:
[01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:26.500]   You should be you should be
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:26.820]   Friedberg:
[01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:29.940]   In that tank. Is that gas?
[01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:30.260]   David Elikwu:
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:33.860]   I only use it. I only use ethanol I make in vats in my backyard.
[01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:34.340]   Friedberg:
[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:37.940]   When I use solar panels that are handcrafted in my backyard.
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:38.100]   David Elikwu:
[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:41.700]   I went out of my way to find find a Luke oil gas station filled up.
[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:42.180]   Friedberg:
[01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:46.660]   What I was saying, guys, was that, you know, from the 10 days from when, you know, both sides,
[01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:50.340]   Russia and Ukraine were like, hey, you know, we think we're basically there, we have a deal.
[01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:55.940]   The rhetoric has gotten really insane. You know, yesterday, I think it was like, the United States
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:06:00.740]   said, you know, we, we think that Russia should be kicked out of the G20. Then Russia responded
[01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:06.100]   and said, I'm only going to sell that gas and settle it in rubles. You know, all of a sudden,
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:12.100]   other actors, China and Saudi Arabia are in the game. Now, you know, China and Saudi Arabia are
[01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:17.140]   negotiating settling a huge oil trade in Yuan. Why in the last 10 days of all these things
[01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:21.780]   happened when we were so close to getting something done? I think the best explanation is
[01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:29.300]   that we are willing to, I guess we've decided I mean, we, none of us have decided but American
[01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:35.140]   government decided that some amount of sacrifice is okay. If it could trigger a Russian escalation,
[01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:38.740]   which could then further destabilize that country, and I think they believe that that's more
[01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:40.020]   important than anything else. Friedberg:
[01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:42.020]   And I think we, you know, we're in a situation where we're in a situation where we're in a situation
[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:44.540]   know, from where I sit, I think we can take Putin as word that
[01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:46.880]   he actually cares about reunification. And that's not to
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:49.820]   say he's crazy, David. And I don't think we can control his
[01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:51.080]   behavior. I think your
[01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:52.940]   reason we're reunification.
[01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:58.200]   Jason and also just today, the Russian military, the tweet that
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:00.580]   I sent you guys was from the Russian military. And that was
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:03.140]   an official statement. And I don't think he they would be
[01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:07.260]   allowed without Putin's explicit sign off. They no longer talked
[01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:11.760]   about denazificating, Ukraine or demilitarizing Ukraine,
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:16.920]   they simply focused it on the Donbas. And to use your Sun Tzu
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:19.020]   argument, it's almost like they're trying to construct
[01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:22.140]   their own golden bridge to exit in a way where they can claim
[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:25.860]   victory to the Russian people to explain the 10s of 1000s of, you
[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:28.740]   know, Russian military people that have been killed in this
[01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:30.660]   whole conflict, right, because they have an explanation that
[01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:34.800]   they have to give. But in all of this, I think that we're, we're
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:38.640]   probably exposing a very high risk game of poker that we're
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:41.700]   playing, which is it seems that the US government is still
[01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:44.760]   focused more on the destabilization of, of Russia
[01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:46.620]   than they are and getting this conflict behind us.
[01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:49.260]   I mean, he did, he did say in his speech, since time
[01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:51.820]   immemorial, the people living in the southwest of what has
[01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:54.320]   historically been Russian land have called themselves Russians
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:57.420]   and Orthodox Christians. That's Donbas. Yeah, I know. But he
[01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:59.820]   there's been a Jason, there's been a civil war going on since
[01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:03.420]   2014. In this Donbas region between Ukrainians and these
[01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:07.460]   sort of these Russian speakers. And now that civil wars as this
[01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:11.640]   a Balkan style civil war that is now escalated with, you know,
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:15.300]   Ukraine and Russia getting in and now the whole West
[01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:17.860]   potentially could get in. This is a very dangerous situation.
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:19.200]   We should not let spin out of control.
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:21.600]   I'm agreeing with that. You guys asked me, did he ever talk about
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:23.700]   reunification? He did. He did in his speech.
[01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:26.560]   That was not one of his stated war objectives. Now you could
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:29.100]   keep accusing him of being a liar. But look what his
[01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:31.600]   objective is just taking about his word that he believes these
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:34.080]   areas are Russian and they should be considered Donbass
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:36.840]   area where they are predominantly Russian speakers.
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:41.580]   Look, and that I'm not taking aside, I'm not taking aside in who should
[01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:45.360]   rule the Donbass. Okay, yeah, I think it's a complicated, ethnic
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:49.140]   strife sort of issue like we saw in the Balkans all the time
[01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:51.720]   between the Russians who live there and the Ukrainians who live
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:55.560]   there. What I do know is it's not worth risking war three over
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:58.440]   an agreement on that issue. 100% agreement. 100% agreement.
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:06.060]   Sacks, let me Can I ask you a question? So how is Putin going
[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:11.220]   to withdraw without 100% lifting of the sanctions? And how is the
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:15.780]   government possibly going to trust him to withdraw? Right?
[01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:19.260]   Well, while taking all the sanctions off, that seems to me
[01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:22.920]   like, when I try to construct the Golden Bridge, in my mind,
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:27.960]   it comes down to, you know, like, how do we how do we whack
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:31.140]   up the sanctions? Do we take some of them off, say, prove to
[01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:33.600]   us be out for x period of time, and then we'll roll the other
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:35.940]   ones off. Because these sanctions are not going to be
[01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:38.940]   rolled back in the next three months based on some ceasefire.
[01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:41.460]   I agree with that. I don't
[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:46.320]   know that Putin can expect the sanctions to be lifted or that he
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:49.320]   can effectively negotiate for that. I think, again, where I
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:53.760]   think the the peace deal is, is that we've known all along what
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:57.780]   it's going to be Ukraine will agree to neutrality in exchange
[01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:02.400]   for some security guarantees from the West. Russia will get
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:06.000]   to keep Crimea because that's been a fait accompli since the
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.860]   annexation 2014. And there will be some sort of regional
[01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:11.400]   autonomy.
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:16.020]   For these sort of Russian speaking areas in the Donbass,
[01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:18.960]   which by the way, we could have had that too, there was a deal
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:22.800]   called mints to since 2015, that simply hasn't been implemented.
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:26.460]   So, you know, I think that those are the broad strokes of the
[01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:29.160]   deal. And then there's questions about, well, is there a land
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:32.460]   bridge from Crimea to the Donbass? And, you know, what
[01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:36.660]   weapons exactly does Ukraine get to get from the United States or
[01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:39.540]   get to keep? I mean, so look, those details matter a lot to
[01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:41.340]   the people who live there. But the broad
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:43.200]   strokes of this, I think are pretty well understood.
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:47.400]   I'm not betting this way with with our book. But if I had to
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:52.200]   guess, we are going to have a period of significant escalation
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:56.700]   on both sides, before they both get to the table. Macron said
[01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:59.820]   this week, that we still have the Europeans have not made a
[01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:03.960]   decision about the embargo of Russian oil that will collapse
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:08.520]   the Russian economy and oil will go to 180 or $200 a barrel. I
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:11.280]   think that's a real likelihood. And the second
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:14.760]   one is I think the Russians will amp up military aggression
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:19.260]   in some face saving measure and to have more to negotiate with.
[01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:23.640]   So maybe to answer my own question is if there is an oil
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:27.600]   embargo, then you take the oil embargo off, right as part of
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:31.260]   the economic sanction, whacking up of the sanctions, because
[01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:35.940]   that's really the nuclear option against the Russians economically.
[01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:41.220]   But it's a you know, unfortunately, I think we have to
[01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:43.680]   be prepared for this to get worse before it gets better.
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:47.640]   Because it makes sense from just a game theory for both sides
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:51.120]   to grab as much as they can right before they sit down at
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:53.340]   the table. So they have more shit to give to each other.
[01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:56.760]   Right. But the problem is, if both sides keep asking, I agree
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:59.820]   with that fundamental analysis is that neither Putin nor
[01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:03.540]   Zelensky can be trusted on their own, to basically make peace
[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:06.600]   because they want to push their advantage. If either one believes
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.160]   that they're winning on the battlefield, they're going to
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:11.160]   push their advantage to grab as much as they can to then
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.680]   negotiate from a position of greater strength. The problem is
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:16.860]   that they're in an escalatory spiral, where if you know, one
[01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:19.620]   or both of them miscalculate, we never get that deal. And I think
[01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:23.100]   the longer the war drags on, the harder it is to make a deal not
[01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:27.780]   easier. One of the I'd say one of the disturbing things that
[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:30.960]   came out over the past week was in that interview that I
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:35.160]   mentioned, where three Zakaria interviewed Zelensky. Zelensky
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:39.120]   said, he said that it's either going to get a peace deal or
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:39.900]   World War Three.
[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:45.660]   I'm listening to this thinking, wait a second. You know, that,
[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:50.640]   that is a pretty scary posture for him to be taking. And
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:53.640]   furthermore, who appointed him leader of the free world, you
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:58.680]   know, the decision to have war three is not his decision. He is
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:01.980]   not the President United States, we did not vote for him. We may
[01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:06.600]   think he's heroic, we may think he deserves our support, but he
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:10.020]   does not get to turn this into war three for us. The American
[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:11.040]   people did not.
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:14.880]   choose that. And this is where I go back to Biden and the
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.440]   administration and their leadership, what are they
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:19.860]   pushing for? Are they pushing for a protracted, never ending
[01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:24.480]   Afghan style war in Ukraine? Or are they going to lead the
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:28.320]   situation to some sort of negotiation or ceasefire? And I
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.360]   just think if we're considering the interest of the United
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:34.860]   States, we would not let this decision purely be Zelensky.
[01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:36.900]   This guy's willing to entertain war three.
[01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:38.580]   That can't be acceptable to us.
[01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:40.980]   But what what what what is his worst alternative?
[01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:43.680]   I mean, like he's losing his country. So of course, he wants
[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:47.820]   to say the thing that would scare us into action
[01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:50.220]   potentially, right? So he has nothing to lose. So right.
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:53.640]   That's what that's the right to defend him to cite for us.
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:57.600]   He's not just using he's he's using rhetoric to get us to talk
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:00.540]   about it, which he just won. Like he you can see that what
[01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:03.360]   he's saying is working. Yeah, because you're talking about it.
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:07.720]   So I think the I think the bigger question in all of this
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:10.920]   is, when is the United States?
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:14.640]   When is the United States going to be able to do that? Because
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:16.980]   they're going to be able to do that? I don't know. I don't know.
[01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:19.320]   I think the answer is, I think the answer is that the United
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:22.080]   States is just willing to draw a really hard line. So there was a
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:24.420]   another thing that happened, which is that, you know, Biden
[01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:27.420]   essentially said, like, you know, if they use chemical
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:31.360]   weapons, we will react sort of in kind, right? There was some,
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:33.960]   some version of that. It's a red line, basically, he said, yes.
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:37.740]   And, and then he also said, you know, depending on, you know,
[01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:40.860]   how they use nuclear weapons, we could theoretically respond. So
[01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:43.680]   if you had a deal in sight, just get it done. Be pregnant.
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:44.180]   Right.
[01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:47.820]   But you're assuming, David, you're, you're assuming that we
[01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:50.220]   have the influence, you assume, David, that we have the
[01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:52.980]   influence to actually cut a deal. You were saying yourself
[01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:56.580]   for the last couple of months, that the US power has waned and
[01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:59.100]   that we don't have influence. So which is it? I think you're
[01:14:59.100 --> 01:14:59.820]   just blaming Biden.
[01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:02.700]   I believe we have the influence to get facilitate a deal.
[01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:05.040]   You were saying, like, last couple of weeks that we lost our
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:05.520]   influence.
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:08.400]   Listen, let me give you an example. We are giving
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:10.800]   Zelensky and the Ukrainians all these incredible weapons.
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:15.360]   What are the conditions on that? If Zelensky is unwilling to make
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:20.040]   a reasonable peace deal, do we, do we have any conditions and
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:23.280]   are giving him these weapons? Why wouldn't we insist Zelensky,
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:26.280]   listen, we support you. We basically are against this
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:28.980]   Russian aggression. You should have the right to defend your
[01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:32.100]   homeland and drive them out. But we also want you to take a
[01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:35.220]   reasonable peace deal if one is available and we need you to
[01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:38.580]   specify what that is. Are we exercising that kind of
[01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:39.660]   discretion? I don't think so.
[01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:40.740]   I think you're
[01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:44.040]   assuming that Biden is blocking this when in fact, it might be
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:47.400]   that Putin is and I believe you're taking Putin's sort of
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:50.520]   position here over our own presidents. I think you need to
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:53.640]   think for a second that we don't want to have this continual
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:55.740]   escalate. You actually think there's a world in which Biden
[01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:57.960]   wants to see this escalate? I don't think that that's the
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:02.580]   case. I think that we don't have influence. David, we do not have
[01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:05.880]   the influence today that we did. It is no longer the United
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:08.580]   States, you know, gets to dictate to the world what's going on
[01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:09.960]   here. We no longer have that.
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:10.680]   Okay, this is not about this.
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:13.620]   Putin wants to talk to Israel. Putin wants to talk to Macron in
[01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:14.280]   France, not us.
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:16.920]   Because we're not seen as an honest broker. But look,
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:18.060]   Chamath just-
[01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:19.380]   We don't have the influence we once had.
[01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:22.440]   Okay, let me explain. I'm not saying we can dictate the
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:26.280]   outcome, okay? But we can push for a negotiated settlement
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:30.960]   instead of a protracted, we can lead not bleed, okay? Chamath
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:33.840]   laid it out. Neil Ferguson laid it out. The Rand Corporation laid
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:38.220]   it out. There is a significant chance that there are definitely
[01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:40.620]   actors in the State Department who,
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:44.880]   who want to see an Afghan style situation insurgency play out in
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:48.600]   Eastern Europe. That's their goal. Okay? Now, I don't know
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:51.840]   what Biden is thinking, but he has made no statement. To the
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:55.020]   contrary, what have we done to help lead the situation to a
[01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:57.060]   negotiated settlement? Name one thing.
[01:16:57.060 --> 01:17:01.860]   Well, I don't think we're in the room, David. But Biden is in
[01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:02.460]   Europe, right?
[01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:04.140]   Why do I need to be in the room? I read all their public
[01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:05.400]   statements. I don't see anything.
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:07.200]   I don't think they want to negotiate through the press
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:08.760]   with Putin. I think-
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:09.840]   I don't think they want to negotiate at all.
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:10.560]   Biden is in Europe right now.
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:14.520]   I think that says enough about what his intent is. He's in
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:16.020]   Poland, right? He's going to Poland?
[01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:17.940]   He's in Poland where we're scaling up our military
[01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:21.720]   presence. Listen, I mean, I don't, all I'm saying is, look,
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.360]   I don't know exactly what Biden is saying or doing behind closed
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:27.720]   doors. What I'm saying is that the US should be playing a
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:30.840]   constructive role to get to a negotiated ceasefire, not
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:35.340]   indulging this sort of fantastical thinking that we can
[01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:38.160]   basically perpetrate a regime change operation in Russia.
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:39.780]   I agree with you on that. I agree with you on that.
[01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:40.500]   I,
[01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:44.160]   I'm worried that there may be a small strain of that probability
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:47.580]   in the range of outcomes here. And I didn't think that before.
[01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:50.460]   I really thought that, okay, maybe we were a little bit on
[01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:53.520]   the outside looking in, but it looks like, you know, we're
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:55.680]   pretty close to a deal. These guys will get in a room,
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:18:01.200]   they'll, you know, chop it up and it'll be done. And instead,
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:03.360]   honestly, if you just look at the headlines and the rhetoric
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:07.080]   and the words from all these three leaders in the last 10
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:10.140]   days, it's been, it's been in the other direction. And so you
[01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:10.440]   have to wonder,
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:12.720]   what is the point of all of this right now, other than
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:14.220]   it could be crescendoing like Brad said,
[01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:18.900]   it's a, you know, I, I, I listened to Blinken over the
[01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:22.740]   weekend and he talked about what I think he defined. What is this
[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:25.200]   new doctrine of economic statecraft? He said, our
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:30.300]   objective is we have the power to impose overwhelming costs on
[01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:35.460]   our target. Okay. Economic costs. And he said our cause Putin's
[01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:39.480]   actions are remembered as a strategic failure, not regime
[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:40.380]   change.
[01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:44.040]   That's what's within our control. That is very different.
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:51.600]   Bush wanted regime change in Iraq, and we executed it through the PAL doctrine of
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:57.480]   overwhelming military force. I think that this is a doctrine of overwhelming economic force that is
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:02.160]   meant to not only signal to the Russians, but every other rogue dictator in the world. If you
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:07.260]   go rolling into your neighbor uninvited, you can count on the fact that there's going to
[01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:12.840]   be massive economic sanctions because our our military deterrence is no longer a deterrent.
[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:17.820]   Everybody knows we're not going to go defend Taiwan. Everybody knows we're not going to send
[01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:24.240]   our military into Ukraine. So we have to demonstrate that we actually have economic resolve, not these
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:29.100]   poo poo sanctions we've been having around the world for the last 20 years. And if that is the
[01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:36.420]   lasting impact on this, I think you're right. You know that we turn this into an economic nuclear weapon. Yeah.
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:41.100]   It's better than sending our kids, you know, running around the world to get killed.
[01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:45.240]   I think you're absolutely right. And I think Tony is very smart to say what he said.
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:52.260]   The one thing that I would want, though, on top of that, tell me if you agree, is just to ratchet
[01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:58.200]   down our rhetoric, which we can control. And maybe to, I mean, why not say that,
[01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:02.700]   listen, we're willing to put these sanctions on the table. We're willing to basically
[01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:07.140]   reinstitute economic ties with Russia if we can get to a satisfactory outcome.
[01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:08.280]   Well, you don't want to reward them.
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:12.480]   I mean, David, the only thing I would say is we're making a big assumption to say that there's not
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:18.060]   back channel diplomacy going on from the Israelis, the Turks, the French, you know,
[01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:24.000]   having those conversations on our behalf. Right. Like, I don't I honestly, I don't know that
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.620]   that's a high probability that we're not sending those signals. But to your point, I just don't
[01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:33.000]   know. I don't know. I hope that it is. I don't know either. But I don't know either. But
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.080]   here's what I would say is, look, I can only judge from the public statements. And I think there is signal
[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:43.620]   in these public statements. And the statements are all one way. There is no olive branch. It's
[01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:50.160]   all it's all basically about escalation. Just like in January before the war, what were the
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:55.140]   State Department's statements about the situation? They said that NATO's door is open and will remain
[01:20:55.140 --> 01:21:00.540]   open, even though they told Zelensky in private that he would not be joining NATO. Okay, that was
[01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:07.020]   an astounding revelation that came out this week on the Freed Zakaria show. Number two, Blinken was
[01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:12.060]   saying that there was no change in the American position and there would be no change. They said
[01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:17.040]   these are all public statements that the US would never recognize the Russian annexation of Crimea
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:23.160]   never. You know, he said that we went into these peace talks represent our core values. There's no
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:28.200]   change on that. So in other words, it's been the position of the United States to be hardline with
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:34.500]   Russia to basically engage in no compromise whatsoever. And it's basically to double down.
[01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:36.960]   It's a double down. You assume you assume David, you don't know, those
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:40.080]   are the public statements. I know, but you're assuming that there's no back channels going on.
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:44.700]   And just to just to wrap this up, I wanted to make one quick point, Chamath, which was, you know,
[01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:50.280]   what if we offer to take the sanctions off, and then we are training Putin that these kind of
[01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:56.760]   misadventures get him something, Don Bass, etc. And that the sanctions roll off. So isn't there
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:22:02.100]   a possibility Chamath that if we don't keep the sanctions up, we're actually rewarding his behavior?
[01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:06.660]   I'm a huge guys. Look, I've been the first person in the front of the line on sanctions. I thought
[01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:13.740]   it was the most brilliant approach to this whole thing. And I still believe that sanctions work. And
[01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:18.720]   I think that this will cripple that country. What I'm saying, though, is that there are these moments
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:24.000]   where instead of then sticking to the rhetoric that Tony talked about, what he said, I don't know,
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.800]   Brad, where Tony said this, this weekend, but like, sticking to that, there are these added
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:33.600]   flourishes that I think are unnecessary. So what I mean by that is the talk about, you know, us
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:36.840]   reacting, or retaliating for the use of chemical
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:41.580]   weapons. Biden made a campaign vow, I don't know if you guys remember this about nuclear weapons,
[01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:46.980]   where, you know, he was very clear that, you know, it is a mechanism to demonstrate that
[01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:53.820]   this deterrence exists. And instead, he actually caved. And instead, he put out this carefully
[01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:57.540]   worded statement, which kind of walked back the campaign vow earlier this week, and I'll just read
[01:22:57.540 --> 01:23:01.740]   it to you. I'll just read what the Wall Street Journal said. It said by President Biden stepping
[01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:06.780]   back from a campaign vow has embraced the long standing US approach of using the threat of a
[01:23:06.780 --> 01:23:12.360]   potential nuclear response to deter conventional and other nuclear dangers in addition to nuclear
[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:17.220]   ones. During the 2020 campaign, Biden promised to work towards a policy in which the sole purpose
[01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:23.520]   of US nuclear, the nuclear arsenal would be deter or respond to an enemy nuclear attack instead.
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:30.120]   Now it holds that the fundamental role of the nuclear arsenal will be to deter, but that it
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:36.720]   leaves the opening to respond and use it in extreme circumstances. So these are big changes. And if
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:42.420]   our whole goal is to just focus the service area to an economic set of sanctions. These are somewhat
[01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:46.620]   unnecessary. Would we all agree we don't need to talk about changing our nuclear policy? Yeah,
[01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:51.480]   Biden was right on the campaign trail, the United States of America should never use nukes,
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:57.120]   except if nukes are used on us. Come on, we know that. Yeah. And we're talking about changing that
[01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:01.980]   now. That's insane. No, we changed it. We changed it. Look, it shows that there there's an influence
[01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:06.660]   in our government, our State Department of certain hardline elements who want
[01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:11.520]   to have this very tough policy that includes destabilizing the Russian regime and maybe
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:17.460]   toppling Putin. I'm just saying that objective is not worth all the existential risks that we're now
[01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:22.800]   facing. All right, do we want to touch on the CCP tax cuts? We want to wrap we're at 80 minutes.
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:27.720]   I mean, the the CCP tax cuts harkens me back, Brad, you can react to this because you lived
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:32.820]   it with me. 2018 19. I'll say it again, we were in this unique moment where,
[01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:36.600]   you know, we were not sure whether there was runaway rampant inflation,
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:43.500]   and in q4 of 2018, the Fed basically said, Okay, you got us, you know, the boogeyman exists,
[01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:46.860]   we're gonna go tame inflation, and they ran forward and raised rates.
[01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:54.360]   And lo and behold, the Chinese economy turned over in q1 of 2019. We had like a, you know,
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:59.760]   a kind of a blippy little recession. And we had to overcome it because China became stimulative.
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:06.540]   Now, here we are, again, we're worried about this inflationary boogeyman. And the Chinese government,
[01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:11.640]   basically extended these tax cuts, increase the tax cuts, and essentially said, we're going to be
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:17.700]   very stimulative in the economy, especially through the back half of the year. Now, China,
[01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:24.120]   again, is a massively export driven economy, right? So the reality is that as goes China,
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:29.940]   so goes the rest of our economies. And so I think that it's a setup where how can the United States
[01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:35.100]   be under so much inflationary pressure, where China is effectively telling you that we are in a
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:42.660]   contraction and a recessionary period. And so if that's where China is, there's a risk that we may
[01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:47.760]   already be there or entering that. And so I think it's a little, you know,
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:54.480]   can you hit two really important points, Juma number one, which we didn't get to earlier. I
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:26:00.300]   tweeted a few weeks ago, the feds probably behind the curve on recession, not inflation. Right? We
[01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:05.460]   have massive demand destruction going on right now in the US economy, massive producer define
[01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:06.420]   what that means, Brad,
[01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:12.180]   I mean, if you just think about what a $6 gas mean, what does no stimmy checks mean? What is
[01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:16.440]   the fact that you actually have to go and get a job again mean, you know, we're, we're rolling
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:20.580]   back trillions of dollars off the Fed balance sheet, I'll tell you what it means is that people
[01:26:20.580 --> 01:26:26.520]   can't spend as much money. Just the increase in the 30 year mortgage means you're buying power
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:31.860]   in December four months ago, to buy a house and you if you could afford 1200 bucks a month,
[01:26:31.860 --> 01:26:36.360]   that buying power budget $350,000 house today, it buys you a $290,000 house.
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:43.620]   $35,000 house, people's ability, right to have money to spend money is getting crushed. So I
[01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:49.920]   think we are going to face an economic slowdown. If you look at the PMI. So this was the inflation
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:57.300]   read in January, little people didn't really notice it. PMI in January came in at point two
[01:26:57.300 --> 01:27:04.740]   versus the consensus estimate estimate of point six. That means the producer level of inflation
[01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:06.300]   was meaningfully less than the inflation rate. So that's a big difference. And then the second point
[01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:10.560]   is that the market is going to be less than we expected. If you look at consumer confidence,
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:16.680]   it's plummeted one of the four biggest drawdowns over the last 20 years, retail sales in UK this
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:21.780]   morning crashing consumer confidence in the UK crashing. The Chinese government sees this we're
[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:27.000]   we're not surprised to look at the what's going on in the world with energy prices. We've never
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:32.640]   had oil over 120 bucks and not gone into a recession. We're facing a global slowdown.
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:35.700]   That will have big implications for inflation, big
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:41.160]   implications for rates. But China sees this coming and says we're going to get ahead of
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:46.800]   this. We've got a People's Congress in November, we promised him five and a half percent GDP growth,
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:52.020]   3 trillion of that is export driven. That means if Europe in the United States catches a cold,
[01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:57.840]   they catch the flu. Okay, so they have to do everything in their power. This is why they're
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:03.780]   not going to supply the Russians with weapons, right? Because it's economically assassinating
[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:06.180]   themselves. Right? So we have
[01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:11.640]   this interconnected world, this idea that we're de globalizing, what we do doesn't impact anybody
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:17.580]   else like that ship is sailed a long time ago. And the Chinese see this. That's why I think there's
[01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:23.460]   also a probability by the Middle East this summer, the Fed in the United States is saying we now see
[01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:29.040]   a balanced risk between growth and inflation. Sachs, let's get you in on this. Just as we wrap
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:36.120]   here. The Chinese Communist Party premier talked about tax costs. And this is a quote fertilizer applied directly
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:39.960]   to the roots of the economy tax rebates look like reductions, but actually are in addition,
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:46.260]   today give back tomorrow you get more in returns. Does this mean the United States, people will go
[01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:50.160]   back and get jobs because they need to have more money and that maybe we should be looking at,
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:56.040]   you know, tax cuts at some point. Listen, Jake, I think we got big problems here at home in the
[01:28:56.040 --> 01:29:00.960]   United States, Brad and Chamath, they've laid out these gigantic economic risks that are facing the
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:06.060]   country. You know, I tweeted at the beginning of the year, January 24, the President's main job is
[01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:10.860]   to ensure peace and prosperity. And Biden's popularity was already plummeting. I think this
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:15.900]   is when his poll numbers were at 38%. But if he gets us into war and recession, he ain't seen
[01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:22.980]   nothing yet. This war, the longer it drags on, the longer it basically can spin out of control
[01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:30.000]   and become something worse that sucks us in, the longer it creates the risk of basically causing a
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:36.000]   recession in the United States. We need the American we need the Biden administration to help try and
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.540]   lead to a better outcome here instead of ratcheting up the rhetoric.
[01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:43.860]   All right, folks, there you have it. That's your all in podcast for this week.
[01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:49.200]   Thanks so much to Brad Gerstner for joining us and filling in for the Sultan of Science.
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:50.460]   BG. Thanks, bro.
[01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:55.680]   And a lot of great announcements here. Brad will also be joining us for the all in summit.
[01:29:55.680 --> 01:30:01.740]   We're about to wrap up tickets. We've announced a bunch of great speakers for the event May 15,
[01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:05.940]   16 and 17 in Miami. You can just do a search for the all in summit.
[01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:11.400]   We have given out. We've sent 200 emails to people who asked for scholarships and 100 of them have
[01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:17.460]   taken the tickets. 500 of the 650 tickets or so are accounted for. We'll be wrapping up registration in
[01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:22.860]   the next week or two. And we look forward to seeing you all at the New World Symphony in South Beach.
[01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:25.500]   You got any announcements of people who else is appearing?
[01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:29.820]   Oh, my Lord, we have great announcements. Keith, her boy is coming. Joe Lonsdale is coming. Nate
[01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:36.960]   Silver is coming. Nate Silver. I love Nate Silver. We decided Chamath we would have people do 15 to
[01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:46.560]   20 minute TED style talks like position papers. And so who else do we have doing that? Tim Urban
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:51.000]   of Wait But Why who is a brilliant TED speaker and writer. Nate Silver is going to do that. And then
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:58.680]   Antonio is coming. He was just on and he was just on Rogan show. And so we're going to have these
[01:30:58.680 --> 01:30:59.800]   like 20 minute TED talks. And then we're going to have a lot of great announcements. And then we're
[01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:02.580]   kind of hits, then the besties will sit with them, we'll do
[01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:06.100]   those back to back. Kimball musk is going to come and talk about
[01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:08.920]   his dow that he's doing for nonprofits, Brad, we're going to
[01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:11.840]   talk about what topics so we're collecting all this talent and
[01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:13.660]   then we'll figure out what positions are going to play in
[01:31:13.660 --> 01:31:16.300]   the show, and what the themes will be but the themes will
[01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:18.800]   match what we've been talking about here, and we don't want to
[01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:22.540]   pre set the themes six or seven weeks seven weeks out from the
[01:31:22.540 --> 01:31:24.340]   event because we don't know what the world will look like then.
[01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:26.860]   And then Freeberg said he wanted to do a position paper and
[01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:28.760]   actually give a 20 minute talk. So besties will have that
[01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:32.180]   ability. And besties will start the event and end the event.
[01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:34.660]   Tons of different speakers rotating in and out talking about
[01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:37.340]   the most important topics of our time, but I would like to have
[01:31:37.340 --> 01:31:40.540]   Peter there. Can you get Peter Thiel to come? He was maybe the
[01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:44.360]   most iconoclastic please. I'm just not I'm just not I have to
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:47.480]   get over my uncertainty that this whole conference thing is
[01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:51.580]   really a grift. It's great. We're putting all the money is
[01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:54.880]   going back into the event. And we gave 200 scholarships, there
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:57.560]   will be no profit from the other needs to be a really nice swag
[01:31:57.560 --> 01:31:58.640]   bag. And I think it was
[01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:03.140]   already at $600 a person I just spent three or 400. What is the
[01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:07.340]   material of the hoodie? All right. If it's got a cashmere
[01:32:07.340 --> 01:32:11.240]   hoodie, if to be on brand, off brand for people need to be able
[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:13.580]   to buy up to the to the special hoodie,
[01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:17.760]   Brad, I just spent $600,000 per gift bag for 600 gift bags.
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:20.980]   Okay, it's like 400 grand in gift bags. And Chamath wants to put a
[01:32:20.980 --> 01:32:24.820]   $6,000 sweater in there. I just wanted to know what the material
[01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:27.300]   was of the hoodie in the bag. That's all I'm just asking a
[01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:27.680]   question.
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:28.480]   This is my life, Brad.
[01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:31.860]   I am busting my ass to put this event on and then Chamath
[01:32:31.860 --> 01:32:35.200]   complaining about the gift bag. Sax is complaining on me making a
[01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:38.200]   dollar from it. And freebergs having a panic attack that we
[01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:41.100]   don't have enough great speakers and I'm doing all the work. It's
[01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:43.360]   my whole fucking life. I appreciate you Jay Kell.
[01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:45.920]   I'm going to say some nice stuff to me. You did say some nice
[01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:49.360]   stuff. I want to get on board with you getting a fee for your
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:52.540]   hard work. You know, I don't need to give you like an hourly wage,
[01:32:52.540 --> 01:32:56.480]   you know, $15. I know I'm not your wage slave David Sachs. I'm
[01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:57.340]   working hard here.
[01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:01.620]   I'm working hard. But I just want to be appreciated.
[01:33:01.620 --> 01:33:06.140]   I don't think you should have like a cotton blend is my I think
[01:33:06.140 --> 01:33:06.260]   it's
[01:33:06.260 --> 01:33:11.220]   by the way, Brad, do you have any thoughts on the sushi? Is
[01:33:11.220 --> 01:33:14.440]   there? Should we be using brown rice and not the two line caught
[01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:15.000]   tuna?
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.120]   No, just make sure there's gold gold leaf on the sushi.
[01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:23.700]   No, literally, we're spending, I think for 300 or 14,000 per
[01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:27.120]   party. It's over a million dollars in parties. And I'm
[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:28.160]   talking to talent.
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:31.460]   Bookers about serious talent coming to perform. Drake, can you
[01:33:31.460 --> 01:33:35.540]   get drink? How about that's $3 million. Dua Lipa $2 million.
[01:33:35.540 --> 01:33:40.380]   I'm deep in $2 million. That's what I got. How much is don't you
[01:33:40.380 --> 01:33:43.160]   catch? She's great. I think those are all seven figures. I
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:46.340]   would like to anyway, what I'm trying to find while use of
[01:33:46.340 --> 01:33:48.260]   running while the use of that mean that would make it an
[01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:51.240]   incredible part. Oh, God. I mean, I really would like to get
[01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:53.520]   by saying how much is Drake again? $2 million. I heard
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:57.220]   two to three million for training bags and get Drake. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.760]   Cancel the bag. Give it all the drink.
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:06.460]   So you guys are saying and all the work I do, I should take $2
[01:34:06.460 --> 01:34:10.040]   million and hand it to fucking Drake. Yes, yes.
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:15.700]   Drake is more valuable than you drink. Five years of working on
[01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:19.420]   events and media Brad. And these these are my friends were like,
[01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:23.400]   take the two million put in your pocket and finally make a profit
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:26.100]   on your work. And just hand 2 million in a bag.
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:32.340]   I need the bag. I get a plane. I'm trying to get a jet card.
[01:34:32.340 --> 01:34:35.460]   Do we get to work with Drake on which songs he's he would sing?
[01:34:35.460 --> 01:34:38.700]   I think he does like a medley of like three. What I would like to
[01:34:38.700 --> 01:34:42.060]   do is have three songs for two. Come on. I think it's basically
[01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:45.960]   like 100,000 a minute. I think that's what you're in for 100,000
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:47.040]   per minute. 20 minutes.
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:52.320]   seems egregious. No, I mean, these guys get paid bank when I
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:55.080]   hired Snoop. He did like 20 songs for me. It was
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:57.360]   unbelievable. And what was that two or three hours show?
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:34:58.680]   100? 250?
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:01.040]   That's because he forgot he was there.
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:02.840]   Yeah, he had a great time.
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:07.160]   Oh my god, man. He was blowing this joint that was so powerful
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:10.880]   that I was 10 feet away and I got stoned. I mean, it was like,
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:13.280]   he walked in. It was like, I remember cloud.
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:15.080]   It was like 20 Super Bowl shows.
[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:17.180]   Good stuff.
[01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:19.520]   All right, everybody. Love you besties. Love you, Brad.
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:19.940]   Peace.

[01:35:22.580 --> 01:35:25.520]   Rain Man David Sachs.
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:27.520]   I'm going home.
[01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:31.480]   And it said we open source it to the fans and they've just gone
[01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:32.280]   crazy with it.
[01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:33.080]   Love you, West.
[01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:36.280]   I'm going home.

[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:42.520]   Besties are gone.
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:46.120]   That's my dog taking a drive away.
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:47.320]   Wait, no, no.
[01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:49.880]   Oh, man.
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:51.820]   The Badger will meet me at .
[01:35:51.820 --> 01:35:54.460]   We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy
[01:35:54.460 --> 01:35:55.660]   because they're all just useless.
[01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:57.360]   It's like this like sexual tension, but they just have to be like,
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:59.800]   we just need to release that out.
[01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:03.400]   What? You're the B. What? You're a B. You're a B.
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:06.120]   B? What? We need to get merch.
[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:07.960]   Besties are back.
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:16.360]   I'm going all in. I'm going all in.
