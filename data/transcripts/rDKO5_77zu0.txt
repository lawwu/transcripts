[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.020]   If you want to grab your Bible, let's go over to, for a moment, to the book of Proverbs.
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:21.140]   And let's go over to Proverbs, and we're interested in chapter 4.
[00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.780]   And we're interested in verse 18.
[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.020]   I think I may have mentioned this earlier in the class period, if there ever is a verse
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.220]   in the Old Testament that is a wonderful verse on progressive sanctification in the Old Testament,
[00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.760]   it's got to be Proverbs 4.18, "The path of the righteous is like the light of dawn that
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.620]   shines brighter and brighter until the full day."
[00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:55.660]   That is God's ability to change lives, change marriages, change homes.
[00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.980]   And if Christians are involved, and you're counseling Christians, then as the counseling
[00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:08.840]   progresses from one appointment to another appointment, you should be able to see real
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.420]   progress and growth.
[00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.140]   Now some people are going to grow, and some families are going to grow faster than others.
[00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.740]   Some are going to be like turtles.
[00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.820]   Others are going to be like jackrabbits.
[00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.900]   Some will move along very, very quickly, and then others will move along very, very slowly.
[00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:32.860]   But you'll be able to discern progress, the light getting brighter and brighter, sort
[00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.180]   of as the sun comes up, as the day goes along.
[00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.980]   And that's what should be happening in counseling.
[00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.580]   Then you skip down to verse 22, "For they are life to those who find them."
[00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.940]   That is the words of knowledge are, "And health to all the body.
[00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.540]   Watch over your heart with all diligence, for from it flows the springs of life."
[00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:05.740]   Ultimately, real change is not going to be just merely behavioral or external between
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.960]   a husband or a wife, or between parents and their kids.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.820]   Certainly there needs to be behavioral changes.
[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.260]   There needs to be changes in what they say to one another and how they treat one another.
[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.820]   But it's got to be more than that.
[00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:27.380]   It's got to be change on a heart level, how they think and view other people in the family,
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:34.740]   how they think and view their spouse, their children, their parents.
[00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.980]   What they want out of life, what they desire more than anything else, that's what's got
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:40.980]   to change.
[00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.740]   Otherwise, a person is only being a Pharisee if all they're doing is just merely changing
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.580]   externally.
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.780]   And if you can get, for example, you can help a husband and wife deal with communication
[00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.100]   and teach them all kinds of biblical, great biblical truths about communication.
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.660]   But if their heart hasn't substantively changed on the inside, like one of the papers that
[00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:13.380]   you've written on, Vernick's article on communication in the heart.
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.980]   If their heart hasn't really changed on the inside, then all the external behavioral changes
[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.780]   is just merely polishing the brass on the Titanic.
[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.900]   They're all going down eventually.
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.860]   This thing, all the communication techniques in the world is not going to solve problems
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.460]   unless people are fundamentally changed.
[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.940]   All right, so I just say that by way of remembrance.
[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:44.780]   This is what ultimately we're after, and we'll talk a little bit more about this later.
[00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.780]   We are still talking about, in our outline here, what are the process dynamics in marriage
[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.060]   and family counseling?
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.260]   And we've gotten to the point where we started talking about demonstrating good analytical
[00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.700]   and instructive skills.
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.140]   And let me review real quickly, when we were talking about analytical skills, what we're
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.460]   talking about here is don't allow for generalities.
[00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:16.080]   The more specific you can get your counselee to be, the sooner you're going to see change
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.740]   in their life.
[00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:22.140]   Get them to be concrete and get them to be specific.
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:28.440]   Don't allow them to just generalize when you're counseling them.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.460]   Remember to be humble enough to ask for confirmation.
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.420]   And I'm doing this constantly in counseling.
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.540]   I'll stop them and I'll say, "Okay, hold on just for a moment.
[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:47.380]   Let me share with you what I hear you saying, and you tell me whether I'm right or not."
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.060]   What I hear you saying, and I'll put in my own words, I'm not going to repeat the words
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.060]   that they say.
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.780]   I'm going to try to define it in my own words so that I'm putting it together from my own
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.740]   perspective, and I want to see their confirmation of what I'm saying.
[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.060]   So you've got to be humble enough to do that.
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.980]   Be sure to invite your counselee's correction as well.
[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.260]   Now that doesn't mean that everything that your counselee is going to say is going to
[00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.580]   be correct, but at least they know that there can be a free exchange there, and if there
[00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.520]   is something wrong, they can help to correct you.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.460]   So be sure to invite their correction.
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.100]   And be careful about interpreting the influence of the past.
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.940]   We don't want to give the past too much influence, because as Christians, we do not believe that
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.060]   the past determines us.
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.740]   The past does have an effect upon us, but it doesn't determine us.
[00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:48.900]   There are an awful lot of regression therapists who want to define the past as determining
[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.820]   us.
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.740]   Modern psychology basically says that buried somewhere deep in your unconscious, or really
[00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.960]   your subconscious, is the key to your well-being, and you have to peel back layers of consciousness
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.140]   and get down to whatever that is, and only a trained psychotherapist has the capacity
[00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.960]   to be able to do that.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.460]   And that's the key to your well-being, and once you're able to, in a sense, relive that
[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:18.260]   past, then you'll feel a lot better about it, and that'll get rid of all your neurotic
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.220]   tendencies.
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.660]   We don't believe that that's the case at all.
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.100]   But we do believe that certainly the past can have an influence on us.
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:37.880]   We just don't want to give it the overruling power to determine the person at this particular
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.880]   point in time.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.340]   They still, no matter what their past may be, they still have an incredible amount of
[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:50.220]   choice in the present to choose to be God's kind of man or God's kind of woman, regardless
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.860]   of what the past has done.
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:57.380]   Now, you're going to get a husband or wife who will say to you at this point, "Well,
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.460]   you don't know what my husband or my wife has done.
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.060]   You don't understand.
[00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.300]   Back when we were married the first two years, they cheated on me."
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.700]   Well, that certainly has had a huge influence upon you and upon your marriage, there's no
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.460]   doubt about that.
[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.980]   But that has not determined your marriage.
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:22.940]   It's only affected your marriage in as much as you've allowed it to affect your marriage.
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.660]   And it's only affected your marriage in as much as you have not practiced biblical forgiveness
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:32.220]   because they supposedly have repented.
[00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:37.740]   So the past can be influential but not determinative.
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.740]   Which brings us now to instructional skills.
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:47.140]   Because these are the skills that you need when you finally get to that point where you
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:52.740]   understand what their problem is, hopefully you've diagnosed that problem biblically,
[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:57.100]   you know the passages of scripture you want to go to and explain to them to help straighten
[00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:01.580]   out this particular problem and address their heart issues.
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:06.740]   And now it becomes your responsibility, in a sense, to preach and to teach.
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.980]   Now, this is the stuff that we always like to do.
[00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:13.460]   This is usually the stuff that we're really trained to do.
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.220]   But in counseling, it's a little bit different than the preaching dynamic, and you have to
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:21.020]   be careful with this.
[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:27.760]   Similar to preaching, you can use a lot of figures of speech and metaphors and illustrations.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:32.580]   Sometimes I can explain things, I think, in pretty good depth to a counselee, and they
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:38.020]   don't really get it until I use some kind of metaphor or some kind of an analogy or
[00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:41.740]   some kind of illustration, and all of a sudden you can see the lights come on, "Oh, that's
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:42.740]   what you mean.
[00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.300]   I understand now."
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.300]   And that's what it stands out.
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:49.820]   Weeks later in counseling, they'll not remember all the details that I shared with them or
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:54.580]   taught them, but they'll remember that illustration, which will help them to remember key aspects
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.640]   of that detail, those details.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:02.780]   So use a lot of figures of speech, use a lot of metaphors, use a lot of illustrations very
[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:09.300]   liberally in marriage and family counseling.
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.300]   You know, it's interesting.
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:17.940]   You can compare the husband and wife relationship to an awful lot of things.
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:26.100]   Sometimes you can compare the husband and wife relationship like two people in a rowboat.
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:33.420]   Each of them has an oar, and if only one of them's rowing, guess what's going to happen
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.420]   to that boat?
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:35.780]   It's just going to go in a circle.
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:39.000]   They're really not going to make any progress at all.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.860]   You get them both rowing, you're going to make progress.
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.400]   That's a great analogy.
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.940]   If only one of you is committed to this counseling process, then this whole process is just going
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.660]   to go in a circle.
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:56.460]   If both of you are committed to being God's kind of man, God's kind of woman, if you're
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:05.940]   committed to doing that, then we're going to make great progress in this counseling.
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.240]   So use a lot of figures of speech.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:12.660]   You can use scripture and let them read scripture so that they understand that your authority
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:20.060]   is not self-derived because that's meaningless.
[00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:30.180]   I can share with them what John Street thinks that they should do about their marital problems,
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:35.820]   but that's not going to be particularly helpful to them in the long run.
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:40.460]   I can share with them what some prominent psychologist says about their problem, and
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:45.260]   that's not going to be particularly helpful to them in the long run.
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:49.100]   But I can certainly share with them what God says about their problem.
[00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:56.300]   Now that carries clout because it's authoritative.
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.540]   So you're saying to them, "Thus saith the Lord," and if they're Christians, there should
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.260]   be something in their heart that resonates with that.
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.760]   Wow.
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:05.760]   This is God speaking.
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.220]   This is not just John Street speaking.
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:11.100]   This is not just Reuben speaking.
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.440]   This is not just Andrew speaking.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.760]   This is God speaking.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:20.100]   This is what God is saying.
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.660]   And so that carries authority for change.
[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.580]   Use a lot of diagrams as well.
[00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:30.660]   Use a lot of diagrams.
[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:37.460]   And there's a host of them that you could be creative with.
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:47.180]   Use -- you can use the Y diagram, and there's a lot of illustrations you can use off of
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:56.140]   the Y diagram that goes something like this.
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.940]   When the focus of your life is Christ, then there's going to be a certain amount of fruit
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:05.220]   that's going to be godly fruit.
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:12.760]   When the focus of your life is self, then there's going to be a lot of rotten fruit
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:17.760]   in your life and in your marriage.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.960]   So what do you want to do?
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.760]   Do you want to serve Christ, or do you want to serve self?
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:29.440]   If you serve self, then you're in self-destructive mode.
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.360]   And it's going to not only destroy your life, but it's going to destroy your marriage.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:39.920]   If you decide that you're going to follow Christ now, this is authoritative because
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.600]   Christ now is going to enable you to be able to work through your problems.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:48.760]   That doesn't mean the problems are going to be easier.
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:53.860]   It may be difficult to work through them, but he'll give you the answers to these problems.
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:13:03.200]   The difficulty here is, to begin with, this is easy, and this is hard.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:11.200]   Later on, however, as Proverbs says, the way of the transgressor is hard, it gets hard.
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:16.920]   This starts out hard, but it ends up easy.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:23.200]   Now this is very appealing because I want to take the easy road real quickly.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.080]   Just give me a few things to fix my marriage.
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:32.260]   Let me press certain buttons, X, Y, Z, and then everything is going to be taken care
[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.480]   of in my marriage.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.640]   Well, that's not the way it works.
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:43.620]   In fact, this particular way means some substantive changes in your life.
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:48.000]   But if you're willing to make substantive changes, which is really hard to do, then
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.960]   later on life gets easier.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.160]   Marriage becomes fun.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:14:00.480]   God doesn't just want your marriage to survive, he wants your marriage to sing.
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:05.700]   But that means you're going to have to change, and that begins on a heart level.
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:19.220]   How you think, what you want, and desire the most is what rules your heart.
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:24.300]   That's what dominates your life.
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:29.540]   You could have a wife who says, "Well, all I want is for my husband to love me," as we
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:30.540]   talked about before.
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:39.540]   In and of itself, that's a good desire, but that can become an evil desire when she wants
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.780]   it too much.
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:45.460]   All I want is for my husband to love me.
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:49.740]   In other words, that's the thing that she lives for, that's the first thing she thinks
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:55.100]   about when she gets up, it's the last thing she thinks about when she goes to bed.
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.500]   All I want is for my husband to love me.
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:02.020]   Or you can have a husband that says, "All I want is for my wife to respect me."
[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:06.060]   Now in and of itself, that's a very legitimate desire, but that can become an idolatrous
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.700]   desire.
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.940]   How do we know it becomes an idolatrous desire?
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:16.340]   Because when he doesn't receive from her the respect that he thinks he deserves, then he
[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:31.180]   becomes mean, angry, upset, vengeful, or maybe he becomes sullen, depressed, withdrawn, silent.
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.540]   Why?
[00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:38.160]   Because he's not receiving the respect that he thinks he deserves from her.
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:43.160]   When that happens, this has become an idolatrous desire that now rules his heart, and he is
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.860]   serving self.
[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:52.300]   That's the easy path to take, and it manifests itself in all kinds of rotten fruit.
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:55.420]   So use diagrams, there's all kinds of diagrams.
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:16:00.420]   I usually have a whiteboard when I'm counseling right in my office, and right behind me I'm
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:07.260]   able to grab a marker like this and put a diagram on the board, and we're able to talk
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.740]   through all the various aspects of that.
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:15.380]   Or sometimes I'll just use my Bible, especially at a turning point in counseling, and I'll
[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:22.260]   say to them, "Right at this particular point, I sense that both of you, Ben, you and Barbara,
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:23.620]   are at a crossroads.
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:28.340]   You're right at a point, and you can either come down with both feet on man's side, or
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.000]   you can come down with both feet on God's side.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.500]   Now what you've done in the past, from your history and your marriage, you've come down
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.860]   with both feet on man's side, and look where that's brought you.
[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:43.020]   Now we've got one problem after another problem that you're facing.
[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.900]   But you have the capacity to change things right at this particular point.
[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:51.420]   You can come down with both feet on God's side and say, "Listen, no matter what, I'm
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:57.820]   going to do things God's way, whether my wife or my husband decides to do that, irregardless
[00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.780]   of what they decide to do, I'm going to do things God's way.
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.460]   I'm going to handle things from God's perspective."
[00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:09.420]   When you decide to come down with both feet on God's side, then things start to change
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:12.260]   in your life and your marriage.
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:16.380]   Now if only one of you do it, things will get worse before it gets better, because that's
[00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.940]   going to be really convicting to the other one.
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:23.260]   That maybe will make them angry, upset.
[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.380]   That just highlights their sin even more.
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.700]   So things will get worse before they get better.
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:34.660]   I had a counselee just this week, that very thing happened.
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:41.260]   He's been in counseling now for several weeks, and God has brought about some wonderful changes
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:49.700]   in his life, but that has not been true with his wife or his children.
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:59.660]   And in fact, the more he changes for the good, the worse things get around the house.
[00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.900]   Because it's very convicting.
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:07.260]   They realize he's changed, and they haven't.
[00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:12.100]   And I told them, "Things are going to get worse before they get better."
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:13.700]   It's kind of like Joseph, right?
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:18.540]   It's like Joseph, when Joseph kept saying, "No, no, no," repeatedly, the Bible says there
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:23.100]   in Genesis 39 to Potiphar's wife.
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:27.460]   After resisting that temptation, resisting temptation, you think that God would have
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:29.740]   blessed him and honored him.
[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.180]   But what's the fruit of that?
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.380]   Things got worse before they got better.
[00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.900]   He got thrown into prison as a result.
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.420]   I know a lot of Christians who say, "Wait a minute, Lord.
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.260]   I resisted all this temptation.
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.420]   I obeyed you, and look where I'm at.
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.420]   I'm in prison.
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.860]   I get thrown into prison.
[00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:49.720]   I'm falsely accused."
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:57.880]   So they sort of obey God with an ulterior motive.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:03.040]   A lot of husbands' wives will do that, they'll obey God with an ulterior motive.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:08.000]   They'll obey God in order to get their husband or wife to straighten up.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:14.560]   That's very convenient, but it's not biblical.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.920]   Use a lot of open questions as well.
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:22.600]   Those questions only seek yes and no answers, right?
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.800]   "Did you have a good week?"
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.160]   Yes.
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:31.440]   It's better to ask them, "Tell me about your week.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.440]   What happened this week?"
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:39.200]   "Well, I did this."
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:43.520]   "Well, what did you do after you did that?
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:48.040]   Tell me how you interacted with one another this week.
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.560]   Did you have any problems?
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:50.560]   Did you have any conflicts?
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.400]   Did you have any arguments?
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.600]   Any quarrels?"
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.320]   Use a lot of open questions.
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:01.120]   You'll get a lot more data that way.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.120]   And use a lot of role plays.
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:10.600]   Don't be afraid to put yourself in Ben's position or Barbara's position.
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:14.000]   Use a lot of role plays.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.760]   Sometimes I'll do that in counseling to help them understand how they need to respond to
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:24.040]   one another.
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.920]   So use a lot of role plays.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:51.800]   Use worst case scenarios, like the wife who says, she communicates to you that she's very
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:58.000]   afraid of trusting God and submitting to her husband.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.280]   If I do that, he's going to ruin us financially.
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:15.200]   If I really practice biblical submission, as Ephesians 5 talks about, or 1 Peter 3 talks
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:22.760]   about, or Colossians 3 talks about, if I really do this, it'll ruin me.
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:35.120]   In fact, I'm supervising a gal who's counseling a woman who's in that situation right now.
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:40.000]   This woman, this is her third marriage.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.320]   The first two, she was not a believer.
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:50.200]   In this marriage, she was a believer, but she met this guy at a church, and this guy
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:55.600]   had recently been saved out of the drug culture.
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:04.400]   And turns out to be a fairly irresponsible guy.
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.440]   But he shows signs of changing, which is a good thing.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:11.760]   Shows signs of changing.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:19.040]   And she's incredibly worried over the fact that if she submits herself to her husband,
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:26.320]   that she'll lose everything, which that's certainly possible.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:37.360]   He could totally mismanage everything in the house, lose all the money that she has accumulated
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:43.880]   over years of really hard work.
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.200]   But that doesn't change the Bible.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:49.320]   The Bible doesn't have a footnote in it that says, "Okay, wives, submit yourselves to your
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.400]   husbands," and then you go down the footnote and it says, "Except for you wives who have
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.680]   married husbands that appear to be irresponsible."
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:58.600]   It doesn't say that.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.440]   There's no caveat there.
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:05.480]   In fact, the key thing is not holding on to the wealth of this world.
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:10.400]   The key thing is seeing past the wealth of this world and seeing the spiritual needs
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.400]   of the husband.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:20.680]   Maybe she can be a dynamic testimony of responsibility and trust in God if she's willing to really
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:25.480]   submit herself into her husband.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:30.480]   Or she could easily say to you, "But if that's true, I'll lose my shirt."
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:36.880]   Well, you could say, "That's true.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:43.000]   You could do that, but it could be worse."
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.460]   What could be worse?
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:54.480]   We would lose our home and our car and, well, that would be terrible, but it could be worse.
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.240]   What could be worse than that?
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.240]   We lose our shirt.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.240]   We lose our car.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.240]   We lose our home.
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.760]   What are we?
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:01.760]   Out on the street.
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:06.120]   I said, "That would be terrible, but it could be worse."
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.920]   "I don't know.
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:13.240]   What do you mean worse?"
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.960]   We could die of starvation.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:21.000]   Now, that certainly would be bad, but it could be worse.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.040]   What are you talking about?
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:28.920]   What's the worst thing?
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.480]   The worst thing is she could dishonor God.
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:35.620]   That's the worst thing.
[00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:41.240]   She could dishonor God in this situation.
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:48.440]   Is obeying God more important than life?
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:52.760]   It's a great question, isn't it?
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.440]   Is obeying God more important than life?
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:04.000]   Well, if it's not, then certainly Christians down through the ages gave their life for
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:16.560]   not much because rather than disobeying God, they were martyred.
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:17.560]   What's the worst thing?
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.000]   What's the worst case scenario?
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.240]   Are you going to obey God or not?
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:24.120]   Does God know what's best for you and your marriage?
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:27.760]   I think you have to settle that issue deep in your heart.
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:34.320]   Do you believe that the Word of God has your long-term interests in mind and the best for
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.800]   your marriage in mind?
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.800]   Do you believe that?
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:44.960]   If you don't, then you've come to the wrong counselor because you came asking for guidance
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.760]   from the Bible and that's what I'm giving you.
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:51.680]   What are you going to do?
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.000]   Use worst case scenarios.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.440]   Furthermore, use your counselee's involvement in readings, responding to questions, opinions.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:00.680]   Get them involved in the interactive process.
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.600]   This should not be one way.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.600]   In counseling, you're not just dumping your favorite Bible lessons on people.
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:09.160]   You're getting them to interact with the Bible.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.580]   Sometimes I like to make that distinction.
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:16.200]   A lot of counselors like to dispense the Bible rather than minister the Bible.
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.480]   We're not out to dispense the Bible.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.560]   We want to minister the Bible.
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.200]   There's a big difference between the two.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:26.560]   A person who dispenses the Bible has a lot of favorite Bible lessons and a lot of favorite
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.520]   things that they like to teach people.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:34.400]   They want people to be able to say, "Whoa, look, man, they are an incredible Bible teacher."
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.320]   That's a person who dispenses Bible truth.
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:42.480]   But then there is a person who really cares about the counselee and looks at life through
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:49.160]   their eyes, who ministers the Bible to them in such a way that it makes it easy for that
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:55.560]   counselee to bring their life into conformity with the truth of that Bible.
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:27:00.920]   So rather than dispensing truth, we minister truth.
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.080]   How do you do that?
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.720]   You get them involved.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.680]   You get them interacting.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:10.720]   You get them reading stuff and responding to it and questioning.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.040]   You talk about opinions.
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.360]   You talk about their likes.
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:16.800]   You talk about their dislikes.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.160]   Some of them you can take seriously.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.680]   Others you don't take seriously.
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:29.280]   That's not the important thing, but you're interacting with them as a person created
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:38.080]   in the image of God who should be treated with respect and their problems should be
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:43.760]   treated with respect.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:48.720]   So you use their involvement in their readings, responding to questions and opinions.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:53.840]   Furthermore, you use a lot of encouragement.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:58.840]   I think the Apostle Paul, when you read through the epistles, he was an expert at this.
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:03.760]   Sometimes he could chide people like he does in the book of Galatians, and sometimes he
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:10.800]   can compliment them for their great faithfulness like he does in 1 Thessalonians, 2 Thessalonians.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:16.520]   The Apostle Paul is real good, but when he comes to the truth, he doesn't compromise
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:24.320]   and he doesn't, in a sense, withhold admonishment.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:31.360]   He gives it to them straight, but then he encourages them, he urges them, he pleads
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:34.640]   with them, he persuades them.
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:40.160]   All of those are good biblical verbs and that's what we should be doing too.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:47.980]   We're trying to encourage them to follow the truth.
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.120]   And sometimes that's exactly what counselees need.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:55.000]   They know it, and they know it's going to be hard to really make the changes that are
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.560]   necessary for their home and their family.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:04.280]   And all they need is somebody saying, "Now God has given you the enablement to be able
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:12.720]   to do this, you just need to go home and do it."
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:18.820]   Sometimes that encouragement comes in loving admonition, sometimes it comes in the form
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:22.120]   of rebuke.
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:30.160]   Dr. Bob Smith was a physician that I trained under when I first taught my biblical counseling
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.160]   training.
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:35.040]   I'll never forget, I sat in on a counseling session with him and a young man.
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:42.920]   This young man was about 25 years of age and in the previous counseling appointment, Bob
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:51.640]   had given him an assignment to go to his unsaved father and repent of some sins that he had
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.880]   done against his father.
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:30:04.440]   The young man was reluctant to do that, to say the least, because the unsaved father
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.840]   was a volcano.
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:13.920]   You never knew when he was going to go off.
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:18.000]   So the kid was somewhat intimidated by the father.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:24.220]   But the kid was a Christian, and Bob admonished him, "Listen, you can do this because God
[00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.160]   will give you an enablement to do it.
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:31.320]   You need to go and confess this is a sin before your father, seek his forgiveness, and try
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:37.960]   to restore whatever relationship you have with your father, you need to do that."
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.160]   And the kid, "All right, all right."
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.960]   So they had prayer, finished the session, he went off.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:49.060]   Week later, kid came back in, sat down, they had prayer, and first thing Bob says, "Well,
[00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.520]   how'd it go with your father?"
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:58.300]   The kid said, "Well, you know, I did most of my homework, but I didn't do that."
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:02.500]   And I remember I was sitting at the end of the table, and Bob was on, I was at one end
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:07.860]   of a long table, and Bob was on the one side, the kid was on the other side, and there was
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:10.560]   somebody else in our counseling class who was on the other end, and I'm sitting there
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:14.700]   taking notes, and there was this long silence.
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:22.340]   So I'm writing down in my notes, "effective long silence."
[00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:29.260]   And suddenly, Bob, if you've ever seen Bob Smith, he has a crew cut, looks like he just
[00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:40.720]   walked out of the Marines, stood up and slammed his hand down on the table and leaned across
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:44.580]   the table and said to the young man, "Young man, you are playing games with God, aren't
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.300]   you?"
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:49.160]   This young man was a pretty big guy, and I'm thinking, "Oh, my goodness, they're gonna
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.740]   get into a fight right here in the counseling room."
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:55.500]   And so I'm burying myself in the notes, I'm going, "If this is what counseling is, there's
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:32:00.140]   no way I'm ever gonna be a biblical counselor, there's no way I could ever do this."
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:04.820]   And that young man kind of looked up at him and stared at him for a moment and broke into
[00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:10.340]   tears, and he said, "Yeah," he says, "that's what I've been doing."
[00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:14.140]   He said, "Your problem is not with your father right now, your problem is with God, and you
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:18.820]   need to repent before God because you're not willing to do what God wants you to do.
[00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:19.820]   You need to go to your father."
[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:22.500]   Spent the rest of the hour talking about that very thing.
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:27.260]   Bob even put himself in a role play where he, in a sense, became the kid's father, and
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:31.420]   he ran him through the worst possible scenario of how his father would respond and help him
[00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:35.280]   to understand how he needs to respond to his father.
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:39.240]   At the end of the session, that kid was full of all kinds of confidence.
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:44.240]   He went off, by the next appointment, he came back, and sure enough, he had gone to his
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:48.640]   father, confessed his sins, asked his father's forgiveness, and to his surprise, his father
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:52.000]   actually responded with a considerable amount of love.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:33:00.240]   The kid was shocked, never seen his father react like that before, just in shock.
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:04.380]   And at that particular point, that kid became a great testimony for Christ in front of that
[00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:07.860]   father.
[00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:08.860]   But you know what?
[00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:12.400]   I thought to myself, after that was all over with, I thought, "You know what, John?
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:18.360]   You would have never loved that kid enough to admonish him."
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.140]   That kid needed an admonishment.
[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:21.880]   He was just dragging his feet.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:26.300]   I mean, he clearly understood what the Bible said about doing this.
[00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:32.440]   He needed to confess the sin before his father and seek his father's forgiveness, and even
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:37.140]   though his father is an unbeliever and his father will not truly be able to forgive him
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:45.640]   in a biblical sense, he still needed to do it, and I wouldn't have loved that kid enough
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:53.240]   to admonish him, but Bob did.
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:34:02.080]   So sometimes that encouragement comes in the form of some direct admonition, not in an
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.080]   unloving way.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:07.440]   I'm not talking about being harsh, I'm not talking about being mean, I'm not talking
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:11.080]   about being hateful with your counselor, I'm not talking about that.
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:17.200]   I'm talking about communicating how serious you are about them following through and obeying
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:20.040]   what the Bible says.
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:26.680]   Sometimes I think we don't do that because we're not serious about it in our own life
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:36.400]   as counselors, but this is critical.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:51.280]   This demonstrates a person who really wants to love their counselees in a biblical way.
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:55.120]   In fact, I'm going to ask you to grab your Bible just for a moment and let's go back
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:35:09.560]   to the book of Proverbs, and I want to go over to Proverbs chapter 24 and I'm interested
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:15.400]   in verse 23.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:21.160]   These are the sayings of the wise, "To show partiality in judgment is not good."
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:36.040]   When you are partial to your counselee, you're pandering to their sinful ways.
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:40.800]   You're not really helping them.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:48.080]   And a real counselor will not do that.
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:57.640]   They will not allow the counselee to walk away without being seriously encouraged to
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:00.040]   follow the truth.
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.040]   One other passage.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:04.760]   Let's go over to Proverbs 27 and verse 5.
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:11.160]   "Better," Solomon says, "is open rebuke than love that is concealed.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:17.760]   Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but deceitful are the kisses of an enemy.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:22.200]   You've become your counselee's worst enemy if all you do is try to kiss up to them and
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:28.960]   tell them things that you know that they want to hear."
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:34.240]   Now more often than not, when you hear encouragement used in counseling, you hear it from the standpoint
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:37.400]   of a psychologized self-esteem type of encouragement.
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:44.440]   "Well, encourage them to have self-confidence, to not feel inferior, da-da-da-da-da."
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:47.560]   And certainly, there are some people who need more confidence.
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:51.240]   Not so much in themselves, but confidence in God and trust in God and confidence in
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.320]   the Word of God in order to follow through.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:57.160]   They need that.
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.940]   And you're the one who can give that to them.
[00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:05.960]   You can encourage them with that confidence, but you've got to be willing to rebuke them.
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.600]   Better is open rebuke than love that is concealed.
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:10.400]   In other words, this is love.
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:20.000]   You are showing love when you're encouraging your counselee to follow and obey God.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.720]   Let's pick up where we left off there and in there in your notes, make plans and follow
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:30.440]   an agenda, but be ready to scrap it.
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:35.480]   Every counseling appointment you have, it's vitally important that you plan for it.
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:39.600]   You've heard that old saying, "People who fail to plan, plan to fail."
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:44.040]   Well, that's true.
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.040]   You got to have a plan.
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.080]   Where are you going to go in the next counseling appointment?
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:52.840]   In fact, sometimes when we're certifying people for counseling, we have an 11-question thing
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:59.120]   with each counseling session that they have, and at the end of it, the last question out
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:03.080]   of those 11 questions is, "What are your future plans for this counseling?"
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:05.520]   I want to see that enumerated.
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.520]   What are your plans?
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:07.520]   Where do you want to go with this?
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:11.960]   Now, you realize that God can interrupt those with a variety of different things, but at
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.280]   least you have a plan.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:18.360]   You have something that you have thought through carefully, and you have a direction where
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.540]   you're going.
[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:23.000]   You can see where the progress is taking place.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.760]   You're not just meandering through counseling because that'll communicate to your counselee
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:35.040]   that there really is no hope and we're not getting anywhere when you don't have a good
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.040]   goal and direction.
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.800]   We already talked about that.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:49.800]   But also, be appropriately open and use self-disclosure as well.
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:58.640]   Self-disclosure is...you've got to be careful with it because it can easily backfire on
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:38:59.640]   you.
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:03.720]   You don't want to glorify sin, but you can talk about the fact that maybe in your personal
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:10.720]   life God has helped you to overcome certain problems with the help of Scripture, and that's
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:14.840]   an encouragement to the counselee, but you don't want to spend a long time dealing with
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:18.420]   the sin because that's all they'll remember from that counseling session.
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:20.340]   We don't want them to remember your sin.
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:22.000]   We want them to remember the Word of God.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.320]   That's what we want them to remember.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:29.480]   So be appropriately open, use self-disclosure.
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:34.080]   Keep momentum up by open-ended questions, by stimulating them to analysis.
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:39.600]   Again, that stresses the importance of being open-ended in your questioning.
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.880]   Don't give the impression that you're in a hurry.
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:45.760]   Don't do that.
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:53.560]   Because that communicates a lack of real hope, or actually, it communicates to your counselee
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:59.280]   the fact that you really don't care, you just got to get them through this session.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:00.280]   Yes?
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:01.280]   >> You probably had this maybe back in Ohio when you were preaching week after week.
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.280]   What do you do when people come up to you after service on Sunday morning and they dump
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:15.280]   the problems of the week on you, and you're kind of in a hurry because you want to talk
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:21.480]   with people, or there's a line, or whatever, do you just say, "Set up an appointment with
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:22.480]   me?"
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.480]   >> Yeah.
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:24.480]   Yeah.
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.480]   That's what I would do.
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:30.600]   His question really centered around if you're busy preaching week in and week out at a church,
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:36.080]   and at the end of a service, people come up to you and want to share a lot of their problems
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:40.200]   and want you to try to counsel them right after service.
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:43.720]   If it's something simple, I'll sit there, or I'll stand there and talk with them a little
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:44.720]   bit.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.280]   Sometimes it's going to take a little bit more time.
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:50.840]   Sometimes I've asked people to step in the office where we could have a little bit more
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:55.760]   of confidentiality, and we'd sit down and talk about it.
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:41:00.640]   But if I see that this is going to be something that's going to be more lengthy, that they
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:04.880]   didn't get into this problem overnight and they're not going to get out of it overnight,
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:08.440]   then it's going to take more intensive work with this couple, then I'll say to them, "Listen,
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.480]   you need to call the secretary this weekend.
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:17.160]   Set up an appointment at some point when I'm open, and I'll love to sit down with you if
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:18.160]   it takes several weeks.
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:21.680]   It takes several weeks, and we'll work through this problem."
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:31.440]   But I don't want to give them simplistic, hurried answers in order to just kind of satisfy
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:33.040]   them temporarily and let them go.
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:39.160]   I want to really get at the hard issues, and that's going to take some work.
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:42.360]   By the way, that's one of the reasons why a lot of pastors don't do counseling, because
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:46.160]   they realize the work it's going to take, and they're not willing to make that kind
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:51.520]   of investment in people's lives.
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:53.160]   And so they'll use all kinds of excuses.
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.840]   They'll say, "Well, I'm not a counselor."
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:42:02.440]   Well, if you're going to be like your savior, then you're going to have to be, because he's
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:05.600]   called Wonderful Counselor, the Prince of Peace.
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:09.360]   If you're going to be like him, you're going to be this way.
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:14.440]   If you're going to be a shepherd, you've got to be this way.
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:20.480]   So you've got to be willing to spend time with people and not just give them quick,
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:23.840]   pat answers.
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:25.880]   So don't give them an impression you're in a hurry.
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:30.400]   Be appropriately authoritative and directive.
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:33.600]   And I love that little passage there in Titus 2:15.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:40.000]   It's kind of tucked in there in Titus, and you have a tendency to think that Timothy
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:46.240]   was the only one who struggled with timidity, but he's not.
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:49.960]   Titus struggled with the same thing.
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:56.000]   Chapter 2 and verse 15 says, "Paul admonishes this young pastor, 'These things speak and
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.720]   exhort and reprove with all authority.
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.680]   Let no one disregard you.'"
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:07.480]   And the word authority is the word command.
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:11.080]   Take these things and command people to follow them.
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:16.400]   Now, we don't like that word in our culture and society today, but it's a good word, to
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.080]   command.
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:20.800]   Command people to follow them.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:24.200]   You've got to follow this because this is what God says.
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:27.440]   Now, again, we're not harsh.
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:29.280]   We're not mean.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:32.040]   We're not hateful when we say that.
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:37.240]   But we certainly communicate that we expect them to obey God.
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:40.440]   We want them to follow through with the Scripture.
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:46.000]   So be appropriately authoritative and directive.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.320]   And then, last of all in this section, allow yourself to identify with and personally experience
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:52.920]   their pain.
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:56.760]   That Romans 12, 15 thing, this is what Jesus did.
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:03.920]   Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 15, "He is able to sympathize with our weaknesses."
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.500]   And this is an ongoing sympathy.
[00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:12.120]   You look at the tense of the verb there, this is something where he is continually able
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:16.120]   to sympathize with our weaknesses and with our struggles.
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:19.240]   He's able to continually do that.
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:29.320]   So all of that has got to be a part of your instructional skills in working with marriages.
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:32.600]   Which now brings us to after and between the sessions.
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:35.800]   After and between the sessions, pray for your counselee.
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:41.360]   Paul's prayer is a good example of that in Philippians chapter 1, verses 9 through 11.
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:44.720]   Pray for them.
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:52.080]   And you've got to be careful because our human desires to see them relieved from their
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:59.680]   problems or their pain can easily infiltrate our prayers in a sinful way.
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:02.960]   And we can begin to pray, "Oh Lord, get them out of this problem.
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:03.960]   Help them to resolve."
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:04.960]   No, no, no.
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:06.660]   That's a bad prayer.
[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:10.280]   God has them in this problem for a reason.
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:17.760]   So a better prayer is, "Lord, teach them everything they will need to know as a result
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:24.280]   of the problems that they're facing in their marriage or in their home or with their children
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:27.880]   so that they can grow appropriately in Christ.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:31.240]   Teach them everything they need to know."
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:34.640]   Oftentimes we have a tendency to want to pray for victory.
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:37.560]   And I understand what people are saying when they want to pray for victory, but I don't
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:44.360]   like that kind of a prayer because to most Christians that implies total escape from
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:45.720]   my problems.
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.760]   Victory means total escape from it.
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:52.920]   When the problems are really God's tool of sanctifying us.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:57.880]   We shouldn't pray for victory, we should pray for faithfulness.
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:02.920]   We need to pray that they are going to be faithful as they face these problems.
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:07.520]   These problems may be serious disagreements between a husband and wife or a serious problem
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:11.840]   with their children and it's not going to be solved overnight.
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:15.080]   And God has a lot for them to learn through these.
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:18.960]   So pray for your counselee.
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:24.200]   After and between sessions you also need to add important details to your notes.
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.800]   Things that come to your mind.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:30.660]   I used to love to counsel with two observers in the counseling room.
[00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:35.240]   Sometimes there would be as many as six people in the counseling room.
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:40.360]   It would be myself as a counselor, the husband and a wife, and if that husband and wife came
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:44.120]   in front of the church we would never counsel them from another church unless they brought
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:51.680]   a leader from the church, a pastor or a deacon or elder with them because our goal was to
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:54.360]   turn them back underneath the ministry of that church and that church needed to know
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.560]   how to shepherd them.
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:59.600]   And by the way that's how we build our counseling training course because those leaders that
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:03.080]   came in to observe the counseling said, "Hey, where did you learn how to do this?"
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:05.200]   I'd say, "Well, we taught our counseling course.
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:10.800]   You can come and learn how to do that," and then they'd take our counseling course.
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.680]   So there would be the husband and wife and there would be the person from their church
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:16.280]   and then there would be two observers that would be sitting in the back.
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:17.800]   They'd be taking notes.
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:21.960]   So after the counseling session was all over with we'd have a debriefing time with the
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:23.360]   observers.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:27.920]   And sometimes those observers would pick up on things that I'd totally miss.
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:31.640]   Maybe my mind was somewhere else or I was looking down at my notes or I was looking
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:35.880]   up something in the Bible and they'd say to me, "By the way, did you see the way that
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:37.440]   she looked at him?"
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:39.440]   I'm going, "No."
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:41.400]   "What did she do?"
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:46.280]   "Well, when you made this statement, did you see the scowl that she gave him?"
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:47.280]   "No."
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:49.640]   "No, I missed that.
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:50.640]   What do you think?
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:51.640]   Why did she do that?"
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:55.960]   Well, then they'd give me within context what they think and I'd go, "Oh wow, that's very
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:56.960]   good.
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:57.960]   I totally missed that.
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:59.240]   So I add this to my notes."
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:03.680]   Those are the kind of things that you end up adding later on in between the sessions
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:10.280]   as you remember them and it helps you to go back and it helps you to piece these things
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:11.960]   together.
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:16.760]   It's hard to get everything that's coming at you in a counseling session, but you need
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:24.120]   to be observant as possible with your counselees and try to write down stuff that you know
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:29.320]   you're going to forget if you don't write it down and then review those notes.
[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:34.440]   D, mentally review the session and prepare for the next one.
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:37.080]   What happened in our last session?
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:46.120]   Now, I'm also supervising another counselor in training right now and this guy is counseling
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:51.760]   a man who has limited schooling, limited background.
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:49:00.440]   He's kind of slow and because of that, the progress in counseling is going to be considerably
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:01.440]   slower.
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:05.920]   He doesn't read real well and so I said, "Okay, listen.
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:10.960]   Every counseling appointment, when you get somebody like this, every counseling appointment,
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:15.540]   you've got to review, review, review, review.
[00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:19.640]   If you have an hour with this guy, a half hour of that counseling appointment is spent
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:22.520]   in reviewing.
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:26.840]   You say to him, "Remember our first appointment where we went over this and this and this?
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:27.840]   You remember that?
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:28.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:30.840]   All right.
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:34.880]   Now, we build on that in the second counseling appointment and then we talked about this
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:38.200]   and this and this and this and this.
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:41.160]   You understand the reason why we talked about that and you remember what we talked about
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:42.160]   from the...
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:43.160]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:44.160]   Well, grab your Bible.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:47.600]   Let's go back there again and we review and we go back, review.
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:50.640]   Every counseling, when you get a counseling like that, it's a little bit slower, maybe
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:56.520]   doesn't have the educational background, is slowly picking up on things, then you need
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:50:00.160]   to do lots of review.
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:05.360]   So you need to do the same thing between counseling sessions.
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:11.000]   You need to mentally review the session and prepare for the next one so that you can pick
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:17.400]   up right where you left off so you know where you're going.
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:22.160]   When they contact you, you need to return phone calls as soon as possible, emails, text
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:25.280]   messages, same thing, consult, do research.
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:30.040]   I mean, there are many times when I've had counseling situations that were real sticky
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:33.520]   wickets in marriage and family and I've not known where to go.
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:35.200]   I'm going, "Man, I am really confused.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.520]   I'm really lost in the details of this."
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:43.520]   So I call a good friend of mine who is a good pastor or good counselor, I'd say, "Listen,
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:44.760]   I got to bounce something off of you.
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:45.760]   Tell me what you think.
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:47.800]   Have you ever had anything like this?"
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:51.840]   And so I'd review the whole thing and he'd say to me, "Oh, yeah, you know, I had some."
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:52.840]   I said, "Well, what did you do?
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:53.840]   How did you handle that?"
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:55.360]   "Well, I handled it this way.
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:59.200]   I took them over in Scripture to this particular passage and I helped them to understand this
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.200]   and that and the other thing, and I'm going, 'Oh, this is great.
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.200]   This is great.
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.200]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:04.200]   That's what I need to do.'"
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:05.200]   So I'm writing down these things.
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:09.360]   So I'm consulting people who I trust, who is committed with the Word of God and handles
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:13.840]   it well, and they'll give me ideas and perspectives that I never had before.
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:14.840]   That's a good thing to do.
[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:19.360]   You can do that after and between your counseling sessions.
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:21.240]   I mean, you know how many emails I get.
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:26.460]   I've been doing this training for many, many years now from former students around the
[00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:34.080]   world every week, and they'll ask questions about this or that, and the questions are
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:35.080]   very simple.
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:38.300]   They're only two or three lines, but it would take sometimes a doctoral dissertation to
[00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.640]   answer them.
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:45.640]   And I mean, I'd be writing forever, and I'll usually say to them, "Listen, your question
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:49.320]   implies, in order to answer this adequately, I'd have to write a dissertation.
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:50.600]   I don't have that kind of time.
[00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:54.120]   I'm going to give you the short answer and give you some sources that you can check on
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:55.760]   and you can do the rest of the work."
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:56.760]   So da, da, da, da, da.
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:58.280]   Here's the direction you need to go.
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:00.680]   There's the passage you need to deal with, and here's some of the books that will help
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:03.680]   you with that.
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:05.680]   Blessings.
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:06.680]   All right?
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:10.600]   So otherwise, all I do, I wouldn't have time to teach or do anything else.
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:12.760]   I'd just be answering e-mails.
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:18.640]   Right now, I'm 185 e-mails behind, all right, in my, in e-mailing.
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:20.680]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:26.360]   Well, your assignment should, half of them should be back in the mail now to you.
[00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:27.360]   So they're half-graded.
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:31.640]   So not all of them are, but they're half-graded.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:38.200]   So all right, then let's talk about analyze and assess.
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:41.640]   This is part of the inventory and interpretation, which is part of the phases of the eight I's
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:44.040]   that we talked about earlier.
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:45.040]   Analyze and assess.
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:47.000]   How do we do that?
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:57.560]   A good counselor will spend time carefully going over the data that they have collected.
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:04.200]   This is what we often refer to as the interpretational phrase, phase of counseling.
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:08.240]   You go over the data that you've collected.
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:13.880]   For example, frequently, we'll use a PDI, which is called a personal data inventory.
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:16.400]   Originally, this was created years ago.
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:20.000]   Jay Adams and some of the people there at CCF created it, and it's in the back of his
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:25.480]   book, Competent to Counsel, or you can get it in the back of the Theology of Christian
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:27.360]   Counseling.
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:28.600]   That's kind of a basic one.
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:35.360]   A lot of the PDIs with a lot of people have kind of evolved over the years, but it asks
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:40.760]   just a lot of basic background questions that helps you to get at a lot of data real quickly.
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:45.840]   And then there's usually a pink sheet that's attached to that PDI that has four basic questions
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:47.360]   on it.
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:51.320]   Number one, why have you come to counseling?
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:53.480]   What's the problem?
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:56.380]   Number two, what have you done about that problem so far?
[00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:57.380]   What have you done about this problem?
[00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:01.720]   Well, I've read some books or I've talked with someone else or I've seen another counselor
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:06.560]   or I've watched a video or, you know, whatever.
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:08.320]   This is what they've done about the problem.
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:14.600]   The third question they have on that little pink sheet is, what do you expect us to do
[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:15.880]   about the problem?
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:19.720]   Which tells you their expectations.
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:22.480]   What do you expect us to do about it?
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:28.140]   And then the last question has to do with, is there any other information that you can
[00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:33.460]   share with us that would help us understand what's going on?
[00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:40.140]   A lot of that has to do with background information to help us have perspective on their particular
[00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:42.060]   problem.
[00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:47.220]   So that's usually on the little pink sheet, okay, on the PDI.
[00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:54.020]   So you have a personal data inventory and before a person comes in, now if I know somebody
[00:54:54.020 --> 00:55:00.620]   from my church really well, I don't have them fill out a PDI.
[00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:06.100]   But if I don't know them really well and they're still a member of my church, then I'll have
[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:07.180]   them fill it out.
[00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:11.380]   Because I want to try to get to know them the best I can.
[00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:15.540]   Then pay attention to communication relationship dynamics.
[00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:18.580]   Here's some examples of dynamics to observe.
[00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:19.900]   Who sits where?
[00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:22.360]   Boy, that's a key thing.
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:25.460]   Who sits where?
[00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:32.100]   You know, oftentimes I'll have, if you were to go to my office, I have a desk there, on
[00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:38.180]   the other side of the desk are two chairs and they're lined up facing me on the other
[00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:39.740]   side of the desk.
[00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:44.580]   And a husband and wife will come in for counseling and they'll be so irritated with each other
[00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:49.600]   that when they sit down, they actually turn their chairs so that their backs are facing
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:51.900]   each other.
[00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:56.780]   You go, whoa, look at this, all right.
[00:55:56.780 --> 00:56:01.900]   He's looking out there, she's looking out there and they usually start off with, will
[00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:08.120]   you tell her, will you tell him, type of thing.
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:17.120]   So the animosity is so thick you can cut it with a knife in that counseling room.
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:19.760]   Who sits where?
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:21.000]   How do they sit?
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:25.360]   Some are very aggressive and attactive and they'll actually turn their chairs towards
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:29.540]   their spouse to stare them in the eye.
[00:56:29.540 --> 00:56:33.640]   So they're very aggressive.
[00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:37.160]   How do people interact?
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:44.760]   How do people interact?
[00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:53.080]   Is one quiet and the other one talkative?
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:57:02.120]   Is one of them constantly making excuses for their behavior?
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:06.480]   Well, I did this, but you've got to understand the reason why I did this was because he or
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:17.280]   she, they're constantly making excuses, implied accusations, how do they interact?
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:20.400]   Is one person constantly explaining what the other person's saying?
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:26.700]   Well, what she means by that is, don't you just love it when somebody does that?
[00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:33.480]   What he means by that is, and you see the spouse go, what are you doing?
[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:34.920]   I said what I mean.
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:38.880]   I don't need for you to explain this to the counselor.
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:39.880]   Or who withdraws?
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:40.880]   Who retreats?
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:41.880]   Who pushes?
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:42.880]   Who coerces?
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:49.080]   Who's trying to be manipulative?
[00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:54.040]   Or who is ignored?
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:55.880]   Someone ignored?
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:57.600]   Maybe it's a kid.
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:04.660]   Maybe it's a parent who's ignored in the counseling.
[00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:09.840]   Who talks the most and who initiates conversations?
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:12.240]   Who talks most and who initiates?
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:16.320]   I just love it when you ask a question of one spouse and the other spouse immediately
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:19.160]   jumps in and answers it.
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:22.320]   That tells me a lot about how this marriage really functions.
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:26.520]   If they're willing to do that now, here in front of me, where they're trying to put on
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:34.140]   their best behavior, you can imagine this is 10 times worse at home.
[00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:40.840]   One person answers for the other person.
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:42.880]   Who interprets?
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:43.960]   Who clarifies?
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:47.260]   Who corrects?
[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:54.880]   Well let me explain what he's trying to say, she'll say.
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:55.880]   Who does that?
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:59:06.940]   Who speaks for other people?
[00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:10.860]   Back several years ago, I had a couple come in for counseling and the presentation problem
[00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:21.140]   was that the husband doesn't communicate, he doesn't communicate, okay, face value.
[00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:25.420]   Before the end of the first session, I knew immediately why he didn't communicate because
[00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:38.300]   every time he attempted to talk in the counseling session, his wife would always put him down.
[00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:42.500]   Well that's stupid, she would say.
[00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:45.900]   He doesn't know what he's talking about.
[00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:51.740]   You got to understand, that's his perspective, she'd say to me.
[00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:57.060]   Now, every time he opened his mouth, he's put down, then he's not going to say anything.
[00:59:57.060 --> 01:00:03.380]   Every time he tried to communicate something, she immediately shut him down, immediately
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:04.940]   shut him down.
[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:08.420]   And now she's complaining that he doesn't communicate.
[01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:14.940]   Well, she's let him know, in no uncertain terms, that what he has to communicate is
[01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:19.700]   not valuable, it's not important.
[01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:25.180]   She doesn't care what he says.
[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:28.960]   It's only her opinion that matters in this situation.
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:31.860]   So he just stopped talking.
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:36.880]   Now he had his own problems, I don't mean to paint a picture as if she's all wrong and
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:39.700]   he's all right, no, no, no, that's not it.
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:42.820]   But before the end of the first session, it was painfully clear what was going on in that
[01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:51.660]   marriage and how I needed to work with that particular wife.
[01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:55.460]   How are disagreements handled?
[01:00:55.460 --> 01:01:01.220]   Couples fall into certain ruts and patterns on handling things.
[01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:05.900]   Some couples like to sweep things under the rug and eventually so much stuff is piled
[01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:10.360]   up underneath, they end up tripping over it, but it's swept underneath the rug.
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:18.380]   Other couples yell and scream at each other and vent all their emotions.
[01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:20.660]   It doesn't solve the problem.
[01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:32.480]   It just vents all of their deep emotional issues and the problem is still there.
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:37.380]   They feel better because they've vented, but now everybody is hurt because they've said
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:40.300]   mean hateful things to one another.
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:45.020]   God dishonoring things.
[01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:50.940]   Some couples deny that there is a problem when there is.
[01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:55.460]   They'll deny, oh, we don't have a problem.
[01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:58.660]   There's no problem there.
[01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:00.580]   Everything's fine.
[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:03.700]   Or you'll get a husband or a wife who will do that.
[01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:06.540]   There's nothing wrong with a marriage.
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:11.460]   Usually, by the way, it's the husbands who do that.
[01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:15.140]   Now occasionally you'll get a wife to do it, but usually the husband, ah, everything's
[01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:17.300]   fine in a marriage, no problem.
[01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:25.580]   The wife is sitting there, no, there's problems.
[01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:33.740]   I was just talking in the pastoral counseling class the last hour about a Methodist pastor
[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:35.780]   and his wife who came to me for counseling.
[01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:43.140]   They were having some fairly serious marital problems.
[01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:47.460]   During one of the counseling sessions, he looked at me in all seriousness and he said
[01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:54.500]   to me, "I don't sin anymore.
[01:02:54.500 --> 01:03:06.900]   I make mistakes and sometimes I do things in ignorance, but I don't sin."
[01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:12.500]   Well it dawned on me, this guy believes in this Methodist theology.
[01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:17.100]   It's a Wesleyan theology that says that once a person's saved, they kind of live the Christian
[01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:20.740]   life until they receive the second blessing and that catapults them to a level where they
[01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.500]   no longer sin any longer.
[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:25.980]   They can make mistakes, but they don't sin any longer.
[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:31.460]   And it's so funny because I can still, it's like they're sitting in front of me today.
[01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:37.300]   I can still see his wife's expression when he said, "I don't sin."
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:43.300]   She went like this.
[01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:50.820]   Her non-verbals were screaming at me, all right, like, "This guy is unbelievable."
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:58.460]   Of course, I took him over to 1 John 1 where it talks about if we say that we have no sin,
[01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:04.540]   then we make him out to be a liar.
[01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:05.540]   That's what you're saying.
[01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:08.340]   You don't have any sin.
[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:12.980]   You supposedly have received the second act of grace where you don't, all you do is make
[01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:13.980]   mistakes.
[01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:15.520]   You don't sin anymore.
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:19.620]   So you're saying basically your wife is totally responsible for all these marital problems
[01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:21.700]   because she's the only one that's sinned.
[01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:24.860]   She's the only one who hasn't received this second act of grace.
[01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:28.340]   Boy, that's convenient.
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:34.860]   That theology will drive a major wedge between a husband and wife.
[01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:37.780]   That'll destroy a marriage.
[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:39.900]   How are disagreements handled?
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:43.980]   This guy basically is saying, "There's no problem on my part.
[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:53.580]   It's all her problem because she hasn't received the second act of grace."
[01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:58.660]   So furthermore, does someone have to have the last word?
[01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:02.060]   Does someone have to have the last word?
[01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:06.300]   There are some couples that do that.
[01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:11.620]   They've just got to have their opinion out there on the table as the last word no matter
[01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:17.180]   what when a problem arises.
[01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:18.180]   Who's really in charge?
[01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:25.420]   Another way to ask that question, who wears the pants in the family?
[01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:31.260]   Who is really in charge of the home?
[01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:39.020]   Now that's a ridiculous question if you believe in egalitarianism, then you're both in charge.
[01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:43.060]   If you believe in egalitarianism, then it's like a plane that has two pilots.
[01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:45.900]   Not a pilot and co-pilot, but two pilots.
[01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:51.820]   That's the way a lot of marriages function today under an egalitarian view.
[01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:54.620]   Mom and dad are struggling for the control of the plane.
[01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:59.140]   So the plane is going like this because she wants it to go one direction and he wants
[01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:01.980]   it to go another direction and so the plane is all over the place and the kids are in
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:05.900]   the back being bounced off the ceiling.
[01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:10.900]   That's the picture of a lot of homes.
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:12.820]   Who's in charge?
[01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:20.860]   Are there subtle or overt power struggles going on in the home?
[01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:27.220]   Some of them are very subtle power struggles.
[01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:34.020]   Who has the most clout in the home?
[01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:36.840]   How does the controlling person maintain control?
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:41.860]   What do they do?
[01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:46.700]   Is it with the checkbook?
[01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:52.460]   Is it through sexuality?
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:54.580]   Is it through threats?
[01:06:54.580 --> 01:07:04.100]   They'll tell somebody, they'll tell the pastor, they'll tell the relatives.
[01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:06.220]   How do they maintain control?
[01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:07.220]   What's going on?
[01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:10.820]   How do they do that?
[01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:12.340]   What's happening there?
[01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:20.620]   Do they maintain control, this is a very common way, by threatening to leave?
[01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:28.220]   There's always that threat on the table, I'll leave you if you do that, then you're going
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:31.340]   to find me out of here.
[01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:36.020]   That's their way of maintaining control.
[01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:40.880]   Very coercive, very manipulative.
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:46.420]   When tense issues arise, how does each person react to those problems?
[01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:47.660]   How do they deal with it?
[01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:51.740]   Who seems most concerned or upset when a problem arises?
[01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:59.300]   Who does or doesn't pay attention when someone speaks?
[01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:00.380]   Do they ignore each other?
[01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:03.780]   Do they listen past each other?
[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:06.780]   It's very easy to do, you know.
[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:12.700]   A husband and wife have been married for several years, sometimes will listen past each other.
[01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:16.020]   They anticipate what their spouse is going to say because they lived with them so long,
[01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:21.100]   they really think they have a pretty good idea.
[01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:23.420]   Who does or doesn't pay attention when somebody speaks?
[01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:25.340]   Do they really hear words or meanings?
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:32.340]   Do they understand each other?
[01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:38.500]   And sometimes a husband or wife will read meanings into words that were not intended,
[01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:44.540]   which just makes the problem worse.
[01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:53.620]   They will imply meanings or motivations behind words that were never intended.
[01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:55.180]   Do some issues get sidetracked?
[01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:56.700]   How do they get sidetracked?
[01:08:56.700 --> 01:09:00.380]   Whose issues get sidetracked?
[01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:04.780]   And what roles do each of the family members have?
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:24.500]   Are they biblical roles in the family and in the relationship?
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:40.900]   All of these issues are important at getting the right kind of data and interpreting it.
[01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:48.780]   I think a good counselor who is somewhat like Sherlock Holmes, he's always asking or she's
[01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:57.580]   always asking lots of questions, maybe not to the counselee, but to themselves.
[01:09:57.580 --> 01:09:58.580]   What about this?
[01:09:58.580 --> 01:09:59.580]   What about this?
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:00.620]   What about that?
[01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:05.580]   Every time I review the notes that I've taken in counseling, I'm always asking myself a
[01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:09.100]   lot of questions.
[01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:14.540]   Why did they say that and why did they say that that way?
[01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:19.420]   What could they have said that would have been better at this particular point?
[01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:24.440]   What's going on in their mind, in their thinking, in their desires, in their expectations that
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:29.940]   would cause them to react the way that they did?
[01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:37.380]   To the point where you really get to know your counselee and you can anticipate what
[01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:42.780]   they're going to do in a certain situation.
[01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:50.380]   They may not like you as a counselor, but you can actually say to them, "You know what?
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:54.060]   I'll bet if this happened, this is the way in which you would respond to it," and they
[01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:58.700]   say, "You're right.
[01:10:58.700 --> 01:10:59.700]   That's exactly it.
[01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:02.740]   How did you know that?
[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:10.580]   In fact, that happened before," they'll say, "and this is the way I responded."
[01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:13.700]   How do you know that because you've asked yourself a lot of questions, you've in a sense
[01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:22.100]   crawled into their mind, and you're looking at life through their eyes, their perspective.
[01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:30.460]   Everything they do and everything they say speaks to their perspective of life and their
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:34.020]   view of their marriage.
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:39.780]   Everything they do and everything they say reveals what they think about life and their
[01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:46.780]   marriage.
[01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:51.900]   Ask appropriate questions and listen very carefully, not just to what they say, but
[01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:56.780]   how they say it.
[01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:58.900]   Here's some questions from a problem-centered approach.
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:11:59.900]   These are great questions.
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:03.460]   In fact, I'll use these frequently.
[01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:07.900]   As you see it, what are some of the problems hindering your marriage and family relationships?
[01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:15.740]   What do you see as ways that you have contributed to the problems in the marriage or family?
[01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:17.980]   That's a very open-ended question, isn't it?
[01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:25.020]   Boy, they can bring in anything, anything.
[01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:28.860]   What are some of the problems hindering your marriage or family relationships?
[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:34.520]   Usually they're going to talk about the things that most concern them first.
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:41.180]   Now, how have you contributed to those problems?
[01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:47.180]   Now, that's a little bit tougher, because the Bible tells us that we always view the
[01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:51.580]   past in such self-favoring ways.
[01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:57.900]   Grab your Bible just for a moment and go over to Proverbs 16 in verse 2.
[01:12:57.900 --> 01:13:03.300]   All the ways of a man are clean in his own sight, but the Lord weighs the motives.
[01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:09.440]   A very similar statement is made in Proverbs 21 in verse 2.
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:14.540]   Every man's way is right in his own eyes, but the Lord weighs the heart.
[01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:23.180]   Now, you're not in marriage and family counseling very long before you realize that people look
[01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:27.620]   at the past in such self-justifying ways.
[01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:33.740]   They can go into great detail and talk about, in technicolor, all the wrongs that their
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:36.460]   spouse or other people in the family have done against them.
[01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:38.380]   They can do that.
[01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:44.520]   But then when you ask them the question, "What have you done that was wrong in the past?
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:47.300]   How did you contribute to these problems?"
[01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:50.820]   All of a sudden they get a glazed look in their eye, and they kind of stare off, and
[01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:56.500]   they say, "Well, you know, I know I didn't always respond the right way, but you don't
[01:13:56.500 --> 01:14:03.020]   understand what they did to me," and all of a sudden we're right back into that mode.
[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:08.780]   So we always see ourselves in a victim role.
[01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:10.820]   I have been victimized by my wife.
[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:13.020]   I have been victimized by my husband.
[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:15.900]   I have been victimized by my children.
[01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:19.220]   I have been victimized by my parents.
[01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:25.380]   I have been victimized by -- you fill in the blank.
[01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:27.700]   That's the way that they view things.
[01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:32.460]   So you're trying to get them to open up and own responsibility for their own feelings
[01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:34.900]   and action in the past.
[01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:39.300]   The number two, what do you see as things that you'd like to change in your relationship
[01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:40.980]   or in yourself?
[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:48.380]   And again, we started off about in the relationship, and, you know, that particular question will
[01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:52.660]   easily get twisted into, "What are the things that I'd like to see changed in my husband
[01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:55.540]   or my wife?"
[01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:57.100]   That's what usually happens.
[01:14:57.100 --> 01:15:02.940]   "What do I want to see changed in him or her?"
[01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:06.740]   Well, that's the wrong reason for coming to counseling.
[01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:07.740]   Wrong agenda.
[01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:08.860]   No, no, no.
[01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:10.540]   You can't change him or her.
[01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:15.260]   In fact, you know what, sometimes I'll say to them, "Now, how long have you guys been
[01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:16.260]   married?"
[01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:19.460]   "Well, we've been married for 15 years," they'll say.
[01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:23.300]   "Have you been trying to change your spouse over these 15 years?"
[01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:24.300]   "Oh, yes.
[01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:25.300]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:26.300]   Oh, yeah."
[01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:28.540]   "This is what you really wanted for them to change, isn't it?"
[01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:29.540]   "Oh, yes.
[01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:30.540]   Uh-huh.
[01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:31.540]   That's exactly right."
[01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:33.460]   "Have you been successful over these 15 years?"
[01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:34.460]   "No.
[01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:35.460]   No.
[01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:36.460]   Are you kidding me?
[01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:37.460]   Not a bit successful."
[01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:44.460]   "Well, then," I say to them, "Don't expect me to be successful on that either."
[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:45.460]   I'm not going to.
[01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:47.900]   You've tried this for 15 years, and you can't do it, right?
[01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:49.020]   So I can't do it.
[01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:50.620]   But we can do one thing.
[01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:54.060]   We can change you.
[01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:57.260]   And you've got to be willing to change.
[01:15:57.260 --> 01:15:59.900]   So are you ready to change?
[01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:05.260]   Well, now that's the right agenda for coming to counseling.
[01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:11.620]   I've got to come to counseling to help me learn how to be a better husband, a better
[01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:22.620]   wife, a better mother, a better father, a better child, a better parent.
[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:26.480]   That's why I'm coming to counseling.
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:31.620]   My coming to counseling is not to get my husband, wife, or my children to change or my parents
[01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:32.700]   to change.
[01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:37.980]   That's not my reason for coming to counseling.
[01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:44.660]   So what things do you see you'd like to change in your relationship?
[01:16:44.660 --> 01:16:49.020]   And don't forget to add in yourself.
[01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:52.900]   Number three, if you could change anything that you did and said, what would it be?
[01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:58.860]   Do you have any regrets that are a part of your past?
[01:16:58.860 --> 01:17:06.220]   Things that you remember that you did that were wrong, words that you said, deeds and
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:24.340]   actions you performed that were wrong, hurtful, mean, that constituted a lie?
[01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:25.620]   What is it?
[01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:32.700]   If you could change anything that you did or you said, what would it be?
[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:34.060]   Get them to open up about it.
[01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:41.220]   Now they're usually really detailed about what they want their spouse to change.
[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:42.220]   They know that.
[01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:47.060]   I mean, they can give you a doctoral dissertation on that one.
[01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:53.220]   Boy, it's really hard for them to list.
[01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:54.480]   In fact, that's a good homework assignment.
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:55.660]   I'm going to send it home.
[01:17:55.660 --> 01:18:05.700]   I want you to list 20 things you'd like to make right about your past with your spouse.
[01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:08.140]   20 things.
[01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:10.780]   That is so hard.
[01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:21.020]   Man, if they make it past three, they're really doing great.
[01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:22.860]   You could change anything.
[01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:29.100]   Number four, when you got married, what expectations did you have for marriage?
[01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:33.060]   This is to tell you what they were really hoping for.
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:36.980]   What were your spouse's expectations, which were fulfilled?
[01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:39.780]   How did you make your expectations known to your spouse?
[01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:45.460]   What effect could unfulfilled expectations have on your marriage?
[01:18:45.460 --> 01:18:54.340]   Most couples, they'll talk with you prior to marriage, "Oh, we have the best communication.
[01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:57.700]   He understands me.
[01:18:57.700 --> 01:18:59.420]   She really knows me.
[01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:03.500]   We really love each other."
[01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:10.620]   After marriage, "That man doesn't understand me.
[01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:14.100]   He doesn't know me.
[01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:20.380]   She ignores me."
[01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:23.340]   What effect could unfulfilled expectations have on your marriage?
[01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:33.140]   Most couples have not talked about their expectations, or they've not been genuine about them.
[01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:38.300]   For one reason or another, they've not really laid all their cards on the table, so to speak,
[01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:41.100]   but they have certain very definite expectations.
[01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:46.640]   They've not told their spouse about them, they're hidden, and they're just waiting.
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:49.620]   I don't know whether they're afraid that if they tell them, then their spouse will just
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:53.660]   do it in order to please them, and it won't be genuine.
[01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:58.440]   There are all kinds of excuses that could go one way or another here or there.
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:02.460]   But they've not been very open about their expectations.
[01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:08.800]   If I were to ask you to list your spouse's expectations when they came into marriage
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:13.500]   with you, what would you say?
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:17.820]   What were their expectations?
[01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:20.340]   They want to get married and have kids.
[01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:22.860]   I guess that's it.
[01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:28.840]   Oh, that we go to church together, and we study the Bible, and we make enough money
[01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:37.740]   to live, and beyond that, I don't know.
[01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:43.880]   Wow, those are all performance things.
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:54.220]   My bet is that your spouse expected you to love you, or for you to love them with lots
[01:20:54.220 --> 01:21:01.180]   and lots of mercy and grace.
[01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:02.180]   Lots and lots of mercy.
[01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:08.980]   Now, they maybe didn't say that, but that was their expectation.
[01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:13.380]   Which gets us over to Matthew 7, 1 through 5 issue.
[01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:15.820]   Don't judge unless you be judged.
[01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:19.140]   Why as you go around trying to pick the speck out of your brother's eye, when all along
[01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:25.780]   you have a log hanging out of your eye, listen to the hyperbole of Jesus in that.
[01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:28.980]   Imagine people walking around with logs hanging out of their eye.
[01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:29.980]   That's hyperbole.
[01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:35.340]   The word speck there in the Greek is the word that actually, I think, it's very hard to
[01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:40.340]   track down, but I actually think it means, sometimes it's translated splinter, but that's
[01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:43.020]   a bad translation.
[01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:44.500]   It means like a floaty.
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:49.220]   Have you ever gotten a piece of dust in your eye and been able to see it float across your
[01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:50.220]   eye?
[01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:53.540]   What if I came to you and I said, "Hey, listen, I want to pick that little floaty out of your
[01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:54.540]   eye."
[01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:55.540]   "Hold on just a second, Stephen.
[01:21:55.540 --> 01:21:56.540]   Let me get that thing."
[01:21:56.540 --> 01:21:58.260]   You'd say, "Whoa, get away from me."
[01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:02.180]   All along I've got this log hanging out of my eye, all right?
[01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:06.080]   You'd say, "What is this guy, nuts?"
[01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:07.540]   You'd get rid of the log in your own eye.
[01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:14.940]   In other words, we're really great at defining what other people need to do in a very refined
[01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:18.900]   way, but we're very, very generous with our own selves.
[01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:27.220]   And Jesus says, "Don't judge others with a standard that you first don't use upon yourself.
[01:22:27.220 --> 01:22:28.220]   Then you can judge other people."
[01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:36.860]   In other words, you use a more refined judgment upon yourself than you do on other people,
[01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:41.700]   and then you're qualified to judge.
[01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:43.340]   So ask appropriate questions.
[01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:46.260]   Listen for them carefully.
[01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:55.540]   As you consider marriage, what is your degree of commitment or your spouse's degree of commitment?
[01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:59.980]   As you consider marriage, what is your degree of commitment to this?
[01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:03.140]   Most Christians go, "Oh, well, we have a high view of marriage."
[01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:09.180]   Well, I've never met one couple yet that their view of marriage didn't need to be elevated
[01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:15.540]   because God's view, wherever they consider to be their view of marriage, however high
[01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:21.180]   it may be, God's view is always somehow much higher.
[01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:25.180]   Do you believe that your problems can be solved?
[01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:27.300]   How much hope do you have?
[01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:30.140]   Do you think that's possible?
[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:33.780]   Can your problems be solved?
[01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:37.540]   How much hope do you have?
[01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:41.100]   I love this because when you ask this question, grab your Bible and let's go over to Proverbs
[01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:51.180]   chapter 15, Proverbs, not Proverbs, I've been there too much, Romans chapter 15.
[01:23:51.180 --> 01:24:00.060]   I said Proverbs and I'm going over to Romans here, Romans chapter 15, verse 4, "For whatever
[01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:04.940]   was written in earlier times was written for our instruction so that through perseverance,"
[01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:09.540]   that is a faithful keeping of the word, "and the encouragement of Scripture, we might have
[01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:12.060]   hope."
[01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:14.580]   There's two ingredients for hope here.
[01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:19.100]   One is persevering and obedience.
[01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:20.700]   That's what gives hope.
[01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:24.060]   And the other is the encouragement of Scripture through the promises of Scripture.
[01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:28.460]   If we're faithful to God, then God is also faithful to us.
[01:24:28.460 --> 01:24:31.900]   We can trust him.
[01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:37.540]   As that's the case, our hope builds and that's key for a marriage that is hopeless.
[01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:48.540]   In fact, a little bit later on, same particular chapter, verse 13, Romans 15, 13, "Now may
[01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:53.500]   the God of hope," that's the way our God is described, "fill you with all joy and peace
[01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:58.380]   and believing so that you will abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit."
[01:24:58.380 --> 01:25:04.300]   As you face problems and difficulties, our God is considered a God of hope.
[01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:07.960]   Number seven, how happy are you with your marriage?
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:09.540]   How happy are you with marriage?
[01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:16.980]   On a scale of 1 to 10, what would you, 10 being absolutely overwhelmed and overjoyed,
[01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:26.620]   1 being this is a miserable existence, what rate would you give your marriage, 1 to 10?
[01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:28.420]   Why would you give them that number?
[01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:33.600]   Number eight, if you could change anything about yourself, your marriage, spouse, kids,
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:37.300]   and know for sure that God would give you the resources to make the change, what would
[01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:39.580]   you choose to change?
[01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:44.120]   What would your spouse choose to change?
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:48.420]   What would you choose to change and what would your spouse choose to change?
[01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:55.820]   And how are the differences important here?
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:26:07.100]   Something that you would want to change about your marriage.
[01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:09.900]   I'd have more kids, less kids.
[01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:10.900]   I want my husband to change.
[01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:14.500]   I want my wife to change.
[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:19.720]   Whatever, fill in the blank.
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:28.520]   As God views your life, number nine, marriage, what do you think He wants continued and what
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:31.400]   does He want changed?
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:35.220]   As God views it, what does He want you to continue?
[01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:40.120]   That which is good, because every Christian marriage at some degree or another has some
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:46.040]   goodness in it, if it's nothing other than the fact that they say that they are committed
[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:47.040]   to Jesus Christ.
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:50.440]   So, we're going to start there.
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:55.520]   Has some kind of goodness in it, not that it's innate to the couple, but because of
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:57.680]   what God has done in that marriage.
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:26:59.960]   So, we can start there.
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:06.760]   So, what does God want to continue in your marriage that's good and then what does He
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:08.160]   want changed?
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:14.020]   Just five things that would make your marriage better.
[01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:19.280]   What would make your marriage better?
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:27.760]   Number ten, what do you want from your marriage and what will it take to get it there?
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:38.960]   What do you want from your marriage and what will it take to get it there?
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:43.820]   This really defines their hope.
[01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:50.600]   It defines what they're looking for, expecting in the future.
[01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:56.000]   Sometimes their expectations are in line with what God would want and sometimes their expectations
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:01.080]   are not in line with what God would want.
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:05.840]   Sometimes they can come across with expectations that sound really biblical, but when you nail
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:11.800]   down the specifics of it, you find out it's not biblical.
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:17.520]   So what do you want from your marriage and what will it take to get it there?
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:20.960]   Number twelve, in what ways have you changed your way of relating to your spouse since
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:25.520]   you were first engaged or since your first few months of marriage and how has your spouse
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:31.720]   changed?
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:34.320]   Have you changed the way that you relate to your spouse?
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:40.460]   In what ways have you changed?
[01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:43.520]   Are you kinder?
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:45.840]   Are you gentler?
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:46.840]   Are you more caring?
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:49.080]   Are you more patient?
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:53.900]   Are you more loving?
[01:28:53.900 --> 01:29:00.080]   Do you express your love and in what ways do you express your love?
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:05.120]   Number thirteen, what would it be like to be married to someone just like you?
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:06.120]   Would you like it?
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:10.520]   That's a great question, isn't it?
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:14.800]   What would it be like if you were married to you?
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:19.980]   I think you'd have even more problems.
[01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:26.760]   If you were married to you, you'd really be stumbling around.
[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:33.660]   Number fourteen, what must happen for you to be satisfied with your marriage?
[01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:35.440]   What's really going to make you satisfied?
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:39.620]   What's really going to make you happy?
[01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:52.220]   If you were able to establish that, then you'll usually find out the core of their problem.
[01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:56.840]   Number fifteen, what are you willing to do to improve your marriage relationship?
[01:29:56.840 --> 01:30:00.760]   How far are you willing to go?
[01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:05.820]   And a follow-up to this particular question that I'd love to ask is, are you willing to
[01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:11.000]   go as far as personally changing?
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:19.800]   I knew this was going to be hard.
[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:25.400]   Are you willing to go as far as personally changing?
[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:29.560]   Number sixteen, if talking to someone who knew nothing about marriage, how would you
[01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:35.960]   explain it to that person?
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:37.640]   Now that's a great question, too.
[01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:42.580]   It kind of steps back, asks them to reflect upon, which helps you to understand what kind
[01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:45.760]   of attitudes they formed about marriage.
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:54.460]   Couples that have had problems, chronic problems over years have formed negative, pessimistic,
[01:30:54.460 --> 01:30:56.600]   dark views of marriage.
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:59.120]   Oh, it's hard.
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.720]   It's difficult.
[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:03.240]   This is drudgery.
[01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:05.280]   It's constant conflict.
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:06.280]   There's arguing.
[01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:15.480]   And then there are others who will say, well, you know, marriage requires work, but it's
[01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:22.320]   a good kind of work because, you know, my wife is God's main tool of sanctification
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:26.800]   in my life.
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:30.840]   She's changing me through her.
[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:35.360]   And I must be God's main tool of sanctification in her life as well.
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:42.120]   If talking to someone who knew nothing about marriage, how would you explain it to that
[01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:43.120]   person?
[01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:47.360]   Number seventeen, as you view marriage, what are seven or eight important elements that
[01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:50.360]   make a marriage what it ought to be?
[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:51.600]   What would you like to strengthen?
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:57.040]   How do you think that these elements could be strengthened?
[01:31:57.040 --> 01:32:02.080]   What ought it be?
[01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:02.960]   That's a critical question.
[01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:03.960]   I think it's a critical question.
[01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:04.960]   I think it's a critical question.
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:04.960]   I think it's a critical question.
