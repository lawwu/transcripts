[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.400]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.240]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.440]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.760]   and I love sharing whatever knowledge I have
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.960]   to help people earn and save more,
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.360]   and leveraging your tax advantaged accounts
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.320]   is one of the ways you can do that.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.880]   And who better to have this conversation with
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.640]   than my good friend and host
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.120]   of the Money With Katie podcast, Katie Gaddy Tassin.
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.120]   She and I will cover everything,
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.760]   including IRAs, 401(k)s, Roth conversion ladders,
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.120]   which might help you completely avoid taxes
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.540]   when you take money out of your 401(k) in the future.
[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.200]   We'll cover backdoor contributions, HSAs,
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.640]   donor advised funds, and a lot more.
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.140]   So let's jump into it right after this.
[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.240]   Did you know that someone new gets impacted
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.960]   by identity theft every two seconds?
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.800]   It makes sense when there's so much
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.400]   of our personal information getting shared online
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.920]   without our consent.
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.240]   I found a listing for my dad on a site
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.880]   called Family Tree Now that had his name,
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.800]   age, address, phone number, email,
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.640]   past addresses, and the names of his relatives.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.720]   And that was just one of the 69 listings
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.200]   that had his info.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.360]   Fortunately, instead of spending hours
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.160]   finding all the sites with his info
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.320]   and submitting the request to take it down,
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.560]   I got it all done in minutes with Delete.me from Abine,
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.520]   and I am so excited to be partnering
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.840]   with them for this episode.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.620]   Delete.me is an amazing service
[00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.400]   that will not just find and remove
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.280]   your personal information from over 500
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.360]   data broker websites, but they'll continuously scan
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.480]   for new data that shows up and get that removed as well.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.440]   On average, Delete.me finds and removes
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.800]   over 2,000 pieces of data for a customer
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.040]   in their first two years, and to date,
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.760]   they've removed over 35 million pieces
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.120]   of data for their customers.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.200]   So if you wanna get your personal information
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.680]   removed from all these listings on the internet,
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.700]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.220]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.200]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.660]   I want you to know that neither Katie nor I
[00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.980]   are CPAs or tax advisors, so I will always recommend
[00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.860]   that you seek the advice of a professional
[00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.140]   when it comes to taxes.
[00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.700]   I've used a few different tax professionals over the years.
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.160]   I've even tried to do it myself back in the day,
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.580]   but now I'm working with Gelt,
[00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.220]   and I finally feel like I found a partner I can trust
[00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.980]   to handle everything business and personal.
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.400]   When I first started working with them,
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.180]   they reviewed our past returns,
[00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.860]   which is something I recommend everyone
[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.860]   ask a new tax advisor to do,
[00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.540]   and they found a huge mistake our prior CPA had made,
[00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.900]   but we were able to refile and get back all that money.
[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.380]   And after having such a great experience with them,
[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.320]   I asked if they'd be interested in partnering
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.200]   with All The Hacks, and they were,
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.480]   so I'm excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.220]   So if you're a business owner, investor,
[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.180]   or just ready for a more premium and proactive tax strategy
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.400]   to optimize and file your taxes,
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.940]   you should check out Gelt.
[00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.380]   And as an All The Hacks listener,
[00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.380]   you can get priority on their wait list.
[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.020]   Just head to allthehacks.com/Gelt, G-E-L-T.
[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.980]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/G-E-L-T.
[00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.580]   Katie, thank you for joining me.
[00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.980]   This is a long time coming.
[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.020]   Chris, it's a pleasure to be here.
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.340]   Thanks for having me on.
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.100]   I've always wanted to break down retirement accounts,
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.820]   and I was looking on the internet.
[00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.060]   I was like, who do I know that's great at this stuff?
[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.180]   And not just retirement, but all tax-advantaged accounts.
[00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.820]   You've called yourself a freak for tax loopholes,
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.880]   so I thought you would be a great person to come on.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.120]   You've done a ton of episodes on your show about this topic.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.660]   What do you say we just break it all down
[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.380]   and go through all the different ways
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.020]   to use these different investment accounts
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.220]   to make the tax code work for you?
[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.220]   I love it, let's do it.
[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.740]   My caveat to all of this is,
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.960]   I don't think that we shouldn't pay taxes, right?
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.260]   I think taxes are important.
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.540]   They make the country function,
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.460]   but there's just a big knowledge gap
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.780]   between people that really dial this in
[00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.420]   and understand it all and the rest of us.
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.740]   And I think the tax code,
[00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.180]   last I remember reading somewhere,
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.980]   grows by like 150,000 words a year.
[00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.100]   And so I feel like most people don't know this.
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.700]   So I just wanna be, this is not a,
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.740]   how do we get out of paying all the taxes
[00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.340]   and let other people pick up the tab,
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.300]   but there are very specific rules out there
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.380]   set for helping people save money, mostly for retirement.
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.540]   And if they're out there,
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.320]   people should all have access to them
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.020]   and information should not be the reason
[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.860]   they aren't being used.
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:21.860]   A hundred percent.
[00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.940]   And I would add that the idea that someone
[00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.180]   who is gonna contribute to a pre-tax account
[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.540]   and therefore save a little bit of their money
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.940]   on their taxes and is gonna be taking advantage
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:33.940]   of something that's out there
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.900]   that the IRS and the federal government
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.020]   fully intends for them to use,
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.340]   that person taking advantage of that
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.220]   and not paying, let's say four to five grand a year
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.060]   in those taxes,
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.020]   that's not gonna make or break the national budget, right?
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.700]   I think it's a little bit like someone
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.900]   who is flying commercial being like,
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.340]   I should only bring one suitcase instead of two
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.940]   'cause fuel efficiency while like a billionaire
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.620]   is flying across the country in a private jet,
[00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.620]   not worried about it.
[00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.260]   So I always too feel like it's kind of important
[00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.700]   to say that these rules exist for a reason.
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.660]   The IRS and the federal government
[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.100]   want you to know about them and use them.
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.260]   You're fully within your rights to do so.
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.980]   And everything that we're talking about,
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.660]   I remember when I first learned about this stuff,
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.980]   I was like, how is this legal?
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:17.900]   This is crazy.
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.940]   I'm about to save, I think like 20 grand in taxes
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.580]   because I just am putting money
[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.380]   in the right quote unquote buckets.
[00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.020]   Like that's unbelievable to me,
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.460]   but it exists and to your point,
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.740]   you don't want a lack of knowledge or information
[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.380]   to be the reason that someone is overpaying.
[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.860]   - So maybe we'll start with the fundamentals
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.780]   of tax advantaged investing accounts.
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.140]   We'll start with 401ks, go into IRAs.
[00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.220]   I know there are a lot of them.
[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.900]   You know way more about some of the obscure ones than I do.
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.340]   It probably doesn't make sense to go
[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.900]   into every possible random account that you could get
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.060]   if you work for the government or work for a school teacher.
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.940]   A lot of them function similarly.
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.980]   Is there any high level overview you want to give
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.740]   to some of the more obscure ones?
[00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.060]   - So I kind of think about them in categories.
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.660]   So the first big one that I'll talk about
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.140]   is the, what I would call 401k category.
[00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:08.020]   This includes the 403Bs, the 457Bs, the TSPs,
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.220]   the simple IRAs, things of that nature
[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.780]   that you're going to get through an employer.
[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.620]   And depending on what type of employer you work for,
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:15.900]   it might look a little bit different
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.660]   and your options might be a little bit different,
[00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.460]   the plan provider, the fees, et cetera.
[00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:20.660]   But generally speaking,
[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.100]   it's like the employer-sponsored account
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.180]   that you may or may not have access to
[00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.580]   that is likely going to have a contribution limit
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.900]   somewhere in the ballpark of around 22,500 per year,
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.340]   at least in 2023.
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.860]   It should be somewhere in the ballpark in 2024
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.740]   of around 23,000, though, to your point,
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.020]   because of some obscurities,
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.660]   some of these accounts have different rules.
[00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.580]   But the point is, it's the one that you're probably
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.900]   going to get from an employer.
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.620]   And if you don't get it from an employer
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.780]   and you're a W-2 employee with no other sources of income,
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.060]   you're kind of SOL on this one.
[00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.700]   You're going to have to go look elsewhere.
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.540]   That's bucket one for me.
[00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.620]   Then I would think about things like the standard Roth IRA,
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.740]   traditional IRA bucket,
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.940]   which I believe is going up to 7,000 in 2024
[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.100]   as a contribution limit.
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.260]   And there are all sorts of smaller limits and penalties
[00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.060]   to be aware of as far as the income that you need to have
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.220]   in order to contribute to one.
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.660]   And there are ways to get around that.
[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.260]   But that is kind of the bucket that's the most freewheeling
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.460]   in the sense that anyone that has earned income
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.340]   can go open one.
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.100]   You don't have to get it from an employer.
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.300]   You don't have to have, say,
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.540]   a specific healthcare plan to get one,
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.380]   things of that nature.
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.220]   The qualifications, we'll say, are fewer.
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.140]   And then we'll say small business pre-tax accounts.
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.340]   So generally speaking, in my mind,
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.540]   this is going to mean the solo 401(k) or the SEP IRA.
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.540]   This is where people will start to get thrown off
[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.020]   because we're now using a lot of the same words,
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.980]   401(k), IRA, but in the small business sphere,
[00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.420]   they do function a little bit differently
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.300]   than the other two categories that we just mentioned.
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.260]   So the contribution limits are higher.
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.960]   The way that contribution limits are determined are higher,
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.320]   because if you're self-employed, solopreneur,
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.700]   you are the employee and the employer.
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.700]   So now this opens up some wiggle room
[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.540]   for you to get a little bit more creative.
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.820]   And a lot of people that have W-2 jobs and side hustles
[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.500]   or W-2 jobs and businesses that they're operating to,
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.940]   I did that for several years,
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.180]   you can contribute to two 401(k)s.
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.700]   If you have a different source of income
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:18.660]   funding each of them,
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.780]   you're fully within your rights to use both.
[00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.700]   So I always think if you can use it, use it, right?
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.200]   Get all the benefit you can.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.820]   So that's the tax advantaged world at a high level
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.180]   that I would point to.
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.180]   And then I kind of think about the taxable brokerage account
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:35.900]   as that stepsister off to the side
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.740]   where you're not getting any tax advantages up front
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.020]   by contributing to one,
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.300]   but because of the way capital gains are taxed
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.140]   in the United States,
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:47.140]   at least right now in this current tax code and paradigm,
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:51.940]   there is a pretty generous allowance of 0% capital gains.
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.500]   So even though it's not tax sheltered every year,
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.500]   and like you're buying and selling within this account,
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.260]   you're still gonna be paying capital gains
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.540]   as you're building it up.
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.700]   If your income goes to zero
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.820]   and you start withdrawing earnings
[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.180]   from that account to live on,
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.860]   you can spend a lot of money
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.140]   before it starts taxing you anything on those gains.
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.820]   So kind of think of it like a poor man's Roth IRA,
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.140]   but my love of tax advantaged accounts
[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.780]   extends to non-tax advantaged accounts too,
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.380]   because investments are just taxed so favorably
[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:21.220]   in the United States,
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.140]   or gains on investments, I should say.
[00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:26.500]   So that's kind of how I conceptualize the landscape.
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.620]   - Maybe we'll put three others in this other bucket
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.580]   of tax advantaged accounts that we'll touch on at the end.
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.940]   - I'm dying to know what this other bucket is.
[00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.860]   - Well, we have HSAs, we've got 529s,
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.300]   and I'll throw donor advised funds in there as well.
[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.020]   - I need to do some digging on the donor advised funds.
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.860]   So I'm glad that you brought that up.
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:46.780]   - Let's put those to the side.
[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:47.620]   We'll come back to them.
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.700]   And I've got one more.
[00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.220]   I've recently been doing some digging
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.700]   on cash balance plans,
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.340]   which is like another small business type of retirement plan
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:56.260]   that's super interesting.
[00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.620]   But let's start with the employer plans.
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.820]   Anyone who's employed probably has had one
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.340]   at one point in time.
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.420]   And I guess there's a few questions.
[00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.980]   So one, I wanna make sure we cover,
[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.860]   some companies now are starting to offer the choice
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.500]   between pre-tax and Roth, which is an interesting one,
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.540]   which will apply to IRAs as well.
[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:18.260]   And then also is the constraints on these accounts
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.220]   or really any retirement accounts worth the trade-off
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.980]   that you don't get to access the money?
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.060]   - I'm glad you asked.
[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.700]   - First off, one of the craziest things
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.340]   is that so few people are actually enrolled in these.
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.860]   And when I joined Google,
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.700]   I remember talking to someone that said
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.100]   the best way to increase the number of people
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.100]   who contribute to their 401k is to just default, turn it on,
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.540]   because so many people aren't.
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.540]   And I've heard people say that in their companies,
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.260]   even with matching, 50% of people aren't doing this.
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.540]   And so just being more aware of how it works,
[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.140]   I think will just help everyone, but let's jump in.
[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.980]   - What might be helpful is if I break down
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:55.060]   what to me is the best strategic way
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.980]   to approach this dilemma of,
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.580]   I have this investable income every year,
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.140]   I'm not sure where to put it.
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.020]   I wanna optimize where I'm putting it
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.820]   so that I'm getting the best bang for my buck, the best ROI.
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.580]   A lot of people, when they think about investing,
[00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:09.500]   they think about ROI,
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.580]   they're thinking about the underlying assets
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.540]   that they're buying.
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.460]   What am I gonna buy in these accounts
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.780]   that's gonna return the most money back to me,
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.540]   that's gonna perform the best?
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.260]   But beating the market, we know, is very hard.
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:25.260]   And active investing or taking a more active role
[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.180]   in the choices and trying to watch things
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.700]   and sell and buy at the right times,
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.020]   I think of that a little bit as a fool's errand.
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.820]   If the people at the hedge funds
[00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.540]   are not consistently beating the market,
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.900]   the chances that you're gonna beat it in your spare time,
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.500]   probably unlikely.
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:42.220]   But what we can do is try to outsmart the tax code.
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.700]   There we have the rules spelled out to us.
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:48.380]   We know exactly how we can increase our returns by,
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.220]   if you're in the 24% bracket, 24% per year.
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.620]   You're in the 32% bracket,
[00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.060]   increase your return on that money by 32% per year.
[00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.700]   How? By putting it in a pre-tax account.
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:02.220]   Then you get 24% or 32%, whatever your marginal tax rate is,
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.940]   assuming the entire contribution
[00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:06.020]   falls into that top marginal bracket.
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.460]   That's money that now stays in your pocket.
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:09.860]   You are now keeping that money
[00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.780]   instead of paying it in taxes.
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.380]   Now we'll get to what happens later
[00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:14.340]   because people love to say,
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.780]   "Well, you're not not paying it, you're just deferring it."
[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:17.620]   Maybe.
[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.140]   With some careful tax planning, you might never be paying it.
[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.100]   So we'll get into that in a little bit.
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.900]   - In advance of the new year,
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.260]   Amy and I are really getting our life organized
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.700]   and a big part of that is our digital life.
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.300]   Think everything from family to home, to travel,
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.100]   and that doesn't even include work.
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.260]   Fortunately, we fully adopted Notion as our second brain
[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.180]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.340]   for this episode.

[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.420]   thanks to Notion's new feature, Q&A,

[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.900]   I've used it to find information from old notes,
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:02.860]   answer questions about a marketing plan,
[00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:06.580]   and even find travel details, all in seconds.

[00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:48.580]   There are only a few brands I use almost every single day
[00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.140]   and Viore is one of them
[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.020]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.100]   for this episode.
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.300]   Viore makes performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:57.960]   Everything is designed to work out in,
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.500]   but it doesn't look or feel like it at all
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.300]   and it is so freaking comfortable,
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.380]   you will wanna wear it all the time.
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.220]   Seriously, I'm pretty sure it's more comfortable
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.940]   than whatever you're wearing right now,
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.540]   unless it's Viore, in which case you know what I mean.
[00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:11.980]   And it's not just for men.
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:15.380]   My wife, Amy, is as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:18.020]   My personal favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.460]   I think I have three pairs of them
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:20.960]   and they're probably the most comfortable pants
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.020]   I've ever owned.
[00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.820]   Their products are incredibly versatile
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.900]   and can be used for just about any activity,
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.820]   whether it's running, training, yoga,
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.980]   but they're also great for lounging
[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:33.260]   or I even wear their MetaPants out to a nice dinner.
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.180]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.500]   and for All The Hacks listeners,
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.980]   they're offering 20% off your first purchase

[00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.540]   - To your question about, is it worth the penalty, right?
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:02.780]   Or is it worth locking it up?
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.300]   'Cause I think that that's a great question
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.000]   and it can be addressed with some strategy.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.640]   But when you contribute,
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.740]   let's say I'm in the 32% tax bracket marginally
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.580]   and I'm not exactly sure
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.580]   of what that would put my income at at this point in time.
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.780]   We'll say maybe like in the 300,000 range,
[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.340]   if I'm single, I honestly don't remember.
[00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.660]   But let's say I've got my 22,500 to invest, right?
[00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.740]   So I'm gonna put it in my employer 401k.
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.780]   I'm gonna buy something boring inside there
[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.260]   like VTSAX or a target date fund.
[00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.300]   I'm gonna get my money invested in the 401k.
[00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:32.900]   I'm gonna get that great employer match.
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.700]   Honestly, the employer match to me is like, yeah, cool.
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.780]   Okay, thanks for like the little extra on the side.
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.340]   The main benefit is that tax break.
[00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:43.060]   So on my 22,500 or I guess next year,
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:45.280]   my 23,000 that I'm putting in,
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:50.280]   I'm gonna get $7,360 in tax savings based on that one move.
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:54.060]   My tax liability is now gonna go down.
[00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:55.660]   I still have to pay FICA taxes on it.
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.740]   That's fine, that's true across the board.
[00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.180]   I'm gonna have to pay that payroll tax,
[00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:00.460]   whether it's traditional or Roth,
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.060]   but my federal and my state taxes
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:05.220]   that I would owe on that money now come back to me.
[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:07.220]   This is partially why this stuff is so great
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.380]   for people who live in California, in New York,
[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.380]   in these states where state taxes are so high,
[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:14.460]   particularly if they plan to retire to Florida,
[00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:15.740]   where there is no state tax.
[00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.100]   Don't pay your state income taxes on this money now,
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.580]   pay it later when you're in Florida
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:20.820]   and the rate is zero, right?
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.180]   So I get my 7,360.
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.540]   I know that that's the tax break I've just unlocked.
[00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:26.740]   And in order to do this right,
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.800]   I'm multiplying the contribution by my marginal tax rate.
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.420]   There are more sophisticated ways to do this
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.160]   if you wanna be like super, super precise,
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.300]   but that's the ballpark.
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.900]   And what do you know?
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.180]   What's the Roth IRA limit next year?
[00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.220]   Oh, it's $7,000, cool.
[00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.140]   There's my Roth IRA contribution that I didn't have before
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.180]   that I can just now pop into that account.
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.380]   I got 360 leftover, but in doing so,
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.460]   in contributing to that pre-tax account,
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.260]   I just created more investable income for myself
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.460]   to go get that Roth diversity elsewhere.
[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.420]   So this is my favorite approach for people
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.100]   that have access to both.
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.660]   And you may have noticed that I was like,
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.420]   oh, 300K, 32%.
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.240]   People that are familiar with income limits
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.900]   for the Roth IRA might be like, ooh,
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.460]   but Katie, there's an income limit.
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.780]   Very simple workaround.
[00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.700]   You've probably talked about this on the show before.
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.860]   Back to a Roth IRA, it's a very simple maneuver.
[00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:16.780]   It doesn't take long and we can get into that,
[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.940]   but there is an easy way to get some money in a Roth IRA
[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:22.020]   if you want to, even if you're over the income limit
[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.220]   and that loophole is still open.
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.340]   So remains to be seen if it stays open.
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:27.620]   But that's my favorite way to approach this
[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:30.660]   is to use that bigger bucket to get a good tax break
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.460]   and then take those tax savings
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:33.780]   and invest them somewhere else.
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.460]   I recently had a CFP come on my show
[00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:40.140]   and I went through my strategy with him
[00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.740]   and we basically debated it.
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.660]   And then he ended up coming to me
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:44.900]   with a spreadsheet that he made
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.460]   that brings in social security, RMDs, inheritance taxes,
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:51.740]   all the other complex, nuanced considerations
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.860]   for someone that also takes into consideration age
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:56.300]   and how long they're gonna work,
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:57.980]   who they're gonna pass the money down to.
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:00.740]   And we ended up coming to the conclusion on the show
[00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:02.140]   that in most cases,
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.860]   with the exception of I think the 12% bracket
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.020]   and people who end up working and earning income
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.940]   until they're like well into their 70s,
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.580]   this approach, this traditional 401k Roth IRA
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.820]   or taxable account for the tax savings
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:19.100]   is going to create net more income later in life,
[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.780]   even if you have very little tax planning later
[00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.860]   because it just generates a bigger portfolio
[00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:25.940]   to draw down from.
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.940]   So that's kind of my favorite bread and butter strategy
[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:30.060]   that I like to follow.
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.700]   - So I wanna clarify a few things.
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.460]   So you said, oh, if you're in the 32% tax bracket,
[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:35.900]   you'll save 32% this year.
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.300]   That is true, but all of the money you put
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.660]   into your pre-tax traditional 401k,
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.460]   you're gonna pay taxes on all the contributions
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.620]   and all the gains in the future.
[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:47.260]   Some of the optimization is,
[00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.820]   well, if I'm not living in California,
[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:50.060]   I'll be at a lower tax rate.
[00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:51.340]   Some of the optimization is,
[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:52.980]   well, if I'm not making as much money,
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.340]   I'll be in a lower tax rate.
[00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.060]   We don't know what will happen with the tax code.
[00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.140]   So who knows?
[00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:00.340]   But what is certain is that if I had taken that,
[00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:04.820]   let's call it $23,000 and I had paid taxes on it now,
[00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.620]   it would have been reduced to let's call it 16,000.
[00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:11.100]   So that 16,000 will only, even if I doubled my money,
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:12.700]   it would only go to 32,000.
[00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:17.100]   Whereas if I do it in the 401k, it stays as 23,000.
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.820]   And if I doubled my money, it would go to 46,000.
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.860]   So because you have a higher base,
[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.660]   you're earning on a higher amount.
[00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:25.060]   Those earnings will be greater
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.780]   over the lifetime of the account.
[00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:29.260]   And yes, you will have to pay taxes on all of it
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:30.140]   when you take it out.
[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.740]   But even if the tax rates were the same,
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.820]   because you have a higher base to grow, it still works out.
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:38.380]   - Right, and I think that that's a really good qualification
[00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.540]   to make because we can get into how to optimize later
[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.180]   and how to pay very little, if any taxes,
[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.660]   depending on your situation.
[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:49.060]   But I always assume when people are making this decision,
[00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:51.700]   they're like, "Should I do traditional or Roth 401k?"
[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:52.540]   But you're right.
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.660]   Most people are not even going that far.
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.820]   They're going, "I'm gonna take all my income home
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.860]   and then I'm gonna figure out how to invest it
[00:19:58.860 --> 00:19:59.700]   and what to do with it."
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.540]   And to your point, if you're doing that,
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.940]   well, now you're paying all the taxes on the money
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.740]   and it's not gonna grow tax-free.
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.460]   Usually, if you're gonna pay all the taxes on the money,
[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.540]   you at least want it to end up in a Roth account
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:11.060]   where it's gonna compound tax-free
[00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.020]   for the rest of your life.
[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.580]   But if you're just taking it all home
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.460]   and you're not taking advantage of that account,
[00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.540]   whether you choose traditional or Roth,
[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.980]   depending on your situation and what's right for you,
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.700]   yeah, you're gonna be in a position
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.340]   where you may have more flexibility,
[00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:24.820]   you can access it sooner.
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.820]   And in some cases, that's desirable
[00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:28.180]   if you're gonna use it for something.
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:31.300]   But most Americans are under-saving for retirement.
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.900]   They're not putting enough money
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.180]   into these retirement accounts
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.540]   and they're figuring out what to do with their savings
[00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:38.220]   once it's in their checking account.
[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.220]   By that point, you've already sacrificed
[00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:42.900]   a lot of the potential gains that you could have gotten
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.420]   by simply using one of these employer accounts.
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.460]   - Let's add a few things.
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.180]   One, there are some trade-offs, right?
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.420]   The liquidity is real.
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.300]   If you need to buy a home,
[00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.620]   I know there is an exemption to take some money out,
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:54.780]   penalty-free for a home,
[00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.300]   but it's a very small amount relative to the cost
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.820]   to buy a home in America right now.
[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:03.500]   - And not an ideal, really, approach to be using,
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:04.540]   I would say.
[00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:07.900]   - So the penalty on taking the money out is high enough
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.340]   that I don't think it's worth putting the money in
[00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:11.380]   if there's any chance
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.140]   you're gonna have to take it out early.
[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:15.540]   You should always be not putting money
[00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.820]   into these retirement accounts
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:20.940]   if you happen to know that you need money to pay a tax bill,
[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.500]   make an investment, buy a home, any of these things.
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.540]   So I think it's really important to make sure
[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:27.220]   you max out your emergency fund
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.180]   before you invest in your retirement accounts
[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:30.020]   and all those things.
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.980]   With the exception, if your employer offers a match,
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.060]   I know you kind of brushed over it briefly,
[00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.020]   but at Google, I can't remember the match,
[00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.700]   it was something like 50% up to the full amount.
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.260]   Whatever the amount was, I think I got $8,000 free.
[00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:47.260]   And so getting $8,000 free and truly at no cost to you
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.620]   other than contributing to your 401(k)
[00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.540]   would actually even be worth it
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:53.740]   if you had to pay the penalty next year
[00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:55.340]   to withdraw the money out of the account.
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.060]   - Interesting, I know I'm now thinking
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:58.620]   through the back of the napkin math of like,
[00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:02.500]   well, the penalty is 10% plus the tax on the contribution,
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.700]   but to your point, unless there is some rule
[00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:06.980]   in the account that the match goes away,
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.260]   I don't think the match would go away.
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:09.420]   I think it's locked.
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:10.940]   I think it's locked once you get it.
[00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:12.660]   So like, yes, in a following year,
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.780]   if you were to have to withdraw the money
[00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:17.300]   and it wasn't protected by any of the 401(k)
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.220]   loan requirements or the hardship
[00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:21.700]   that there's some withdrawals
[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.540]   where if you're in a really hard up position,
[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:24.980]   they'll let you withdraw money.
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:26.860]   I would agree that depending on the amount
[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.260]   that the match is gonna generate for you,
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:31.340]   then yeah, it might be a worthwhile trade-off.
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.340]   - Yeah, I mean, if the match is 5%,
[00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:34.820]   then it's not gonna outweigh the fee.
[00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:38.540]   But if your employer is matching 25, 50, or even 100%,
[00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:39.780]   I would make the case,
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.620]   maybe it's not worth it for the hassle
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:44.380]   if you don't even have one month of emergency savings.
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:47.300]   But if you've got two, three months of emergency savings,
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.140]   my personal belief is max out your 401(k)
[00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:52.020]   to the match no matter what.
[00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:55.660]   Then consider whether you have any liquidity issues
[00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.060]   that you will need to resolve,
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.700]   whether that's resolved because you owe money to someone
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.820]   or resolve you wanna buy a home,
[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.940]   then I would say you don't necessarily wanna put that.
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:06.180]   And then everything else is fair game
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:07.660]   for tax-advantaged accounts.
[00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.340]   - I think it also, I would add too,
[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.500]   a lot of people will not even think about the 401(k)
[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.460]   until they're out of debt, even credit card debt,
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:15.060]   because they're like, "Well, the interest rate's so high."
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.940]   But to your point, if they're matching 5% of your salary,
[00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:20.100]   if you put in 5%, they'll put in 5%,
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.980]   that is a 100% interest rate on your money
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.220]   'cause they're matching it.
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:27.060]   So that should also probably be a top priority
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.660]   even if you're in a position where you're like,
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:29.700]   "Ooh, but I'm still in debt,
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.740]   so investing is not a super high priority for me right now."
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.500]   I would still put that 401(k) match.
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:35.820]   I think I kind of write it off
[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:38.580]   because I hear people say, "I don't get a 401(k) match,
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.140]   so I'm not gonna use the 401(k)."
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:41.540]   And I'm like, "Oh, no, no, no,
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:43.340]   that's not even the primary reason
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:44.660]   you should be using the 401(k).
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.180]   That's great if you have one."
[00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:47.780]   Especially if you're earning a lot of money,
[00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:51.220]   a 4% to 5% match on your salary could be significant.
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:53.980]   It could be another 10 or 20 grand a year,
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:56.500]   depending on how the matching is structured.
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:58.140]   So it's not that it's insignificant,
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:00.140]   it's just that if you don't have one,
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.100]   I don't think that that's a reason not to use it
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:06.020]   because to me, the primary benefit is the tax break up front
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:08.100]   that's gonna create more investable income for you,
[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.580]   and then the years and years and years
[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.660]   of tax-sheltered compounding,
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:15.300]   which we'll have to pay taxes on later
[00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:16.580]   in some way, shape, or form.
[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:18.620]   But that is a huge benefit,
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.900]   especially as your network starts to get bigger.
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.580]   A couple percentage points or dividend taxes
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:25.780]   on your taxable account may not feel like that big of a deal
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.540]   when it's worth $100,000,
[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:29.180]   but when it's $2 million,
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:30.740]   well now with 3% dividend yield,
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:31.660]   you're starting to pay taxes.
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:32.860]   It catches up to you,
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.580]   and I think just kind of being smart about tax planning
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.140]   is important for that reason.
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:37.980]   - Totally agree.
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:38.820]   So the last two things.
[00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:39.740]   One is fees.
[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:41.740]   I have worked at some companies
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:43.820]   where the 401(k)s are pretty terrible.
[00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:47.260]   The investment options are actively managed mutual funds
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:48.420]   with high fees.
[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:49.860]   And then I've worked at a company like Google
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:53.500]   where it was like the lowest cost Vanguard Admiral Fund,
[00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.540]   tiny expense ratio funds,
[00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:58.260]   no cost to manage the 401(k) to the employees.
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:00.060]   So I found this data point,
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:03.300]   which was that if you assume a portfolio return of 6%,
[00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:06.300]   I believe that the underperformance
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:09.060]   where a 401(k) stops mattering
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:10.860]   and the tax benefit stops mattering
[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:12.900]   is about 2.1%.
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:13.780]   - In fees?
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:14.620]   - No, no, no.
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:15.460]   I'm saying like,
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:18.060]   if you're going to get 2.1% less performance,
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.860]   the tax advantage kind of goes away.
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:22.660]   So if you have funds where the only options
[00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.820]   are actively managed funds with really high expense ratios,
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:28.180]   I could make a case that it doesn't work
[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:29.540]   with maybe an exception.
[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:33.140]   If you can roll it out into a Roth IRA or something later,
[00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:33.980]   great.
[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.740]   But if you're at an employer with really high fee.
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:37.580]   - If you're like,
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.060]   you know you're not going to be there for a long time,
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.780]   but you're making a lot of money right now
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.700]   and you just really need the tax break.
[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.620]   Because I think what happens is those fees compound, right?
[00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:47.780]   So it's like one year of having the fees
[00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:49.540]   or having shitty investment options.
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:51.420]   You might be able to just keep it in cash
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:52.780]   and not invest it in anything
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.740]   if the investment options are truly terrible,
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:56.420]   but get your tax break.
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:57.860]   And then if you know you're going to leave
[00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:58.940]   in a year or two,
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.660]   you just roll it out and put it in an IRA and self-manage it.
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:03.540]   I generally agree that the fees,
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:04.900]   you should be very wary of them.
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.620]   And there are absolutely terrible 401k providers.
[00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:10.180]   There are even more terrible 403b providers.
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:11.620]   There is like a very well-known,
[00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:12.980]   maybe not as well-known as it should be,
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:16.060]   scam that has kind of been quietly perpetrated
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:19.140]   on public school teachers over the last few years
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:22.500]   where these annuity salespeople will go and sell teachers
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.620]   these very expensive annuities within their 403b's
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:29.620]   that are vastly underperforming and have crazy fees,
[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:31.100]   like three to 5% per year.
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:32.220]   It's just like unbelievable.
[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.980]   The SEC is actually suing this company
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:36.580]   like $50 million for misleading investors.
[00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:38.140]   So those things are out there
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.980]   and it is 100% possible for the fees
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.420]   or the plan structure or the investment options
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:46.660]   to ultimately negate any benefit you would be getting.
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:47.980]   So I'm glad you brought that up.
[00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:52.300]   The general position or orientation that people should take
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:54.980]   is assume it's probably gonna be okay,
[00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:56.660]   look into it to double check,
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:59.780]   but don't let the fear that there might be fees
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:02.380]   keep you from even going down that path in the first place
[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:03.220]   or looking into it.
[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:05.140]   And you can always email someone at HR
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.260]   or a plan administrator if you're not sure.
[00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.420]   Usually it's in the paperwork,
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:11.220]   but sometimes the paperwork is a little bit confusing.
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.180]   - There's actually websites.
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:15.500]   I wanna say, if you search 401k fees,
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.020]   I don't know one off the top of my head,
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.340]   but there are websites where you like type in your employer
[00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:21.700]   and they've already like read the plan docs
[00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:24.740]   and will tell you, hey, your 401k sucks.
[00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:25.940]   It has really high fees.
[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:27.220]   - Man, I love that.
[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:28.780]   - And most of the reason they do this
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.900]   is around what you can do with your money
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.380]   after you leave your employer.
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.220]   You can take your money from a 401k
[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:37.940]   and one, you can roll it into your new employer's 401k.
[00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:41.100]   So I remember I had a 401k and my wife had a 401k
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.420]   at old companies that actually were pretty terrible,
[00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:45.940]   but then we joined companies that had great 401ks
[00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:48.260]   and by great, I mean just low fee
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:52.700]   and we could roll those 401ks into our new 401ks.
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.740]   You can also roll it over into a rollover IRA
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.380]   and we'll get into some of the rollover stuff
[00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:59.060]   in a little bit, but know that yes,
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:02.020]   you're not stuck in this terrible 401k forever.
[00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:05.380]   And if you have old 401ks just lying around,
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:07.100]   but you like your current 401k,
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:08.740]   then you can also roll those all in
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:11.340]   and put them all together and stop managing them separately.
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.500]   But not every company has this option.
[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:14.740]   I know I did when I was at Google
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:16.500]   and I know it's being more popular.
[00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:20.940]   - This holiday season, I wanna give gifts to my loved ones
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:22.900]   that make them feel special and unique,
[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:25.260]   just like the relationships we share.
[00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:26.500]   If you feel the same way,
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.220]   you should be giving them StoryWorth,
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:29.700]   which is an incredible gift
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.460]   I've given to the people I care about
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:33.780]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:35.580]   StoryWorth is an online service
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:36.900]   that helps you and your loved ones
[00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.340]   preserve precious memories and stories for years to come.
[00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.260]   It's a thoughtful and meaningful gift
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.580]   that connects you to those who matter most.
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.340]   Each week, StoryWorth emails your relative or friend
[00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:49.580]   a thought-provoking question of your choice
[00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:51.620]   from a vast pool of options.
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.420]   Each unique prompt asks a question
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:54.700]   you've never thought about,
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.740]   like what's the bravest thing you've ever done,
[00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.540]   or if you could see into the future,
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:00.580]   what would you want to find out?
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.740]   After a year, StoryWorth will compile
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:04.380]   all of your loved one's stories,
[00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:07.420]   including photos, into a beautiful keepsake book
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:08.500]   that you'll be able to share
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.660]   and revisit for generations to come,
[00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:12.100]   which now that we have kids,
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.460]   I couldn't be more excited
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:16.140]   to start collecting these books to share with them.
[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:18.140]   Reading the weekly stories helps connect you
[00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:21.500]   with loved ones no matter how near or far apart you are,
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.860]   and you'll be surprised at the things you learn,
[00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:26.420]   like how my dad might have gotten into trouble
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:28.140]   for landing a helicopter at Denny's
[00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:29.940]   back when he was in the military.
[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:32.500]   With StoryWorth, I'm giving those I love most
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.540]   a thoughtful, personal gift from the heart
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:37.940]   and preserving their memories and stories for years to come.

[00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:55.060]   I'm sure you all know about Black Friday and Cyber Monday,
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:57.900]   but did you know that next Tuesday is Giving Tuesday?
[00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:59.820]   It's a global generosity movement
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:03.380]   surrounding a time I know we all have gratitude on our mind.
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:04.940]   Whether it's your time or money,
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.700]   it's a great opportunity to consider giving.
[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:09.220]   And in the spirit of this episode
[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:10.820]   on tax-advantaged accounts,

[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:18.100]   who I'm excited to partner with today.
[00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.820]   Daffy actually came up organically in this episode,
[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:22.980]   so you'll hear a lot more about it later.
[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.980]   But if you're not familiar, it's a platform and app
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:27.860]   that makes it so easy and efficient
[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:30.700]   to manage giving to the charities you care about.
[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:33.180]   So if you're planning to give or raise funds
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.140]   for any charities, schools, or faith-based organizations
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:38.220]   this holiday season, and you wanna do it
[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:40.820]   in the simplest and most tax-efficient way,

[00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:00.460]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to

[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:17.500]   How do you think about the option
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.700]   if your company says traditional versus Roth 401(k)?
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:23.660]   Traditional 401(k) is my preference
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:25.460]   for the reasons that I highlighted.
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.980]   The additional piece in what I thought you were gonna say
[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:30.580]   with Google is that after-tax option.
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:32.180]   Oh yeah, so I wanna get to that also.
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.540]   But is there ever a case, let's say right now
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.460]   you're living in Florida and you have no state tax
[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:39.340]   and you're not making that much,
[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:42.740]   is there a case to pick the Roth 401(k) option?
[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:45.180]   Here's who I would say Roth 401(k) is best for.
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:46.860]   12% tax bracket or below.
[00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:49.220]   Because the jump from 12 to 22,
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:51.260]   that's a pretty big increase.
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:54.500]   22 to 24, okay, we're talking two incremental
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:55.340]   percentage points.
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:57.260]   But 12% marginal tax bracket,
[00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:00.940]   if after your standard deduction and other deductions,
[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:02.700]   you are in the 12% bracket
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:06.140]   and your 401(k) contributions will be taxed at 12% rather,
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:08.860]   Roth 401(k), it's gonna be hard to do better than that.
[00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.300]   The other people who would be a good candidate
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:14.260]   for Roth 401(k) are those who expect to work
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:15.620]   for a very long time.
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:16.580]   If for some reason you're like,
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:20.100]   oh, I know I'm gonna have earned income into my 70s.
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:21.820]   Or like I have rental properties
[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.900]   that are gonna create taxable income later.
[00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.700]   Or I have a business that I'm gonna retain
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:28.380]   partial ownership of and I expect to be taking money
[00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:30.700]   out of that business even after I'm retired
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:31.940]   and no longer working there.
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:34.180]   If there's a lot of other sources of income
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:35.980]   that you expect to have in retirement
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:38.860]   after you stop quote unquote earning income,
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:41.180]   then the Roth 401(k) probably makes more sense.
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:43.860]   Now, the reason that I always prefer traditional
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:46.580]   for myself and people who are like me,
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:50.340]   in that I mean, you are earning a really healthy income now,
[00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:52.540]   you have a high marginal tax rate now,
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:55.340]   you intend to retire probably in your 50s
[00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:58.260]   and you don't have a bunch of other sources of income
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:32:59.300]   that are gonna be coming in
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:03.500]   and jacking up your tax rate in retirement unnecessarily
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.140]   or unwantingly, we'll say.
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:07.060]   I tend to think that traditional makes more sense,
[00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:09.860]   but there are 100% use cases for Roth 401(k).
[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:11.940]   I would just say that the expectation
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:13.460]   that a lot of people have that,
[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:16.540]   oh, well, this question is often positioned to people as,
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:19.620]   do you think you're gonna earn more now or earn more later?
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:21.580]   Most people hear that and they go,
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:25.420]   huh, well, I'm making $100,000 a year now.
[00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:28.860]   Am I gonna earn more when I'm 55 or 58, you know, whatever?
[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:31.060]   Yeah, like I'm a trajectory that's going up.
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:32.540]   My career is gonna keep getting better.
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:33.700]   I'm gonna keep earning more money,
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:36.780]   but you're not taxed on your traditional 401(k) withdrawals
[00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:39.260]   in retirement based on your last working salary.
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:41.220]   You're taxed on the amount that you're taking
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:42.900]   as earned income in retirement,
[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:44.420]   which for most people,
[00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:46.420]   just by nature of how these things work,
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.980]   even with social security, once you turn,
[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:50.940]   I guess you can delay it after you're 62,
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:53.020]   but you could start taking it when you're 62.
[00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:54.500]   Even with social security,
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:58.340]   most people are not able to create more earned income
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.260]   for themselves in retirement
[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:03.820]   than they are as employees that are earning salaries
[00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:05.820]   and focused on increasing their compensation.
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:08.940]   It's weirdly hard to do for most individuals.
[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:11.860]   Now, if you have a $15 million nest egg
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:13.660]   and you're like, my safe withdrawal rate
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:16.580]   is 500,000 or a million dollars a year.
[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.860]   Okay, well now you might be making more in retirement,
[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:21.620]   but maybe not, because how did you get
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:23.740]   that $15 million nest egg in the first place?
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:25.580]   Well, you're probably making a lot of money.
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:27.380]   You're probably making more than 500
[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.940]   or a million dollars a year.
[00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:30.180]   So I think it's kind of that like,
[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:32.500]   in order to be in a higher tax rate in retirement,
[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.340]   to have enough money in retirement
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:36.220]   that you can be living so large
[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:37.180]   that you're pushing yourself
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:39.020]   into a higher marginal tax bracket,
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:40.700]   you have to be making a lot of money now
[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:42.020]   and investing a lot of money now.
[00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:43.700]   So probably gonna be hard to out-earn.
[00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:45.260]   And it's not that that's impossible,
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:48.340]   it's just that we choose Roth 401k for certainty
[00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:49.820]   without often looking at like,
[00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.940]   okay, but what is the lifetime tax bill
[00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:53.980]   that I'm paying by taking this approach?
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:56.340]   Am I inadvertently paying more money
[00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:58.660]   than I would need to be on these contributions
[00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:01.420]   when I could be a little bit savvier about this decision
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.540]   and create more net investable income
[00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:06.260]   by using pre-tax and then investing the tax savings?
[00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:07.780]   The other person that should not do this
[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:09.900]   is the person who's not gonna invest the tax savings.
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:12.060]   If you just invest in your traditional 401k
[00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:13.860]   and then spend the tax savings,
[00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:15.820]   well, congratulations, you should have used Roth
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.500]   because you kind of defeated the purpose of the strategy.
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:19.620]   That's a great thing, you know,
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:21.260]   like do what you're actually gonna do.
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:22.940]   If you know yourself and you're like,
[00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:24.980]   "Yeah, there is no fricking chance
[00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:27.100]   that I'm gonna actually end up investing that money,"
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:28.660]   it can be a forced savings device.
[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:30.340]   Just pay the taxes now and use Roth
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:32.780]   and like forget about the optimization and the math.
[00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:33.820]   But I guess I would assume
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.060]   that the people who listen to this show
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:38.100]   are probably not the people who would be like,
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.780]   "Yeah, no, I'm not gonna invest that money."
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:42.500]   I think your audience is probably pretty interested
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:45.460]   in optimizing their financial situation.
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.220]   So of course there are scenarios,
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:49.300]   there are just fewer and farther between
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:50.740]   than most people would probably think.
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:54.020]   - The overarching theme is no matter what tax advantage
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:55.100]   to count you're choosing,
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:56.220]   it probably shouldn't affect
[00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:57.860]   how much you've spent in a given year, right?
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:00.140]   For me, I know there are people who think,
[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:02.660]   "Oh, I spend whatever's left over."
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:04.340]   I'm typically the person that's like,
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:05.900]   "I'm not gonna change my spending
[00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:08.380]   based on how much I contribute to an account.
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:10.820]   I'm just gonna spend independently of that thing."
[00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.100]   - The way that it works for most people
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:14.180]   is they maybe make the switch, right?
[00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:16.580]   They go from Roth 401k to traditional 401k.
[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:18.380]   They're contributing the same amount of money
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.980]   to that 401k, but now their paychecks are higher
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:22.180]   because of the tax break.
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.060]   So they're like, "Ah, cool, extra money.
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:24.940]   I'm gonna spend it."
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:27.380]   I tend to agree with you that I try to make
[00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:29.940]   my spending decisions independent of like
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:32.300]   what number is actually in my checking account.
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:35.260]   That is, I try to plan that type of thing ahead of time
[00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:38.180]   so that my investments don't wobble, we'll say,
[00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:40.860]   based on tax breaks that I may or may not be generating.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:42.900]   - Last little thing is, it's interesting,
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:45.740]   the contribution limit for a 401k,
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:48.140]   we talked about it next year being 23,000,
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:49.980]   but that's not quite true.
[00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:53.700]   The total contribution limit will be 68,000.
[00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:55.300]   And by the way, if you're over 50,
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:59.060]   both those numbers go up by $7,500 in 2024.
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:01.380]   But that $23,000 is the cap
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:05.020]   for the pre-tax employee contribution.
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:08.340]   And so this is where I wanna get kind of ninja style
[00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:10.700]   and go a little deeper and commonly called
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:15.020]   the mega backdoor 401k, a really Roth contribution.
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:17.780]   I was fortunate that Google's 401k allowed it.
[00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:19.540]   - Yes, a lot of tech companies do this.
[00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:22.860]   Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Apple, Meta, I should say.
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:26.140]   They all, for whatever reason, I think Dell too.
[00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:27.900]   I've worked at a couple that have done this
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:30.460]   and it seems to be a commonality between tech companies
[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:32.060]   if they all are in the know about this.
[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:36.100]   - The trick here is you can make more than 23,000 next year,
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:37.980]   whatever the limit is, in contributions,
[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:41.980]   but they are non-deductible post-tax contributions
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:44.180]   into your pre-tax 401k.
[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:46.460]   And on the whole, that is a horrible thing to do.
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:49.660]   It doesn't make any sense to contribute post-tax money
[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:52.180]   into a retirement account that you can't take money out of
[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:53.980]   for many years and have to pay penalties,
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:56.620]   except when you are allowed to take those
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:58.660]   after-tax contributions to your 401k
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:01.380]   and roll them over to a Roth 401k.
[00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:05.140]   And so that lets you take money beyond the next year,
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:07.700]   $7,000 you could get into a Roth IRA
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:10.900]   and put a lot more money into a Roth investment vehicle,
[00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.860]   which then, like we've kind of mentioned,
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.380]   you aren't gonna pay taxes
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.180]   when you make contributions to a Roth account,
[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:17.780]   whether it's an IRA or a Roth 401k,
[00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:19.940]   you don't pay taxes on any of the gains
[00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:21.260]   or any of the money you take out.
[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:24.500]   So I loved that strategy when I had it available to me,
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:27.060]   but when I worked at Wealthfront, it wasn't an option.
[00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:28.940]   - You know what's interesting is
[00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:32.180]   I took screenshots of the language
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:34.860]   in my old Fidelity account with,
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:37.100]   I believe it was with Dell, the 401k.
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:39.220]   I think I might have screenshots from Facebook too,
[00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:42.020]   where I wanted to see how they were referring to this.
[00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:44.540]   Here it is, with the mega backdoor Roth IRA,
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:46.020]   how it came up on the screen
[00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:47.900]   when I was like reviewing elections.
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.700]   The way that you determine this
[00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:52.540]   is there will be your contributions per pay period.
[00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:55.900]   So it'll say, okay, pre-tax, Roth, after-tax,
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:58.420]   and usually there will be like bonus elections
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:38:59.260]   and things like that.
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:02.620]   But what you're looking for is that after-tax option,
[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:05.020]   which is again, different than Roth, right?
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:08.140]   It's not a Roth contribution to that elective deferral,
[00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:11.420]   that 23,000, that after-tax option
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:14.180]   is referring to how much of your salary
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:16.940]   you want deferred into that difference
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:21.420]   between the $68,000 limit and the 23,000 elective deferral.
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:25.740]   So it's about $45,000 total that you could put in, in 2024.
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:27.580]   And so you would choose your percentage, right?
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:28.820]   You could do up to 45K.
[00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:30.460]   And then there's often gonna be,
[00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:32.300]   in both plans that I had, this was the case.
[00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:33.780]   So I'm not gonna blanket statement say
[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:34.620]   it's gonna be in everyone,
[00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:37.980]   but typically it's these in-plan conversions
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:39.060]   that you're looking for.
[00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:40.380]   In the case of Fidelity,
[00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:43.260]   it was the daily Roth in-plan conversion.
[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:46.900]   Do you want to convert your after-tax contributions to Roth?
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:48.660]   And you basically just have to select,
[00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:50.420]   yes, that is what I want you to do
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:51.700]   with these after-tax conversions.
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:53.380]   I want you, plan administrator,
[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:55.380]   to every day, anything that's going in,
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:57.380]   check and then convert it to Roth right away.
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:59.300]   So that you're really not even having to do anything
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:00.380]   beyond checking the button
[00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:01.900]   when you're making those contributions.
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:03.900]   But I think every plan kind of does it differently.
[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:04.980]   It's just that keyword.
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:06.860]   When you're filling this out, it's not gonna say,
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:09.100]   do you wanna do a mega backdoor Roth IRA?
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:10.700]   It's gonna go, do you wanna make
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:13.340]   after-tax contributions to this account?
[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:15.260]   And that's kind of the buzzword.
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:17.700]   And then do in-plan Roth conversions.
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:20.980]   - Yeah, and then do in-plan conversions,
[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:23.620]   which at Google, you had to do manually one-off.
[00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:24.700]   You couldn't automate it.
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:25.700]   - Oh, that's annoying.
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:26.660]   Tell me more about that.
[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:29.780]   Did you have to physically roll over the funds every year
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:31.860]   to get them into a Roth IRA?
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:34.140]   - I mean, it's been almost a decade, so.
[00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.060]   - They probably fixed it.
[00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:37.300]   They probably got a better plan now. (laughs)
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:38.660]   - But the only other thing
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:40.780]   that is really very, very important
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:44.940]   is that you can put in $68,000 next year
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:46.620]   into after-tax contributions.
[00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:48.260]   Your 401(k) will let you do that
[00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:50.700]   before you put in your pre-tax.
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:52.780]   So it is important to make sure
[00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:55.860]   that you don't set up, put 100% in both,
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:58.180]   because sometimes your plan will put money
[00:40:58.180 --> 00:40:59.180]   in the wrong thing.
[00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:00.820]   This is especially true,
[00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:02.220]   at Google, one person had this problem.
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:03.860]   First, at the beginning of the year, they said,
[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:05.460]   let's max out my pre-tax.
[00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:08.580]   And then they switched and said pre-tax down to 0%
[00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:09.940]   and after-tax to 100.
[00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:12.420]   And then next year, they left it at that.
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:14.260]   And in their early, the next year,
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.180]   they've maxed out the entire,
[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:18.140]   it was probably wasn't 68,000 back then,
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:19.340]   amount into after-tax,
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:20.780]   and they were no longer eligible
[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:22.620]   to put anything in pre-tax,
[00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:24.260]   which also included the match.
[00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:25.420]   And so I would just say,
[00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:27.660]   make sure you're maxing out your pre-tax,
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:28.900]   maxing out your match
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:31.140]   before you do the after-tax contributions.
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:31.980]   - Love that note.
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:32.940]   I think that's amazing.
[00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:34.660]   In the screenshot that I was just looking at,
[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:38.420]   I think I had put like 17% in pre-tax and then another.
[00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:40.260]   They were both weird percentages,
[00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:42.380]   but I had sat there and calculated like,
[00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:45.060]   what is 23,000 worth of my salary?
[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:46.540]   And then what is the 45?
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:48.940]   Or I think at the time it would have been 42,
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:50.820]   to make sure that the percentages were like,
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:52.980]   taking the correct numbers simultaneously
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:55.020]   versus going, I'm gonna do all of this first
[00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:56.060]   and all of this second.
[00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:56.900]   'Cause you're right,
[00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:58.460]   I think you can get into hot water with that.
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:41:59.780]   That's a really good example.
[00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.460]   You know, and that person's not gonna be sad
[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:03.740]   if they have 60 something thousand dollars
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:05.020]   of Roth money later,
[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:06.500]   but it is kind of a bummer 'cause it's like,
[00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:08.220]   oh, well man, now I'm not really getting
[00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:10.260]   my juicy tax break that I wanted.
[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:11.900]   I also think it's worth noting that like,
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:14.580]   we keep talking about not being able to access the money.
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:17.180]   And I feel just this little like footnote
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:18.860]   trying to climb out of me that's like,
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:21.460]   except for your Roth IRA cost basis,
[00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:23.860]   that your contributions to Roth IRAs,
[00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:26.580]   you technically could access.
[00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:29.660]   - So I think we exhausted the non-self-employed,
[00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:31.860]   non-company owner retirement plans.
[00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:34.580]   Let's talk quickly about the IRAs.
[00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:36.500]   Downside being much lower limits,
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.500]   upside being available to anyone.
[00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:39.340]   Where do we go?
[00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:43.780]   - Okay, so to me, the IRA kind of flashing headline
[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:45.900]   is that if you don't have
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:48.340]   an employer-sponsored retirement plan,
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:51.100]   you are a W-2 employee who only has W-2 income
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:53.620]   and you have no employer-sponsored retirement plan
[00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:56.300]   for whatever reason, and you still want a tax break,
[00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:58.700]   you can contribute to a traditional IRA,
[00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:00.700]   pretty confident regardless of your income
[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:01.900]   and get that deduction.
[00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:03.180]   It's a much smaller deduction,
[00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:04.900]   but if you're really hungry for a deduction,
[00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:05.740]   you can get it.
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:08.580]   Everyone else is probably gonna be better off
[00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:09.620]   with the Roth IRA.
[00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:11.180]   Both because at this point,
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:13.420]   if you do have the employer-sponsored plan,
[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:15.140]   you cannot then also get a deduction
[00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:17.740]   in this traditional IRA unless your income is below,
[00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:20.340]   I wanna say it's in the 70,000 range next year,
[00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:22.300]   but like most people earning 70K
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:24.220]   are not gonna be able to max out all these accounts
[00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:26.060]   and still be able to support themselves
[00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:28.180]   with the remaining income that's left over.
[00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:31.660]   So for most people, it's gonna be Roth IRA.
[00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:33.260]   Again, with that $7,000 limit.
[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:36.020]   And there are income limits with the Roth IRA
[00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:39.380]   where I believe in 2024.
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:40.220]   - Yeah, I pulled it up.
[00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:43.260]   It's somewhere around the 150, 160,000
[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:44.460]   if you're filing single
[00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:47.620]   and 220, 240,000 filing jointly.
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:49.620]   - Great, and there's that phase out in there.
[00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:51.460]   So that's where the ranges come in.
[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:53.540]   - But if you're anywhere close to those,
[00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:55.300]   just backdoor, don't worry about it.
[00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:56.140]   - Exactly.
[00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:59.100]   And so the backdoor Roth IRA is a pretty simple maneuver
[00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:01.160]   just in case this is not something
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:03.100]   that a listener has heard of before
[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:04.220]   or is not super clear on.
[00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:05.100]   It's pretty simple.
[00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:08.740]   You basically just make a contribution to a traditional IRA,
[00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:10.260]   but you make it non-deductible.
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:11.940]   So it's been a while since I've done this.
[00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:14.140]   So I can't exactly remember if you clarify
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:16.540]   when you're making the contribution that it's non-deductible.
[00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:18.580]   I think it's on your taxes, right?
[00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:19.420]   Where it's like, oh, great.
[00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:20.820]   Yeah, you're like filling out your taxes
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:23.660]   and it'll ask you, did you make deductible IRA contributions?
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:25.620]   You don't claim the deduction for that.
[00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:27.920]   You just put the funds in a traditional IRA,
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.620]   allow them to settle, convert them to Roth.
[00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:32.740]   There's gonna be a button that probably says
[00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:35.260]   convert to Roth in most major brokerage firms.
[00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:37.340]   And then once it's in a Roth IRA,
[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:39.460]   which you'll have to have a Roth IRA opened
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:41.780]   in order to be the receptacle of that conversion,
[00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:43.780]   then you'll invest it once it's in the Roth IRA.
[00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:45.460]   And yeah, for whatever reason,
[00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:47.100]   they have not closed this tax loophole.
[00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:48.460]   So it sounds like you just did this.
[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:49.880]   Any updates?
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:52.500]   - There's a form 8606 you have to file
[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:54.900]   in your tax return that's for non-deductible IRAs.
[00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:57.460]   I would say they've gone even further than not closed it.
[00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:59.740]   I believe there was a letter somewhere like five,
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:01.740]   10 years ago that the IRS put out
[00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:05.360]   that more or less endorsed that this is a legitimate thing.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.180]   They didn't go as far as say, which is silly,
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:08.900]   that if they're like, we think it's okay
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:10.740]   that anyone of any limit can do this thing,
[00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:13.500]   but we're not gonna just change the tax code to make it easy.
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:14.720]   - I know, it's so strange.
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:15.560]   Okay, good to know.
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:16.840]   I was gonna say, I think I just saw
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:21.200]   that 8606 is ringing a bell because I use Tax Act to file.
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:22.700]   I just like their software.
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:25.260]   And I was helping a friend file on Tax Act
[00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:26.220]   who had to do this.
[00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:30.180]   And I remember Tax Act prompting her with form 8606
[00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:32.220]   at some point because she had answered some question
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:33.060]   a certain way.
[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:34.620]   So it was like, oh, you need this form.
[00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:37.060]   So it's not like you even have to go hunting this down
[00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:40.380]   if you're using a CPA or a sophisticated tax software
[00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:44.300]   like Tax Act, it's probably going to serve you that form
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:46.340]   if you're answering questions accurately too.
[00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:47.460]   - By the way, we didn't mention this.
[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:50.180]   Your 401k contributions are things you have
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:51.620]   to elect during the year.
[00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:53.740]   They have to come out of your employer income.
[00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:55.040]   You can't do it on your own.
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:56.940]   The IRA, you can do on your own,
[00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:59.220]   not only during the year of the tax year,
[00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:01.260]   but up until your filing deadline.
[00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:03.400]   So I don't know what day this will come out.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:06.260]   It's possible this has come out before November 15th
[00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:08.260]   or whatever the new tax deadline is
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:12.180]   for all but two counties in California for 2022.
[00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:14.140]   So we're recording this in October.
[00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:18.940]   I made my 2022 IRA contributions for non-deductible,
[00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:22.460]   converted it to Roth for 2022 just a few weeks ago
[00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:25.880]   because California extended the filing deadline
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:28.520]   all the way until October and then again to November.
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:29.480]   So if you're listening to this,
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:30.720]   you could do it for this year.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:32.280]   You probably, by the time this comes out,
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:33.800]   won't be able to do it for last year.
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:36.500]   But even if you wait until March or April
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:37.400]   when you're filing your taxes,
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:38.880]   you can still do it for the year prior.
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:41.440]   I believe if you're filing taxes on your own,
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.100]   I seem to remember from a while ago
[00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.320]   that it's like 20% more complicated
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:47.040]   if you do it in the next year
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:49.260]   than it is if you just do it in the calendar year
[00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:51.380]   in terms of what form you have to file.
[00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:52.240]   I don't know if that's true.
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:54.660]   I'm not a CPA, but I would say if you want to do it
[00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:56.160]   and you can do it in the calendar year,
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:57.000]   it's probably better.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.280]   So back to a Roth IRA, amazing.
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:01.120]   Obvious benefits of Roth IRA,
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:02.840]   you don't get that tax deduction up front.
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:04.380]   You don't lower your taxable income,
[00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:06.440]   but that money can grow tax-free forever
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:09.640]   and you can take it out as soon as you're 59 and a half,
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:11.200]   but you can take it out before, right?
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:13.600]   - Well, you can access your cost basis before.
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:15.560]   So that is kind of the big footnote
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:19.040]   on these tax-advantaged accounts is I believe,
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.760]   well, HSA and 529 put a pin in those,
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.300]   but I believe as far as the major players,
[00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:27.000]   the Roth IRA is the only one
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.760]   where you can access your cost basis.
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:32.980]   So that means the contributions that you put in
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:35.280]   at any time for any reason.
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:37.800]   So if I invested 6K this year in a Roth IRA
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:38.720]   and the next year I was like,
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:41.080]   "Oop, I need to get some of that contribution back."
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:42.400]   I could go in and take it out.
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.040]   I can't access the growth, right?
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.160]   Like I can't touch that,
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:48.080]   but I can go in and remove cost basis if I needed it.
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:49.840]   Now that's not recommended obviously,
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.760]   but it is a footnote worth knowing,
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:54.860]   particularly for people who may be starting this journey
[00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:56.280]   and a little bit on the fence
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:58.640]   or like mentally a little bit feeling funky
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:00.560]   about quote unquote locking up their money.
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.840]   Sometimes the Roth IRA is like a good baby step
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:04.540]   'cause it's like, well, it's not really locked up.
[00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:06.100]   Like you could technically get it back,
[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:08.200]   but you're just not gonna be able to touch the growth.
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:10.280]   And obviously you're not gonna be wanting
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:11.800]   to be removing it from the account
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:13.720]   'cause there's no like putting that back in.
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:15.920]   You can't be like, "Oh, I took out 5,000
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:17.580]   "of my $6,000 contribution.
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:18.680]   "I wanna go replace it."
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:19.600]   The ship has sailed.
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:21.720]   You cannot go and replace that contribution.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:24.680]   So it's definitely not advisable, but it is possible.
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:28.560]   And that little weird oddity about the Roth IRA
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:30.460]   that you can access cost basis
[00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:33.640]   is partially what makes more complicated
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:36.840]   withdrawal strategies later in life possible.
[00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:39.480]   So if you've heard of like the Roth IRA conversion ladder,
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.640]   that cost basis little hack
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:44.120]   is what really makes that possible.
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:45.720]   - It's funny 'cause I was Googling around
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:47.480]   trying to find someone explaining
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:50.880]   the Roth withdrawal cost basis contributions, et cetera.
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:52.640]   And it's funny, it's so obvious
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:54.960]   that no one's actually written an article about this,
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:56.120]   at least that I could find.
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:49:00.080]   But it's as simple as if you have contributed $5,000
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:04.000]   for four years and your account is now at $23,000,
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.640]   but you've put in 20, you can take the 20 out.
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:08.360]   You can leave the three in,
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:10.200]   let the three continue to grow
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:12.240]   and take that out tax-free in retirement,
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:13.640]   but you can take the 20 out.
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:16.280]   And to me, I was like, "Well, how do you determine how much?
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:18.140]   "What if the account went down?
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:20.120]   "Which piece of the money do you take out?"
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:21.520]   And it's not that complicated.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.600]   It's just, you do have to keep track of it.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:26.200]   I've found that if you've moved your Roth IRA
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:28.720]   from multiple institutions over time,
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:30.160]   they don't necessarily always,
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:33.880]   at least I couldn't find the historical contributions.
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.840]   So I would say, I don't know,
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:38.480]   create a Google sheet that logs all of your contributions
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:40.580]   so that you don't forget it and kind of go back in time,
[00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:42.520]   especially if you've done a lot of rollovers,
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:44.160]   it can be a little confusing.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.240]   But all of that, I think is a great strategy.
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:47.560]   We did forget to clarify one thing.
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:49.040]   When you do a backdoor Roth,
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:50.400]   when you go to convert
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:53.280]   your non-deductible traditional IRA contributions
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:54.720]   into your Roth IRA,
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:57.160]   there is this pro rata rule in the IRS
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:00.200]   that requires you to convert an equal
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:04.800]   or a proportionate share of your pre-tax traditional IRA
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:07.040]   and after-tax IRA contributions.
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:08.960]   So the general strategy is
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:11.560]   never have pre-tax traditional IRA.
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:13.080]   And the way to avoid that is
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:14.560]   never contribute in the first place,
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:15.960]   which if you don't make enough money
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:18.640]   or you have an employer plan is probably already the case.
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:22.280]   Or even if you have traditional IRA contributions already,
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:26.080]   you can usually roll them into your pre-tax 401k,
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:29.920]   clear out all of your traditional IRA basis, everything,
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:31.720]   and then do the backdoor strategy.
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:32.560]   So I would say,
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:35.400]   if you have traditional IRA contributions today,
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:38.480]   and I believe that includes rollover IRAs.
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:40.040]   - It does, unfortunately.
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:42.240]   And this is why I haven't done a backdoor Roth IRA
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:43.680]   in a while, 'cause I've been lazy
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:45.840]   and I have a big rollover IRA
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:48.400]   that I'm sitting on, but yes, so you're right.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:51.360]   This is an amazing call-out because it trips people up,
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:53.960]   but yes, you basically don't want any money
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:57.160]   in traditional IRAs if you're going to do this.
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:00.280]   So that could be a regular shmegular traditional IRA.
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:02.000]   It could be a SEP IRA,
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.640]   which we haven't even talked about yet.
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:07.040]   It could be a rollover IRA from an old 401k plan,
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:10.920]   but any IRA that has pre-tax dollars in it
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:13.440]   will foul up a backdoor Roth IRA.
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:16.360]   And the workaround is, as you highlighted, very simple.
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:19.880]   It's either roll it into a 401k plan through your job,
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:21.480]   or if you're self-employed too,
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:24.040]   get a solo 401k and roll it into that.
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:25.680]   It's kind of funny and annoying
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:27.560]   that the type of account
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:29.280]   really makes that big of a difference,
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:32.520]   but this is definitely a dependency to be aware of,
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:35.400]   'cause that pro rata rule is, it's a little complicated,
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:38.560]   but yeah, the TLDR is that you don't wanna be doing this
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:40.840]   if you have pre-tax funds,
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:43.360]   or maybe if you have like 50 bucks,
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:45.840]   the Roth conversion ladder and all the tactics there.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:47.680]   That's one thing that I've always known
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:49.120]   is a thing that people talk about,
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:51.720]   and I've never really been able to dial it in in my head.
[00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:53.760]   - Yeah, okay, so this is one of my favorite,
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:56.280]   and I'm gonna try to explain this as simply
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:57.480]   and as clearly as I can,
[00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:59.160]   because it is a little complicated.
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:01.880]   So this is something really blew my mind
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:04.840]   and was like when I fell in love with tax strategies,
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:06.840]   because I was like, holy smokes,
[00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:10.840]   like by literally using the right bucket later in life
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:14.280]   and being a little creative with your account conversions
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:17.080]   and withdrawals and where you're physically taking money
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:19.520]   from, you can avoid taxes altogether.
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:22.080]   I think with the exception maybe of like state income tax,
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:23.320]   but we'll, you know, we can come back to that.
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:24.960]   So, and like state capital gains tax.
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:29.240]   It relies on a few key priors that we'll establish first.
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:31.520]   The first prior that's important to know
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:33.480]   is that for the year 2024,
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:38.480]   you will pay 0% capital gains on capital gains tax rather,
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:41.680]   on long-term capital gains with a taxable income
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:45.260]   of filing single up to $47,025.
[00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:48.040]   And if you're married, $94,050,
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:50.240]   which means if I have no other income,
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:52.080]   my husband has no other earned income,
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:54.300]   we're just, you know, fly in an early retirement,
[00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:57.760]   not making any money that if we had a taxable account
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:01.200]   that we wanted to withdraw $94,000 of gains from,
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:03.560]   the tax bill on that money would be zero,
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:05.360]   despite it coming out of a taxable account.
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:06.600]   So that's prior number one.
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:09.440]   Prior number two is that the standard deduction
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:14.240]   is in 2024, it's gonna be like 14,600 for singles,
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:18.080]   call it 29,200-ish for married filing jointly.
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:19.680]   The standard deduction is basically
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.520]   if you're not itemizing your deductions,
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:24.200]   I believe like 90% of Americans take the standard.
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:25.660]   So this should be most people.
[00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:28.200]   That is money, but the IRS basically says that's a freebie.
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:29.120]   We'll give you that one.
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:32.080]   So you can look at these two pieces of the tax code
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:34.080]   that tell you, okay, I'm gonna get
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:36.800]   between 14 and $29,000, quote unquote,
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:39.120]   as a freebie from the IRS on my earned income.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:42.840]   And I also have this amazing like 47 to $94,000,
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:45.040]   zero, you know, to single or married filing jointly,
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:46.760]   0% capital gains tax bracket.
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:49.480]   So using those priors and then using what we know
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:51.360]   about how Roth IRAs work,
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:53.440]   which is that conversions that you make
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:56.160]   from pre-tax dollars to Roth dollars
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:59.600]   become the cost basis in that Roth IRA.
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:01.560]   We can combine these three things
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:05.240]   and create a tax-free retirement income strategy.
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:07.160]   The caveats that I will mention quickly
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:09.680]   before I kind of break this down and walk through it
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:12.080]   is that if you are a married couple
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:14.720]   that intends to spend more than,
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:19.600]   let's say 9405 plus, fast math, 29 to,
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:22.360]   if you're a married couple that intends to spend
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:27.360]   more than around $123,000 per year in today's dollars,
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:29.960]   so that's like what, over 10,000 a month.
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:32.040]   If your retirement spending goals
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:34.880]   in today's purchasing power is more than 10,000 a month,
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:36.680]   you're gonna end up with a tax bill.
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:39.640]   But if it's under that, you could be totally tax-free.
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:41.720]   The other thing that I would note is
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:43.480]   it does take some fancy footwork.
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:45.160]   You're gonna have to be a little strategic here,
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:47.200]   but in any case, basically what we would do
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:49.440]   if we wanted to do this Roth IRA conversion ladder
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:52.680]   and pay no taxes on it is we would take our 401(k)
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:55.360]   or 401(k)s, if there are two of us, two earners,
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:57.440]   and they're all in, you know, traditional, right?
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:00.680]   If we've followed this broader strategy, this optimization,
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:02.200]   we'll take our traditional 401(k)s,
[00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:04.400]   we'll roll them over when we leave the workforce
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:06.200]   into traditional IRAs.
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:07.920]   They just basically become rollover IRAs
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:08.960]   that we now control.
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:11.520]   Now that they're in that rollover IRA status,
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:13.520]   we can do Roth conversions with them.
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:15.720]   So we're gonna look at our standard deduction,
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:17.680]   we're gonna say, all right, what is the amount
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:20.040]   that the IRS is gonna give us as a freebie this year
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:20.880]   as a married couple?
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:24.440]   Well, it's 14,600 each or 29,200 together,
[00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:27.200]   so maybe we wanna use just one 401(k)
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:29.200]   or maybe we're combining all the funds into,
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:30.040]   I guess that wouldn't work,
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:31.840]   you'd have to have two separate rollover IRAs,
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:33.520]   but in any case, you're gonna convert
[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:35.960]   a standard deduction size chunk to Roth
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:37.800]   in much the same way that we just talked about
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:40.680]   converting your non-deductible chunk to Roth
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:41.920]   for a back-to-a-Roth IRA.
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:44.360]   Same principle, you're converting a chunk to Roth.
[00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:46.920]   Now, once it's been converted to Roth,
[00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:49.360]   it's gonna be sitting there in that Roth IRA.
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:52.600]   The hack or the trick here is that because of,
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:54.560]   I would call it like the five-year rule,
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:57.520]   I don't know the true IRS terminology for this,
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:58.920]   but there is a five-year rule
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:00.600]   that once you take pre-tax funds
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:02.000]   and you convert them to Roth,
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.560]   that whole amount, even if it was all gains in your 401(k),
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:08.000]   even if it represented capital gains or earnings
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.640]   in the 401(k), not contributions,
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:12.760]   it becomes the cost basis of that new Roth IRA,
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:14.820]   which means, what do we know about the cost basis?
[00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:15.780]   You can access it.
[00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:18.320]   You don't have to be 59 1/2, you can touch it at any time.
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:19.720]   A 35-year-old could do this,
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:21.800]   but you have to wait five years.
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:24.280]   So you begin your Roth IRA conversion ladder
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:26.800]   in year one of retirement, early retirement,
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:28.260]   'cause if you're already retired,
[00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:30.840]   if you're 59 1/2 or older, you don't need this
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:33.360]   because you can just access the money straight away.
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:34.600]   You're above the age limit.
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:35.540]   But let's say you're 40.
[00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:36.600]   You start in year one,
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:38.900]   you convert your first standard deduction size chunk.
[00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:39.740]   You let it sit.
[00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:41.520]   You can use a Google Sheet to track this stuff too
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:43.720]   if you're like, I don't wanna lose track of my conversion.
[00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:45.200]   Year two, you do the same thing.
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:46.620]   Year three, you do the same thing.
[00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:47.920]   This is why they call it a ladder
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:50.400]   because you're doing that standard deduction size chunk
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:52.620]   every single year, and you're basically getting
[00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:56.480]   a 0% tax rate on your Roth conversion of that money
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:58.800]   that you have never paid taxes on to begin with,
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:00.120]   and it's probably all gains
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:01.640]   from sitting there and compounding.
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:04.840]   - This assumes that you don't have any other income, right?
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:05.720]   - Yes.
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:07.240]   So we'll talk about where your income
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:08.160]   is coming from at this point,
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:10.000]   'cause obviously you have to live on something, right?
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.200]   So basically then, the moral of the story is by year six,
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:15.960]   the funds from year one are now "touchable."
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:18.580]   By year seven, your funds from year two are now touchable,
[00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:19.660]   so on and so forth.
[00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:20.520]   You can access them.
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:22.760]   They are now Roth dollars that you can use.
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:24.720]   So in those first five years, though, too,
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:26.600]   like you need money to live on, right?
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:30.080]   So that's where your, I'll call it, original Roth IRA
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:32.920]   and/or primarily and preferably
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:34.720]   your taxable brokerage account
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:37.300]   that has that super high capital gains
[00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:38.800]   tax rate of zero comes in.
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:41.640]   So I could theoretically, if I'm doing this this year,
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:44.080]   if I'm in early retirement, I have no other earned income,
[00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:45.400]   I don't have a job anymore,
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:47.280]   I'm not earning money from anything else,
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:50.180]   I could take my husband and I's standard deduction
[00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:53.520]   in 2024 of 29K, do that Roth conversion, let it sit,
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:56.980]   and then we could take 94K from our capital gains,
[00:57:56.980 --> 00:57:58.700]   you know, that 0% tax bracket,
[00:57:58.700 --> 00:58:00.200]   we could take that out of a taxable account
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:01.900]   and live on it tax-free.
[00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:04.420]   And then starting in year six, you can combine them
[00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:06.820]   and get your full 0% cap gains bracket,
[00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:08.900]   your standard deduction-sized Roth chunk
[00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:11.380]   from the pre-tax conversion that you did five years prior,
[00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:13.460]   and then if you have Roth IRA,
[00:58:13.460 --> 00:58:14.660]   money that you wanna use, too.
[00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:16.420]   Obviously, Roth is like the playground
[00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:19.020]   where you can use as little or as much of it as you want,
[00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:20.500]   it doesn't impact your tax rate.
[00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:21.900]   So lots of fancy footwork,
[00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:25.260]   obviously that's not gonna be the right move for everybody,
[00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:27.460]   and there are plenty of people listening to this
[00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:29.940]   that will probably continue to have royalty income
[00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:32.060]   or business income or income from real estate
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:33.180]   or other deals they're doing
[00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:34.460]   even when they're not earning money,
[00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:38.500]   but if you can structure your financial life
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:40.320]   such that you don't have earned income
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:41.400]   when you start doing this,
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:43.860]   you can basically not pay any taxes,
[00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:46.260]   at least federally, on the investment income.
[00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:47.500]   One other important thing
[00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:49.220]   is that if you have that taxable account,
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:51.240]   yes, the capital gains have that treatment,
[00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:53.220]   but the dividends might not.
[00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:55.220]   So if they're qualified dividends,
[00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:56.980]   then again, they're treated kind of similarly
[00:58:56.980 --> 00:58:58.060]   to the way of capital gains,
[00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:00.060]   but if they are non-qualified dividends,
[00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:01.640]   they will count as earned income.
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:03.980]   I just quickly looked at my brokerage account,
[00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:05.540]   my 1099 for last year.
[00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:08.780]   It looks like about 80% of the dividends I have
[00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:10.420]   in my Wealthfront account are qualified,
[00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:13.180]   and the dividend rate is somewhere, I don't know,
[00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:16.460]   let's say on average 2.8, 3%, let's call it 3%.
[00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:20.500]   So 3% times 0.8, 2.4,
[00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:24.140]   so about 0.6% of my account balance
[00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:25.460]   ends up being earned income.
[00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:27.460]   So you will have some earned income
[00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:28.820]   from your brokerage account,
[00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:31.220]   but less than 1% likely.
[00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:32.760]   Obviously, I don't know if you're a dividend
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:34.420]   stock portfolio, it'll be very different.
[00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:37.140]   Right, yes, if you're trying to invest in dividend,
[00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:37.980]   but yeah, I agree.
[00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:41.140]   I think mine was something similar, just anecdotally.
[00:59:41.140 --> 00:59:42.180]   So let me try to recap.
[00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:44.340]   You're in retirement, you have no income,
[00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:46.700]   and you've got a taxable brokerage account,
[00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:47.660]   which is fine.
[00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:49.260]   The only income it's spitting off
[00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:50.980]   are these non-qualified dividends,
[00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:53.720]   which is gonna be probably less than 1% of your balance.
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:56.340]   You take the amount of your standard deduction
[00:59:56.340 --> 00:59:58.300]   and minus whatever income you have,
[00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:00.660]   so maybe minus your non-qualified dividends,
[01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:04.820]   and then you take all of your traditional IRA assets,
[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:06.540]   which are likely things you've rolled
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:09.820]   from your 401(k) over to your rollover IRA,
[01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:13.780]   and then you roll that amount over into a Roth every year,
[01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:16.340]   and then five years later, you can take that money out.
[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:20.480]   And then separately, you can use your stocks
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.380]   in that taxable brokerage account,
[01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:24.900]   you can sell up to the capital gains limit,
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:27.300]   and you can use that money to live on.
[01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:28.120]   That is correct.
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:30.780]   I will make a few little finer points to close this out,
[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:32.820]   is that some people think about that taxable account
[01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:33.800]   like a bridge account.
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:36.260]   So it's possible that if you are intending
[01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:38.940]   to start depleting it and eating into the principal,
[01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:42.060]   you could actually be withdrawing more than 94(k)
[01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:43.940]   and just be taking cost basis out,
[01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:45.900]   and then you're not paying capital gains taxes on it
[01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:47.780]   'cause it's your principal, it's your contribution,
[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:50.300]   so you wouldn't owe any additional tax money on that.
[01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:52.180]   So that's one consideration.
[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:54.460]   The other finer points on the accounts themselves
[01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:56.100]   is that by the time you're doing this,
[01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.660]   you may have a lot of different pre-tax accounts
[01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:00.860]   in your life that you have contributed to.
[01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:02.540]   You might have multiple 401(k)s,
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:04.500]   you might have multiple rollover IRAs,
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:07.380]   or traditional IRAs, or SEP IRAs, or SOLO, whatever.
[01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:10.100]   Sometimes, because of how complex this process is,
[01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:12.500]   if you can simplify things on the front end, it can help.
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:16.340]   So if you wanted to get all of your pre-tax accounts
[01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:18.900]   and all your pre-tax funds that are in your name
[01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:22.700]   into one rollover IRA or one traditional IRA,
[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:24.260]   just to have that one bucket.
[01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:26.620]   Now, granted, you and your spouse, if you have one,
[01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:29.600]   will both have to do this 'cause you can't have a joint IRA,
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:31.460]   but sometimes that can be helpful,
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:33.900]   and then you'd end up having two Roth IRAs,
[01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:35.780]   I guess, per person, 'cause you'd probably have
[01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:37.680]   the Roth IRA that you were contributing to
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.540]   the entire time that you were working,
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:41.620]   and then you're gonna have this new Roth IRA,
[01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:44.120]   a separate account, that is gonna be the receptacle
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:45.220]   for these conversions.
[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:47.300]   And I only say you might wanna keep them separate
[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:49.740]   just for bookkeeping purposes of knowing,
[01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:52.420]   okay, this Roth IRA I've been contributing to,
[01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:54.240]   it's all cost basis and growth.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:58.140]   This one over here is basically all gonna be cost basis
[01:01:58.140 --> 01:01:59.700]   after the five years are up.
[01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:01.820]   And so keeping them separate can just make it
[01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:04.700]   a little bit easier on you to mentally know
[01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:09.180]   where that money is and what is "usable" and what's not.
[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:12.180]   So that's kind of like a extra little level of detail,
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:13.940]   but sometimes for me personally,
[01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:16.660]   it's helpful to imagine how these accounts,
[01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:19.320]   what the interplay is actually gonna look like.
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:21.980]   - Okay, and does the five-year rule apply
[01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:25.580]   to all conversions, including backdoor Roth conversions?
[01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:27.580]   - No, because the backdoor Roth conversions
[01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:30.060]   are post-tax conversions to Roth.
[01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:31.420]   The five-year only applies
[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:33.780]   if it's a pre-tax conversion to Roth.
[01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:34.760]   - We've covered a lot.
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:37.060]   I wanna briefly spend a few minutes
[01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:39.400]   on work small business plans.
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:41.620]   I know not everyone listening is a business owner,
[01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:43.840]   but there are a few things to hit on here.
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:46.780]   So why don't you quickly run through a few,
[01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:47.820]   and then I'll talk a little bit
[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:50.500]   about this cash balance plan thing I've been exploring.
[01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:51.820]   - Amazing, 'cause I'm really interested
[01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:52.660]   to hear more about this.
[01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:53.900]   So this is actually pretty simple.
[01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:55.740]   There are really two major players
[01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:57.620]   if you're, I will say, a solopreneur,
[01:02:57.620 --> 01:03:00.020]   or like a entrepreneur where your only employee
[01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:01.100]   is like your spouse.
[01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:03.180]   Things get more complicated once you have employees,
[01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:05.440]   so definitely consult your CPA if that's the case.
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:08.780]   But if you're just like a side hustler with 1099 income,
[01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:10.280]   you are a solopreneur, right?
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:11.220]   So you can use these.
[01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:13.480]   So if you've got 1099 income, this is for you.
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:16.660]   The two major things to be aware of is your solo 401k,
[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:19.900]   which is basically you need an EIN number to open one,
[01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:21.880]   like the business needs to be incorporated,
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:24.420]   but EIN numbers are pretty easy to apply for online.
[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:26.540]   Same rules in a lot of respect
[01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:27.900]   that an employer account would have
[01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:28.920]   that we've already talked about.
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:32.500]   So 2024, overall contribution limit, 68K.
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:35.900]   You have that $23,000 elective employee deferral
[01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:36.820]   that you could use.
[01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:38.060]   But as I would maybe say,
[01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:40.740]   the only kind of like complicated, nuanced thing
[01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:43.100]   to be aware of is that for whatever reason,
[01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:45.700]   the IRS looks at these different 401ks,
[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:48.240]   your 401k from your job and maybe a solo 401k
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:50.180]   from a side hustler or a business that you're running.
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:53.060]   And they're like, "Cool, as long as different sources
[01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:55.900]   "of income are funding those, you're good, have at it."
[01:03:55.900 --> 01:04:00.700]   Except for that elective employee, $23,000.
[01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:03.860]   That is by person, by social security number,
[01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:06.100]   not by source of income.
[01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:09.460]   So if you are already putting in 23K at your job
[01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:12.980]   into that 401k, you could still put 68,000
[01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:16.220]   into that solo 401k on the side funded by your business,
[01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:18.540]   but your business has to have enough income
[01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:20.100]   in order to justify it.
[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:22.860]   And so for most sole proprietors, solopreneurs,
[01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:25.500]   it's the easy way to find that is that you can put in
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:28.180]   up to 20% of your net business income
[01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:31.380]   into that solo 401k up to 68K,
[01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:34.300]   but it all has to be employer contribution,
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:36.060]   you as the employer, right?
[01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:38.060]   You are your own employer in this case.
[01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:40.820]   Employer contribution based on the net income
[01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:41.660]   of the business.
[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:45.860]   SEP IRA, very similar, no elective deferral option,
[01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:47.740]   only employer contribution option.
[01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:49.340]   Again, if you're a sole proprietor,
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:52.700]   usually works out to around 20% of your net business income
[01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:56.700]   that you can defer up to $68,000 per year in 2024.
[01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:58.860]   And it's for all intents and purposes,
[01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:00.540]   like you can kind of think about it functioning
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:02.020]   on the tax side of things,
[01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:04.980]   pretty similarly to the way that like you would benefit
[01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:07.740]   from the 401k at work or like a deduction
[01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:09.420]   from a traditional IRA.
[01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:11.060]   - I can't remember all the reasons why,
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:14.020]   but when I looked into it, I opened up the solo 401k.
[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:16.060]   I didn't pay myself a high enough salary
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:17.900]   that I could do a lot last year,
[01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:20.660]   but this year I'm really gonna focus on optimizing it.
[01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:24.140]   But one cool thing is the same principles apply
[01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:27.380]   in terms of being able to make after-tax contributions,
[01:05:27.380 --> 01:05:29.180]   being able to do Roth and everything.
[01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:31.380]   So I have, technically I have a solo 401k
[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:32.460]   with three accounts.
[01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:35.060]   It's a pre-tax, a Roth and an after-tax.
[01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:37.660]   You can mega backdoor it, you can do all kinds of stuff.
[01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:38.940]   So that's super interesting.
[01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:42.060]   I set mine up with a company that was formerly called Ocho
[01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:43.460]   and is now called Carey,
[01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:46.380]   but there are other providers out there that let you do this.
[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:50.300]   But I don't think Vanguard has all the mega backdoor,
[01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:51.500]   fanciness.
[01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:54.060]   - I use Vanguard, I think for mine.
[01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:56.460]   I think they call it like an individual 401k.
[01:05:56.460 --> 01:05:57.700]   I don't think so either.
[01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:01.220]   I think it's more kind of standard or like traditional.
[01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:02.540]   - And then the only reason I know
[01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:04.060]   about this cash balance plan is actually
[01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:05.900]   'cause Carey sent an email out saying
[01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:07.580]   they are working on this product
[01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:09.220]   and I went down a rabbit hole.
[01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:10.900]   And so a cash balance plan,
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:13.260]   it's a type of defined benefit plan,
[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:15.060]   meaning there are kind of two kinds.
[01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:17.060]   There's defined contribution and defined benefit.
[01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:20.140]   In a defined benefit plan, it's a form of pension.
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:22.980]   The company says this is the benefit you're going to get.
[01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:25.300]   So the company is actually on the hook
[01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:27.660]   for any of the investment risk down the road.
[01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:31.540]   But the plan effectively is like a simpler pension
[01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:33.140]   for small business owners.
[01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:35.260]   And the goal of the plan is to get
[01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:37.540]   to this maximum balance at retirement,
[01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:40.820]   which right now is around $3.5 million.
[01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:44.940]   And based on your age and some actuarial assumptions,
[01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:46.940]   there is an amount you can try to get to,
[01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:48.300]   an amount you can contribute.
[01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:52.900]   And if you are a business owner making mid to six figures,
[01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:55.580]   it is possible to get a pre-tax deduction
[01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:59.300]   all the way up to 100, 200, maybe even $300,000,
[01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:00.540]   depending on how old you are.
[01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:03.540]   So obviously this is the next step.
[01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:04.780]   It sits on top of it, right?
[01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:06.260]   You can do your solo 401(k),
[01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:07.740]   you can max everything out there,
[01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:10.300]   and then you can do your cash balance plan.
[01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:12.380]   The cost, it does have an administration cost
[01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:14.220]   in the kind of low single digit,
[01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:15.980]   thousands of dollars a year to set up.
[01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:19.300]   It is even more lucrative the closer you are to retirement
[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:22.900]   because the goal is to hit this huge number at retirement.
[01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:25.020]   But if you are making a lot of money
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:27.380]   and you want to put that in a pre-tax vehicle,
[01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:29.140]   you wanna reduce your taxable income,
[01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:30.660]   it is definitely something to look at.
[01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:32.980]   There are a lot of companies that seem complicated
[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:34.580]   that offer it, Cary or Ocho,
[01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:36.260]   which I'm gonna see if I can set up actually
[01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:38.620]   a referral code for people that might offer some discount.
[01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:40.060]   So look at the show notes.
[01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:43.980]   I'll set it up at allthehacks.com/cary, C-A-R-R-Y,
[01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:44.980]   and I will get something set up
[01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:46.300]   before this episode comes out
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:48.180]   because I happen to have met the founder.
[01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:49.860]   I am optimistic he will be willing
[01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:50.940]   to set something up for us.
[01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:52.500]   So that's one.
[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:53.940]   Yeah, Anker is amazing.
[01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:55.820]   Some of the content they produce is incredible.
[01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:57.660]   They do a lot of content for business owners.
[01:07:57.660 --> 01:08:01.060]   The other really cool thing is it's an incredibly low fee
[01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:06.060]   with access to all the basic Vanguard ETFs in it, 401(k),
[01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:10.340]   and you can roll your past 401(k)s into your solo 401(k).
[01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:12.860]   So right now, my wife and I are both in the process
[01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:17.260]   of taking our old Census Fidelity Vanguard 401(k)s
[01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:19.940]   and rolling them all into our solo 401(k)
[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:22.420]   so we can manage them all in one convenient place
[01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:25.020]   that happens to be low fee and easy to take care of.
[01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:27.740]   So when we're done, we will have one account
[01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:31.660]   for all of our retirement vehicles, except Roth IRAs.
[01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:32.780]   One account each.
[01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:33.620]   Beautiful.
[01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:36.820]   I should have known that you would have this on lock.
[01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:38.180]   Well, I went pretty deep 'cause I was like,
[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:40.100]   now that I have a business, I need to figure this out.
[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:41.460]   If you had asked me two years ago,
[01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:43.180]   I would have been like, "Is that by IRA?"
[01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:46.340]   I don't even know if I knew what a solo 401(k) did or was.
[01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:49.020]   But one thing we didn't talk about, which I'll touch on
[01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:50.940]   because it's part of this whole strategy,
[01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:52.380]   now that you have all this money
[01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:54.580]   in your tax-advantaged accounts,
[01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:56.820]   how do you think about your investment strategy?
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:59.140]   So I think it's important to consider,
[01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:01.740]   let's say, hypothetically, you had $100,000
[01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:04.020]   in a taxable account and $100,000
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:05.580]   in a tax-advantaged account,
[01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:07.780]   be it a 401(k), a Roth IRA, whatever it is,
[01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:10.820]   there's this concept of what's called tax-aware allocation,
[01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:13.500]   which is how you think about what to put in each.
[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:16.860]   So for example, if you wanted an investment strategy,
[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:19.500]   and I'm not gonna pretend here, nor think are you,
[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:21.220]   to tell people how they should invest their money,
[01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:24.140]   but if you wanted to have part of your strategy
[01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:27.540]   be allocated toward real estate in the form of REITs,
[01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:29.580]   ETFs that invest in real estate,
[01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:32.220]   the income that gets distributed from a REIT
[01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:34.780]   is taxable as ordinary income.
[01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:38.300]   And so that tax feature, you could maybe call it negative.
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:39.140]   A bug.
[01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:41.700]   A bug is definitely something that makes it
[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:44.780]   almost not worth including in a taxable account.
[01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:47.740]   In fact, at Wealthfront, when we built portfolios
[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:49.820]   and we ran them through and wrote all the white papers,
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:52.180]   we found that adding real estate to a taxable account
[01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:53.020]   wasn't worth it.
[01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:55.460]   Adding real estate to a tax-advantaged account was.
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:58.380]   And so I think it's worth thinking about
[01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:01.100]   how you want to use the funds in different
[01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:04.460]   Roth pre-tax or taxable accounts in tandem.
[01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:06.060]   It's a bit more of a...
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:07.380]   It's like asset location.
[01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:11.340]   It's like, how do I optimize that I'm not basically
[01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:13.940]   holding all of my bonds that are throwing off
[01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:16.540]   a bunch of interest and all my dividend-yielding stocks
[01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:19.140]   in my account that is the least tax-sheltered?
[01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:21.260]   Like if it's all the same to me,
[01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:23.780]   I'm not as well-versed in asset location,
[01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:26.900]   but I think typically people will recommend high growth
[01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:30.620]   and large cap, high growth stocks and ETFs,
[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:34.100]   just like standard S&P 500 or like Russell 1000
[01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:36.940]   in the taxable accounts because those stocks
[01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:40.140]   are very rarely going to be paying high dividends.
[01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:42.020]   And I think usually people will say,
[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:44.820]   hold bonds and hold things that are yielding interest
[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:46.780]   and dividend stocks and things like that
[01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:48.140]   in the tax-advantaged accounts
[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:50.260]   so you're not getting dinged every year.
[01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:52.740]   - A link to a Bogleheads Wiki page
[01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:54.740]   that's called "Tax-Efficient Fund Placement"
[01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:56.140]   that goes into all of this.
[01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:57.940]   It has a little chart about halfway down
[01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:00.180]   where it's like the most inefficient are real estate,
[01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:02.540]   REIT funds, high turnover active funds,
[01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:04.620]   which by the way, I don't recommend anyone invest in,
[01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:05.980]   and high-yield corporate bonds.
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:07.740]   So that's something to think about.
[01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:10.700]   It does make your entire process much more complicated.
[01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:12.220]   So for me at Wealthfront,
[01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:15.540]   if I want my portfolios to kind of all work in tandem,
[01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:17.340]   it kind of breaks if you say,
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:19.540]   well, my investment account is all real estate
[01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:21.740]   and my personal account doesn't include it
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:23.340]   because they're, to my knowledge,
[01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:26.220]   is not a automated solution to rebalance
[01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:27.780]   across all accounts.
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:29.620]   So it might not be worth it to do this,
[01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:31.340]   but it is just something to consider.
[01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:34.060]   The other one is when it comes to Roth IRAs,
[01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:36.340]   people may have seen articles about how people
[01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:39.420]   like Peter Thiel have these massive Roth IRA accounts.
[01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:42.060]   And part of the reason is there is an ability
[01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:45.140]   with Roth IRAs and even some 401Ks.
[01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:47.140]   In fact, Cary actually has this feature
[01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:49.860]   to self-direct your investment accounts.
[01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:54.860]   And so you can elect to use a custodian or create an LLC,
[01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:56.420]   and I'll get to that piece later,
[01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:58.260]   and invest in whatever you want.
[01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:01.060]   You could invest in startups, in venture capital,
[01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:03.740]   in various things and put the assets
[01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:06.780]   that you think have the highest return potential
[01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:10.580]   in your Roth IRA, where you are going to pay no taxes
[01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:11.700]   on all of those gains.
[01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:12.940]   There are a few requirements.
[01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:15.300]   You can't invest in companies that you have control of.
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:16.380]   So you couldn't start a company
[01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:17.900]   and invest in your own company,
[01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:19.420]   invest in a company you're on the board of.
[01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:21.540]   I would say, when you get to this level of detail,
[01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:23.500]   do more homework than we're gonna cover today.
[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:25.580]   But there is a very important caveat,
[01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:27.780]   which is this is a strategy for people
[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:30.100]   who already have retirement covered.
[01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:31.980]   Because the last thing you wanna do is say,
[01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:34.580]   well, all my retirement is in my Roth IRA,
[01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:36.220]   and I'm gonna go put that in something
[01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:37.620]   with the highest return potential.
[01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:39.060]   I'm gonna invest in 10 startups
[01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:40.540]   and have your retirement go to zero.
[01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:42.980]   So if you already have things covered,
[01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:45.380]   and you are investing for the future,
[01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:46.780]   and you're disciplined enough
[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:48.740]   that your non-retirement assets
[01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:50.220]   are going to be where they need to be,
[01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:51.420]   and they're not gonna be touched,
[01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:55.060]   you can elect to have a self-directed IRA or 401(k)
[01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:59.300]   and invest in some of the more high return, high risk assets
[01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:02.580]   to kind of reduce the future tax liability on those assets.
[01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:04.660]   Yes, and if you wanna go one step further,
[01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:07.100]   I was reading about how this feature works.
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:08.940]   It's not just having self-directed,
[01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:11.100]   but having what's called a checkbook IRA.
[01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:13.580]   So your self-directed IRA gives you all these options,
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:15.820]   but you usually have to have a custodian manage it.
[01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:18.060]   So if you wanted to invest in a fund,
[01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:20.060]   you say, hey, custodian, can you write this check?
[01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:21.940]   And a lot of times you're making these investments,
[01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:22.940]   things are moving quickly.
[01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:27.180]   So you can actually create a self-directed IRA LLC,
[01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:29.940]   also kind of a checkbook control IRA,
[01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:32.220]   which is a special type of self-directed IRA
[01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:35.380]   that uses an LLC to give you full checkbook control
[01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:36.220]   on your own.
[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:37.620]   So you control the checkbook,
[01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:39.820]   you're able to make those contributions
[01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:41.380]   or investments on your own.
[01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:43.700]   Buying real estate funds, buying real estate,
[01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:45.700]   even you can buy lots of things on your own.
[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:47.140]   I noticed Kerry has that feature.
[01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:50.340]   There's another company that I think is mysolo401k.net
[01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:51.180]   or something.
[01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:53.940]   It's basically like, looks like a site from 20 years ago,
[01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:55.940]   but is able to do this as well.
[01:13:55.940 --> 01:13:57.180]   But after looking at a lot of things,
[01:13:57.180 --> 01:13:58.500]   I went with Kerry personally.
[01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:00.020]   I have no vested interest.
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:01.420]   In fact, I tried to invest in the company,
[01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:02.420]   but it didn't work out
[01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:03.940]   because they'd already closed the round,
[01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:05.340]   but I was very excited about the company.
[01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:07.460]   And so that's what I use, but they have this feature.
[01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:09.540]   So if I were to make an angel investment,
[01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:11.860]   if I were to make a higher risk investment,
[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:14.180]   I could do all that through my Kerry account.
[01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:15.500]   So that's something to know.
[01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:17.700]   Okay, so that was employer plans.
[01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:18.540]   We covered rollovers,
[01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:22.140]   we covered pretty much all the kind of standard retirement
[01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:23.060]   investment plans.
[01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:24.900]   Let's quickly run through a couple of things
[01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:25.740]   we said we would.
[01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:27.700]   I actually think let's punt on HSAs
[01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:29.780]   because I did a whole episode on open enrollment,
[01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:31.980]   covered HSAs, we don't need to go there.
[01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:33.260]   Although just to be clear,
[01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:35.340]   they are my favorite tax advantage to count.
[01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:39.020]   Pre-tax in, no taxes on gains, no taxes on withdrawals,
[01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:41.620]   max that out, don't spend it, great.
[01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:43.900]   529s, now that we have children,
[01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:45.260]   it's something I've been thinking about.
[01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:47.820]   I will say there are a few quick things.
[01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:49.580]   One, the hesitation I have
[01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:51.180]   is I don't know the future of education.
[01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:54.060]   So for me, I don't know what education looks like.
[01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:57.260]   On one hand, you know, now and 20 years ago,
[01:14:57.260 --> 01:14:58.300]   it looked the same.
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:00.540]   And on the other hand, it'll probably look the same,
[01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:01.380]   but I'm nervous.
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:04.500]   You can use it for room and board, apprenticeships,
[01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:07.820]   professional education, secondary education, lots of things,
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:10.260]   even private school for primary education.
[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:12.020]   You can change the beneficiaries,
[01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:15.500]   but the tax benefit is not quite as good for most states.
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:18.420]   There are some states where you get a state tax deduction,
[01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:20.380]   but in California, for example,
[01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:24.300]   the only benefit is that you don't pay taxes on the gains
[01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:27.300]   as long as they're used for those educational expenses.
[01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:29.460]   - And there's no federal tax break
[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:31.460]   for contributing to a 529.
[01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:34.500]   So if you're interested in federal tax breaks,
[01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:36.380]   the 529 will not give you that.
[01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:38.220]   - I think putting in enough money
[01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:40.700]   to cover what you're pretty confident will be expenses,
[01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:44.620]   great if you are starting to do private school for your kids
[01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:46.740]   and you know you're gonna have that cost for 10 years,
[01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:48.460]   there's probably a way you can optimize it.
[01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:51.500]   But at the end of the day, it's not nearly as lucrative
[01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:54.260]   as other accounts in terms of the tax breaks you get.
[01:15:54.260 --> 01:15:56.020]   But if you're confident you're gonna spend this
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:58.460]   for education, you could put the money in now
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:01.220]   and not have to pay taxes on the gains,
[01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:02.900]   assuming you're using it for those purposes.
[01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:04.900]   And I have to believe, maybe not,
[01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:06.860]   but if something drastically changes
[01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:08.180]   with the educational system,
[01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:11.140]   I think it's possible that they would make some changes
[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:12.580]   to the rules, but who knows.
[01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:13.540]   - That's a good point.
[01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:16.340]   I agree with and co-sign everything you just said.
[01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:18.780]   They're not my favorite for the reasons you just stated,
[01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:21.580]   but if you are pretty confident about your expenses,
[01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:23.340]   I think that they make sense if you're in a state
[01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:26.260]   where you're gonna see some sort of benefit for that.
[01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:28.540]   I hope the educational bubble bursts
[01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:31.460]   before my unborn children are in college.
[01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:34.380]   And that's how I will finish that section.
[01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:37.100]   - And then the last other one I'm gonna cover
[01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:38.420]   is donor advised funds.
[01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:40.180]   I don't know how much you've gone into them.
[01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:43.980]   For me, they are not a way to grow your wealth,
[01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:48.780]   but they are a way to tax advantagely contribute to charity.
[01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:50.220]   We've talked about them in the past.
[01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:52.500]   I'll link to a few episodes where we cover them.
[01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:53.940]   At the highest level,
[01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:56.700]   you are able to make contributions to charity
[01:16:56.700 --> 01:17:00.220]   by contributing to a fund that is itself a charity.
[01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:02.660]   And then you get access to those funds.
[01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:04.100]   You can invest those funds
[01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:06.780]   in whatever investments the provider offers.
[01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:08.140]   You don't pay tax on any of that
[01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:09.540]   'cause you've already given it away,
[01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:11.700]   but you don't have to make all the contributions now.
[01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:14.660]   So really great if you're in a high tax year
[01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:17.540]   because you can make 10 years of contributions
[01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:19.140]   to charity in that year.
[01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:21.220]   And then later in lower tax years
[01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:22.940]   where you're not getting as much value,
[01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:24.900]   you're not making any taxable contributions.
[01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:28.540]   And so that's something that is a tax advantage to count,
[01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:30.220]   but it is a little bit different
[01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:31.940]   in that you're giving the money away, right?
[01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:33.060]   Nothing's coming back,
[01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:35.420]   but it does give you a lot of efficiency
[01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:37.580]   in terms of reducing your taxable income
[01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:40.700]   and growing that money tax-free for the purpose of giving.
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:44.020]   So if you're charitably inclined, it's a great option.
[01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:46.660]   And the absolute best way to fund it
[01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:48.780]   is with appreciated securities
[01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:51.540]   because when you donate those appreciated securities,
[01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:53.380]   you're not paying the capital gains tax.
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:56.140]   So if you had some stock at a company you worked at
[01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:57.940]   or something you've held for many years
[01:17:57.940 --> 01:18:00.500]   where let's say you bought it for $1,000
[01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:02.220]   and now it's worth $2,000,
[01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:03.380]   if you were to sell that,
[01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:05.580]   you'd pay taxes on that $1,000 of gain.
[01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:07.380]   If you donate it, you don't,
[01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:10.220]   but you get the full write-off for the $2,000 amount.
[01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:14.060]   And fun hack, there is no wash sale rule that applies here.
[01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:17.460]   So you could donate $2,000 of Apple stock
[01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:20.780]   and immediately rebuy $2,000 of Apple stock.
[01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:22.340]   You increase your cost basis,
[01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:24.060]   you don't pay capital gains tax,
[01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:27.340]   and you get $2,000 contributed to charity
[01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:29.060]   that you can kind of give over your life.
[01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:30.700]   And the other really efficient thing
[01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:32.180]   is that if you're the kind of person
[01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:34.940]   that might make five, 10, 15 charitable contributions a year,
[01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:37.980]   you are not going to have to keep track of all those receipts
[01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:39.500]   because you make one contribution
[01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:40.620]   to your donor-advised fund,
[01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:43.620]   it's so much easier to keep track of at the end of the year.
[01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:46.060]   So people who've listened for a long time
[01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:48.620]   know that Daffy is a donor-advised fund
[01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:50.020]   that is a partner of the show.
[01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:51.100]   They're a sponsor of the show.
[01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:53.360]   They're where I keep all of our charitable giving.
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:54.200]   It's where we've made
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:56.100]   all of our donor-advised fund contributions.
[01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:57.300]   It's an amazing product.
[01:18:57.300 --> 01:18:58.860]   They are paying me as a sponsor,
[01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:00.620]   but they are not paying me to say this.
[01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:02.620]   They don't know that we're even doing this episode.
[01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:04.920]   And so I had the Daffy account opened up
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:06.580]   before they even became a partner.
[01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:08.120]   I'm a big fan of Daffy.
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:10.900]   And if you are charitably inclined, definitely check it out.
[01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:14.340]   You can even get $25 towards a charity of your choice
[01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:16.000]   at allthehacks.com/daffy.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:16.980]   I think that's a lot.
[01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:21.220]   I mean, we went 90 minutes into tax-advantaged accounts.
[01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:22.100]   - I mean, that was a lot.
[01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:24.400]   That was definitely a crash course.
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:26.740]   And I think that if there were things specific
[01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:28.740]   to what I talked about, that you're like,
[01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:30.580]   "Oh, wait, I wanna go deeper there."
[01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:33.380]   I'm almost positive we would have a podcast episode about it.
[01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:35.260]   And if we don't, Chris almost certainly does.
[01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:37.460]   So I'm glad that we did the crash course, though,
[01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:38.460]   'cause it's a nice little,
[01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:40.980]   let's address all the big points
[01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:43.740]   for someone so that they know where to go next
[01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:46.060]   and what to focus their effort on now.
[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:47.100]   - Thank you for hanging in with me.
[01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:48.460]   Thank you for joining me.
[01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:49.660]   For people that wanna go deeper,
[01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:51.320]   because you've talked about all this stuff,
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:52.160]   where should we send them?
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:55.000]   - If you like podcasts, "The Money With Katie Show,"
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.100]   wherever you listen to your podcasts.
[01:19:57.100 --> 01:20:00.380]   And if you prefer to read, you like blog posts
[01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:02.340]   or you like written content,
[01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:05.380]   moneywithkatie.com will have you covered there.
[01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:07.140]   - And I assume it's a podcast audience,
[01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:08.780]   since you had to have been listening
[01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:10.140]   to the podcast to get here.
[01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:11.580]   Katie, this has been awesome.
[01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:14.960]   Thank you for going over an hour on a nerdy topic.
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:16.760]   There are only a few people in the world
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:19.100]   that I think would enjoy a conversation like this
[01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:19.980]   as much as you.
[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:21.640]   I am so glad we are friends
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:23.740]   and can have conversations like this.
[01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:24.580]   - Likewise.
[01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:25.700]   Well, it was truly my pleasure.
[01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:27.280]   I could feel myself getting excited.
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:29.500]   I'm all energized now after talking about this.
[01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:31.300]   So I'm excited to have you on my show as well,
[01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:34.700]   so we can talk about all the hacks for high earners
[01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:36.260]   and people that are looking
[01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:38.160]   for that next level of optimization.
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:41.460]   - I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:43.220]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:44.700]   If you haven't already left a rating
[01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:48.140]   and a review for the show in Apple Podcasts or Spotify,
[01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:49.820]   I would really appreciate it.
[01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:51.260]   And if you have any feedback on the show,
[01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:53.660]   questions for me, or just want to say hi,
[01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:57.940]   I'm chris@allthehacks.com or @hutchins on Twitter.
[01:20:57.940 --> 01:20:58.980]   That's it for this week.
[01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:00.140]   I'll see you next week.
[01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:03.180]   (upbeat music)
[01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:06.140]   (bubbles popping)
[01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:08.980]   (bubbles popping)
[01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:11.820]   (bubbles popping)
