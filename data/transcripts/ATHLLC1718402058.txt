[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.400]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.240]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.440]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.760]   and I love sharing whatever knowledge I have
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.960]   to help people earn and save more,
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.360]   and leveraging your tax advantaged accounts
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.320]   is one of the ways you can do that.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.880]   And who better to have this conversation with
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.640]   than my good friend and host
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.120]   of the Money With Katie podcast, Katie Gaddy Tassin.
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.120]   She and I will cover everything,
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.760]   including IRAs, 401ks, Roth conversion ladders,
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.120]   which might help you completely avoid taxes
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.520]   when you take money out of your 401k in the future.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.200]   We'll cover backdoor contributions, HSAs,
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.640]   donor advised funds, and a lot more.
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.140]   So let's jump into it right after this.
[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.240]   Did you know that someone new gets impacted
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.960]   by identity theft every two seconds?
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.800]   It makes sense when there's so much
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.400]   of our personal information getting shared online
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.920]   without our consent.
