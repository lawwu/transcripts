[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520]   The only person who can cause you more harm
[00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.040]   than a thief with a dagger is a journalist with a pen.
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.160]   - The following is a conversation with Bill Ackman,
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.160]   a legendary activist investor
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.120]   who has been part of some of the biggest
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.600]   and at times controversial trades in history.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.360]   Also, he is fearlessly vocal on X, FKA Twitter,
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.340]   and uses the platform to fight for ideas he believes in.
[00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.880]   For example, he was a central figure
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.080]   in the resignation of the president of Harvard University,
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.720]   Claudine Gay, the saga of which we discuss in this episode.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.800]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.260]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.600]   in the description.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.280]   And now, dear friends, here's Bill Ackman.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.800]   In your lecture on the basics of finance and investing,
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.320]   you mentioned a book, "Intelligent Investor"
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.120]   by Benjamin Graham as being formative in your life.
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.600]   What key lesson do you take away from that book
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.400]   that informs your own investing?
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.240]   - Sure.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.300]   Actually, it was the first investment book I read,
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.520]   and as such, it was kind of the inspiration
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.360]   for my career and a lot of my life.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.600]   So, important book.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.680]   You know, bear in mind this is sort of
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.560]   after the Great Depression.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.520]   People lost confidence investing in markets.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.000]   World War II, and then he writes this book.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.880]   It's for like the average man.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.160]   And basically, he says that you have to understand
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.560]   the difference between price and value, right?
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.200]   Price is what you pay, value is what you get.
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.940]   And he said the stock market is here to serve you, right?
[00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.000]   And it's a bit like the neighbor that comes by every day
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.960]   and makes you an offer for your house.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.700]   Makes you a stupid offer, you ignore it.
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.040]   Makes you a great offer, you can take it.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.080]   And that's the stock market.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.180]   And the key is to figure out what something's worth,
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.000]   and you have to kind of weigh it.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.600]   He talked about the difference between,
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.480]   he said the stock market in the short term
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.520]   is a voting machine.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.520]   It represents speculative interests,
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.320]   supply and demand of people in the short term.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.280]   But in the long term, the stock market's a weighing machine.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.660]   You're much more accurate.
[00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.360]   It's gonna tell you what something's worth.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.180]   And so, if you can divine what something's worth,
[00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.000]   then you can really take advantage of the market
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.020]   'cause it's really here to help you.
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.600]   And that's kind of the message of the book.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.480]   - In that same way, there's a kind of difference
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.920]   between speculation and investing.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.500]   - Yeah, speculation is just a bit like buying,
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.080]   trading crypto, right?
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.920]   You're--
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.200]   - Strong words.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.900]   - Well, short term trading crypto.
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.700]   Maybe in the long run, there's intrinsic value.
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.700]   But the, you know, it's many investors,
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.920]   you know, in a bubble going into the, you know, the crash,
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.320]   were really just pure speculators.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.400]   They didn't know what things were worth.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.200]   They just knew they were going up, right?
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.160]   That's speculation.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.880]   And investing is, you know, doing your homework,
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.360]   digging down, understanding a business,
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.920]   understanding the competitive dynamics of an industry,
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.320]   understanding what management's gonna do,
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.880]   understanding what price you're gonna pay.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.680]   You know, the value of anything, I would say,
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.600]   other than love, let's say,
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.280]   is the present value of the cash
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.120]   you can take out of it over its life.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.400]   Now, some people think about love that way,
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.680]   but it's not the right way to think about love.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.400]   But it's, yeah, so investing is about
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.280]   basically building a model of what this business
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.280]   is gonna produce over its lifetime.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.960]   - So how do you get to that,
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.200]   this idea of called value investing?
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.320]   How do you get to the value of a thing?
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.940]   Even like philosophically, value of anything, really,
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.800]   but we can just talk about the things
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.360]   that are on the stock market, companies.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.360]   - The value of a security is the present value of the cash
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.480]   you can take out of it over its life.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.640]   So if you think about a bond,
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.320]   your bond pays a 5% coupon interest rate.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.720]   You get that, let's say, every year
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.940]   or twice a year, split in half.
[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.320]   And it's very predictable.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.440]   And if it's a US government bond,
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.280]   you know you're gonna get it.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.120]   So that's a pretty easy thing to value.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.600]   A stock is an interest in a business.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.920]   It's like owning a piece of a company.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.640]   And a business, a profitable one, is like a bond
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.720]   in that it generates these coupons
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.360]   or these earnings or cashflow every year.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.160]   The difference with a stock and a bond
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.640]   is that the bond, it's a contract.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.800]   You know what you're gonna get
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.560]   as long as they don't go bankrupt and default.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.000]   With a stock, you have to make predictions
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.880]   about the business.
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.320]   How many widgets are you gonna sell this year?
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.640]   How many are you gonna sell next year?
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.860]   What are the costs gonna be?
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.440]   How much of the money that they generate
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.000]   do they need to reinvest in the business
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.360]   to keep the business going?
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.440]   And that's more complicated.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.120]   But what we do is we try to find businesses
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.000]   where, with a very high degree of confidence,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.360]   we know what those cash flows are gonna be
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.080]   for a very long time.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.400]   And there are very few businesses
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.320]   that you can have a really high degree of certainty about.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.960]   And as a result, many investments are speculations
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.040]   'cause it's really very difficult to predict the future.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.720]   So what we do for a living, what I do for a living,
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.200]   is find those rare companies that you can kind of predict
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.040]   what they're gonna look like
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.560]   over a very long period of time.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.280]   - So what are the factors that indicate
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.800]   that a company is something,
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.240]   is going to be something that's going to make a lot of money,
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.760]   it's gonna have a lot of value,
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.960]   and it's going to be reliable over a long period of time?
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.960]   And what is your process of figuring out
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.760]   whether a company is or isn't that?
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.960]   - So every consumer has a view on different brands
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.940]   and different companies.
[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.240]   And what we look for are sort of
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.360]   these non-disruptible businesses,
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.320]   a business where you can kind of close your eyes,
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.600]   stock market shuts for a decade,
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.160]   and you know that 10 years from now
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.520]   it's gonna be a more valuable, more profitable company.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.760]   So we own a business called Universal Music Group.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.080]   It's in the business of helping artists
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.040]   become global artists, sort of the recorded music business.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.760]   And it's in the business of owning rights
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.200]   to sort of the music publishing rights of songwriters.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.200]   And I think music is forever, right?
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.720]   Music is a many thousand year old
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.960]   part of the human experience.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.320]   And I think it will be thousands of years from now.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.760]   And so that's a pretty good backdrop to invest in a company.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.120]   And the company basically owns
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.880]   a third of the global recorded music.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.000]   And that's, you know,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.720]   the most dominant sort of market share in the business.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.800]   They're the best at taking an artist who's 18 years old,
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.720]   who's got a great voice
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.720]   and has started to get a presence on YouTube and Instagram
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.720]   and helping that artist become a superstar.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.480]   And that's a unique talent.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.600]   And the result is the best artists in the world
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.160]   wanna come work for them.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.840]   But they also have this incredible library of, you know,
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.080]   the Beatles, the Rolling Stone, U2, et cetera.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.240]   So, and then if you think about what music has become,
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.840]   used to be about records and CDs and, you know,
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.800]   eight track tapes for those of whom,
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.040]   and it was about a new format
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.840]   and that's how they drive sales.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.920]   And it's become a business,
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.960]   which is like the podcast business about streaming.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.080]   And you can, streaming is a lot more predictable
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.920]   than selling records, right?
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.720]   You can sort of say, okay,
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.520]   how many people have smartphones?
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.160]   How many people are gonna have smartphones next year?
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.920]   There's a kind of global penetration
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.800]   over time of smartphones.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.960]   You pay, call it 10, 11 bucks a month for a subscription
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.280]   or last for a family plan.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.200]   And you can kind of build a model
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.720]   of what the world looks like and predict, you know,
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.560]   the growth of the streaming business.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.520]   You predict what kind of market share Universal
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.120]   is gonna have over time.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.060]   And you can't get to a precise view of value.
[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.560]   You can get to an approximation.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.080]   And the key is to buy at a price
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.800]   that represents a big discount to that approximation.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.120]   And that gets back to Ben Graham.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.960]   Ben Graham was about what he called,
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.120]   invented this concept of margin of safety, right?
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.720]   You wanna buy a company at a price
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.160]   that if you're wrong about what you think it's worth,
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.600]   and it turns out to be worth 30% less,
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.440]   you paid a deep enough discount to your estimate
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.920]   that you're still okay.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.960]   It's about investing.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.640]   A big part of investing is not losing money.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.000]   If you can avoid losing money
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.400]   and then have a few great hits,
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.360]   you can do very, very well over time.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.480]   - Well, music is interesting 'cause yes,
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.600]   music's been around for a very long time,
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.480]   but the way to make money from music has been evolving.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.840]   Like you mentioned streaming,
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.880]   there's a big transition initiated by, I guess,
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.480]   Napster then created Spotify of how you make money
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.840]   on music with Apple and with all of this.
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.120]   And the question is how well are companies like UMG
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.840]   able to adjust to such transformations?
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.520]   One, I could ask you about the future,
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.860]   which is artificial intelligence,
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.560]   being able to generate music, for example.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.200]   There've been a lot of amazing advancements with,
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.080]   so do you have to also think about that?
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.920]   Like when you close your eyes,
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.440]   all the things you think about,
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.120]   are you imagining the possible ways
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.000]   that the future is completely different from the present
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.520]   and how well this company will be able
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.640]   to like surf the wave of that?
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.380]   - Sure, and they've had to surf a lot of waves.
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.940]   And actually the music business peaked the last time
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.280]   in like the late '90s or 2000 timeframe.
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.320]   And then really innovation, Napster digitization of music
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.200]   almost killed the industry.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.040]   And Universal really led an effort to save the industry
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.120]   and actually made an early deal with Spotify
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.340]   that enabled the industry to really recover.
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.040]   And so by virtue of their market position
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.120]   and their credibility and their willingness
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.260]   to kind of adopt new technologies,
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:30.240]   they've kept their position.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.240]   Now they of course had this huge advantage
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.760]   because I think the Beatles are forever.
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.120]   I think U2 is forever.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.280]   I think Rolling Stones are forever.
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:41.780]   So they had a nice base of assets that were important
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.480]   and I think will forever be, and forever is a long time.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.720]   But again, there's enormous,
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.400]   there are all kinds of risks in every business.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.240]   This is one that I think
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.960]   has a very high degree of persistence.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.600]   And I can't envision a world
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.960]   where beyond streaming in a sense.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.880]   Now you may have a Neuralink chip in your head
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.760]   that instead of a phone,
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.100]   but the music can come in a digitized kind of format.
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.040]   You're gonna wanna have an infinite library
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.760]   that you can walk around in your pocket or in your brain.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.400]   It's not gonna matter that much at the form factor,
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.240]   the device changes.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.560]   It's not really that important,
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.340]   whether it's Spotify or Apple or Amazon
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:23.860]   that are the so-called DSPs or the providers.
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.420]   I think the value is really gonna reside
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.740]   in the content owners
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.900]   and that's really the artists and the label.
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.540]   - And I actually think AI is not going to be
[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.140]   the primary creator of music.
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.980]   I think we're going to actually face the reality
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.020]   that it's not that music has been around
[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.460]   for thousands of years,
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:51.020]   but musicians and music has been around.
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:54.380]   We actually care to know who's the musician that created it.
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.740]   Just wanna know who's the artist,
[00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.980]   human artist that created a piece of art.
[00:10:58.980 --> 00:10:59.820]   - I totally agree.
[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.180]   And I think if you think about it,
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:05.060]   there's lots of other technologies and computers
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.600]   that have been used to generate music over time,
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.160]   but no one falls in love
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.060]   with a computer generated track, right?
[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:17.140]   And Taylor Swift, incredible music,
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.980]   but it's also about the artist and her story
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:24.980]   and her physical presence and the live experience.
[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.060]   I don't think you're gonna sit there
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.260]   and someone's gonna put a computer up on stage
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.020]   and then it's gonna play
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.300]   and people are gonna get excited around it.
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.460]   So I think AI is really gonna be a tool
[00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.720]   to make artists better artists.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.620]   And I think like a synthesizer, right?
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.120]   Really created the opportunity
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.880]   for one man to have an orchestra.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:53.340]   Maybe a bit of a threat to a percussionist, but maybe not.
[00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:57.260]   Maybe it drove even more demand for the live experience.
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:01.460]   - Unless that computer has human-like sentience,
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.820]   which I believe is a real possibility,
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.440]   but then it's really from a business perspective,
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.680]   no different than a human.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.220]   If it has an identity,
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.300]   that's basically fame and influence,
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.660]   and there'd be a robot Taylor Swift
[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:14.480]   and it doesn't really matter.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.500]   - It's a copywritable asset, I would think, right, yeah.
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.340]   - And then there'll be--
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.980]   - Not sure that's the world I'm excited about.
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.420]   - Well, that's a different discussion.
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:24.980]   The world is not gonna ask your permission
[00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:27.300]   to become what it's becoming.
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.300]   But you can still make money on it.
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:30.860]   Presumably there'd be a capital system
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:34.180]   and there'd be some laws under which I believe
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.900]   AI systems will have rights that are akin to human rights.
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.740]   And we're gonna have to contend with what that means.
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.620]   - Well, there's sort of name and likeness rights
[00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:44.660]   that have to be protected.
[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:48.980]   Now, can a name be attributed to a Tesla robot?
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.580]   I don't know.
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:51.420]   - I think so.
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:52.740]   I think it's quite obvious to me.
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.420]   - Okay, so there's more potential artists
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.580]   for us to represent at university.
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:56.900]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:57.740]   All right.
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:58.560]   - That's sort of one example.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.500]   Another example could be just the restaurant industry, right?
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.940]   If you can look at businesses like a McDonald's, right?
[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:04.780]   It's a, whatever,
[00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.840]   the company's like a 1950 vintage business,
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.460]   and here we are, it's 75 years later.
[00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.380]   And you can kind of predict
[00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:13.860]   what it's gonna look like over time.
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.700]   And the menu's gonna adjust over time to consumer tastes.
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.500]   But I think the hamburger and fries is probably forever.
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.020]   - The Beatles, the Rolling Stones,
[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.060]   the hamburger and fries are forever.
[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.820]   I was eating at Chipotle last night
[00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.940]   as I was preparing these notes.
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.180]   - Thank you.
[00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.020]   Thank you.
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.540]   - And yeah, it is one of my favorite places to eat.
[00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:36.860]   You said it is a place that you eat.
[00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.680]   You obviously also invest in it.
[00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.460]   What do you get at Chipotle?
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.300]   - I tend to get a double chicken.
[00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.300]   - Bowl or burrito?
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.140]   - I like the burrito,
[00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.660]   but I generally try to order the bowl.
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:49.500]   - Yeah.
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.060]   - Cut the carb apart. - For health reasons, all right.
[00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.920]   - And double chicken, guac, lettuce, black beans.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.260]   - And I'm more of a steak guy,
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.240]   just putting that on the record.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:03.300]   What's the actual process you go through?
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:08.220]   Like literally, like the process of figuring out
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.160]   what the value of a company is.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.420]   Like how do you do the research?
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:13.720]   Is it reading documents?
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.300]   Is it talking to people?
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:16.220]   How do you do it?
[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.140]   - It's all of the above.
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.060]   So Chipotle, what attracted us initially
[00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:22.580]   is the stock price dropped by about 50%.
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.340]   Great company, great concept.
[00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:27.140]   Athletes love it.
[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:28.660]   Consumers love it.
[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:32.420]   Healthy, sustainable, fresh food made in front of your eyes.
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:36.740]   And great, Steve Ells, the founder, did an amazing job.
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:40.060]   But ultimately, the company's lacking some of the systems
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.140]   and had a food safety issue.
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.360]   Consumers got sick, almost killed the rent.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:48.900]   But the reality of the fast food quick service industry
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.260]   is almost every fast food company
[00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.760]   has had a food safety issue over time.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.140]   And the vast majority have survived.
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:58.460]   And we said, look, such a great concept.
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:02.180]   But their approach was far from ideal.
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:05.020]   But we start with usually reading the SEC filing.
[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:07.660]   So the companies file a 10-K or an annual report.
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.140]   They file these quarterly reports called 10-Qs.
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:11.620]   They have a proxy statement which describes
[00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:14.100]   kind of the governance, the board structure.
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.660]   Conference call transcripts are publicly available.
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.260]   It's kind of very helpful to go back five years
[00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:20.580]   and kind of learn the story.
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:23.220]   Here's how management describes their business.
[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:24.780]   Here's what they say they're gonna do.
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.020]   And then you can follow along to see what they do.
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.700]   It's like a historical record
[00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:33.700]   of how competent and truthful they are.
[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:35.500]   And it's a very useful device.
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.300]   And then of course, looking at competitors
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:42.120]   and thinking about what could dislodge this company.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:46.540]   And then we'll talk to, if it's an industry
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:47.360]   we don't know well,
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.100]   we know the restaurant industry really well.
[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.360]   Music industry, we'll talk to people in the industry.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.740]   We'll try to understand the difference
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.380]   between publishing and recorded music.
[00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:56.880]   We'll look at the competitors.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.620]   We'll talk to, we'll read books.
[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.500]   I read a book about the music industry
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.500]   or a couple of books about the industry.
[00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:07.860]   So it's a bit like a big research project.
[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.860]   And these so-called expert networks now,
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:13.140]   and you can get pretty much anyone on the phone.
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:16.260]   And they'll talk to you about an aspect of the industry
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.540]   that you don't understand and wanna learn more about.
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.020]   Try to get a sense, public filings of companies
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.620]   generally give you a lot of information,
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.300]   but not everything you wanna know.
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.240]   And you can learn more by talking to experts
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.020]   about some of the industry dynamics, the personalities.
[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.940]   You wanna get a sense of management.
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:35.820]   I like watching podcasts.
[00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.260]   If a CEO were to do a podcast or a YouTube interview,
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.020]   you get a sense of the people.
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:41.500]   - So in the case of Chipotle, for example,
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.260]   by the way, I could talk about Chipotle all day.
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.100]   I just love it.
[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.040]   I love it.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.340]   I wish there was a sponsor.
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.980]   - I'll mention it to the CEO.
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.920]   - Don't make promises you can't keep, Bill.
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.620]   - I'm not making, I can't.
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.220]   Brian Nichols is a fantastic CEO.
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.540]   He's not gonna spend $1
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:58.180]   that he doesn't think is the company's best interest.
[00:16:58.180 --> 00:16:59.900]   - All right, all I want is free Chipotle.
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:00.740]   Come on now.
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.480]   - What was I saying?
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.660]   Oh, and so you look at a company like Chipotle
[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:09.700]   and then you see there's a difficult moment in its history,
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.620]   like you said, that there was a food safety issue.
[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:14.500]   And then you say, okay, well, I see a path
[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.620]   where we can fix this.
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:19.420]   And therefore, even though the price is low,
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:23.180]   we can get it to where the price goes up to its value.
[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:27.080]   - So the kind of business we're looking for
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.420]   is sort of the kind of business
[00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:29.900]   everyone should be looking for, right?
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.740]   A great business, it's got a long-term trajectory
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.580]   of growth out into the force,
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.460]   even beyond the foreseeable distance, right?
[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:38.780]   Those are the kinds of businesses you wanna own.
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.060]   You want businesses that generate a lot of cash.
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.300]   You want businesses you can easily understand.
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.660]   You want businesses with these sort of huge barriers to entry
[00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.620]   where it's difficult for others to compete.
[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:48.620]   You want companies that don't have
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.060]   to constantly raise capital.
[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.860]   And these are some of the great business of the world,
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:54.000]   but people have figured out
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.240]   that those are the great businesses.
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.840]   So the problem is those companies
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.620]   tend to have very high stock prices
[00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.460]   and the value is generally built
[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.660]   into the price you have to pay for the business.
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:06.180]   So we can't earn the kind of returns
[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.520]   we wanna earn for investors
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.000]   by paying a really high price.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.220]   Price matters a lot.
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.500]   You can buy the best business in the world,
[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.300]   and if you overpay,
[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.220]   you're not gonna earn particularly attractive returns.
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.620]   So we get involved in cases where a great business
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:22.300]   has kind of made a big mistake
[00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:25.480]   or you've a company that's kind of lost its way,
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.820]   but it's recoverable.
[00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.780]   And that's, we buy from shareholders who are disappointed,
[00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.460]   who've lost confidence,
[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.260]   selling at a low price relative to what it's worth,
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.620]   if fixed, and then we try to be helpful
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:37.720]   in fixing the company.
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:42.020]   - You said that barriers to entry,
[00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:45.380]   you said a lot of really interesting qualities
[00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:48.800]   of companies very quickly in a sequence of statements
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.300]   that took like less than 10 seconds to say,
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.900]   but some of them were fascinating,
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:53.900]   all of them were fascinating.
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.980]   So you said barriers to entry.
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:59.380]   How do you know if there's a type of moat
[00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:04.380]   protecting the competitors from stepping up to the plate?
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.900]   - I mean, the most difficult analysis to do
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.820]   as an investor is that,
[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.580]   is kind of figuring out how wide is the moat,
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:16.100]   how much at risk is the business to disruption.
[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.740]   And we're in, I would say a period,
[00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:21.260]   the greatest period of disruptability in history, right?
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.580]   Technology, a couple of 19 year olds
[00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.820]   can leave whatever university,
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.300]   or maybe they didn't even go in the first place.
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.260]   They can raise millions of dollars.
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:36.180]   They can get access to infinite bandwidth storage.
[00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.820]   They can contract with engineers
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:42.020]   in low cost markets around the world.
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.860]   They could build a virtual company
[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.180]   and they can disrupt businesses
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.400]   that seem super established over time.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.240]   And then on top of that,
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.040]   you have major companies
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.420]   with multi-trillion dollar market caps
[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:55.020]   working to find profits wherever they can.
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.500]   And so that's a dangerous world in a way to be an investor.
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.080]   And so you wanna, you have to find businesses
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.860]   that it's hard to foresee a world
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:04.900]   in which they get disrupted.
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.420]   And the beauty of the restaurant business,
[00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:07.360]   and we've actually,
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.120]   our best track record is in restaurants.
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.820]   We've never lost money.
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.900]   We've only made a fortune, interestingly,
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.300]   investing restaurants.
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.500]   A big part of it's a really simple business.
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.060]   And if you get Chipotle right,
[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.220]   and you're at a hundred stores,
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.940]   it's not so hard to envision getting to 200 stores
[00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:26.020]   and then getting to 500 stores, right?
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.620]   And the key is maintaining the brand image,
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.920]   growing intelligently, having the right systems.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.820]   You know, and when you go from a hundred stores
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:37.180]   to 3,500 stores, you have to know what you're doing.
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.780]   And there's a lot of complexity, right?
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:42.260]   You know, if you think about your local restaurant,
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:44.300]   you know, the family's working in the business,
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.740]   they're watching the cash register
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.180]   and you can probably open another restaurant,
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.180]   you know, across town.
[00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:52.980]   But there are very few restaurant operators
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.700]   that own more than a few restaurants
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.020]   and operate them successfully.
[00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:59.220]   And the quick service business is about systems
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:02.740]   and building a model that a stranger
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:04.980]   who doesn't know the restaurant industry can come in
[00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:09.600]   and enter the business and build a successful franchise.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.140]   Now, Chipotle is not a franchise company.
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:12.820]   They actually own all their own stores,
[00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.620]   but many of the most successful restaurant companies
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:15.700]   are franchise models,
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.700]   like a Burger King, a McDonald's, Tim Horton's,
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.740]   you know, all these various brands, Popeyes.
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:22.080]   And there, it's about systems.
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.580]   But the same systems apply,
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.340]   whether you own all the stores
[00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:26.820]   and it's run by a big corporation
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.140]   or whether the owners of the restaurants
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:32.220]   are sort of franchisees, you know, local entrepreneurs.
[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:35.120]   - So if the restaurant has scaled to a certain number,
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.580]   that means they've figured out
[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.180]   some kind of system that works.
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:39.020]   - Yeah. - And it's very difficult
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:40.220]   to develop that kind of system.
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:41.540]   So that's a moat.
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:44.020]   - A moat is you get to a certain scale
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:45.620]   and you do it successfully.
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:50.100]   And the brand is now understood by the consumer.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.820]   And what's interesting about Chipotle
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:54.780]   is what they've achieved is difficult, right?
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.660]   They're not buying frozen hamburgers, getting shipped in.
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:59.460]   They're buying fresh, you know,
[00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.580]   sustainably sourced ingredients.
[00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:03.180]   They're preparing food in the store.
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:04.420]   That was a first, right?
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:06.900]   The quality of the product at Chipotle is incredible.
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.260]   It's the highest quality food you can get for,
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:12.580]   you can get a serious dinner for under 20 bucks
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.780]   and eat really healthfully
[00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:17.980]   and very high quality ingredients.
[00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:19.860]   And that's just not available anywhere else.
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.140]   And it's very hard to replicate
[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:23.260]   and to build those relationships with,
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:24.660]   you know, farmers around the country.
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.060]   It's a lot easier to make a deal with one of the big,
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.260]   you know, massive food producers
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.060]   and buy your pork from them
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.380]   than to buy from a whole bunch of farmers around the country.
[00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:36.540]   And so it's, that is a big moat for Chipotle.
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:38.100]   Very difficult to replicate.
[00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:39.380]   - And by the way, another company,
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:41.900]   I think you have a stake is McDonald's?
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:44.220]   - No, we own a company called Restaurant Brands.
[00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:46.860]   Restaurant Brands owns a number of quick service companies,
[00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:48.380]   one of which is Burger King.
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:49.300]   - Burger King. - Yeah.
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:51.860]   - Well, it's been a meme for a while,
[00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:55.380]   but I've, Burger King is great too, Wendy's, whatever.
[00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:57.260]   But usually I go McDonald's.
[00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:58.820]   I'll just eat burger patties.
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:00.380]   I don't know if you knew you could do this,
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.420]   but a burger patty at Burger King can do this.
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.540]   McDonald's, it's actually way cheaper.
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:06.380]   - They'll just sell you the patty.
[00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:07.740]   - The patty, and it's cheap.
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:10.860]   It's like $1.50 or $2 per patty.
[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:14.100]   And it's about 250 calories and it's just meat.
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.220]   And despite like the criticism and memes out there,
[00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.140]   that's- - Pretty healthy stuff.
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.100]   - It's healthy stuff.
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.940]   And so when I go, the healthiest I feel
[00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:24.700]   is when I do carnivore.
[00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.820]   It doesn't sound healthy, but if I eat only meat,
[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:28.060]   I feel really good.
[00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.340]   I lose weight.
[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:30.820]   I have all this energy, it's crazy.
[00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:34.100]   And when I'm traveling, the easiest way to get meat is that-
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.860]   - So you go to McDonald's, you order six patties?
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:36.700]   - Exactly.
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:39.940]   So there's this sad meme of me just sitting alone in a car
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:42.620]   when I'm traveling, just eating beef patties at McDonald's.
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:43.460]   But I love it.
[00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:45.620]   And you gotta do what you love, what makes you happy,
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:46.460]   and that's what makes me happy.
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:48.660]   - Okay, we should maybe have Burger King feature in it.
[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:49.860]   What about Flamed World?
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:50.940]   What's with these fried burgers?
[00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:53.940]   We gotta get you to Burger King grilled burgers.
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:56.100]   - Wait, is this like fast food trash?
[00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:56.940]   I didn't know.
[00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.500]   I don't know the details of how they're made.
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:59.660]   I'm not- - Ah, you should.
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:00.500]   - I don't have allegiance to McDonald's.
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.300]   - I think we got a chance to switch you to Burger King.
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.580]   - Great, we'll see.
[00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:07.780]   I'm making so many deals today, it's wonderful.
[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:08.620]   - Okay.
[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:09.460]   - You were talking about most,
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:13.100]   and this kind of remind me of Alphabet, the parent company.
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.740]   - Sure, it's a big position for us.
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:20.740]   - So it's interesting that you think that maybe Alphabet
[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:24.140]   fits some of these characteristics.
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:29.580]   It's tricky to know with everything that's happening in AI,
[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.900]   and I'm interviewing Sundar Pichai soon.
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.940]   It's interesting that you think that there's a moat.
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.540]   And it's also interesting to analyze it
[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.420]   'cause the consumer is just a fan of technology.
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.500]   Why is Google still around?
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.420]   Like, they've been, it's not just the search engine
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:47.540]   is doing all the basics of the business of search
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.220]   really well, but they're doing all these other stuff.
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.760]   So what's your analysis of Alphabet?
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.260]   Why are you still positive about it?
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:56.740]   - Sure, so it's a business we've admired as a firm
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:01.740]   for whatever, 15 years, but rarely got to a price
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:03.660]   that we felt we could own it.
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:05.260]   Because again, the expectations were so high,
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:06.500]   and price really matters.
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:10.020]   And really the sort of AI scare, I would call it.
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.420]   Microsoft comes out with Chat GPT.
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:13.900]   They do an amazing demonstration.
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.060]   People are like this most incredible product.
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.940]   And Google, which had been working on AI even earlier,
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:21.300]   obviously Microsoft was behind in AI.
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.500]   That was really their Chat GPT deal
[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.700]   that gave them a kind of a market presence.
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:30.660]   And then Google does this fairly disastrous
[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:32.580]   demonstration of BART.
[00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:34.140]   And the world says, oh my God,
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.540]   Google's fallen behind in AI, AI is the future,
[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:38.140]   stock gets crushed.
[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.800]   Google gets to a price around 15 times earnings,
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.100]   which for a business of this quality
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.060]   is an extremely, extremely low price.
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:49.660]   And our view on Google, one way to think about it,
[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:52.140]   when a business becomes a verb,
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:53.300]   that's usually a pretty good sign
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.180]   about the mode around the business.
[00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:58.740]   So you'd open your computer and you open your search,
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.940]   and very high percentage of the world
[00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:03.580]   starts with a Google page in one line,
[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:07.220]   where you type in your search.
[00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:10.980]   The Google advertising search YouTube franchise
[00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:14.480]   is one of the most dominant franchises in the world.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:18.240]   Very difficult to disrupt, extremely profitable.
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.460]   The world is moving from offline advertising
[00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:21.500]   to online advertising.
[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.560]   And that trend I think continues, why?
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.000]   Because you can actually see with your ads work.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.260]   You know, they used to say about advertising,
[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.920]   you know, you spend a fortune
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.240]   and you just don't know which 50% of it works,
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.360]   but you just sort of spend the money
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.200]   'cause you know ultimately
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.440]   that's gonna bring in the customer.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.040]   And now with online advertising,
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:42.840]   you can see with granularity which dollars I'm spending,
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.740]   you know, when people click on the search term
[00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:47.160]   and end up buying something and I pay,
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.660]   you know, it's a very high return on investment
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:50.840]   for the advertiser.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.960]   And they really dominate that business.
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.060]   Now AI of course is a risk.
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:56.760]   If all of a sudden people start searching
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:00.200]   or asking questions of chat GPT
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.120]   and don't start with the Google search bar,
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.360]   that's a risk to the company.
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.800]   And so our view based on work we had done
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.360]   and talked to industry experts
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.320]   is that Google if anything had a,
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.480]   by virtue of the investment they've made,
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.840]   the time, the energy that people put into it,
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:17.120]   we felt their AI capabilities were
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:21.080]   if anything potentially greater than Microsoft chat GPT
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.420]   and that the market had overreacted.
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:28.200]   And because Google, you know, is a big company,
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.920]   global business regulators
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:32.640]   scrutinize it incredibly carefully,
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.600]   they couldn't take some of the same liberties.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.000]   A startup like OpenAI did in releasing a product.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.760]   And I think Google took a more cautious approach
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.480]   in releasing an early version of Bard
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.640]   in terms of its capabilities.
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:46.540]   And that led the world to believe that they were behind.
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:47.880]   And we ultimately concluded if any,
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:51.080]   they're tied or ahead and you're paying nothing
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.560]   for that potential business.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.680]   And they also have huge advantages by virtue.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.120]   You think of all the data Google has,
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:00.880]   like the search data, all the various applications,
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.360]   you know, email and otherwise,
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.440]   and the kind of the Google suite of products.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.680]   It's an incredible data set.
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.920]   So they have more training data
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.320]   than pretty much any company in the world.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.440]   They have incredible engineers,
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.680]   they have enormous financial resources.
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.400]   So that was kind of the bet.
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:17.800]   And we still think it's probably the cheapest
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.840]   of the big seven companies in terms of the price
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.040]   you're paying for the business relative
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:23.600]   to its current earnings.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.520]   It also is a business that has a lot of potential
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.280]   for efficiency.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.920]   You know, sometimes when you have this enormously
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.880]   profitable dominant company,
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:34.720]   you know, all of the technology companies
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:38.560]   in the post March 20 world grew enormously
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:41.440]   in terms of their teams and they probably overhired.
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.960]   And so you've seen some, you know,
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:43.960]   the Facebooks of the world,
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.480]   and now even Google starting to get a little more efficient
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.120]   in terms of their operation.
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:52.080]   So we've had a low multiple for the business.
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.440]   One way to think about the value of the business
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.960]   is the price you pay for the earnings,
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.000]   or alternatively, what's the yield.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.120]   If you flip over the price over the earnings,
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.040]   it gives you kind of the yield of the business.
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:06.560]   So a 15 multiple is about a, almost a 7 1/2% yield.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:09.360]   And that earnings yield is growing over time
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.440]   as the business grows.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:14.320]   That's a, you know, compared to what you can earn
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.360]   lending your money to the government, you know, 4%,
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.000]   that's a very attractive going in yield.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.400]   And then there's all kinds of what we call optionality
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.000]   in all the various businesses and investments
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.560]   they've made that are losing money.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.120]   They've got a cloud business that's growing very rapidly,
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.600]   but they're investing basically 100% of the profits
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.080]   from that business in growth.
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.520]   You're in that earnings number,
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.440]   you're not seeing any earnings from the cloud business.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.840]   And, you know, they're one of the top cloud players.
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:41.440]   So very interesting, generally well-managed company
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.640]   with incredible assets and resources and dominance,
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:48.720]   you know, and it has no debt and it's got a ton of cash.
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.200]   And so pretty good story.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:54.680]   - Is there something fundamentally different about AI
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.120]   that makes all of this more complicated,
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:01.040]   which is the sort of the exponential possibilities
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:06.040]   of the kinds of products and impact that AI could create
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:11.120]   when you're looking at Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, Google,
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:15.760]   all these companies, XAI, or maybe startups?
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.840]   Like, is there some more risk introduced
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.800]   by the possibilities of AI?
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.680]   - Absolutely, that's a great question.
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:26.000]   You know, business investing is about finding companies
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.680]   that can't be disrupted.
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:32.080]   AI is the ultimate disruptible asset or technology.
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:35.440]   And that's what makes investing treacherous,
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.400]   is that you own a business that's enormously profitable,
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.680]   management gets, if you will, fat and happy,
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.160]   and then a new technology emerges
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.840]   that just takes away all their profitability.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.680]   And AI is this incredibly powerful tool,
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.000]   which is why every business is saying,
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.560]   how can I use AI in my business to make us more profitable,
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.880]   more successful, grow faster,
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:58.880]   and also disrupt or protect ourself from the incomings?
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.840]   You know, it's a bit like, you know,
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:04.760]   Buffett talks about a great business like a castle
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.680]   surrounded by this really wide moat,
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.960]   but you have all these barbarians trying to get in
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:12.560]   and steal the princess.
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.640]   And it happens, you know, Kodak, for example,
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.720]   was an amazing, incredibly dominant company
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.440]   until it disappeared.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:23.680]   Polaroid, you know, this incredible technology.
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:26.440]   And that's why we have tended to stay away from companies
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.640]   that are technology companies,
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.320]   because technology companies, generally,
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.760]   the world is such a dynamic place
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:33.440]   that someone's always working on a better version.
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:38.440]   And, you know, Kodak was caught up in the analog film world,
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.080]   and then the world changed.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.480]   - Well, Google was pretty fat and happy
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.120]   until "Tragic Petit" came out.
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:44.960]   - Yes. - How would you rate
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:48.720]   their ability to wake up, lose weight,
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:52.640]   and be less happy and aggressively rediscover
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.680]   their search for happiness?
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:58.520]   - I think you've seen a lot of that in the last year.
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:03.520]   And I would say some combination of embarrassment and pride
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:07.840]   are huge motivators for everyone from Sergey Brin,
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.320]   you know, to the management of the company.
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.800]   - And Demis Hassab is thrown into the picture,
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:15.920]   and all of DeepMind teams, and the unification of teams,
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.040]   and like all the shakeups.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.040]   It was interesting to watch the chaos.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:19.880]   I love it.
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:22.040]   I love it when everybody freaks out.
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.560]   Like you said, partly embarrassment,
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:26.440]   and partly that competitive drive
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.680]   that drives engineers is great.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.560]   I can't wait to see what,
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.440]   there's been just a lot of improvement in the product.
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.060]   Let's see where it goes.
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.360]   You mentioned management.
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:39.200]   How do you analyze the governance structure
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.180]   and the individual humans
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:42.720]   that are the managers of a company?
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.120]   - So, as I like to say,
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:47.680]   incentives drive all human behavior.
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:50.420]   And that certainly applies in the business world.
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:53.240]   So understanding the people and what drives them,
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.240]   and what the actual financial
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.760]   and other incentives of a business are,
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.720]   very important part of the analysis
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.080]   for investing in a company.
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.880]   And you can learn a lot.
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.020]   You know, I mentioned before,
[00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:05.360]   one great way to learn about a business
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.160]   is go back a decade and read everything
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.100]   that management has written about the business,
[00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:11.600]   and see what they've done over time.
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:12.440]   See what they've said.
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:17.280]   You know, conference calls are actually relatively recent.
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:18.200]   When I started in the business,
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.840]   there weren't conference call transcripts.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.640]   Now you have a written record
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.000]   of everything management has said
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.920]   in response to questions from analysts
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.600]   at conferences and otherwise.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.160]   And so just, you learn a lot about people
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.800]   by listening to what they say,
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.580]   how they answer questions,
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:33.720]   and ultimately their track record
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.360]   for doing what they say they're gonna do.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.480]   Do they under-promise and over-deliver?
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.880]   Do they over-promise and under-deliver?
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.280]   Do they say what they're gonna do?
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.700]   Do they admit mistakes?
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:46.480]   Do they build great teams?
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.440]   Do people wanna come work for them?
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.440]   Or are they able to retain their talent?
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:53.320]   You know, and then part of it is,
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.980]   do they, how much are they running the business
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:56.920]   for the benefit of the business?
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:57.760]   How much are they running the business
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.220]   for the benefit of themselves?
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:03.520]   And, you know, that's kind of the analysis you do.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:05.840]   - Are we talking about CEO, COO?
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:07.600]   What does management mean?
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.320]   Oh God, how deep does it go?
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:13.000]   - Sure, so, this very senior management matters enormously.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.860]   You know, we use the Chipotle example.
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:16.640]   Steve Ells, great entrepreneur.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:19.480]   Business got to a scale he really couldn't run it.
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:20.680]   We recruited a guy named Brian,
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:24.040]   helped the company recruit a guy named Brian Nickel.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.160]   And he was considered the best person
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:27.760]   in the quick service industry.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.120]   He came in and completely rebuilt the company.
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:31.920]   Actually, we moved the company.
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.240]   Chipotle was moved to California.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:37.080]   And sometimes one way to redo the culture of a company
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.040]   is just to move it geographically.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.520]   And then you can kind of reboot the business.
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.240]   But a great leader has great followership.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:44.720]   You know, over the course of their career,
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:45.800]   they'll have a team they've built
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:48.460]   that will come follow them into the next opportunity.
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:52.360]   But the key is, you know, really the top person
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:55.460]   matters enormously because, and then it's who they recruit.
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.400]   You know, you recruit an A plus leader
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.600]   and they're gonna recruit other A type people.
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.560]   If you're a B leader, you're not gonna recruit
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.580]   any great talent beneath them.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.520]   - You mentioned Warren Buffett.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.600]   You said you admire him as an investor.
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.200]   What do you find most interesting
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.800]   and powerful about his approach?
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.760]   What aspects of his approach to investing
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.800]   do you also practice?
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.240]   - Sure, so most of what I've learned
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:22.880]   in the investment business, I've learned from Warren Buffett.
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:26.240]   He's been my great professor of this business.
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.480]   My first book I read in the business
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.400]   was "The Ben Graham Intelligent Investor."
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.120]   But fairly quickly, you get to learn about Warren Buffett.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.080]   And I started by reading the Berkshire Hathaway annual
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:38.000]   reports, and then I eventually got
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.920]   the Buffett partnership letters that you can see,
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:44.520]   which are an amazing read to go back to the mid 1950s
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.720]   and read what he wrote to his limited partners
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:49.040]   when he first started out and just follow that trajectory
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:49.980]   over a long period of time.
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:53.680]   So what's remarkable about him is one, duration, right?
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.140]   He's still at it at 93.
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:36:00.320]   You know, two, you know, it takes a very long-term view.
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:03.040]   But a big thing that you learn from him,
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:07.160]   investing requires this incredible dispassionate,
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:08.480]   unemotional quality.
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:11.680]   You have to be extremely economically rational,
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:15.280]   which is not a basic,
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:16.680]   it's not something you learn in the jungle.
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.800]   You know, I don't think it's something that, you know,
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:23.800]   if you think about the, you know, surviving the jungle,
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:26.720]   you know, the lion shows up, you know,
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.280]   and everyone starts running, you run with them.
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.600]   That does not work well in markets.
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.520]   In fact, you generally have to do the opposite, right?
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:35.560]   When the lemmings are running over the cliff,
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.240]   that's the time where you're facing the other direction
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.360]   and you're running the other direction,
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.800]   i.e. you're stepping in, you're buying stocks
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:41.900]   at really low prices.
[00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:44.720]   You know, Buffett's been great at that
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.960]   and great at teaching about what he calls temperament,
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.720]   which is this sort of emotional kind of,
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:53.000]   or unemotional quality that you need
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.100]   to be able to dispassionately look at the world and say,
[00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:57.680]   okay, is this a real risk?
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.000]   Are people overreacting?
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:02.160]   People tend to get excited about investments
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.560]   when stocks are going up
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:05.440]   and they get depressed when they're going down.
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.640]   And I think that's just inherently human.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:08.640]   You have to reverse that.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.400]   You have to get excited when things get cheaper
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:15.280]   and you gotta get concerned when things get more expensive.
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:17.760]   - You've been a part of some big battles,
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.480]   some big losses, some big wins.
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.600]   So it's been a rollercoaster.
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:25.420]   So in terms of temperament, psychologically,
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:28.500]   how do you not let that break you?
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:32.880]   How do you maintain a calm demeanor
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.680]   and avoid running with the lemmings?
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:38.640]   - I think it's something you kind of learn over time.
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:42.020]   A key success factor is you wanna have enough money
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:43.920]   in the bank that you're gonna survive,
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:47.160]   you know, regardless of what's going on
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:48.880]   with volatility in markets.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:52.440]   You know, people who, one, you shouldn't borrow money.
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.640]   So if you borrow money, you own stocks on margin,
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.140]   markets are going down,
[00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:59.940]   and you have your livelihood at risk,
[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:01.600]   it's very difficult to be rational.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.760]   So key is getting yourself to a place
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:06.280]   where you're financially secure.
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.240]   You're not gonna lose your house, right?
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:11.000]   That's kind of a key thing.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.860]   And then also doing your homework.
[00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:17.620]   You know, stocks can trade at any price in the short term.
[00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:20.460]   And if you know what a business is worth
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.500]   and you understand the management,
[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.400]   you know it extremely well,
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.360]   it's not nearly as,
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.660]   it doesn't bother you when a stock price goes down,
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:30.220]   or it has much less impact on you
[00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:33.620]   because you know, you know, again, as Mr. Graham said,
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:35.460]   you know, the short term, the market's a voting machine.
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:37.540]   You have a bunch of lemmings voting one direction.
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:38.380]   That's concerning.
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:41.380]   But if it's a great business, doesn't have a lot of debt,
[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:43.720]   and people are gonna just listen to more music next year
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.940]   than this year, you know you're gonna do well.
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:50.480]   So it's a bit, some combination of being personally secure
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:53.320]   and also just knowing what you own.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:58.320]   And over time you build calluses, I would say.
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:01.860]   - So psychologically, just as a human being,
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.660]   speaking of lions and gazelles and all this kind of stuff,
[00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:06.220]   is there some,
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:09.460]   is it as simple as just being financially secure?
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:12.740]   Is there some just human qualities
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:16.980]   that you have to be born with/develop?
[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:17.820]   - I think so.
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:21.740]   I think, now I'm a pretty emotional person, I would say,
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:25.820]   or I feel pretty strong emotions, but not in investing.
[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:29.740]   I'm remarkably immune to kind of volatility.
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:31.740]   And that's a big advantage.
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:33.940]   And it took some time for me to develop that.
[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:35.340]   - So you weren't born with that, you think?
[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:36.180]   - No.
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:40.300]   - So being emotional, do you want to respond to volatility?
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:43.220]   - Yeah, and you just, it's a bit, again,
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:45.660]   you can learn a lot from other people's experience.
[00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:47.860]   It's one of the few businesses
[00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:49.780]   where you can learn an enormous amount
[00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:53.140]   by reading about other periods in history,
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:58.820]   following Buffett's career, the mistakes he made.
[00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:00.580]   If you're investing a lot of capital,
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:02.960]   every one of your mistakes is gonna be big, right?
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:05.260]   So we've made big mistakes.
[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:07.060]   The good news is that the vast majority
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:08.900]   of things we've done have worked out really well.
[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:12.460]   And so that also gives you confidence over time.
[00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:15.460]   But because we make very few investments,
[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:16.660]   and we own eight things today,
[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:19.620]   or seven companies of that matter,
[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:23.380]   if we get one wrong, it's gonna be big news.
[00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:25.300]   And so the other nature of our business
[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:26.780]   you have to be comfortable with
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:30.540]   is a lot of public scrutiny, a lot of public criticism.
[00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:35.300]   And that requires some experience, I'll call it that.
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.780]   - I think we'll talk about some of that.
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:40.700]   Financially secure is something I believe also recommend
[00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:43.380]   for even just everyday investors.
[00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:45.380]   Is there some general advice
[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:48.300]   from the things you've been talking about
[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:50.220]   that applies to everyday investors?
[00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:51.380]   - Sure.
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:55.100]   So never invest money you can't afford to lose,
[00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:58.420]   where it would, if you'd lost this money,
[00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:00.280]   you'd lose your house, et cetera.
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:05.280]   So having, being in a place where you're investing money
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.900]   that you don't care about the price in the short term.
[00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:10.380]   It's money for your retirement,
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:12.420]   and you take a really long-term view.
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:13.380]   I think that's key.
[00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:16.980]   Never investing where you borrow money
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:18.180]   against your securities.
[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:20.940]   The markets offer you the opportunity
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:23.380]   to leverage your investment.
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:26.680]   And in most worlds, you'll be okay.
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:30.340]   Except if there's a financial crisis
[00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:33.480]   or a nuclear device gets detonated, God forbid,
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:37.160]   somewhere in the world, or there's an unexpected war,
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:40.020]   or someone kills a leader unexpectedly.
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.900]   Things happen that can change the course of history,
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:46.260]   and markets react very negatively to those kinds of events.
[00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:47.900]   And you can own the greatest business in the world,
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:51.000]   trading for $100 a share, and next moment, it could be 50.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.180]   So as long as you don't borrow against securities,
[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:56.160]   you own really high-quality businesses,
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.780]   and it's not money that you need in the short term,
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:02.660]   then you can actually be thoughtful about it.
[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.820]   And that is a huge advantage.
[00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:07.580]   The vast majority of investors, it seems,
[00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:10.780]   tend to be the ones that panic in the downturns,
[00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:14.060]   get over-elated when markets are doing well.
[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:16.820]   - So be able to think long-term
[00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:18.980]   and be sufficiently financially secure
[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:22.140]   such that you can afford to think long-term.
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:25.420]   - Yeah, Buffett is the ultimate long-term thinker.
[00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:27.540]   And just the decisions he makes,
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:32.300]   the consistency of the decisions he's made over time,
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:34.940]   and fitting into that sort of long-term framework
[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:39.540]   is a very educational, let's put it that way,
[00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:42.500]   for learning about this business.
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.560]   - So you mentioned eight companies,
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:47.740]   but what do you think about mutual funds
[00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:50.020]   for everyday investors that diversify
[00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:53.820]   across a larger number of companies?
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:56.140]   - I think there are very few mutual funds.
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:58.900]   There are thousands and thousands of mutual funds.
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:01.540]   There are very few that earn their keep
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:03.280]   in terms of the fees they charge.
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.460]   They tend to be too diversified
[00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:11.580]   and too short-term,
[00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:14.700]   and you're often much better off just buying an index fund.
[00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:16.280]   And many of them perform,
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.140]   if you look carefully at their portfolios,
[00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:23.100]   they're not so different from the underlying index itself,
[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:25.100]   and you tend to pay a much higher fee.
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:26.020]   Now, all of that being said,
[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:29.540]   there's some very talented mutual fund managers.
[00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:31.300]   A guy named Will Danoff at Fidelity
[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:33.020]   has had a great record over a long period of time.
[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:34.220]   The famous Peter Lynch.
[00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:39.480]   Ron Barron, another great long-term growth stock investor.
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:42.140]   So there's some great mutual funds,
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:46.380]   but I put them in the handful versus the thousands.
[00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:49.740]   And if you're in the thousands,
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:54.360]   I'd rather someone bought just an index fund, basically.
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:55.420]   - Yeah, index funds.
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:59.760]   But what would be the leap for an everyday investor
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:02.740]   to go to investing in a small number of companies,
[00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:05.860]   like two, three, four, or five companies?
[00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:08.180]   - I even recommend for individual investors
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:11.060]   to invest in a dozen companies.
[00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:13.580]   You don't get that much more benefit of diversification
[00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:18.060]   going from a dozen to 25, or even 50.
[00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:21.060]   Most of the benefits of diversification come in the first,
[00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:22.320]   call it 10 or 12.
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:24.700]   And if you're investing in businesses
[00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:26.300]   that don't have a lot of debt,
[00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:28.500]   they're businesses that you can understand yourself.
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:31.480]   You understand, actually individual investors
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.660]   did a much better job analyzing Tesla
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:36.400]   than the so-called professional investors or analysts,
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:37.360]   the vast majority of them.
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:38.780]   So if it's a business you understand,
[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:39.620]   if you bought a Tesla,
[00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:43.500]   you understand the product and its appeal to consumers,
[00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:47.100]   it's a good place to start when you're analyzing a company.
[00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:49.460]   So I would invest in things you can understand.
[00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:50.540]   That's kind of a key.
[00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:54.860]   You like Chipotle, you understand why they're successful,
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:57.380]   you can go there every week and you can monitor,
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:00.160]   is anything changing?
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:03.520]   How are these new kind of, how's chicken al pastor?
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:07.600]   Is that a good upgrade from the basic chicken?
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:12.360]   The drink offering's improving, the store is clean.
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.680]   I think you should invest in companies
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:16.160]   you really understand, simple businesses
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:17.920]   where you can predict with a high degree of confidence
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:19.040]   what it's gonna look like over time.
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:20.320]   And if you do that
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:22.000]   in a not particularly concentrated fashion
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.040]   and you don't borrow money against your securities,
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:25.320]   you'll probably do much better
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:26.840]   than your typical mutual fund.
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:27.680]   - Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:29.460]   Consumers that love a thing
[00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.540]   are actually good analysts of that thing,
[00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:33.020]   or I guess a good starting point.
[00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:33.860]   - And by the way,
[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:34.980]   there's much more information available today.
[00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:37.340]   When I was first investing,
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:39.500]   literally we had people faxing us documents
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:42.060]   from the SEC filings in Washington, DC.
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:43.900]   Now everything's available online,
[00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:45.780]   conference call transcripts are free.
[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:52.900]   You have AI, you have unlimited data
[00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:58.080]   and all kinds of message boards and Reddit forums
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:00.720]   and things where people are sharing advice.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.220]   And everyone has their own,
[00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:05.240]   by virtue of their career or experience,
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:09.040]   they'll know about an industry or a business.
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:09.880]   And that gives them,
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:12.360]   I would take advantage of your own competitive advantages.
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:14.440]   - I'm just afraid if I invest in Chipotle,
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:17.480]   I'll be analyzing every little change of menu
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:20.720]   from a financial perspective and just be very critical.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:22.600]   - If it's gonna affect your experience,
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.520]   I wouldn't buy the stock.
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:25.360]   - Yeah, I mean,
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:27.400]   I should also say that I am somebody
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:29.800]   that emotionally does respond to volatility,
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:32.840]   which is why I've never bought index funds.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:36.240]   And I just noticed myself psychologically being affected
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.740]   by the ups and downs of the market.
[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:40.660]   I want to tune out because if I'm at all tuned in,
[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:43.320]   it has a negative impact on my life.
[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:45.560]   - Yeah, that's really important.
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:48.800]   - Can you explain what activist investing is?
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:51.360]   You've been talking about investing
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:53.840]   and then looking at companies when they're struggling,
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:57.760]   stepping in and reconfiguring things within that company
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:00.280]   and helping it become great.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:03.480]   So that's part of it, but let's just zoom out.
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:05.720]   What's this idea of activist investing?
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:07.760]   - I think recently in the last couple of days,
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:10.040]   I read an article saying that more than 50%
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:12.080]   of the capital in the world today
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:15.960]   invests in the stock markets, passive, indexed money.
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:18.200]   And that's the most passive form, right?
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:20.240]   So if you think about an index fund,
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:24.160]   a machine buys a fixed set of securities
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:25.320]   in certain proportion.
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:28.800]   There's no human judgment at all.
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:32.380]   And there's no real person behind it in a way.
[00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:35.920]   They never take steps to improve a business.
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.520]   They just quietly own securities.
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:43.020]   What we do is we invest our capital in a handful of things.
[00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:44.240]   We get to know them really, really well,
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:46.320]   'cause you're gonna put 20% of your assets in something,
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:48.560]   you need to know it really well.
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:51.560]   But once you become a big holder,
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:53.720]   and if you've got some thoughts
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:56.600]   on how to make a business more valuable,
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:58.400]   you can do more than just be a passive investor.
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:02.520]   So our strategy is built upon finding great companies
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:04.600]   in some cases that have lost their way,
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:07.320]   and then helping them succeed.
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:10.160]   And we can do that with ideas from outside the boardroom.
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:14.360]   Sometimes we take a seat on a board or more than one,
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:18.280]   and we work with the best management teams in the world
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:20.520]   to help these businesses succeed.
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:22.360]   So when I first went into this business,
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:25.900]   no one knew who we were, and we didn't have that much money.
[00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:29.940]   And so to influence what was to us a big company,
[00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:33.560]   we had to make a fair bit more noise, right?
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:36.780]   So we would buy a stake, we'd announce it publicly,
[00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:38.320]   we'd attempt to engage with management.
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:39.680]   The first activist investment we made
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:41.780]   at Pershing Square was Wendy's.
[00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:44.900]   I couldn't get the CEO to ever return my call.
[00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:46.460]   Didn't return my call.
[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:49.700]   So we actually, in that case,
[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:51.820]   our idea was Wendy's owned a company called Tim Hortons,
[00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:54.040]   which was this coffee donut chain.
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:57.760]   And you could buy Wendy's for basically $5 billion.
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.760]   And they owned 100% of Tim Hortons,
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:03.160]   which itself was worth more than 5 billion.
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:05.760]   So you could literally buy Wendy's, separate Tim Hortons,
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:07.720]   and get Wendy's for negative value.
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:09.440]   That seemed like a pretty good opportunity,
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:11.960]   even though the business wasn't doing that well.
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:14.920]   So we bought the stake, called the CEO,
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:16.360]   couldn't get a meeting, nothing.
[00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:18.120]   So we hired, actually, Blackstone,
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:21.420]   which was, at that time, had an investment bank.
[00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:24.180]   And we hired them to do what's called a fairness opinion
[00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:26.540]   of what Wendy's would be worth if they followed our advice.
[00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:29.520]   And they agreed to do it, paid them a fee for it.
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:30.880]   And then we mailed in a letter
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:32.080]   with a copy of the fairness opinion,
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:34.000]   saying Wendy's would basically be worth 80% more
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.280]   if they did what we said.
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.200]   And six weeks later, they did what we said.
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:41.080]   So that's activism, at least an early form of activism.
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:42.800]   With that kind of under our belt,
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:44.120]   we had a little more credibility.
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:46.840]   And now we started to take stakes in companies.
[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:48.920]   The media would pay attention.
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:51.800]   So the media became kind of an important partner.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:54.760]   And some combination of shame, embarrassment,
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:57.400]   and opportunity motivated management teams
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:58.440]   to do the right thing.
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:02.880]   And then, beyond that, there's certain steps you can take
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.320]   if management's recalcitrant,
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:05.680]   and the shareholders are on your side.
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:08.000]   But it's a bit like running for office.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.400]   You've gotta get all the constituents
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:11.800]   to support you and your ideas.
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:13.480]   And if they support you and your ideas,
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:16.960]   you can overthrow, if you will, the board of a company.
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:18.600]   You bring in new talent
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:21.480]   and then take over the management of a business.
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:23.680]   And that's the most extreme form of activism.
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:25.960]   So that's kind of the early days and what we did.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:28.620]   And a lot of the early things that we did were,
[00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:32.120]   call it, what we call sort of like
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:33.600]   investment banking activism,
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:35.120]   where we'd go in and recommend something
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:37.320]   a good investment bank would have recommended.
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:38.640]   And if they do it, we make a bunch of money.
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:40.840]   And then we moved on to the next one.
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:42.960]   And then we realized an investment,
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:45.080]   a company called General Growth,
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:47.320]   was the first time we took a board seat on a company.
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:50.760]   And there was some financial restructuring
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:51.920]   and also an opportunity to improve
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:53.400]   the operations of the business,
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:54.880]   sit on the board of a company.
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:57.360]   And that was one of the best investments we ever made.
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:59.000]   And we said, okay, we can do more
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.480]   than just be an outside the boardroom investor.
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:03.920]   And we can get involved in helping select
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:05.020]   the right management teams
[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:06.880]   and helping guide the right management teams.
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:09.840]   And then we've done that over years.
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:12.200]   And then I would say the last seven years,
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:14.240]   we haven't had to be an activist.
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:16.800]   An activist is generally someone who's outside
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.400]   banging on the door, trying to get in.
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:20.080]   We've sort of built enough credibility
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:21.880]   that they open the door and they say,
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:24.380]   "Hey, Bill, what ideas do you have?"
[00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:27.040]   So, "Welcome, would you like to join the board?"
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:28.160]   We're treated differently today
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:29.800]   than we were in the beginning.
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:33.760]   And that is, I would say,
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:37.280]   some people might just call it being an engaged owner.
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:39.440]   By the way, that's the way investing was done
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:42.840]   in the Andrew Carnegie, JP Morgan days,
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.960]   you know, 150 years ago, right?
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:47.520]   You had these iconic business leaders
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.360]   that would own 20% of US steel.
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:51.080]   And when things would go wrong,
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:53.720]   they'd replace the board and the management and fix them.
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:56.280]   And over time, we went to a world
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:52:01.040]   where mutual funds were created like in the 1920s, '30s,
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:04.320]   index funds with Vanguard and others.
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:06.880]   And that all these controlling shareholders
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:09.560]   would kind of gave their stock to society
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:11.920]   or their children and multiple generations.
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:13.520]   And there were no longer kind of controlling
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:15.640]   owners of businesses or very few.
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:17.440]   And that led to underperformance
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.420]   and the opportunity for activists over time.
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:20.640]   And what activism has done,
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:22.920]   and I think we've helped lead this movement,
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:25.080]   is it restored kind of the balance of power
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:26.920]   between the owners of the business
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:28.400]   and the managements of the company.
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:29.760]   And that's been a very good thing
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:33.560]   for the performance of the US stock market, actually.
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:35.360]   - So the owners, meaning the shareholders.
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:36.180]   - Yes.
[00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:39.320]   - So there's a more direct channel communication
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:42.640]   with activists investing between the shareholders
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:44.160]   and the people running the company.
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:45.000]   - Yes.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.300]   So activists generally never own
[00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:49.120]   more than five or 10% of a business.
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:51.160]   So they don't have control.
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:53.040]   So the way they get influence
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:55.380]   is they have to convince the other, you know,
[00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:57.640]   but they have to get to sort of a majority
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:00.200]   of the other shareholders to support them.
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:02.040]   And if they can get that kind of support,
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:04.840]   they can behave almost like a controlling shareholder.
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:06.160]   And that's how it works.
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:08.580]   - So the running of a company is,
[00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:11.640]   according to Bill Ackman, is more democratic now.
[00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:13.160]   - It is, it is.
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:14.360]   But you need some thought leaders.
[00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:16.320]   So activists are kind of thought leaders,
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:19.360]   'cause they can spend the time and the money.
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:21.680]   You know, a retail investor that owns 1,000 shares
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:24.860]   doesn't have the resources or the time.
[00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:25.700]   They got a day job.
[00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:26.840]   Whereas an activist day job
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:28.640]   is finding the handful of things
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:30.540]   where there are opportunities.
[00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:34.880]   - So on average, is it good to have such an engaged,
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:38.920]   powerful, influential investor
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:42.120]   helping control, direct the direction of a company?
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:44.840]   - It depends who that investor is,
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:46.800]   but generally I think it's a good thing.
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:49.440]   And that's why, you know,
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:51.320]   one of the problems with being CEO of a company today
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:53.900]   and having a very diversified shareholder base
[00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:57.640]   is the kind of short-term, long-term balance.
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:00.040]   And you have investors who have all different interests
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:01.280]   in terms of what they want to achieve
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:03.160]   and when they want it achieved.
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:08.160]   And a new CEO of an old company, let's say,
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:11.880]   hasn't had the chance to develop the credibility
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:14.720]   to make the kind of longer-term decisions
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:17.020]   and can be stuck in a cycle
[00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:19.640]   of being judged on a quarterly basis.
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:23.840]   And a business, the best businesses are forever assets.
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:25.160]   And decisions you make now
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:28.160]   have impact three, four, or five years from now.
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:28.980]   In order to make,
[00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:30.360]   and sometimes there are decisions we make
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:33.840]   that have the effect of reducing the earnings of a company
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:36.320]   in the short-term, because in the long-term,
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:38.840]   it's gonna make the business much more valuable.
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:41.080]   But sometimes it's hard to have that kind of credibility
[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:42.480]   when you're a new CEO of a company.
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:43.980]   So when you have a major owner
[00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:47.120]   that's respected by other shareholders,
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:48.120]   sitting on the board saying,
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:50.040]   "Hey, the CEO is doing the right thing
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:53.180]   "and making this expensive investment in a new factory.
[00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:55.480]   "We're spending more money on R&D
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:56.680]   "because we're developing something
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:58.680]   "that's gonna pay off over time."
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:01.320]   That large owner on the board
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:03.600]   can help buy the time necessary
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:05.640]   for management to behave in a longer-term way.
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:07.520]   And that's, I think, good for all the shareholders.
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:10.320]   - So that's the good story, but can it get bad?
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:13.920]   Can you have a CEO who is a visionary
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:16.640]   and sees the long-term future of a company
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:20.480]   and an investor come in and have very selfish interest
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:22.880]   in just making more money in the short-term
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:27.240]   and therefore destroy and manipulate
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:28.800]   the opinions of the shareholders
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:30.080]   and other people on the board
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:33.000]   in order to sink the company,
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.600]   maybe increase the price,
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:41.080]   but destroy the possibility of long-term value?
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:42.480]   - It could theoretically happen.
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:46.240]   But again, the activist in your example,
[00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:48.240]   Johnny doesn't own a lot of stock.
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.840]   The shareholder basis today,
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:51.640]   the biggest shareholders are these index funds
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:53.060]   that are forever, right?
[00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:55.600]   The BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street,
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:57.960]   their ownership stakes are just at this point only growing
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:01.060]   'cause of the inflows of capital they have from shareholders.
[00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:04.040]   So they have to think, or they should think very long-term,
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:05.520]   and they're gonna be very skeptical
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:08.080]   of someone coming in with a short-term idea
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:11.760]   that drives the stock price up in the next six months,
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:13.800]   but impairs the company's long-term ability to compete.
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:16.080]   And basically that ownership group
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:19.800]   prevents this kind of activity from really happening.
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:22.720]   - So people are generally skeptical
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:25.680]   of short-term activist investors.
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:28.200]   - Yes, and they're very few.
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.800]   I don't really know any short-term activist investors.
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:33.720]   - That's a hopeful message. - Not ones with credibility.
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:35.600]   - You mentioned general growth.
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:37.720]   I read somewhere it called arguably
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:40.820]   one of the best hedge fund trades of all time.
[00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:47.240]   So I guess it went from $60 million to over 3 billion.
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:50.540]   - It was a good one, but it wasn't a trade.
[00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:51.560]   I wouldn't describe it as a trade.
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:53.880]   A trade is something you buy and you flip.
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:55.620]   This is something where we made the investment
[00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:57.640]   initially in November of 2008.
[00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:02.880]   And we still own a company we spun off of general growth,
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:04.600]   and it's now 15 years later.
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:08.520]   - So can you describe what went into making that decision
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:10.800]   to actually increase the value of the company?
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:13.840]   - Sure, so this was at the time of the financial crisis,
[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:17.040]   circa November 2008.
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:19.700]   What real estate's always been a kind of sector
[00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:20.620]   that I've been interested in.
[00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:22.240]   I began my career in the real estate business
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:24.360]   working for my dad actually,
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:25.920]   arranging mortgages for real estate developers.
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:30.800]   So I have kind of deep ties and interest in the business.
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:32.340]   And General Growth was the second largest
[00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:34.280]   shopping mall company in the country.
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:36.400]   Simon Properties, many people have heard of.
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:38.020]   General Growth was number two.
[00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:39.840]   They own some of the best malls in the country.
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:42.520]   And at that time, people thought of shopping malls
[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:44.920]   as these non-disruptible things.
[00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:46.280]   Again, we talk about disruption.
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:48.980]   Malls have been disrupted in many ways.
[00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:53.560]   And General Growth stock, General Growth, the company,
[00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:56.080]   the CFO in particular, was very aggressive
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:58.040]   in the way that he borrowed money.
[00:57:58.040 --> 00:58:01.080]   And he borrowed money from a kind of Wall Street,
[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:03.760]   not long-term mortgages,
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:05.600]   but generally relatively short-term mortgages.
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:06.480]   He was pretty aggressive.
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:07.760]   As the value went up,
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:09.720]   he would borrow more and more against the assets,
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:12.760]   and that helped the short-term results of the business.
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:14.880]   The problem was during the financial crisis,
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:18.360]   the market for what's called CMBS,
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:20.920]   Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities, basically shut.
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:23.000]   And the company, 'cause its debt was relatively short-term,
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.200]   had a lot of big maturities coming up
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:27.280]   that they had no ability to refinance.
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:28.840]   And the market said, "Oh my God,
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:30.700]   "the lenders are gonna foreclose,
[00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:33.120]   "and the company's gonna go bankrupt,
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:34.080]   "they're gonna get wiped out."
[00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:38.240]   Stock went from $63 a share to 34 cents.
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:40.840]   And there was a family, the Buxbaum family owned,
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:42.760]   I think about 25% of the company,
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:46.000]   and they had a $5 billion of stock
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.360]   that was worth 25 million or something
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:50.460]   by the time we bought a stake in the business.
[00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:53.100]   And what interested me was,
[00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:56.720]   I thought the assets were worth substantially more
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:57.560]   than the liabilities.
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:58:59.920]   The company had 27 billion of debt,
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:03.520]   and had $100 million value of the equity,
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:06.000]   down from like 20 billion, okay?
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.240]   And one, that's sort of an interesting place to start,
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:10.400]   with the stock down 99%.
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.480]   But the fundamental drivers of the mall business
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:15.200]   are occupancy, how occupied are the malls.
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:16.880]   Occupancy was up year on year,
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:19.520]   between '07 and '08, interestingly.
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:20.560]   Net operating income,
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:22.500]   which is kind of a measure of cashflow from the malls,
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:24.440]   that was up year on year.
[00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:28.520]   So kind of the underlying fundamentals were doing fine.
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:29.440]   The only problem they had
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:31.080]   is they had billions of dollars of debt
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:33.480]   that they had to repay, they couldn't repay.
[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:36.280]   And if you kind of examine the bankruptcy code,
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:41.000]   it's precisely designed for a situation like this,
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.040]   where it's kind of this resting place you can go
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:48.520]   to kind of restructure your business.
[00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:51.200]   Now, the problem was that every other company
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:54.440]   that had gone bankrupt, the shareholders got wiped out.
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:56.560]   And so the market's seeing every previous example,
[00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:57.600]   the shareholders get wiped out,
[00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:59.680]   the assumption is the stock's gonna go to zero.
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.400]   But that's not what the bankruptcy code says.
[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:03.080]   What the bankruptcy code says
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:06.880]   is that the value gets apportioned based on value.
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:09.300]   And if you could prove to a judge
[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:12.320]   that there was the assets worth more than the liabilities,
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.080]   then the shareholders actually get to keep
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.040]   their investment in the company.
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:17.680]   And that was the bet we made.
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:18.960]   And so we stepped into the market,
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:22.640]   we bought 25% of the company in the open market for,
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:25.200]   we had to pay up, it started out at 34 cents.
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:28.300]   I think there were 300 million shares.
[01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:29.920]   So it was at $100 million value.
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:32.480]   By the time we were done, we paid an average of,
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:34.600]   we paid 60 million for 25% of the business.
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:38.720]   So about $240 million for the equity of the company.
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:39.700]   And then we had to get on the board
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:41.400]   to convince the director of the right thing to do.
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:43.760]   And the board was in complete panic.
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.000]   Didn't know what to do.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.800]   Spending a ton of money on advisors.
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:52.160]   And I was a shareholder activist,
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:55.000]   four years into Pershing Square,
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.840]   and no one had any idea what we were doing.
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:57.680]   They thought we were crazy.
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:59.960]   Every day we'd go into the market,
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.880]   we'd buy this penny stock,
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:03.520]   and we'd file what's called a 13D,
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:06.280]   every 1% increase in our stake.
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:07.560]   And people just thought we were crazy.
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.600]   We're buying stock in a company that's gonna go bankrupt.
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.960]   Bill, you're gonna lose all your money.
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.160]   You know, run, okay.
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:16.200]   And I said, well, bankruptcy code says
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.840]   that if there's more asset value than liabilities,
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:20.380]   we should be fine.
[01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:23.940]   And the key moment, if you're looking for fun moments,
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:26.280]   is there's a woman named Maddie Buxbaum,
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:27.880]   who was from the Buxbaum family.
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:32.000]   And her cousin, John, was chairman of the board,
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.680]   CEO of the company.
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.920]   And I said, as she calls me
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:37.640]   after we disclosed our stake in the company,
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:40.040]   she's like, Billy Ackman, I'm really glad to see you here.
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:42.640]   And I met her like, I don't think it was a date,
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.720]   but I kind of met her in a social context
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:46.800]   when I was like 25 or something.
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:48.280]   And she said, look, I'm really glad to see you here.
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:52.160]   And if there's anything I can do to help you, call me.
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.240]   I said, sure.
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:56.080]   We kept trying to get on the board of the company.
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.720]   They wouldn't invite us on.
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:59.360]   Couldn't really run a proxy contest,
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:01.880]   you know, not with a company going bankrupt.
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:03.720]   And their advisors actually were Goldman Sachs,
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:06.560]   and they're like, you don't want the fox in the henhouse.
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:08.560]   And they were listening to their advisors.
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:10.440]   So I called Maddie up and I said,
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:12.560]   Maddie, I need to get on the board of the company to help.
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:13.520]   And she says, you know what?
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:16.000]   I will call my cousin and I'll get it done.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.480]   Like, you know, she calls back a few hours later.
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:21.720]   You'll be going on to the board.
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:24.760]   I don't know what she said to her cousin.
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:25.600]   - But she was convincing.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:26.440]   - Next thing you know, I'm invited
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:27.720]   to on the board of the company.
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:29.320]   And the board is talking about
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:32.400]   the old equity of general growth.
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.800]   Old equity is what you talk about
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:34.960]   that the shareholders are getting wiped out.
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:35.800]   I said, no, no, no.
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:40.200]   This board represents the current equity of the company.
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.360]   And I'm a major shareholder.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:42.560]   John's a major shareholder.
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:43.760]   There's plenty of asset value here.
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.840]   This company should be able to be restructured
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:47.840]   for the benefit of shareholders.
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:50.400]   And we led a restructuring for the benefit of shareholders.
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.800]   And it took, let's say, eight months.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:56.760]   And the company emerged from chapter 11.
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:59.920]   We made an incremental investment into the company.
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:01.960]   And the shareholders kept the vast majority
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:03.160]   of their investment.
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:06.560]   All the creditors got a face amount of their investment,
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:09.160]   par plus acute, crude interest.
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.760]   And it was a great outcome.
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.120]   All the employees kept their jobs.
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:13.480]   The mall stayed open.
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:14.920]   There was no liquidation.
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:17.220]   The bankruptcy system worked the way it should.
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:20.080]   I was in court all the time.
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:22.800]   And the first meeting with the judge,
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.480]   the judge was like, look, this would never have happened
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:26.760]   were it not for a financial crisis.
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:29.400]   And once the judge said it, I knew we were gonna be fine.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:31.000]   Because the company had really not done
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.200]   anything fundamentally wrong.
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:34.800]   Maybe a little too aggressive in how they borrowed money.
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:38.100]   And stock went from 34 cents to $31 a share.
[01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:41.460]   And actually, fun little anecdote.
[01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:42.880]   We made a lot of people a lot of money
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:44.800]   who followed us into it.
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:46.460]   I got a lot of nice thank you notes,
[01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:47.880]   which you get on occasion in this business,
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:49.100]   believe it or not.
[01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:50.380]   And then one day I get a voicemail.
[01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:52.920]   This is when there was something called voicemail.
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:55.320]   Probably a few years later.
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:58.160]   And it's a guy with a very thick Jamaican accent
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:01.320]   leaving a message for Bill Ackman.
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:02.920]   So I return all my calls.
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:04.600]   Call the guy back.
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:05.720]   He's like, hi, it's Bill Ackman.
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:07.160]   I'm just returning your call.
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.640]   He's like, oh, Mr. Ackman.
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:11.600]   Thank you so much for calling me.
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:13.720]   I said, oh, how can I help?
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:15.080]   He says, I wanted to thank you.
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:16.520]   I said, what do you mean?
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:19.480]   He said, I saw you on CNBC a couple years ago
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:21.680]   and you were talking about this general growth.
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:23.400]   And the stock, I said, where was the stock at the time?
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:25.720]   He said, it's 60 cents or something like this.
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:27.120]   And I bought a lot of stock.
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:31.200]   And I'm like, well, how much did you invest?
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:35.120]   Oh, I invest all of my money in the company.
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:38.040]   And he was a New York City taxi driver
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:41.800]   and he invested like $50,000 or something like this
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:44.040]   at 60 cents a share.
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.040]   And he was still holding it.
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:46.480]   And he went into retirement
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:49.160]   and he made 50 times his money.
[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:51.520]   And those are the moments
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.840]   that you feel pretty good about investing.
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:55.240]   - What gave you confidence through that?
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:56.160]   That's a penny stock
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.520]   and I'm sure you were getting a lot of naysayers
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:01.400]   and people saying that this is crazy.
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:02.240]   - It's the same thing.
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:03.280]   You just do the work.
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:05.560]   Like we got a lot of pushback from our investors actually,
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:08.480]   'cause we had never invested in a bankrupt company before.
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.880]   It's a field called distressed investing
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:14.280]   and they're dedicated distressed investors.
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:16.200]   We weren't considered one of them.
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:17.400]   So Bill, what are you doing?
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:18.920]   You don't know anything about distressed investing.
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:21.080]   You don't know anything about bankruptcy investing,
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:23.600]   but I can read.
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:24.520]   - And you learned.
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:25.720]   - And I learned.
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:30.120]   And sometimes it's very helpful not to be a practitioner,
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:31.240]   an expert in something,
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.200]   'cause you get used to the conventional wisdom.
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:37.160]   And so we just abstractly read the,
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:38.880]   step back and look at the facts.
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.560]   And it was just a really interesting setup
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:43.440]   for one of the best investments we ever made.
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:46.280]   - How hard is it to learn some of the legal aspects of this?
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:48.680]   Like you mentioned bankruptcy code.
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:52.520]   Like I imagine it's very sort of dense language
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:55.320]   and dense ideas and the loopholes
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:56.480]   and all that kind of stuff.
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:58.160]   Like if you're just stepping in
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:00.040]   and you've never done distressed investing,
[01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.640]   how hard is it to figure out?
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:03.520]   - It's not that hard.
[01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:04.720]   No, it's not that hard.
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:05.560]   - Okay.
[01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:07.480]   - I mean, I literally read a book on distressed investing.
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:08.320]   - Okay.
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:11.200]   - Ben Branch or something, something on distressed investing.
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.520]   - So you were able to pick up the intuition from that,
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:17.000]   just all the basic skills involved,
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.360]   the basic facts to know, all that kind of stuff.
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:21.080]   - Most of the world's knowledge
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:22.720]   has already been written somewhere.
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.520]   You just gotta read the right books.
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:27.560]   And also had great lawyers,
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:31.040]   built up some great relationships.
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:32.880]   We work with Sullivan and Cromwell
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:35.000]   and their lawyer there named Joe Schenker,
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.360]   who I met earlier in my career.
[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:37.840]   Pershing Square is actually my second act
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:38.680]   in the hedge fund business.
[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:41.800]   I started a fund called Gotham Partners when I was 26.
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:42.720]   One of my early investments
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:44.960]   was a company called Rockefeller Center Properties
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.840]   that was heading for bankruptcy.
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:49.440]   And the lawyer on the other side representing Goldman Sachs
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:51.120]   was a guy named Joe Schenker.
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:52.720]   So he was like an obvious phone call
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:54.600]   'cause we had yet another real estate bankruptcy.
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:56.920]   And that one we did very well,
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:58.480]   but I missed the big opportunity.
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:02.960]   And I suffered severe psychological torture
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:04.280]   every time I walked by Rockefeller Center
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:05.120]   because we could have made,
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.640]   we knew more about that property than anyone else,
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:08.440]   but I knew less about deal-making
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:09.600]   and didn't have the resources.
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:12.120]   And I was 28 years old or 27.
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:15.680]   And they hired a better lawyer than we did.
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:19.400]   And they outsmarted us on that one in a way.
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:21.000]   So I said, okay, I'm gonna go hire this guy
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000]   the next time around. (laughs)
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.160]   - Okay, we'll probably talk about Rockefeller Center
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:28.120]   and some failures.
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:31.120]   But first, you said Fox in the hen house.
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:31.960]   - Yes.
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:33.360]   - Something that the board and the chairman
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:34.480]   were worried about.
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:36.880]   Why would they call you a fox?
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:40.240]   So you keep saying activist investing
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:42.000]   is nothing to worry about.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.920]   It's always good, mostly good.
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:49.140]   But that expression applied in this context.
[01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:51.140]   You know, they were still worried about that.
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:51.980]   - Sure.
[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:54.120]   - And so, I mean, there's a million questions here,
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:54.960]   but first of all,
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:58.360]   what is the process of getting on the board look like?
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:01.300]   - So a board can always admit a member at any time
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:03.680]   in their discretion for a US company.
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:07.160]   Maybe there's some jurisdiction
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.080]   where you need a shareholder vote,
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:08.920]   but in most cases,
[01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:11.560]   a board can vote on any director that they want.
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:14.340]   If the board doesn't invite you to the party,
[01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:16.960]   you have to apply to be a member in effect.
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:19.400]   And that process is called,
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:21.200]   you know, basically it's the process
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:25.660]   of ultimately running a slate for a meeting
[01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:27.180]   where you propose a number.
[01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:29.860]   Any shareholder can propose to be on a board of a company
[01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:33.060]   if they own one share of stock in the business.
[01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:36.540]   And getting your name in the company's,
[01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:39.600]   you know, in the materials they sent to shareholders,
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:41.100]   those rules were written in a way
[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:42.980]   that were very unfavorable and very difficult
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:43.820]   to get in the door.
[01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:45.980]   And those rules have been changed very recently
[01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:48.380]   where the company now has to include a candidate,
[01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:50.740]   really all the candidates in the materials
[01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:51.580]   they send to shareholders
[01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:53.060]   so the shareholders pick the best ones.
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:54.540]   When we applied, or when we applied,
[01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:56.060]   when we ran proxy contests in the past,
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:57.420]   that was not the case.
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:08:58.980]   And so you have to spend a lot of money,
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:01.900]   mostly mailing fees and all kinds of other legal
[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:04.500]   and other expenses to let everyone know you're running,
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:05.940]   like running a political campaign.
[01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:06.780]   And then you've got to run around
[01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:08.620]   and meet with the big shareholders,
[01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:10.620]   you know, fly around the country,
[01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:11.900]   explain your case to them.
[01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:14.700]   And then there's a shareholder meeting.
[01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:17.260]   And if you get a majority of the votes, you get on.
[01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:22.420]   - What's this proxy contest/battle idea?
[01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:23.260]   What's that?
[01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:24.940]   - The battle comes when they don't want you to get on.
[01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:25.780]   - Okay.
[01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:27.180]   - And a lot of that has to do with,
[01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:29.940]   I would say pride, normal human kind of stuff.
[01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:32.540]   You know, a lot of times a board
[01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:35.020]   of an underperforming company doesn't want to admit
[01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:36.980]   that they've underperformed.
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:39.700]   And boards of directors 20 years ago,
[01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:40.940]   when we started Pershing Square,
[01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:42.860]   were pretty cushy jobs.
[01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:44.820]   You sit on a board of a company,
[01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:46.540]   you play golf with the CEO, you know,
[01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:48.140]   at nice golf courses,
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:49.500]   you make a few hundred thousand dollars a year
[01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:50.660]   to go to four meetings.
[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:53.940]   It was kind of a rubber stamp world,
[01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:56.340]   where boards, you know, at the end of the day,
[01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:59.980]   the CEO really ran the show.
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:04.780]   Once shareholders could actually dislodge board members
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:06.780]   and they could lose their seats,
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:09.260]   and that's really the rise of shareholder activism,
[01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:11.340]   boards started taking their responsibilities
[01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:14.300]   much more seriously, because directors are typically,
[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:17.580]   you know, there are many cases, they're retired CEOs.
[01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:19.380]   This is kind of how they're making a living
[01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:20.460]   in the later part of their career.
[01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:23.060]   They sit on four boards, they collect a million,
[01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:25.860]   a million and a half dollars a year in director's fees.
[01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:28.500]   If they get thrown off the board by the shareholders,
[01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:30.580]   that's embarrassing, obviously.
[01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:32.740]   And it affects their ability to get on other boards.
[01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:36.060]   So, you know, again, incentives, as I said earlier,
[01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:37.140]   drive all human behavior.
[01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:38.540]   The incentives of directors,
[01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:40.500]   they want to preserve their board seats.
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:41.460]   So if you have a director,
[01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:44.100]   now, the directors on board serve in various roles.
[01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:46.140]   The most vulnerable ones are ones who, for example,
[01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:47.820]   chair a compensation committee.
[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:50.540]   And if they put in a bad plan or they overpaid management,
[01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:53.540]   you know, they're subject to attack by shareholders.
[01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:55.420]   But, you know, these contests are not dissimilar
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:57.900]   to political contests, where there's mudslinging
[01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:00.980]   and the other side puts out false information about you,
[01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:01.980]   you have to respond,
[01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:03.660]   and they're spending the shareholder's money.
[01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:05.380]   So they have sort of unlimited resources,
[01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:08.220]   and you're spending your and your investor's money.
[01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:10.580]   You know, when you're a small firm, finite resources.
[01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:12.820]   So they can outspend you, they can sue you.
[01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:15.020]   They can try to, you know,
[01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:18.820]   jigger the mechanics in such a way
[01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:19.900]   that you're going to lose.
[01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:22.740]   There's some unfortunate stuff that's happened in the past,
[01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:24.340]   you know, manipulative stuff.
[01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:26.060]   - So also some stuff that's public,
[01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:27.860]   like in the press and all this kind of stuff.
[01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:29.700]   - Oh, of course, you know, there'll be, you know,
[01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:33.260]   articles about, you know, the dirty days
[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:37.060]   where they would go through your trash and, you know,
[01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:40.140]   make sure that, you know, you're not sleeping around
[01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:43.140]   and, you know, things like this, but that's okay.
[01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:46.980]   I can, I'm subject, I can survive extreme scrutiny
[01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:48.900]   'cause I've been through this for a long time.
[01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:51.420]   - So you're saying the fat and happy hens
[01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:58.060]   can get very wolf-like when the fox is trying to break in?
[01:11:58.060 --> 01:11:59.740]   Is this how we extend the metaphor?
[01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:01.140]   - Well, the fox is a threat to the hens.
[01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:02.100]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:06.580]   - But you've just, the charismatic fox
[01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:08.580]   just explained to me why the fox is good
[01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:10.660]   for everybody in the hen house.
[01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:12.180]   - At the end of the day, it's actually very good
[01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:14.980]   on a board to have someone, you know, if you,
[01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:16.940]   there are many examples over time
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:18.580]   and some handful of high-profile ones
[01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:20.020]   where the board fought tooth and nail
[01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:21.940]   to keep the activists off the board.
[01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:23.260]   And then once the activists got on the board
[01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:25.100]   and they said, you know, the guy's not so bad after all,
[01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:28.140]   the shareholders voted him on, he's got some decent ideas,
[01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:30.180]   and let's all work together to have this work out.
[01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:33.820]   And so there are very few cases where after the contest,
[01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:34.900]   when the, and by the way,
[01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:36.500]   sometimes you have to replace the entire board.
[01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:37.340]   We've done that.
[01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:41.700]   But in most cases, you get a couple of seats on the board
[01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:45.220]   and it's just, you know, you wanna build a board
[01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:47.820]   comprised of diverse points of view.
[01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:49.980]   And that's how you get to the truth.
[01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:53.940]   - What was the most dramatic battle for the board
[01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:55.740]   that you have been a part of?
[01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:58.380]   - The Canadian Pacific Proxy Contest.
[01:12:58.380 --> 01:12:59.940]   So Canadian Pacific was like,
[01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:02.580]   considered the most iconic company in Canada.
[01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:05.100]   It literally built the country
[01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:08.660]   because the rail that got built over Canada
[01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:12.260]   is what united the various provinces into a country.
[01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:14.580]   And then over time,
[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:16.820]   'cause the railroad business is pretty good business,
[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:18.140]   they built a ton of hotels,
[01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:19.420]   they owned a lot of real estate,
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:21.500]   and it became this massive conglomerate,
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:25.300]   but it was horribly mismanaged for decades.
[01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:26.740]   By the time we got involved,
[01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:29.820]   it was by far the worst run railroad in North America.
[01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:31.580]   They had the lowest profit margins,
[01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:33.340]   they had the lowest growth rate,
[01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:36.580]   every quarter management would make excuses
[01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:37.500]   generally about the weather
[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:39.340]   as to why they underperformed versus,
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:40.860]   and there there's a direct competitor,
[01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:42.380]   a company called Canadian National,
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:44.180]   has a rail that goes right across the country.
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:46.060]   And Canadian Pacific would constantly be complaining
[01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:47.260]   about the weather.
[01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:51.660]   And basically, you know, same country, same regions,
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:53.160]   tracks weren't that far apart.
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:57.700]   But it was a really important company
[01:13:57.700 --> 01:14:00.100]   and being on this board was like an honorary thing.
[01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:02.260]   And everyone on the board was an icon of Canada.
[01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:04.380]   You know, the chairman of the Royal Bank of Canada,
[01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:06.780]   you know, the head of the most important grain,
[01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:08.220]   privately held grain company,
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:10.660]   the, you know, sort of an important collection
[01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:14.860]   of, you know, big time Canadian executives.
[01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:15.700]   Here we were, you know,
[01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:19.620]   this is probably about 13 years ago.
[01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:24.620]   And, you know, still maybe 44 year old from New York,
[01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:28.340]   not a Canadian, basically saying
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:31.100]   this is the worst run railroad in North America.
[01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:34.620]   And we bought 12% of the railroad at a really low price.
[01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:38.700]   And we brought with us to our first meeting,
[01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:40.660]   the greatest railroader ever,
[01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:41.660]   a guy named Hunter Harrison
[01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:43.900]   who had turned around Canadian National.
[01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:46.220]   So we'd like, okay, we've got a great asset.
[01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:47.980]   We've got the greatest railroad CEO of all time.
[01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:49.700]   He's come out of retirement
[01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:51.660]   to step in and run the railroad.
[01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:53.340]   And we brought him to the first meeting
[01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:55.300]   and they wouldn't even meet with him.
[01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:59.260]   And they certainly weren't gonna consider hiring him.
[01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:01.220]   And that led us to a proxy contest.
[01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:06.020]   - And this is where the engine starts churning
[01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:09.100]   just to figure out how this contest can be won.
[01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:11.220]   So what's involved?
[01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:12.860]   - Well, the key is we had to, one,
[01:15:12.860 --> 01:15:14.780]   come up with a group of directors
[01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:17.620]   who would be willing to step into a battle.
[01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:20.420]   And we didn't want a bunch of New York directors
[01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:21.420]   or even American directors.
[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:22.780]   We wanted Canadians.
[01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:25.500]   The problem was this was the most iconic company in Canada
[01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:27.260]   and we wanted high profile people.
[01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:29.340]   So we talked to all the high profile people in Canada.
[01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:31.460]   Every one of them would say, Bill, you're entirely right.
[01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:34.620]   This thing is the worst railroad, it needs to be fixed.
[01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:36.180]   But you know, I see John at the club.
[01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:38.460]   You know, I see him at the Toronto club.
[01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:40.180]   You know, I can't, you know, I can't do this
[01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:42.060]   but you're totally right.
[01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:44.900]   And we had to, and that was the concern
[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:47.580]   because you have to file your materials by a certain day.
[01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:48.860]   You got to put together a slate.
[01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:49.700]   We needed a big slate
[01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:51.460]   'cause we knew that we had to replace
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:53.740]   basically all the directors.
[01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:56.140]   And then one, I spoke to a guy
[01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:58.580]   who was one of the wealthiest guys in Canada
[01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:01.420]   who was on the board at one point in time.
[01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:05.540]   And he said, Bill, I have an idea for you.
[01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:07.620]   There's this woman, Rebecca McDonald.
[01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:09.300]   Why don't you give her a call?
[01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:13.460]   And I called Rebecca and she was the first woman
[01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:16.300]   to take a company public in Canada as CEO.
[01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:18.940]   And she was a kind of anti-establishment,
[01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:21.660]   not afraid to take on anything kind of person.
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:24.060]   And I called her, we had a great conversation.
[01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:27.340]   And she was in the Dominican Republic at her house
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:29.140]   and I flew down to see her.
[01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:30.980]   And she said, yeah, I'm all in.
[01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:33.420]   And actually once we got her,
[01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:35.020]   that enabled us to get others.
[01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:37.020]   And then we put together our slate
[01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:40.380]   and we had some pretty interesting dialogue
[01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:41.220]   with the company.
[01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:42.780]   They tried to embarrass us all the time.
[01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:44.540]   - In the press publicly, what were you talking about?
[01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:45.980]   - Press publicly.
[01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:48.060]   You know, at one point I wrote an email saying,
[01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:50.580]   look, let's come to peace on this thing.
[01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:54.700]   But if we don't, you're really forcing my hand
[01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:57.580]   and we're gonna have to rent the largest hall in Toronto
[01:16:57.580 --> 01:16:59.100]   and invite all the shareholders.
[01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:00.900]   And it's gonna be embarrassing for management.
[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:02.780]   And I made reference to some nuclear winter.
[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:05.420]   Let's not have it be a nuclear winter.
[01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:06.540]   And they thought they'd embarrass me
[01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:08.940]   by releasing the email, but it only inspired us.
[01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:11.460]   And we rented the largest hall in Canada
[01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:14.500]   and we put up a presentation walking through,
[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.340]   here's Canadian National, here's Canadian Pacific.
[01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:18.260]   Here's what they said, here's what they did.
[01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:19.220]   And we had Hunter get up.
[01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:23.420]   It was this incredibly charismatic guy from Tennessee.
[01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:27.420]   An amazing, you know, he's like a lion, okay?
[01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:30.420]   Incredibly deep voice, unbelievable track record,
[01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:32.180]   incredibly respected guy.
[01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:34.980]   It's like getting Michael Jordan to come out of retirement
[01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:38.580]   and come and run the company.
[01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:40.100]   And Hunter was incredible.
[01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:42.940]   And other, Paul Lau, other members of my team
[01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:44.540]   were, you know, super engaged.
[01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:49.100]   And the board, you know, Canadians are known to be nice.
[01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:50.700]   So one of the problems we had is shareholders
[01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:52.900]   would never tell management or the board
[01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:54.700]   that they were losing.
[01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:56.100]   It was not until the night before the meeting
[01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:57.100]   when the vote came in,
[01:17:57.100 --> 01:17:59.060]   the management realized that they lost.
[01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:04.940]   We got 99% of the vote and they offered us a deal.
[01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:06.180]   When they begged us to take a deal,
[01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:08.460]   they said, look, we'll resign tonight
[01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:10.220]   so that we don't have to come to the meeting tomorrow.
[01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:11.420]   That's how embarrassed they were.
[01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:13.820]   So that was kind of an interesting one.
[01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:18.660]   - So in both this proxy battle and the company itself,
[01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:21.820]   this was one of your more successful investments.
[01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:22.660]   - It was.
[01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:24.220]   I mean, the stock's up about 10 times
[01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:25.980]   and it's an industrial company.
[01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:27.980]   It's a railroad and it's not like a growth,
[01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:29.980]   like it's not Google.
[01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:30.820]   So it's a great story.
[01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:33.260]   And the company's now run by a guy named Keith Creel.
[01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:36.140]   And Keith, it was Hunter's protege.
[01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:38.980]   And in so many ways, he's actually better than Hunter.
[01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:39.980]   He's doing an incredible job.
[01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:43.780]   And the sad part here is we did very well.
[01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:45.260]   We tripled our money over several years.
[01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:46.860]   And then I went through a very challenging period
[01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:49.260]   because of a couple of bad investments.
[01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:53.620]   And we had to sell our Canadian Pacific to raise capital,
[01:18:53.620 --> 01:18:56.460]   to pay for investors who were leaving.
[01:18:56.460 --> 01:19:00.020]   But we had another opportunity to buy it back
[01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:01.300]   in the last couple of years.
[01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:03.740]   And so we're now again, a major owner of the company.
[01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:05.540]   But had we held onto original stock,
[01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:09.340]   it would have been epic, if you will.
[01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:13.260]   - So on this one, you were right.
[01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:14.100]   - Yes.
[01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:16.660]   - And I read an article about you
[01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:18.060]   and there's many articles about you.
[01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:22.060]   I read an article that said Bill is often right,
[01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:26.580]   but you approach it with a scorched earth approach
[01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:30.500]   that can often do more, sort of can do damage.
[01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:31.940]   - I haven't read the often right article,
[01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:33.580]   but the good news is we are often right.
[01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:36.580]   And I say we, because we're a team, a small team,
[01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:38.900]   but a fortunately very successful one.
[01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:42.460]   So our batting average as investors is extremely high.
[01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:44.620]   And the good news is our record's totally public.
[01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:46.580]   You can see everything we've ever done.
[01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:48.580]   But the press doesn't generally write
[01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:50.300]   about the success stories.
[01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:51.620]   They write about the failures.
[01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:56.220]   And so we've had some epic failures, big losses.
[01:19:56.220 --> 01:20:00.340]   Good news is they've been a tiny minority of the cases.
[01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:03.140]   Now, no one likes to lose money.
[01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:06.220]   It's even worse to lose other people's money.
[01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:08.180]   And I've done that occasionally.
[01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:10.820]   The good news is if you stuck with us,
[01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:13.740]   you've done very well over a long time.
[01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:16.540]   - On a small tangent, since we're talking about boards,
[01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:19.580]   did you get a chance to see what happened
[01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:21.260]   with the OpenAI board?
[01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:23.160]   'Cause I'm talking to Sam Altman soon.
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.940]   Is there any insight you have,
[01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:29.460]   just maybe lessons you draw from this kind of,
[01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:30.300]   these kinds of events,
[01:20:30.300 --> 01:20:32.180]   especially with an AI technology company,
[01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:34.780]   such dramatic things happening?
[01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:36.340]   - Yeah, that was an incredible story.
[01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:38.180]   Look, governance really matters.
[01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:40.860]   And the governance structure of OpenAI,
[01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:43.520]   I think, leaves something to be desired.
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:45.820]   You know, I think Sam's point was this,
[01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:48.020]   and maybe Elon Musk's point,
[01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:49.660]   originally set up as a nonprofit.
[01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:52.700]   And it reminds me, actually,
[01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:57.420]   I invested in a nonprofit run by a former Facebook founder,
[01:20:57.420 --> 01:20:59.780]   where he was gonna create a Facebook-like entity
[01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:04.400]   for nonprofits to promote goodness in the world.
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:06.260]   And the problem was he couldn't hire the talent
[01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:08.020]   he wanted, 'cause he couldn't grant stock options,
[01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:10.180]   he couldn't pay market salaries.
[01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:12.300]   And ultimately, he ended up selling the business
[01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:13.940]   to a for-profit.
[01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:16.300]   So it taught me, for-profit solutions to problems
[01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:17.700]   are much better than nonprofits.
[01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:19.380]   And here you had kind of a blend, right?
[01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:21.260]   It was set up as a nonprofit,
[01:21:21.260 --> 01:21:22.860]   but I think they found the same thing.
[01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:24.060]   They couldn't hire the talent they wanted
[01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:26.740]   without having a for-profit subsidiary.
[01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:30.940]   But the nonprofit entity, as I understand it,
[01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:35.300]   owns a big chunk of OpenAI.
[01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:37.820]   And the investors own sort of a capped interest
[01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:40.260]   where their upside is capped,
[01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:43.260]   and they don't have representation on the board.
[01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:47.620]   And I think that was a setup for a problem.
[01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:49.860]   And that's clearly what happened here.
[01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:52.100]   - And there's, I guess, some kind of complexity
[01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:53.900]   in the governance.
[01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:58.180]   I mean, because of this nonprofit and cap profit thing,
[01:21:58.180 --> 01:22:00.420]   it seems like there's a bunch of complexity
[01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:04.180]   and non-standard aspects to it
[01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:08.700]   that perhaps also contributed to the problem.
[01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:10.380]   - Yeah.
[01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:11.620]   Governance really matters.
[01:22:11.620 --> 01:22:13.380]   Boards of directors really matter.
[01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:18.860]   Giving the shareholders the right to have input
[01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:20.660]   at least once a year on the structure
[01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:23.460]   of the governance of a company is really important.
[01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:26.180]   And private, you know, venture-backed boards
[01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:27.460]   are also not ideal.
[01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:30.220]   You know, I'm an active investor in ventures,
[01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:33.580]   and there are some complicated issues
[01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:38.180]   that emerge in private sort of venture-stage companies
[01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:41.980]   where board members have somewhat divergent incentives
[01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:44.540]   from the long-term owners of a business.
[01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:46.580]   And what you see a lot in venture boards
[01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:49.660]   is they're presided over generally
[01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:51.580]   by venture capital investors
[01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:53.780]   who are big investors in the company.
[01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:56.140]   And oftentimes, it's more important to them
[01:22:56.140 --> 01:22:59.740]   to have the public perception
[01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:01.460]   that they're good directors
[01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:03.580]   so they get the next best deal, right?
[01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:05.820]   If they have a reputation
[01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:08.580]   for kind of taking on management too aggressively,
[01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:10.820]   word will get out in the small community of founders,
[01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:12.660]   and they'll miss the next Google.
[01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:14.740]   And so their interests are not just
[01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:16.500]   in that particular company.
[01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:19.580]   That's also, you know, one of the problems.
[01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:21.660]   Again, it all comes back to incentives.
[01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:23.220]   - Can you explain to me the difference, you know,
[01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:26.540]   venture-backed, like, VCs and shareholders?
[01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:28.940]   So this means before the company goes public?
[01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:31.700]   - Yeah, so private venture-backed companies,
[01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:34.220]   the boards tend to be very small.
[01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:36.460]   It could be a handful of the venture investors
[01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:37.700]   and management.
[01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:42.020]   They're often very rarely independent directors.
[01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:43.700]   It's just not an ideal structure.
[01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:45.340]   - Oh, I see. You want independent.
[01:23:45.340 --> 01:23:46.820]   - It's beneficial to have people
[01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:48.820]   who have an economic interest in the business,
[01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:51.460]   and they care only about the success of that company,
[01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:54.860]   as opposed to someone who, you know,
[01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:56.100]   if you think about the venture business,
[01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:57.940]   getting into the best deals
[01:23:57.940 --> 01:24:00.100]   is more important than any one deal.
[01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:01.900]   And you see cases where, you know,
[01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:04.780]   the boards go along with, in some cases,
[01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:06.900]   bad behavior on the part of management
[01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:08.180]   because they want a reputation
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:11.860]   for being kind of a founder-friendly director.
[01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:14.060]   You know, that's kind of problematic.
[01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:16.540]   You don't have the same issue in public company boards.
[01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:18.820]   - So we talked about some of the big wins
[01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:20.700]   and your track record,
[01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:22.900]   but you said there were some big losses.
[01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:27.100]   So what's the biggest loss of your career?
[01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:28.060]   - Biggest loss of my career
[01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:29.940]   is a company called Valiant Pharmaceuticals.
[01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:30.980]   We made an investment in a business
[01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:32.780]   that didn't meet our core principles.
[01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:35.020]   The problem with the pharmaceutical industry,
[01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:37.180]   and there are many problems, as I've learned,
[01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:39.540]   is it's a very volatile business, right?
[01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:41.060]   It's based on drug discovery.
[01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:43.460]   It's based on, you know,
[01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:46.300]   predicting kind of the future revenues of a drug
[01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:47.580]   before it goes off patent.
[01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:50.820]   You know, lots of complexities.
[01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:53.540]   And we thought we had founded a pharmaceutical company
[01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:56.100]   we could own because of a very unusual founder
[01:24:56.100 --> 01:24:57.980]   and the way he approached his business.
[01:24:57.980 --> 01:25:02.060]   It was a company where another activist
[01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:03.660]   was on the board of directors of the company
[01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:06.300]   and kind of governing and overseeing the day-to-day decisions
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:08.780]   and we ended up making a passive investment in the company.
[01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:09.820]   And up until this point in time,
[01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:12.380]   we really didn't make passive investments.
[01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:14.220]   And the company made a series of decisions
[01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:16.820]   that were, you know, disastrous.
[01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:18.820]   And then we stepped in to try to solve the problem.
[01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:20.340]   It was the first time I ever joined a board
[01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:22.260]   and the mess was much larger than I realized
[01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:23.180]   from the outside.
[01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:25.140]   And then I was kind of stuck.
[01:25:25.140 --> 01:25:29.300]   And it was very much a confidence-sensitive strategy
[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:30.820]   'cause they built their business
[01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:33.300]   by acquiring pharmaceutical assets.
[01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:36.980]   And they often issued stock when they acquired targets.
[01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:40.140]   And so once the market lost confidence in management,
[01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:43.180]   the stock price got crushed and it impaired their ability
[01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:46.980]   to continue to acquire low costs, you know, drugs.
[01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:49.980]   And we lost $4 billion.
[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:51.020]   - $4 billion.
[01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:51.860]   - Yeah.
[01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:53.460]   How's that for a big loss?
[01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:54.300]   It's up there.
[01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:56.900]   - So I'm sweating this whole conversation,
[01:25:56.900 --> 01:25:59.860]   both the wins and the losses and the stakes involved.
[01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:03.100]   - And by the way, that loss catalyzed other,
[01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:05.260]   what I call mark-to-market losses.
[01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:09.980]   So very high profile, huge number, disastrous press.
[01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:14.100]   Then people said, okay, Bill's gonna go out of business.
[01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:16.100]   So we're gonna bet against everything he's doing.
[01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:17.460]   And we know his entire portfolio
[01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:19.180]   'cause we only own 10 things.
[01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:21.420]   And we were short a company called Herbalife,
[01:26:21.420 --> 01:26:23.980]   very famously.
[01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:25.540]   We've only really shorted two companies.
[01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:27.100]   The first one, there's a book.
[01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:28.580]   The second one, there's a movie.
[01:26:28.580 --> 01:26:30.780]   We no longer short companies.
[01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:34.180]   But so people pushed up the price of Herbalife,
[01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:38.460]   which is when you're a short seller, that's catastrophic.
[01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:39.420]   I can explain that.
[01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:42.980]   And then they also shorted the other stocks that we owned.
[01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:45.900]   And so that valiant loss led to an overall
[01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:49.460]   more than 30% loss in the value of our portfolio.
[01:26:49.460 --> 01:26:53.060]   The valiant loss was real and was crystallized.
[01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:55.980]   We ended up selling the position, taking that loss.
[01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:57.780]   Most of the other losses were
[01:26:57.780 --> 01:26:59.180]   what I would call mark-to-market losses.
[01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:00.740]   They were temporary.
[01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:02.220]   But many people go out of business
[01:27:02.220 --> 01:27:05.380]   because as I mentioned before, large move in a price,
[01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:08.100]   if investors are redeeming or you have leverage,
[01:27:08.100 --> 01:27:09.620]   you know, it can put you out of business.
[01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:11.580]   And people assumed if we got put out of business,
[01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:15.060]   we'd have to sell everything or cover our short position.
[01:27:15.060 --> 01:27:16.260]   And that would make the losses even worse.
[01:27:16.260 --> 01:27:17.740]   So Wall Street is kind of ruthless.
[01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:19.900]   - So they can make money off of that whole thing.
[01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:20.740]   - Absolutely.
[01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:21.980]   - So they use the opportunity of valiant
[01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:23.740]   to try to destroy you.
[01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:24.580]   - Yes.
[01:27:24.580 --> 01:27:27.500]   - Reputation, financially, and then capitalizing.
[01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:28.340]   - Yes.
[01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:29.160]   - Make money off of that.
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:30.000]   - Yes.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.180]   - Well, that's a terrifying spot to be in.
[01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:34.220]   What was it like going through that?
[01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:35.500]   - That was pretty grim.
[01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:38.020]   It was, it's actually much worse than that
[01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:40.700]   because I had a lot of stuff going on personally as well.
[01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:42.740]   So, and these things tend to be correlated.
[01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:45.280]   The valiant mistake came at a time
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:47.620]   where I was contemplating my marriage.
[01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:51.020]   And I was also, you know,
[01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:53.260]   the problem with the hedge fund business
[01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:55.120]   is when you get to a certain scale,
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:57.100]   the CEO becomes like the chief marketing officer
[01:27:57.100 --> 01:27:57.940]   of the business.
[01:27:57.940 --> 01:28:00.300]   And I'm really an investor as opposed to a marketing guy.
[01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:01.900]   But when you have investors who give you
[01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:04.300]   a few hundred million dollars, they want to see you,
[01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:06.880]   you know, once a year, Bill, I'd love to see you for an hour.
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:08.820]   But if you've got a couple hundred of those,
[01:28:08.820 --> 01:28:11.380]   you find yourself on a plane to the Middle East,
[01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:14.300]   to Asia, flying around the country.
[01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:15.280]   This is pre-Zoom.
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:20.700]   And that takes you away from the investment process.
[01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:22.340]   You have to delegate more.
[01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:25.340]   That was a contributor to the valiant mistake.
[01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:28.020]   So, now we lose a ton of money on valiant.
[01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:29.700]   My ex-wife and I were, you know,
[01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:32.100]   talking about separating, getting divorced.
[01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:32.980]   I put that on hold.
[01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:34.380]   So I didn't want to make a decision
[01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:36.480]   in the middle of this crisis.
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:39.340]   And things just kept getting worse.
[01:28:39.340 --> 01:28:40.740]   We were also sued.
[01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:41.940]   When you lose a lot of money,
[01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:42.980]   we didn't get sued by our investors,
[01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:44.700]   but we got sued by a shareholder
[01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:47.740]   because when the stock price goes down, shareholders sue.
[01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:49.740]   We'd done nothing wrong other than make a big mistake.
[01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:52.580]   But, you know, so you have litigation.
[01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:54.620]   Your investors are taking their money out.
[01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:57.580]   I'm in the middle of a divorce.
[01:28:57.580 --> 01:28:59.580]   The divorce starts to proceed.
[01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:02.860]   My ex-wife's lawyers' expectations
[01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:05.260]   of what my net worth was was about three times
[01:29:05.260 --> 01:29:06.860]   what it actually was.
[01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:10.020]   And it was going lower, right in the middle of this.
[01:29:10.020 --> 01:29:12.420]   And I remember the lawyers saying,
[01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:16.460]   "Look, Bill, you know, we've estimated your net worth at X,
[01:29:16.460 --> 01:29:18.900]   but don't worry, we only want a third."
[01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:20.500]   But X was three X.
[01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:22.200]   So a third was a hundred percent.
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:26.480]   And then we had litigation.
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:30.420]   And actually never before publicly disclosed,
[01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:32.620]   and I'll share it with you now.
[01:29:32.620 --> 01:29:36.700]   We had a public company that owned
[01:29:36.700 --> 01:29:38.900]   about a third of our portfolio
[01:29:38.900 --> 01:29:41.620]   that was called our version of Berkshire Hathaway.
[01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:44.940]   I tried to learn from Mr. Buffett over time.
[01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:47.100]   And it was, so to speak, permanent capital.
[01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:48.380]   The beauty of, the problem with hedge funds
[01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:51.320]   is people can take their money out every quarter.
[01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:53.300]   What Buffett has is a company
[01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:54.460]   where people wanna take their money out,
[01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:56.580]   they sell the stock, but the money stays.
[01:29:56.580 --> 01:30:00.060]   So we set up a similar structure in October of 2014.
[01:30:00.060 --> 01:30:02.380]   And then a year later, Valiant happens.
[01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:04.700]   And then a year later, we're in the middle of the mess.
[01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:05.860]   And we're still in the mess.
[01:30:05.860 --> 01:30:09.700]   You know, like by kind of mid 2017,
[01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:12.100]   we've got litigation underway.
[01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:14.540]   And another activist investor,
[01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:17.180]   a firm called Elliott Associates,
[01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:20.140]   which is run by a guy named Paul Singer,
[01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:23.260]   took a big position in our public company
[01:30:23.260 --> 01:30:25.220]   that was the bulk of our capital.
[01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:27.860]   And they shorted all the stocks that we owned,
[01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:29.340]   and they went long the short,
[01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:32.140]   probably went long the short that we were short.
[01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:34.820]   And they were making a bet that we'd be forced to liquidate.
[01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:36.700]   And then they would make money on,
[01:30:36.700 --> 01:30:39.100]   you know, our public company was trading at a discount
[01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:40.060]   to what all the securities were worth.
[01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:42.500]   So they bought the public company,
[01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:44.260]   they shorted the securities.
[01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:46.540]   And then they, you know, came to see us
[01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:48.380]   and to try to, you know, be activists
[01:30:48.380 --> 01:30:50.300]   and force us to liquidate.
[01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:52.660]   And that's sort of-
[01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:54.180]   - Oh, wow.
[01:30:54.180 --> 01:30:55.180]   - So I thought this was gonna be-
[01:30:55.180 --> 01:30:56.300]   - Wow.
[01:30:56.300 --> 01:30:57.900]   - I envisioned an end
[01:30:57.900 --> 01:31:01.220]   where the divorce takes all of my resources,
[01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:04.100]   the permanent capital vehicle ends up getting liquidated,
[01:31:04.100 --> 01:31:07.580]   and another activist in my industry puts me out of business.
[01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:11.900]   And I had met Neri Oxman right around this time,
[01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:14.100]   and I had fallen completely in love with her.
[01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:17.380]   And I was envisioning a world where I was bankrupt,
[01:31:17.380 --> 01:31:20.460]   a judge found me guilty of, you know, whatever.
[01:31:20.460 --> 01:31:22.220]   You know, he sends me off to jail,
[01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:23.740]   or not that judge 'cause he was a civil judge,
[01:31:23.740 --> 01:31:26.980]   but another judge sues the SEC Department of Justice.
[01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:29.220]   And I find myself in this incredible mess.
[01:31:29.220 --> 01:31:32.100]   And I decided I didn't want things to end that way.
[01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:35.460]   So I did something I'd never done before.
[01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:37.300]   I talked all before about you don't borrow money,
[01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:38.540]   I borrowed money.
[01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:43.380]   And I borrowed $300 million from JP Morgan
[01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:44.820]   in the middle of this mess.
[01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:49.700]   And I give JP Morgan enormous credit in seeing through it.
[01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:54.020]   And also, you know, I had been a good client
[01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:54.860]   over a long period of time,
[01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:57.500]   and it's like, you know, it's a handshake bank,
[01:31:57.500 --> 01:31:59.140]   and they bet that I would succeed.
[01:31:59.140 --> 01:32:00.980]   And I took that money to buy enough stock
[01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:04.180]   in my public company that I could prevent an activist
[01:32:04.180 --> 01:32:07.020]   from taking over and effectively buy control
[01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:08.460]   of our little public company.
[01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:10.860]   And I got that done.
[01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:13.900]   And that I knew was the moment, the turning point.
[01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:16.020]   And I resolved my divorce.
[01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:17.420]   And divorces get easier to resolve
[01:32:17.420 --> 01:32:18.700]   when things are going badly.
[01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:19.700]   I was able to resolve that.
[01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:21.500]   We settled the litigation.
[01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:23.420]   I was buying blocks of our stock in the market.
[01:32:23.420 --> 01:32:25.060]   I remember a day I bought a big block of stock
[01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:26.260]   in the market.
[01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:28.180]   And I get a call from Gordon Singer,
[01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:29.540]   who is Paul Singer's son,
[01:32:29.540 --> 01:32:33.220]   who runs their London part of their business.
[01:32:33.220 --> 01:32:35.260]   He's like, "Bill, was that you buying that block?"
[01:32:35.260 --> 01:32:37.100]   I said, "Yes."
[01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:38.340]   And he's like, "Fuck."
[01:32:38.340 --> 01:32:39.380]   (laughing)
[01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:40.540]   - So he knew--
[01:32:40.540 --> 01:32:42.060]   - He knew that once I got that,
[01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:43.740]   they were not gonna be able to succeed,
[01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:44.780]   and they went away.
[01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:47.180]   And that was the bottom.
[01:32:47.180 --> 01:32:51.500]   And then I, we've had an incredible run since then.
[01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:53.300]   - And there you were able to protect your reputation
[01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:56.620]   from the valiant failure still?
[01:32:56.620 --> 01:32:58.500]   - I mean, you know, this is a business
[01:32:58.500 --> 01:32:59.740]   where you're gonna make some mistakes.
[01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:01.140]   It was a big one.
[01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:03.460]   It was very reputationally damaging.
[01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:05.660]   The press was a total disaster.
[01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:08.420]   But I'm not a quitter.
[01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:11.020]   And actually, the key moments for us,
[01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:14.060]   we had never taken our core investment principles
[01:33:14.060 --> 01:33:16.660]   and actually really written them down.
[01:33:16.660 --> 01:33:18.980]   Something we talked about at meetings,
[01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:21.820]   investor, you know, kind of our investment team meetings.
[01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:22.660]   I had a member of the team, I said,
[01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:26.260]   "Look, go find a big piece of granite and a chisel.
[01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:27.860]   "And let's take those core principles.
[01:33:27.860 --> 01:33:30.060]   "I want them like Moses's 10 commandments.
[01:33:30.060 --> 01:33:30.900]   "Okay, we're gonna chisel them,
[01:33:30.900 --> 01:33:32.460]   "then we're gonna put it up on the wall."
[01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:33.580]   And once we produced those,
[01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:34.820]   we put one on everyone's desk.
[01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:36.820]   I said, "Look, if we ever again veer
[01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:39.220]   "from the core principles, you know,
[01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:40.700]   "hit me with a baseball bat."
[01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:41.540]   - Yeah.
[01:33:41.540 --> 01:33:42.360]   - And that was the bottom.
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:43.460]   And ever since then, we've done,
[01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:45.180]   we've had the best six years in the history of the firm.
[01:33:45.180 --> 01:33:47.860]   - So refocus on the fundamentals.
[01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:50.500]   That's a hell of a story.
[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:51.340]   - Love helps.
[01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:53.180]   I literally met Neri at the absolute bottom.
[01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:55.820]   Our first date was September 7th of 2017.
[01:33:55.820 --> 01:33:57.200]   That was very close to the bottom.
[01:33:57.200 --> 01:33:59.060]   Actually, there's one other element to the story.
[01:33:59.060 --> 01:34:01.900]   So this went on for a few months after I met her.
[01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:05.020]   The other element is that one day I got a call from Neri.
[01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:06.780]   She's like, "Bill, guess what?"
[01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:07.780]   I'm like, "What?"
[01:34:07.780 --> 01:34:10.140]   "Brad Pitt is coming to the Media Lab.
[01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:12.100]   "He wants to see my work."
[01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:13.540]   I'm like, "That's beautiful, sweetheart.
[01:34:13.540 --> 01:34:16.180]   "I didn't know Brad Pitt was interested in your work."
[01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:19.780]   - As a man, that's a difficult phone call to take.
[01:34:19.780 --> 01:34:22.980]   - And apparently, he's really interested in architecture.
[01:34:22.980 --> 01:34:24.620]   I'm like, "Okay."
[01:34:24.620 --> 01:34:28.240]   Now, Neri and I, we would WhatsApp all day, every day.
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:29.740]   We'd talk throughout the day.
[01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:32.900]   Brad Pitt shows up at the Media Lab at 10 o'clock.
[01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:34.940]   I talked to her in the morning.
[01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:37.460]   I'd kinda text her to see how things are going.
[01:34:37.460 --> 01:34:38.580]   Don't hear back.
[01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:40.340]   And on WhatsApp, you can see
[01:34:40.340 --> 01:34:43.100]   whether the other person's read it or not.
[01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:44.420]   No response.
[01:34:44.420 --> 01:34:45.820]   Couple hours later, send her another text.
[01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:47.100]   No response.
[01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:48.700]   Six o'clock, no response.
[01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:49.960]   Eight o'clock, no response.
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:52.060]   10 o'clock, no response.
[01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:56.100]   And you know, she finally calls me at 10.30,
[01:34:56.100 --> 01:34:58.840]   tells me how great Brad Pitt is.
[01:34:58.840 --> 01:34:59.680]   So I had this scenario.
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:02.100]   Okay, a judge is gonna find me.
[01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:03.600]   We're gonna lose to the judge.
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:07.500]   All my assets will disappear.
[01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:08.860]   And then Brad Pitt's gonna take my girlfriend.
[01:35:08.860 --> 01:35:10.940]   - Yeah, Brad Pitt's your competition.
[01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:11.780]   This is great.
[01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:13.260]   - So it was like a moment.
[01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:15.380]   That was sort of the bottom.
[01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:17.100]   And then sort of the motivational thing.
[01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:18.500]   I didn't wanna lose to an activist.
[01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:21.520]   Didn't wanna lose my girl to some other guy, so.
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:23.580]   - Brad Pitt.
[01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:26.980]   And you emerged from all of that the winner on all fronts.
[01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:28.740]   - I'm a very fortunate guy.
[01:35:28.740 --> 01:35:30.020]   Very fortunate and lucky.
[01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:33.020]   - You talked about some of the technical aspects of that,
[01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:35.600]   but psychologically, just, is there a,
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:39.300]   like, what are you doing at night by yourself?
[01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:40.140]   - That was a hard time.
[01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:42.940]   Hard time 'cause I was separated from my wife and my kids.
[01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:47.160]   I was living in, you know, not the greatest apartment.
[01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:50.680]   You know, I had a beautiful home.
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:53.160]   And so I had to go find like a bachelor place.
[01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:56.440]   And I was, I didn't wanna be away from my kids.
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:59.000]   I moved like 10 blocks away and I wasn't seeing them
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:35:59.840]   and they didn't like it.
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:02.680]   So I ended up buying an apartment I didn't like
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:03.960]   in the same building as my kids,
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:06.800]   like with a different entrance so I could be near them.
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:07.800]   But I was home alone.
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:08.880]   I got a dog.
[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:12.000]   That was a Babar.
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.760]   We call him Babar, not the elephant.
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:16.160]   He's a black Labradoodle.
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:17.000]   - Nice.
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.720]   - He was supposed to be a mini, but he's not as mini.
[01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:21.640]   (Dave laughs)
[01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:24.800]   But I got him at six weeks old and he would keep me company.
[01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:27.320]   And I started meditating, actually.
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:30.940]   And a friend recommended TM.
[01:36:30.940 --> 01:36:33.560]   And I would meditate 20 minutes in the morning,
[01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:34.800]   20 minutes in the evening.
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:38.840]   And I also, big believer in exercise and weightlifting.
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:39.780]   And I play tennis.
[01:36:39.780 --> 01:36:43.920]   And I had been, this is not my first, you know,
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:46.600]   proximity to disaster.
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:51.600]   I had another moment in my career, like, you know, 2002.
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:54.880]   And I learned this method for dealing with
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:55.720]   these kinds of moments,
[01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:59.080]   which is you just make a little progress every day.
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:02.440]   So today I'm gonna wake up, I'm gonna make progress.
[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:03.960]   You know, I'll make progress on the litigation,
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:05.680]   make progress on the portfolio.
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:08.000]   I'll make progress with my life.
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:12.240]   And progress compounds, a bit like money compounds.
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:14.760]   You don't see a lot of progress in the first few weeks,
[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:17.040]   but like 30 days in, like, oh, okay.
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:18.720]   You know, you can't look up at the mountaintop
[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:21.880]   where you used to be, 'cause then you'll give up, right?
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:24.660]   But you just, okay, just make step by step by step.
[01:37:24.660 --> 01:37:26.700]   And then 90 days in, you're like,
[01:37:26.700 --> 01:37:28.560]   okay, I was way down there.
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:30.760]   Okay, I'm not, okay, I don't look up.
[01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:34.480]   Just keep making, you know, progress, progress, progress.
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:36.240]   And progress really does compound.
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:37.720]   And one day you wake up and like, wow,
[01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:39.420]   it's amazing how far I've come.
[01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:44.000]   And if you look at a chart of Pershing Square, our company,
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.760]   you can see the absolute bottom.
[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:49.200]   You can see where we were, you can see the drop,
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:51.040]   and you can see where we are now.
[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:54.240]   And that huge drop that felt like
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:56.680]   a complete, unbelievable disaster
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:38:00.040]   looks like a little bump on the curve.
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:03.200]   And it really gives you perspective on these things.
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:04.900]   You just have to power through.
[01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:07.200]   And I think the key is, you know,
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:08.480]   I've always been fortunate,
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:11.520]   like, from a mental health point of view.
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:15.000]   And, you know, nutrition, sleep, exercise,
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.920]   and a little progress every day, you know, that's it.
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:19.520]   And, you know, good friends and family.
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:20.960]   You know, I had, you know,
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:24.360]   go take a walk with a friend every night,
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:26.920]   you know, and a sister who loves me,
[01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:28.140]   and parents who were supportive.
[01:38:28.140 --> 01:38:29.320]   But they were, you know,
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:32.280]   they were all worried about their son, their brother.
[01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:34.520]   You know, it was a moment.
[01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:36.440]   And also, by the way, the other thing to think about
[01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:40.460]   is when you recover from something like this,
[01:38:40.460 --> 01:38:43.940]   you really appreciate it, you know?
[01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:48.340]   And also the, you know, as much as the media loves,
[01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:51.360]   okay, when some successful person falls.
[01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:53.460]   They love writing the story of success.
[01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:55.480]   They love even more the story of failure.
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:56.680]   But when you recover from that,
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:59.560]   it's kind of like the American story, right?
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:02.640]   America, you know, you think of the great entrepreneurs
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:04.900]   and how many failures they had before they succeeded.
[01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:07.320]   You know, how many rocket launches, you know,
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:10.740]   did SpaceX have explode on the pad, right?
[01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:11.780]   And then you look at success.
[01:39:11.780 --> 01:39:14.180]   I mean, that's why Musk is so admired.
[01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:15.220]   - You mentioned Herbalife.
[01:39:15.220 --> 01:39:17.860]   Can you take me through the saga of that?
[01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:21.560]   It's historic.
[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:27.460]   - So we at Pershing Square shorted very few stocks.
[01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:29.620]   And the reason for that is short selling
[01:39:29.620 --> 01:39:31.820]   is just inherently treacherous.
[01:39:31.820 --> 01:39:35.180]   So if you buy a stock, it's called going long, right?
[01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:36.680]   You're buying something.
[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:38.400]   Your worst case scenario is you lose your whole investment.
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:39.240]   You buy a stock for a hundred,
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:41.040]   it goes to zero, you lose a hundred dollars, right?
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:41.880]   Per share.
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:43.160]   You buy one share, you lose a hundred.
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:44.960]   You short a stock at a hundred.
[01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:48.480]   What it means is you borrow the security from someone else.
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:50.440]   The analogy I gave that made it easy
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:52.080]   for people to understand.
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:53.840]   It's a bit like you think, you know,
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:56.240]   silver coins are gonna go down in value.
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:57.960]   And you have a friend who's got a whole pile
[01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:02.800]   of these 1880 silver US dollars.
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:03.640]   And you think they're gonna go down in value.
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:06.940]   You say, "Hey, can I borrow 10 of those dollars from you?"
[01:40:06.940 --> 01:40:08.820]   He's like, "Sure, but what are you gonna pay me to borrow?"
[01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:13.820]   I'll pay you interest on the value of the dollars today.
[01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:16.180]   So you borrow the dollars
[01:40:16.180 --> 01:40:18.460]   that are worth a hundred dollars each today.
[01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:20.500]   You pay them interest while you're borrowing them.
[01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:22.220]   And then you go sell them in the market for a hundred dollars
[01:40:22.220 --> 01:40:23.620]   that's what they're worth.
[01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:26.400]   And then they go down in price to 50.
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:29.500]   You go back in, you buy the silver dollars back at $50
[01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:30.540]   and you give them back to your friend.
[01:40:30.540 --> 01:40:31.780]   Your friend is fine.
[01:40:31.780 --> 01:40:33.880]   You borrowed 10, you gave him the 10 back
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:35.020]   and he got interest in the meantime.
[01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:37.960]   He's happy, he made money on his coin collection.
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:40.200]   You however made $50 times the 10 coins.
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:42.680]   You made 500 bucks, that's pretty good.
[01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:45.880]   The problem with that is, what if you sell them
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:48.000]   and they go from a hundred to a thousand?
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000]   Now you're gonna have to go buy them back
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.840]   and you're gonna pay, you know, whatever,
[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:55.180]   $10,000 to buy back coins, you know,
[01:40:55.180 --> 01:40:59.040]   that you sold for 500, you're gonna lose $9,500.
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:00.940]   And there's no limit, right?
[01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:02.420]   To how high a stock price can go.
[01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:04.780]   Companies go to $3 trillion in value, right?
[01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:06.860]   Tesla, a lot of people shorted Tesla saying,
[01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:08.180]   "Oh, it's overvalued.
[01:41:08.180 --> 01:41:11.520]   He's never gonna be able to make a successful electric car."
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:15.040]   Well, I'm sure there are people went bankrupt shorting Tesla.
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:16.660]   That's why we didn't short stocks.
[01:41:16.660 --> 01:41:20.640]   But I was presented with this actually reporter
[01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:24.100]   that covered the other short investment we made early
[01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:26.300]   in the career, a company called MBIA came to me and said,
[01:41:26.300 --> 01:41:27.500]   "Bill, I found this incredible company.
[01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:28.380]   You gotta take a look at it.
[01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:30.740]   It's a total fraud and they're scamming poor people."
[01:41:30.740 --> 01:41:33.500]   - And we should say that MBIA was a very successful short.
[01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:34.340]   - It was.
[01:41:34.340 --> 01:41:37.020]   Big part of it was that we used a different kind
[01:41:37.020 --> 01:41:40.620]   of instrument to short it, where we reversed that sort of,
[01:41:40.620 --> 01:41:43.100]   we made the investment asymmetric in our favor,
[01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:44.700]   meaning put up a small amount of money.
[01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:46.700]   If it works, we make a fortune.
[01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:48.900]   Whereas short selling is you kind of sell something
[01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:51.140]   and you have to buy it back at a higher price.
[01:41:51.140 --> 01:41:54.660]   Herbalife didn't have the, what's called credit default swaps
[01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:56.180]   that you could purchase.
[01:41:56.180 --> 01:41:57.220]   Not a big enough company.
[01:41:57.220 --> 01:41:58.460]   It didn't have enough debt outstanding
[01:41:58.460 --> 01:41:59.620]   to be able to implement it.
[01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:03.100]   You had to short the stock in order to make it a successful,
[01:42:03.100 --> 01:42:04.780]   to bet against the company.
[01:42:04.780 --> 01:42:06.460]   And the more work I did in the company, the more I was like,
[01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:08.740]   "Oh my God, this thing's an incredible scam."
[01:42:08.740 --> 01:42:12.180]   You know, that they purport to sell weight loss shakes.
[01:42:12.180 --> 01:42:13.860]   But in reality, they're selling, you know,
[01:42:13.860 --> 01:42:15.260]   kind of a fake business plan.
[01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:17.980]   And the people that adopt it lose money
[01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:20.460]   and they go after poor people.
[01:42:20.460 --> 01:42:22.420]   They go after actually in many cases,
[01:42:22.420 --> 01:42:25.900]   undocumented immigrants who were pitched
[01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:28.860]   on the American dream opportunity.
[01:42:28.860 --> 01:42:30.780]   And because they have few other options,
[01:42:30.780 --> 01:42:33.660]   because they can't get legal employment,
[01:42:33.660 --> 01:42:35.300]   they become Herbalife distributors.
[01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:37.340]   And it's a business where you,
[01:42:37.340 --> 01:42:39.980]   so-called multi-level marketing or pyramid, you know,
[01:42:39.980 --> 01:42:42.860]   multi-level marketing is sort of the name
[01:42:42.860 --> 01:42:45.260]   for a legitimate company like this.
[01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:47.340]   Or it's a pyramid scheme where basically your sales
[01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:49.140]   are really only coming from people who are,
[01:42:49.140 --> 01:42:50.420]   you convince them to buy the product
[01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:51.980]   by getting them into the business.
[01:42:51.980 --> 01:42:54.060]   That's precisely what this company is.
[01:42:54.060 --> 01:42:57.460]   And like, okay, shorting a pyramid scheme seems like,
[01:42:57.460 --> 01:42:59.180]   one, we'll make a bunch of money,
[01:42:59.180 --> 01:43:02.220]   but, you know, two, the world will be behind us
[01:43:02.220 --> 01:43:03.780]   because they're harming poor people.
[01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:05.180]   You know, regulators will get interested
[01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:06.140]   in a company like this.
[01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:07.020]   And we thought, you know,
[01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:09.380]   the FTC is gonna shut this thing down.
[01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:10.820]   And we did a ton of work.
[01:43:10.820 --> 01:43:14.420]   And I gave this sort of epic presentation,
[01:43:14.420 --> 01:43:16.140]   laying out all the facts.
[01:43:16.140 --> 01:43:19.860]   Stock got completely crushed and we were on our way.
[01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:21.980]   And the government actually got interested early on,
[01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:23.580]   launched an investigation pretty early,
[01:43:23.580 --> 01:43:25.700]   SEC and other otherwise.
[01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:31.220]   But then a guy named Carl Icahn showed up
[01:43:31.220 --> 01:43:34.860]   and we have a little bit of a backstory,
[01:43:34.860 --> 01:43:36.420]   but his motivations here were not really
[01:43:36.420 --> 01:43:38.580]   principally driven by thinking Herbalife was a good company.
[01:43:38.580 --> 01:43:42.540]   He thought it was a good way to hurt me.
[01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:44.780]   So he basically bought a bunch of stock
[01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:46.220]   and said it was a really great company.
[01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:48.020]   And, you know, Carl, at least at the time,
[01:43:48.020 --> 01:43:49.500]   threw his weight around a bit.
[01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:52.900]   I was a credible investor, had a lot of resources.
[01:43:52.900 --> 01:43:56.220]   And that began the saga.
[01:43:56.220 --> 01:43:58.500]   - So he was, we should say,
[01:43:58.500 --> 01:44:03.100]   a legendary investor himself.
[01:44:03.100 --> 01:44:05.660]   - I'd say legendary in a sense, yes, for sure.
[01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:06.940]   An iconic.
[01:44:06.940 --> 01:44:07.780]   - Iconic.
[01:44:07.780 --> 01:44:08.620]   - Carl Icahn.
[01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:09.940]   - Oh, that's very well done.
[01:44:09.940 --> 01:44:11.860]   - So definitely a iconic investor.
[01:44:11.860 --> 01:44:15.100]   - So what was the backstory between the two of you?
[01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:17.900]   - So I mentioned that I had another period of time
[01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:19.860]   where significant business challenges.
[01:44:19.860 --> 01:44:21.860]   This was my first fund called Gotham Partners.
[01:44:21.860 --> 01:44:23.740]   And we had a court stop a transaction
[01:44:23.740 --> 01:44:27.220]   between a private company we owned and a public company.
[01:44:27.220 --> 01:44:28.780]   It's another long story.
[01:44:28.780 --> 01:44:30.380]   If you want to go there.
[01:44:30.380 --> 01:44:32.060]   - I would love to hear it as well.
[01:44:32.060 --> 01:44:34.820]   - But it was really my deciding to wind up my former fund.
[01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:36.620]   And we owned a big stake
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:38.540]   in a company called Hallwood Realty Partners,
[01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:40.780]   which was a company that owned real estate assets.
[01:44:40.780 --> 01:44:42.780]   It was worth a lot more than where it was trading,
[01:44:42.780 --> 01:44:45.860]   but it needed an activist to really unlock the value.
[01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:48.780]   And we were, in fact, going out of business
[01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:51.380]   and didn't have the time or the resources to pursue it.
[01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:53.140]   So I sold it to Carl Icahn.
[01:44:53.140 --> 01:44:56.340]   But, and I sold it to him at a premium
[01:44:56.340 --> 01:44:57.260]   to where the stock was trading.
[01:44:57.260 --> 01:44:59.860]   I think the stock was like 66, I sold to him for 80,
[01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:02.100]   but it was worth about 150.
[01:45:02.100 --> 01:45:05.140]   And I said, look, and part of the deal was,
[01:45:05.140 --> 01:45:08.020]   Carl's like, look, I'll give you schmuck insurance.
[01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:10.300]   I'll make sure you don't look bad.
[01:45:10.300 --> 01:45:13.100]   And I had another deal at a higher price
[01:45:13.100 --> 01:45:14.740]   without schmuck insurance.
[01:45:14.740 --> 01:45:16.020]   But I deal with Carl at a lower price
[01:45:16.020 --> 01:45:16.860]   with schmuck insurance.
[01:45:16.860 --> 01:45:17.940]   And the way the schmuck insurance went,
[01:45:17.940 --> 01:45:20.460]   he said, look, Bill, if I sell the stock
[01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:24.420]   in the next three years, you know, for a higher price,
[01:45:24.420 --> 01:45:26.100]   I'll give you 50% of my profit.
[01:45:26.100 --> 01:45:29.660]   Well, that's a pretty good deal.
[01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:31.140]   So we made that deal.
[01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:33.020]   And 'cause I was dealing with Carl Icahn,
[01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:36.860]   who had a reputation for, you know, being difficult.
[01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:38.820]   I was, you know, very focused on the agreement.
[01:45:38.820 --> 01:45:41.940]   And we didn't want him to be able to be cute.
[01:45:41.940 --> 01:45:44.860]   So the agreement said, if we sell,
[01:45:44.860 --> 01:45:48.860]   if he sells or otherwise transfers his shares,
[01:45:48.860 --> 01:45:49.900]   we came up with a definition,
[01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:51.820]   include every version of sale, okay?
[01:45:51.820 --> 01:45:53.180]   'Cause you know, it's Carl.
[01:45:53.180 --> 01:45:57.420]   Well, he then buys the stake
[01:45:57.420 --> 01:45:59.660]   and then makes a bid for the company.
[01:45:59.660 --> 01:46:02.140]   And, you know, plan is for him to get the company.
[01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:04.020]   And he bids like 120 a share.
[01:46:04.020 --> 01:46:07.420]   And the company hires Morgan Stanley to sell itself.
[01:46:07.420 --> 01:46:10.500]   And he raises a bid to 125 and the 130,
[01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:13.140]   eventually gets sold, I don't remember the exact price.
[01:46:13.140 --> 01:46:15.180]   Let's say $145 a share.
[01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:18.700]   And Carl's not the winning bidder.
[01:46:18.700 --> 01:46:23.700]   And he sells his stock or he loses or transfers his shares
[01:46:23.700 --> 01:46:25.580]   for $145 a share.
[01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:27.660]   So he owes, actually our investors,
[01:46:27.660 --> 01:46:31.100]   the difference between 145 and 80 times 50%.
[01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:31.940]   And I had like, you know,
[01:46:31.940 --> 01:46:34.900]   lawyers never like you to put like a arithmetic example.
[01:46:34.900 --> 01:46:36.660]   I put like a formula, you know,
[01:46:36.660 --> 01:46:39.260]   like out of a math book in the document.
[01:46:39.260 --> 01:46:40.180]   So there can be no confusion.
[01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:42.940]   There's only an eight page, really simple agreement.
[01:46:42.940 --> 01:46:45.420]   So the deal closes and he's supposed to pay us
[01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:47.980]   in two business days or three business days.
[01:46:47.980 --> 01:46:50.100]   I wait a few business days, no money comes in.
[01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:50.940]   I call Carl.
[01:46:50.940 --> 01:46:55.740]   I'm like, Carl, congratulations on the Hollywood Realty.
[01:46:55.740 --> 01:46:57.020]   Thanks, Bill.
[01:46:57.020 --> 01:46:58.260]   I said, Carl, I just wanna remind you.
[01:46:58.260 --> 01:47:01.500]   I know it's been a few years, but you know,
[01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:02.500]   we have this agreement.
[01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:04.140]   Remember the schmuck insurance?
[01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:05.380]   He's like, yeah.
[01:47:05.380 --> 01:47:08.300]   I said, well, you owe us our schmuck insurance.
[01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:09.380]   He said, what do you mean?
[01:47:09.380 --> 01:47:10.860]   I didn't sell my shares.
[01:47:10.860 --> 01:47:14.260]   I said, do you still have the shares?
[01:47:14.260 --> 01:47:15.340]   He says, no.
[01:47:15.340 --> 01:47:16.900]   I said, what happened to them?
[01:47:16.900 --> 01:47:21.420]   Well, the company did a merger for cash
[01:47:21.420 --> 01:47:24.380]   and they took away my shares, but I didn't sell them.
[01:47:24.380 --> 01:47:26.980]   You understand what happened.
[01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:29.020]   So I had, I said, Carl, I'm gonna have to sue you.
[01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:30.260]   He said, sue me.
[01:47:30.260 --> 01:47:32.500]   I'm gonna sue you, he says.
[01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:35.460]   So I sued him.
[01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:38.660]   And the legal system in America can take some time.
[01:47:38.660 --> 01:47:41.340]   And what he would do is we sued and then we won
[01:47:41.340 --> 01:47:43.460]   in the whatever, New York Supreme Court.
[01:47:43.460 --> 01:47:47.060]   And then he appealed.
[01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:49.900]   And you can appeal like six months after the case.
[01:47:49.900 --> 01:47:53.660]   We waited to the 179th day and then he would appeal.
[01:47:53.660 --> 01:47:56.380]   And then we fought it at the next level.
[01:47:56.380 --> 01:47:57.220]   And then he would appeal.
[01:47:57.220 --> 01:47:58.340]   And he appealed all the way to the Supreme Court.
[01:47:58.340 --> 01:48:00.260]   Of course, the Supreme Court wouldn't take the case.
[01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:01.300]   It took years.
[01:48:01.300 --> 01:48:02.500]   Now we had, as part of our agreement,
[01:48:02.500 --> 01:48:05.580]   we got 9% interest on the money that he owed us.
[01:48:05.580 --> 01:48:08.180]   So I viewed it as my Carl Icahn money market account
[01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:10.260]   with a much higher interest rate.
[01:48:10.260 --> 01:48:12.380]   And eventually I won.
[01:48:12.380 --> 01:48:13.460]   What was the amount?
[01:48:13.460 --> 01:48:14.500]   Just tiny.
[01:48:14.500 --> 01:48:16.380]   Now, it was material to my investors.
[01:48:16.380 --> 01:48:19.580]   So my first fund, I wound it down.
[01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:22.580]   But I wanted to maximize everything for my investors.
[01:48:22.580 --> 01:48:24.780]   These are the people who backed me at 26 years old.
[01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:25.620]   I was right out of business school.
[01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:27.220]   I had no experience.
[01:48:27.220 --> 01:48:28.060]   And they supported me.
[01:48:28.060 --> 01:48:30.980]   So I'm gonna go to the end of the earth for them.
[01:48:30.980 --> 01:48:33.740]   And 4.5 million relative to our fund at the end
[01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:35.100]   was maybe 400 million.
[01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:36.380]   So it wasn't a huge number.
[01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:38.820]   But it was a big percentage of what was left
[01:48:38.820 --> 01:48:40.540]   after I sold all our liquid security.
[01:48:40.540 --> 01:48:42.180]   So I was fighting for it.
[01:48:42.180 --> 01:48:43.620]   So we got 4.5 million plus interest
[01:48:43.620 --> 01:48:44.940]   for eight years or something.
[01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:47.020]   That's how long the litigation took.
[01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:48.220]   So we got about double.
[01:48:48.220 --> 01:48:51.180]   So he owed me $9 million.
[01:48:51.180 --> 01:48:52.300]   Which to Carl Icahn,
[01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:55.340]   who had probably a $20 billion net worth at the time,
[01:48:55.340 --> 01:48:56.700]   this was nothing.
[01:48:56.700 --> 01:48:58.540]   But to me, it was like, okay, this is my investor's money.
[01:48:58.540 --> 01:48:59.660]   I'm gonna get it back.
[01:48:59.660 --> 01:49:03.540]   And so, you know, eventually we won.
[01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:05.500]   Eventually he paid.
[01:49:06.420 --> 01:49:07.820]   And then he called me.
[01:49:07.820 --> 01:49:10.100]   He said, Bill, congratulations.
[01:49:10.100 --> 01:49:12.500]   Now we can be friends.
[01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:15.820]   And we can do some investing together.
[01:49:15.820 --> 01:49:18.220]   I'm like, Carl, fuck you.
[01:49:18.220 --> 01:49:19.500]   - You actually said fuck you?
[01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:20.340]   - Yes.
[01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:21.820]   And I'm not that kind of person generally.
[01:49:21.820 --> 01:49:26.700]   But, you know, he made eight years to pay me.
[01:49:26.700 --> 01:49:27.660]   Not me, even me.
[01:49:27.660 --> 01:49:29.180]   My investor's money they owed.
[01:49:29.180 --> 01:49:30.140]   And so I, yeah.
[01:49:30.140 --> 01:49:33.540]   So he probably didn't like that.
[01:49:33.540 --> 01:49:35.940]   So he kind of hung around in the weeds,
[01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:37.300]   waiting for an opportunity.
[01:49:37.300 --> 01:49:39.060]   And then from there, I, you know, started purging.
[01:49:39.060 --> 01:49:40.580]   We had a kind of straight line up.
[01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:42.300]   You know, we were up in the first 12 years.
[01:49:42.300 --> 01:49:43.940]   We could do nothing wrong.
[01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:48.940]   Then Valiant, Herbalife, right?
[01:49:48.940 --> 01:49:51.900]   He sees an opportunity and he buys the stock.
[01:49:51.900 --> 01:49:55.100]   He figures he's gonna run me off the road.
[01:49:55.100 --> 01:49:56.900]   And so that was the beginning of that.
[01:49:56.900 --> 01:49:58.660]   And kind of the moment,
[01:49:58.660 --> 01:50:01.140]   and I think it's the, I'm told by CNBC,
[01:50:01.140 --> 01:50:03.780]   it's the most watched segment
[01:50:03.780 --> 01:50:05.340]   in business television history.
[01:50:05.340 --> 01:50:07.540]   They're interviewing me about
[01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:09.740]   the Herbalife investment on CNBC.
[01:50:09.740 --> 01:50:12.580]   And then Carl Icahn calls into the show.
[01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:15.620]   And we have kind of a interesting conversation
[01:50:15.620 --> 01:50:17.180]   where he calls me all kinds of names and stuff.
[01:50:17.180 --> 01:50:18.540]   So it was a moment.
[01:50:18.540 --> 01:50:20.260]   It was a moment in my life.
[01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:21.540]   - It wasn't public information
[01:50:21.540 --> 01:50:24.020]   that he was long on Herbalife?
[01:50:24.020 --> 01:50:26.380]   - He didn't yet disclose he had a stake.
[01:50:26.380 --> 01:50:27.220]   - Yeah.
[01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:28.580]   - But he was just telling me how stupid I was
[01:50:28.580 --> 01:50:30.180]   to be short this company.
[01:50:30.180 --> 01:50:33.580]   - So for him it wasn't about the fundamentals of the company
[01:50:33.580 --> 01:50:36.100]   it was about, it was just personal.
[01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:37.620]   - 100%.
[01:50:37.620 --> 01:50:41.220]   - Is there part of you that regrets saying fuck you
[01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:44.460]   on that phone call to Carl Icahn?
[01:50:44.460 --> 01:50:45.300]   - No.
[01:50:45.300 --> 01:50:47.620]   (laughing)
[01:50:47.620 --> 01:50:50.580]   I generally have no regrets
[01:50:50.580 --> 01:50:53.220]   because I'm very happy with where I am now.
[01:50:53.220 --> 01:50:57.820]   And I feel like it's a bit like you step on the butterfly
[01:50:57.820 --> 01:50:59.180]   in the forest and the world changes
[01:50:59.180 --> 01:51:02.740]   because every action has a reaction.
[01:51:02.740 --> 01:51:04.180]   You know, if you're happy with who you are,
[01:51:04.180 --> 01:51:05.420]   where you are in life,
[01:51:05.420 --> 01:51:07.020]   every decision you've made good or bad
[01:51:07.020 --> 01:51:07.900]   over the course of your life
[01:51:07.900 --> 01:51:09.020]   got you to precisely where you are.
[01:51:09.020 --> 01:51:10.700]   I wouldn't change anything.
[01:51:10.700 --> 01:51:12.580]   - He said you lost money on Herbalife.
[01:51:12.580 --> 01:51:16.060]   So what, so he did the long-term battle.
[01:51:16.060 --> 01:51:19.620]   - What he did is he got on the board of the company
[01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:21.460]   and used the company's financial resources
[01:51:21.460 --> 01:51:26.460]   plus his stake in the business to squeeze us.
[01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:28.180]   And a squeeze in short selling
[01:51:28.180 --> 01:51:31.340]   is where you restrict the supply of the securities.
[01:51:31.340 --> 01:51:33.700]   So that there's a scarcity.
[01:51:33.700 --> 01:51:35.660]   And then you encourage people to buy the stock
[01:51:35.660 --> 01:51:37.340]   and you drive the stock up.
[01:51:37.340 --> 01:51:38.180]   And as I explained before,
[01:51:38.180 --> 01:51:40.980]   you're short those coins at 10, they go to 100.
[01:51:40.980 --> 01:51:43.220]   You can lose a theoretically an unlimited amount of money.
[01:51:43.220 --> 01:51:45.060]   And that's scary.
[01:51:45.060 --> 01:51:47.660]   That's why we don't short stocks.
[01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:50.060]   That's why I didn't short stocks before this.
[01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:51.460]   But this was, unfortunately,
[01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:53.060]   I had to have the personal lesson.
[01:51:53.140 --> 01:51:55.300]   - So how much was for him personal
[01:51:55.300 --> 01:51:59.420]   versus part of sort of the game of investing?
[01:51:59.420 --> 01:52:01.660]   - Well, he thought he could make money doing this.
[01:52:01.660 --> 01:52:03.540]   He wouldn't have done it if he did otherwise.
[01:52:03.540 --> 01:52:05.500]   He thought his bully pulpit,
[01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:07.140]   his ability to create a short squeeze,
[01:52:07.140 --> 01:52:08.540]   his control over the company
[01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:11.820]   would enable him to achieve this.
[01:52:11.820 --> 01:52:14.060]   And he made a billion, we lost a billion.
[01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:16.460]   - So you think it was a financial decision, not a personal?
[01:52:16.460 --> 01:52:18.660]   - It was a personal decision to pursue it,
[01:52:18.660 --> 01:52:19.900]   but he was waiting for an opportunity
[01:52:19.900 --> 01:52:21.140]   where he can make money at our expense.
[01:52:21.140 --> 01:52:23.380]   And it was kind of a brilliant opportunity for him.
[01:52:23.380 --> 01:52:25.580]   Now the irony is, well, first of all,
[01:52:25.580 --> 01:52:28.140]   the FTC found a few interesting facts.
[01:52:28.140 --> 01:52:30.620]   So one, the government launched an investigation.
[01:52:30.620 --> 01:52:32.100]   They ended up settling with the company
[01:52:32.100 --> 01:52:35.260]   and the company paid $220 million in fines.
[01:52:35.260 --> 01:52:39.860]   I met a professor from Berkeley a couple of years ago
[01:52:39.860 --> 01:52:43.060]   who told me that he had been hired by the government
[01:52:43.060 --> 01:52:45.140]   as their expert on Herbalife.
[01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:46.780]   And he got access to all their data,
[01:52:46.780 --> 01:52:49.140]   was able to prove that they're a pyramid scheme.
[01:52:49.140 --> 01:52:52.100]   But the government ultimately settled with Carl
[01:52:52.100 --> 01:52:55.460]   'cause they were afraid they could possibly lose in court.
[01:52:55.460 --> 01:52:56.700]   So they settled with him.
[01:52:56.700 --> 01:52:59.060]   But if you look at the stock,
[01:52:59.060 --> 01:53:01.180]   if we'd been able to stay short the entire time,
[01:53:01.180 --> 01:53:02.660]   we would have made a bunch of money
[01:53:02.660 --> 01:53:04.740]   'cause the stock had a $6 billion market cap
[01:53:04.740 --> 01:53:07.780]   and we shorted it today, it's probably a billion,
[01:53:07.780 --> 01:53:08.820]   billion and a half.
[01:53:08.820 --> 01:53:10.260]   - So you left the short position
[01:53:10.260 --> 01:53:11.940]   or whatever that's called, closed.
[01:53:11.940 --> 01:53:13.940]   - Covered, closed it out.
[01:53:13.940 --> 01:53:16.900]   When we sold Valiant, we covered Herbalife,
[01:53:16.900 --> 01:53:18.980]   that was the resetting moment for the firm
[01:53:18.980 --> 01:53:21.500]   'cause it would just psychologically...
[01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:23.380]   And the beauty of investing
[01:53:23.380 --> 01:53:25.700]   is you don't need to make it back the way you lost it.
[01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:27.620]   You can just take your loss.
[01:53:27.620 --> 01:53:28.780]   By the way, losses are valuable
[01:53:28.780 --> 01:53:31.540]   and that the government allows you to take a tax loss
[01:53:31.540 --> 01:53:32.820]   and that can shelter other gains.
[01:53:32.820 --> 01:53:35.220]   And we just refocused.
[01:53:35.220 --> 01:53:38.420]   - Can you say one thing you really like about Carl Icahn
[01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:40.820]   and one thing you really don't like about him?
[01:53:40.820 --> 01:53:41.660]   - Sure.
[01:53:41.660 --> 01:53:44.300]   So he's a very charming guy.
[01:53:44.300 --> 01:53:45.700]   So in the midst of all this,
[01:53:47.340 --> 01:53:49.940]   the Hollywood one, he took me out for dinner
[01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:51.380]   to his favorite Italian restaurant.
[01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:52.220]   - Really?
[01:53:52.220 --> 01:53:53.060]   - Yeah.
[01:53:53.060 --> 01:53:54.020]   We were in the middle of the litigation
[01:53:54.020 --> 01:53:55.500]   to see if he could resolve it.
[01:53:55.500 --> 01:53:57.900]   And he offered 10 million to my favorite charity.
[01:53:57.900 --> 01:54:01.020]   The problem was that it wasn't my money,
[01:54:01.020 --> 01:54:01.980]   it was my investor's money.
[01:54:01.980 --> 01:54:04.660]   So I couldn't settle with him on that basis.
[01:54:04.660 --> 01:54:10.060]   But I had the chance to spend real time with him at dinner.
[01:54:10.060 --> 01:54:13.940]   He's funny, he's charismatic, he's got incredible stories.
[01:54:15.220 --> 01:54:17.300]   And actually I made peace with him over time.
[01:54:17.300 --> 01:54:19.980]   We had a little hug out on CNBC,
[01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:22.580]   even had him to my house, believe it or not.
[01:54:22.580 --> 01:54:25.620]   I hosted something called the Finance Cup,
[01:54:25.620 --> 01:54:26.620]   which is a tennis tournament
[01:54:26.620 --> 01:54:30.300]   between people in finance in Europe and the US.
[01:54:30.300 --> 01:54:32.660]   And we had the event at my house
[01:54:32.660 --> 01:54:35.220]   and one guy thought to invite Carl Icahn.
[01:54:35.220 --> 01:54:37.820]   And so we had Carl Icahn there to present awards.
[01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:40.700]   And again, I have to say, I kind of liked the guy.
[01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:43.020]   (laughing)
[01:54:43.020 --> 01:54:46.300]   But I didn't like him much during this.
[01:54:46.300 --> 01:54:49.460]   - Is there, because at least from the outsider perspective,
[01:54:49.460 --> 01:54:52.060]   there's a bit of a personal vengeance here
[01:54:52.060 --> 01:54:55.460]   or anger can build up.
[01:54:55.460 --> 01:54:57.500]   Do you ever worry the personal attacks
[01:54:57.500 --> 01:55:01.300]   between powerful investors can cloud your judgment?
[01:55:01.300 --> 01:55:03.940]   What is the right financial decision?
[01:55:03.940 --> 01:55:04.780]   - I think it's possible.
[01:55:04.780 --> 01:55:07.140]   But again, I try to be extremely economically rational.
[01:55:07.140 --> 01:55:10.940]   And actually the last seven years been quite peaceful.
[01:55:10.940 --> 01:55:13.540]   I really have not been an activist
[01:55:13.540 --> 01:55:17.900]   in the old form for many years.
[01:55:17.900 --> 01:55:21.060]   And the vast majority of even our activist investments
[01:55:21.060 --> 01:55:25.220]   historically were very polite, respectful cases.
[01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:27.940]   The press of course, focuses on the more interesting ones.
[01:55:27.940 --> 01:55:30.820]   Like Chipotle was one of the best investments we ever made.
[01:55:30.820 --> 01:55:34.900]   We got four of eight board seats
[01:55:34.900 --> 01:55:37.020]   and we worked with management and it was a great outcome.
[01:55:37.020 --> 01:55:39.100]   I don't think there's ever been a story about it.
[01:55:39.100 --> 01:55:41.540]   And the stock's up almost 10 times
[01:55:41.540 --> 01:55:44.860]   from the time we hired Brian Nichols, CEO.
[01:55:44.860 --> 01:55:47.820]   But it's not interesting because there was no battle.
[01:55:47.820 --> 01:55:50.580]   Whereas Herbalife, of course, was like an epic battle,
[01:55:50.580 --> 01:55:52.260]   even Canadian Pacific.
[01:55:52.260 --> 01:55:53.940]   So for a period there,
[01:55:53.940 --> 01:55:55.260]   most people when they meet me in person,
[01:55:55.260 --> 01:55:56.940]   they're like, "Wow, but you seem like a really nice guy."
[01:55:56.940 --> 01:55:59.860]   (laughing)
[01:55:59.860 --> 01:56:01.540]   So, but things have been pretty calm
[01:56:01.540 --> 01:56:03.460]   for the last seven years.
[01:56:03.460 --> 01:56:06.940]   - Of course, there's more than just investing
[01:56:06.940 --> 01:56:08.420]   that your life is about.
[01:56:08.420 --> 01:56:09.620]   Especially recently.
[01:56:09.620 --> 01:56:14.500]   Let me just ask you about what's going on in the world first.
[01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:19.380]   What was your reaction and what is your reaction
[01:56:19.380 --> 01:56:24.380]   and thoughts with respect to the October 7th attacks
[01:56:24.380 --> 01:56:26.460]   by Hamas on Israel?
[01:56:26.460 --> 01:56:29.620]   - You know, it's a sad world that we live in.
[01:56:29.620 --> 01:56:31.940]   That one, we have terrorists
[01:56:31.940 --> 01:56:36.220]   and two, that we could have such barbaric terrorism.
[01:56:36.220 --> 01:56:38.060]   And yeah, just a reminder of that.
[01:56:38.060 --> 01:56:40.060]   - So there's several things I can ask here.
[01:56:40.060 --> 01:56:44.780]   First, on your views on the prospects of the Middle East,
[01:56:44.780 --> 01:56:49.780]   but also on the reaction to this war in the United States,
[01:56:49.780 --> 01:56:54.020]   especially on university campuses.
[01:56:54.020 --> 01:56:55.300]   So first, let me just ask,
[01:56:55.300 --> 01:56:57.780]   you've said that you're pro-Palestinian.
[01:56:57.780 --> 01:56:59.860]   Can you explain what you mean by that?
[01:56:59.860 --> 01:57:03.180]   - You know, with all of my posts about Israel,
[01:57:03.180 --> 01:57:06.580]   I'm obviously very supportive of the country of Israel,
[01:57:06.580 --> 01:57:10.140]   Israel's right to exist, Israel's right to defend itself.
[01:57:10.140 --> 01:57:13.580]   My Arab friends, my Palestinian friends,
[01:57:13.580 --> 01:57:16.060]   you know, were kind of saying, "Hey Bill, where are you?
[01:57:16.060 --> 01:57:19.500]   "You know, what about Palestinian lives?"
[01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:23.180]   And I was, pretty early in my life,
[01:57:23.180 --> 01:57:24.820]   a guy named Marty Peretz, who's been important to me
[01:57:24.820 --> 01:57:25.660]   over the course of my life,
[01:57:25.660 --> 01:57:27.780]   a professor, first investor in my fund,
[01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:29.020]   introduced me to Nary.
[01:57:29.020 --> 01:57:31.860]   Asked me when I was right out of school
[01:57:31.860 --> 01:57:35.300]   to join this nonprofit called the Jerusalem Foundation,
[01:57:35.300 --> 01:57:37.740]   which was a charitable foundation
[01:57:37.740 --> 01:57:38.780]   that supported Teddy Kolek
[01:57:38.780 --> 01:57:40.940]   when he was mayor of Jerusalem.
[01:57:40.940 --> 01:57:42.380]   I ended up becoming the youngest chairman
[01:57:42.380 --> 01:57:43.660]   of the Jerusalem Foundation in my 30s,
[01:57:43.660 --> 01:57:45.580]   and I spent some time in Israel.
[01:57:45.580 --> 01:57:49.220]   And the early philanthropic stuff I did
[01:57:49.220 --> 01:57:50.980]   with the Jerusalem Foundation,
[01:57:50.980 --> 01:57:52.260]   the thing I was most interested in
[01:57:52.260 --> 01:57:56.340]   was kind of the Palestinian, the plight of the Palestinians,
[01:57:56.340 --> 01:57:58.740]   and kind of peaceful coexistence.
[01:57:58.740 --> 01:58:01.900]   And so I had kind of an early kind of perspective,
[01:58:01.900 --> 01:58:03.420]   and you know, as chairman of the Jerusalem Foundation,
[01:58:03.420 --> 01:58:06.180]   I would go into, you know, Arab communities,
[01:58:06.180 --> 01:58:08.460]   I would meet the families in their homes.
[01:58:08.460 --> 01:58:12.180]   You know, you get a sense of the humanity of a people,
[01:58:12.180 --> 01:58:14.660]   and I care about humanity.
[01:58:14.660 --> 01:58:16.860]   I generally take the side of people
[01:58:16.860 --> 01:58:18.100]   who've been disadvantaged.
[01:58:18.100 --> 01:58:21.220]   You know, almost all of our philanthropic work
[01:58:21.220 --> 01:58:23.740]   has been in that capacity.
[01:58:23.740 --> 01:58:26.980]   So it's sort of my natural perspective.
[01:58:26.980 --> 01:58:31.220]   But I don't take the side of terrorists ever, obviously.
[01:58:31.220 --> 01:58:34.420]   And you know, the whole thing is just a tragedy.
[01:58:34.420 --> 01:58:37.900]   - So to you, this is about Hamas, not about Palestine.
[01:58:37.900 --> 01:58:41.180]   - Yes, I mean, you know, the problem, of course,
[01:58:41.180 --> 01:58:44.020]   is when Hamas controls, you know,
[01:58:44.020 --> 01:58:47.820]   for the last almost 20 years, has controlled Gaza,
[01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:50.540]   you know, including the education system.
[01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:53.060]   They're educating, you know, you see these, you know,
[01:58:53.060 --> 01:58:56.300]   training videos of kindergartners
[01:58:56.300 --> 01:59:00.380]   indoctrinating them into hating Jews and Israel.
[01:59:00.380 --> 01:59:03.180]   So it's, of course, you don't like to see
[01:59:03.180 --> 01:59:06.500]   Palestinians celebrating, you know,
[01:59:06.500 --> 01:59:09.140]   some of those early videos of October 7th
[01:59:09.140 --> 01:59:11.020]   with, you know, dead bodies in the back of trucks
[01:59:11.020 --> 01:59:13.980]   and people, you know, cheering.
[01:59:13.980 --> 01:59:16.260]   So it's a really unfortunate situation.
[01:59:16.260 --> 01:59:18.140]   But I, you know, I think about, you know,
[01:59:18.140 --> 01:59:21.100]   a Palestinian life is important and is valuable
[01:59:21.100 --> 01:59:24.380]   as a Jewish life, as a American life.
[01:59:24.380 --> 01:59:27.020]   And, you know, what do people really want?
[01:59:27.900 --> 01:59:29.740]   They want a place, they want a home.
[01:59:29.740 --> 01:59:32.300]   They want to be able to feed their family.
[01:59:32.300 --> 01:59:35.940]   They want a job that generates the resources
[01:59:35.940 --> 01:59:36.780]   to feed their family.
[01:59:36.780 --> 01:59:40.060]   They want their kids to have a better life than they've had.
[01:59:40.060 --> 01:59:41.300]   They want peace.
[01:59:41.300 --> 01:59:43.300]   I think these are basic human things.
[01:59:43.300 --> 01:59:45.500]   I'm sure the vast majority of Palestinians
[01:59:45.500 --> 01:59:49.340]   share these views, but it's such an embedded situation
[01:59:49.340 --> 01:59:53.740]   with hatred and, as I say, indoctrination.
[01:59:53.740 --> 01:59:55.540]   And then, you know, going back to incentives,
[01:59:55.540 --> 01:59:58.420]   you know, terrorists generate their resources
[01:59:58.420 --> 02:00:01.900]   by committing terrorism, and that's how they get funding.
[02:00:01.900 --> 02:00:04.140]   And that's, you know, there's a lot of graft.
[02:00:04.140 --> 02:00:07.580]   You know, it's a plutocracy, right?
[02:00:07.580 --> 02:00:10.020]   The top of the terrorist pyramid, you know,
[02:00:10.020 --> 02:00:12.380]   if you accept the numbers that are in the press,
[02:00:12.380 --> 02:00:14.060]   you know, the top leaders, you know,
[02:00:14.060 --> 02:00:15.260]   have billions of dollars, you know,
[02:00:15.260 --> 02:00:17.860]   40 billion or so has gone into Gaza over the last,
[02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:21.580]   and the West Bank over the last 30 years,
[02:00:21.580 --> 02:00:23.220]   a number like that.
[02:00:23.220 --> 02:00:26.700]   And a lot of it's disappeared into some combination
[02:00:26.700 --> 02:00:31.060]   of corruption or tunnels or weapons.
[02:00:31.060 --> 02:00:32.540]   And the tragedy is, you know,
[02:00:32.540 --> 02:00:34.900]   you look at what Singapore has achieved
[02:00:34.900 --> 02:00:37.380]   in the last 30 years, right?
[02:00:37.380 --> 02:00:38.820]   - Do you think that's still possible
[02:00:38.820 --> 02:00:42.700]   if we look into the future of 10, 20, 50 years from now?
[02:00:42.700 --> 02:00:43.620]   - Absolutely.
[02:00:43.620 --> 02:00:46.380]   - So not just peace, but-
[02:00:46.380 --> 02:00:47.900]   - Peace comes with prosperity.
[02:00:49.620 --> 02:00:51.420]   You know, people are, you know,
[02:00:51.420 --> 02:00:53.660]   under the leadership of terrorists.
[02:00:53.660 --> 02:00:55.260]   You're not gonna have prosperity,
[02:00:55.260 --> 02:00:56.820]   and you're not gonna have peace.
[02:00:56.820 --> 02:01:01.460]   And I think the, you know, the Israelis withdrew in 2005,
[02:01:01.460 --> 02:01:04.020]   and fairly quickly, Hamas took control of the situation.
[02:01:04.020 --> 02:01:06.940]   That should never have been allowed to happen.
[02:01:06.940 --> 02:01:09.020]   And I think, you know, if you think about,
[02:01:09.020 --> 02:01:11.940]   I had the opportunity to spend,
[02:01:11.940 --> 02:01:14.020]   well, call it an hour with Henry Kissinger
[02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:16.980]   a few months before he passed away,
[02:01:16.980 --> 02:01:19.820]   and we were talking about Gaza
[02:01:19.820 --> 02:01:20.980]   or in the early stage of the war.
[02:01:20.980 --> 02:01:22.860]   He said, "Look, you know, this is not,
[02:01:22.860 --> 02:01:27.940]   "you can think about Gaza as a test
[02:01:27.940 --> 02:01:28.980]   "of a two-state solution.
[02:01:28.980 --> 02:01:30.460]   "It's not looking good."
[02:01:30.460 --> 02:01:32.140]   These were his words.
[02:01:32.140 --> 02:01:34.940]   So the next time around, you know,
[02:01:34.940 --> 02:01:38.300]   Palestinian people should have their own state,
[02:01:38.300 --> 02:01:40.820]   but it can't be a state where, you know,
[02:01:40.820 --> 02:01:42.420]   40 billion resources goes in
[02:01:42.420 --> 02:01:44.740]   and is spent on weaponry and missiles
[02:01:44.740 --> 02:01:47.420]   and rockets going into Israel.
[02:01:47.420 --> 02:01:52.380]   And I do think a consortium of the Gulf States,
[02:01:52.380 --> 02:01:54.260]   you know, the Saudis and others,
[02:01:54.260 --> 02:01:57.900]   have to ultimately oversee the governance of this region.
[02:01:57.900 --> 02:01:59.580]   If I think if that can happen,
[02:01:59.580 --> 02:02:02.180]   I think you can have peace, you can have prosperity.
[02:02:02.180 --> 02:02:06.220]   And, you know, I'm fundamentally an optimist.
[02:02:06.220 --> 02:02:09.500]   - So coalition of governance.
[02:02:09.500 --> 02:02:10.620]   - Governance matters, you know,
[02:02:10.620 --> 02:02:13.260]   going back to what we talked about before.
[02:02:13.260 --> 02:02:16.940]   And, you know, that kind of approach
[02:02:16.940 --> 02:02:20.140]   can give the people a chance to flourish.
[02:02:20.140 --> 02:02:20.980]   - 100%, 100%.
[02:02:20.980 --> 02:02:23.860]   I mean, look at what Dubai has accomplished
[02:02:23.860 --> 02:02:27.500]   with, you know, nomads in the desert, right?
[02:02:27.500 --> 02:02:31.420]   And that's become a major, it's a tourist destination.
[02:02:31.420 --> 02:02:33.580]   Gaza could have been a tourist destination.
[02:02:33.580 --> 02:02:37.460]   - Take me through the saga of university presidents
[02:02:37.460 --> 02:02:40.780]   testifying on this topic,
[02:02:40.780 --> 02:02:44.500]   on the topic of protests on college campuses,
[02:02:44.500 --> 02:02:47.340]   protests that call for the genocide of Jewish people
[02:02:47.340 --> 02:02:50.100]   and the university presidents,
[02:02:50.100 --> 02:02:54.580]   maybe you could describe it more precisely,
[02:02:54.580 --> 02:02:59.580]   but they fail to denounce the calls for genocide.
[02:02:59.580 --> 02:03:04.980]   - So it begins on October 8th, probably.
[02:03:04.980 --> 02:03:09.860]   And, you know, you can do a compare and contrast
[02:03:09.860 --> 02:03:13.980]   with how Dartmouth managed the events of October 7th
[02:03:13.980 --> 02:03:16.020]   and the aftermath and how Harvard did.
[02:03:16.020 --> 02:03:20.660]   And on October 8th or shortly thereafter,
[02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:23.740]   you know, the Dartmouth president who had been in her job
[02:03:23.740 --> 02:03:26.220]   for precisely the same number of months
[02:03:26.220 --> 02:03:28.500]   that the Harvard president had been in her job.
[02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:30.620]   The first thing she did is she got
[02:03:30.620 --> 02:03:33.900]   the most important professors of Middle East studies
[02:03:33.900 --> 02:03:38.900]   who were Arab and who were Jews and convened them.
[02:03:39.820 --> 02:03:44.020]   And held a, you know, an open session Q and A
[02:03:44.020 --> 02:03:46.820]   for students to talk about what's going on in the Middle East
[02:03:46.820 --> 02:03:50.340]   and began an opportunity for common understanding
[02:03:50.340 --> 02:03:51.940]   among the student body.
[02:03:51.940 --> 02:03:55.900]   And Dartmouth has been a relatively benign environment
[02:03:55.900 --> 02:03:56.740]   on this issue.
[02:03:56.740 --> 02:04:01.220]   And students are able to do work
[02:04:01.220 --> 02:04:03.020]   and there aren't disruptive protests
[02:04:03.020 --> 02:04:05.700]   with people with bullhorns walking into classrooms,
[02:04:05.700 --> 02:04:09.220]   interfering with, you know, people pay today $82,000 a year
[02:04:09.220 --> 02:04:11.660]   which itself is crazy to go to Harvard.
[02:04:11.660 --> 02:04:14.340]   But imagine your family borrows the money
[02:04:14.340 --> 02:04:16.540]   or you borrow the money as a student
[02:04:16.540 --> 02:04:19.580]   and your learning is disrupted by constant protests
[02:04:19.580 --> 02:04:20.980]   and the university does nothing.
[02:04:20.980 --> 02:04:23.500]   You know, when George Floyd died,
[02:04:23.500 --> 02:04:27.580]   you know, the Harvard president wrote a very strong letter
[02:04:27.580 --> 02:04:29.660]   denouncing what had taken place
[02:04:29.660 --> 02:04:31.980]   and, you know, calling this an important moment
[02:04:31.980 --> 02:04:36.020]   in American history and took it incredibly seriously.
[02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:39.500]   Her first letter about October 7th was not that,
[02:04:39.500 --> 02:04:41.060]   let's put it that way.
[02:04:41.060 --> 02:04:43.700]   And then her second letter was not that.
[02:04:43.700 --> 02:04:45.460]   And then ultimately, you know,
[02:04:45.460 --> 02:04:48.340]   she was sort of forced by the board or the pressure
[02:04:48.340 --> 02:04:51.700]   to make a more public statement.
[02:04:51.700 --> 02:04:53.860]   But it was clear that it was hard for her
[02:04:53.860 --> 02:04:58.300]   to come to an understanding of this terrorist act.
[02:04:58.300 --> 02:05:00.620]   And then the protests erupted on campus
[02:05:00.620 --> 02:05:02.860]   and they started out reasonably benign.
[02:05:02.860 --> 02:05:06.060]   And then the protesters got more and more aggressive
[02:05:06.060 --> 02:05:08.580]   in terms of violating university rules
[02:05:08.580 --> 02:05:10.740]   on things like bullying.
[02:05:10.740 --> 02:05:12.580]   And the university did nothing.
[02:05:12.580 --> 02:05:14.980]   And that obviously for the Jewish students,
[02:05:14.980 --> 02:05:17.460]   the Israeli students, the Israeli faculty,
[02:05:17.460 --> 02:05:19.660]   Jewish faculty created an incredibly
[02:05:19.660 --> 02:05:21.460]   uncomfortable environment.
[02:05:21.460 --> 02:05:24.660]   And the president seemed indifferent.
[02:05:24.660 --> 02:05:26.900]   And, you know, I went up to campus
[02:05:26.900 --> 02:05:29.020]   and I met with hundreds of students
[02:05:29.020 --> 02:05:30.740]   in small groups and larger groups.
[02:05:30.740 --> 02:05:33.300]   And they're like, Bill, why is the president doing nothing?
[02:05:33.300 --> 02:05:35.740]   Why is the administration doing nothing?
[02:05:35.740 --> 02:05:37.140]   And that was really the beginning.
[02:05:37.140 --> 02:05:39.500]   And that, you know, I reached out to the president,
[02:05:39.500 --> 02:05:42.180]   reached out to the board of Harvard.
[02:05:42.180 --> 02:05:45.020]   I said, look, this thing is heading in the wrong direction
[02:05:45.020 --> 02:05:46.900]   and you need to fix it.
[02:05:46.900 --> 02:05:49.700]   And I have some ideas, love to share.
[02:05:49.700 --> 02:05:54.260]   And I got the Heisman, as they say.
[02:05:54.260 --> 02:05:56.620]   You know, they just kept pushing off the opportunity
[02:05:56.620 --> 02:06:01.620]   for me to meet with the president and meet with the board.
[02:06:01.620 --> 02:06:05.180]   And a certain point in time I pushed, you know,
[02:06:05.180 --> 02:06:08.380]   I'm kind of a activist when you push me.
[02:06:08.380 --> 02:06:11.340]   It reminded me of, you know, early days of activism
[02:06:11.340 --> 02:06:14.780]   where I couldn't get the CEO of Wendy's to return my call.
[02:06:14.780 --> 02:06:19.340]   I couldn't get the CEO of Harvard, you know, to take a meeting.
[02:06:19.340 --> 02:06:21.300]   And then finally I spoke to the chairman of the board,
[02:06:21.300 --> 02:06:23.140]   a woman by the name of Penny Pritzker,
[02:06:23.140 --> 02:06:24.620]   who I, you know, knew from,
[02:06:24.620 --> 02:06:27.300]   I'm on a business school board with her.
[02:06:27.300 --> 02:06:29.460]   And it was, as I described,
[02:06:29.460 --> 02:06:31.220]   one of the more disappointing conversations of my life.
[02:06:31.220 --> 02:06:33.900]   And it did not seem, she seemed a bit like,
[02:06:33.900 --> 02:06:35.740]   if you will, deer in the headlights.
[02:06:35.740 --> 02:06:38.740]   They couldn't do this, they couldn't do that.
[02:06:38.740 --> 02:06:41.780]   The law was preventing them from doing various things.
[02:06:41.780 --> 02:06:44.420]   And that led to my first letter to the university.
[02:06:44.420 --> 02:06:47.540]   And I sort of ended the letter, you know,
[02:06:47.540 --> 02:06:49.180]   sort of giving this president of Harvard
[02:06:49.180 --> 02:06:50.140]   a dare to be great speech.
[02:06:50.140 --> 02:06:51.780]   This is your opportunity.
[02:06:51.780 --> 02:06:53.260]   You know, you can fix this.
[02:06:53.260 --> 02:06:57.500]   This could be your legacy.
[02:06:57.500 --> 02:07:00.660]   And I sent it to the, I emailed it to the president
[02:07:00.660 --> 02:07:03.820]   and the board members whose email addresses I had.
[02:07:03.820 --> 02:07:06.380]   I posted it on Twitter.
[02:07:06.380 --> 02:07:09.420]   And I got no response, no acknowledgement, nothing.
[02:07:09.420 --> 02:07:12.300]   And in fact, the open dialogue I had
[02:07:12.300 --> 02:07:13.380]   with a couple of people on the board
[02:07:13.380 --> 02:07:15.900]   basically got shut down after that.
[02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:17.580]   And that led to letter number two.
[02:07:17.580 --> 02:07:23.580]   And then when the Congress, led by Elise Stefanik,
[02:07:23.580 --> 02:07:28.740]   announced an investigation of anti-Semitism on campus
[02:07:28.740 --> 02:07:32.220]   and concern about, you know, violations of law,
[02:07:33.060 --> 02:07:35.460]   the president was called to testify along with two other,
[02:07:35.460 --> 02:07:37.580]   you know, the president of MIT,
[02:07:37.580 --> 02:07:40.180]   you know, the president of University of Pennsylvania,
[02:07:40.180 --> 02:07:43.300]   who were having similar issues on campus.
[02:07:43.300 --> 02:07:45.620]   I reached out to the president of Harvard and said,
[02:07:45.620 --> 02:07:48.340]   well, one, the Israeli government had gotten in touch
[02:07:48.340 --> 02:07:51.900]   and offered the opportunity for me to see the Hamas,
[02:07:51.900 --> 02:07:53.820]   if you will, GoPro film.
[02:07:53.820 --> 02:07:55.740]   And I said, you know what, I'd love to show it at Harvard.
[02:07:55.740 --> 02:07:57.660]   And they thought that would be a great idea.
[02:07:57.660 --> 02:08:00.340]   And so I partnered with the head of Harvard Chabad,
[02:08:01.780 --> 02:08:03.820]   a guy named Rabbi Hershey,
[02:08:03.820 --> 02:08:06.620]   and we were putting the film up on campus.
[02:08:06.620 --> 02:08:07.460]   And I thought, you know,
[02:08:07.460 --> 02:08:08.540]   if the president were to see this,
[02:08:08.540 --> 02:08:10.420]   it would give her a lot of perspective on what happened
[02:08:10.420 --> 02:08:13.140]   and she should see it before her testimony.
[02:08:13.140 --> 02:08:17.780]   And so I reached out to her or actually Rabbi Hershey did,
[02:08:17.780 --> 02:08:20.540]   and he was told she would be out of town
[02:08:20.540 --> 02:08:22.620]   and couldn't see it.
[02:08:22.620 --> 02:08:24.820]   And then I reached out to her again,
[02:08:24.820 --> 02:08:29.820]   said, look, I'll facilitate your attendance in the Congress,
[02:08:29.980 --> 02:08:32.820]   you know, come see the film, "I'll Fly You Down."
[02:08:32.820 --> 02:08:34.340]   That was rejected.
[02:08:34.340 --> 02:08:35.500]   And then she testified.
[02:08:35.500 --> 02:08:38.940]   And I watched, you know, a good percentage,
[02:08:38.940 --> 02:08:41.660]   80% of the testimony of all three presidents.
[02:08:41.660 --> 02:08:44.500]   And it was an embarrassment to the country,
[02:08:44.500 --> 02:08:46.260]   embarrassment to the universities.
[02:08:46.260 --> 02:08:47.500]   You know, they were evasive.
[02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:48.720]   They didn't answer questions.
[02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:49.560]   They were rude.
[02:08:49.560 --> 02:08:50.800]   They smirked.
[02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:55.800]   You know, they looked very disrespectful to our Congress.
[02:08:55.800 --> 02:08:59.820]   And then of course there was that several minutes
[02:08:59.820 --> 02:09:01.140]   where finally at least Stefanik
[02:09:01.140 --> 02:09:02.940]   was not getting answers to her questions.
[02:09:02.940 --> 02:09:06.720]   And she said, you know, let me be, you know, kind of clear.
[02:09:06.720 --> 02:09:10.780]   What if protesters are calling for genocide for the Jews,
[02:09:10.780 --> 02:09:14.860]   does that violate your rules on bullying and harassment?
[02:09:14.860 --> 02:09:16.860]   And the three of them basically gave the same answer.
[02:09:16.860 --> 02:09:18.760]   You know, it depends on the context
[02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:23.420]   and not until they actually executed on the genocide
[02:09:23.420 --> 02:09:26.120]   does the university have the right to intervene.
[02:09:26.120 --> 02:09:28.000]   And the thing that perhaps bothered me the most
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:29.880]   was the incredible hypocrisy.
[02:09:29.880 --> 02:09:31.940]   You know, Harvard was, you know,
[02:09:31.940 --> 02:09:33.500]   each of these universities are ranked
[02:09:33.500 --> 02:09:35.580]   by this entity called FIRE,
[02:09:35.580 --> 02:09:38.700]   which is a nonprofit that focuses on free speech on campus.
[02:09:38.700 --> 02:09:42.120]   And Harvard, it's been in the bottom quartile
[02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:44.780]   for the last five years and dropped to last
[02:09:44.780 --> 02:09:47.300]   before October 7th out of like 250.
[02:09:47.300 --> 02:09:48.380]   - I should mention briefly
[02:09:48.380 --> 02:09:50.340]   that I've interviewed on this podcast,
[02:09:50.340 --> 02:09:52.700]   the founder of FIRE and the current head of FIRE.
[02:09:52.700 --> 02:09:54.940]   We've discussed this in length,
[02:09:54.940 --> 02:09:57.700]   including running for the board of Harvard
[02:09:57.700 --> 02:09:59.380]   and the whole procedure of all that.
[02:09:59.380 --> 02:10:04.380]   It's quite a fascinating investigation of free speech.
[02:10:04.380 --> 02:10:06.620]   For people who care about free speech absolutism,
[02:10:06.620 --> 02:10:08.620]   that's a good episode to listen to
[02:10:08.620 --> 02:10:11.460]   because those folks kind of fight for this idea.
[02:10:11.460 --> 02:10:15.140]   It's a difficult idea actually to internalize
[02:10:15.140 --> 02:10:17.780]   what does free speech in college campuses look like.
[02:10:17.780 --> 02:10:19.940]   - Harvard has become a place where free speech
[02:10:19.940 --> 02:10:21.260]   is not tolerated on campus,
[02:10:21.260 --> 02:10:24.220]   or at least free speech that's not part
[02:10:24.220 --> 02:10:26.020]   of the accepted dialogue.
[02:10:26.020 --> 02:10:31.020]   Or this whole notion of speech codes and microaggressions
[02:10:31.020 --> 02:10:32.780]   really emerged on the elite,
[02:10:32.780 --> 02:10:36.580]   the Harvard-Yale campuses of the world.
[02:10:36.580 --> 02:10:40.340]   And the president of Harvard's,
[02:10:40.340 --> 02:10:41.960]   then president of Harvard's explanation
[02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:44.980]   for why you could call for the genocide
[02:10:44.980 --> 02:10:46.180]   of the Jewish people on campus
[02:10:46.180 --> 02:10:49.100]   was Harvard's commitment to free expression.
[02:10:49.100 --> 02:10:53.300]   And one of the more hypocritical statements of all time.
[02:10:53.300 --> 02:10:54.820]   And you really can't have it both ways.
[02:10:54.820 --> 02:10:56.860]   Either Harvard has to be a place where it's a free speech.
[02:10:56.860 --> 02:10:59.460]   She basically said we're a free speech absolutist place,
[02:10:59.460 --> 02:11:01.580]   which is why we have to allow this.
[02:11:01.580 --> 02:11:04.180]   And Harvard could not be further from that.
[02:11:04.180 --> 02:11:07.180]   And so that was a big part of it.
[02:11:07.180 --> 02:11:11.980]   And I was in the barber chair, if you will, getting haircut.
[02:11:11.980 --> 02:11:14.500]   And I had a guy on my team send me
[02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:16.140]   the three minute section.
[02:11:16.140 --> 02:11:19.580]   I said, "Cut that line of questioning."
[02:11:19.580 --> 02:11:22.220]   And I put out a little tweet on that.
[02:11:22.220 --> 02:11:26.220]   And I call it my greatest hits of posts.
[02:11:26.220 --> 02:11:28.660]   It's got something like 110 million views.
[02:11:28.660 --> 02:11:31.500]   And everyone looked at this and said,
[02:11:31.500 --> 02:11:34.460]   what is wrong with university campuses?
[02:11:34.460 --> 02:11:37.900]   And their leadership.
[02:11:37.900 --> 02:11:39.140]   And their governance, by the way.
[02:11:39.140 --> 02:11:41.900]   In a way, this whole conversation's been about governance.
[02:11:41.900 --> 02:11:44.440]   Harvard has a disastrous governance structure,
[02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:46.260]   which is why we have the problem we have.
[02:11:46.260 --> 02:11:50.220]   - And just to linger on the testimony,
[02:11:50.220 --> 02:11:53.220]   you mentioned smirks and this kind of stuff.
[02:11:53.220 --> 02:11:55.700]   And you mentioned dare to be great.
[02:11:55.700 --> 02:11:59.300]   I, myself, am kind of a sucker for great leadership.
[02:11:59.300 --> 02:12:02.780]   And those moments, you mentioned Churchill or so on.
[02:12:02.780 --> 02:12:04.820]   Even great speeches.
[02:12:04.820 --> 02:12:08.860]   People talk down on speeches like it's maybe just words.
[02:12:08.860 --> 02:12:13.380]   But I think speeches can define a culture
[02:12:13.380 --> 02:12:18.100]   and define a place, define a people that can inspire.
[02:12:18.100 --> 02:12:21.360]   And I think, actually, the testimony before Congress
[02:12:21.360 --> 02:12:26.360]   could have been an opportunity to redefine what Harvard is.
[02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:29.940]   Dare to be great, dare to be a great leader.
[02:12:29.940 --> 02:12:31.780]   - President Harvard had a huge opportunity
[02:12:31.780 --> 02:12:33.460]   'cause she went third.
[02:12:33.460 --> 02:12:36.140]   The first two gave the world's most disastrous answers
[02:12:36.140 --> 02:12:37.620]   to the question.
[02:12:37.620 --> 02:12:39.660]   And she literally just copied their answer,
[02:12:39.660 --> 02:12:43.920]   which is itself kind of ironic
[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:45.820]   in light of ultimately what happened.
[02:12:45.820 --> 02:12:50.820]   - It's tough because you can get busy as a president,
[02:12:50.820 --> 02:12:52.140]   as a leader, and so on.
[02:12:52.140 --> 02:12:54.220]   There's these meetings, so you think Congress,
[02:12:54.220 --> 02:12:57.140]   maybe you're smirking at the ridiculousness of the meeting.
[02:12:57.140 --> 02:13:02.140]   You need to remember that many of these are opportunities
[02:13:02.140 --> 02:13:05.020]   to give a speech of a lifetime.
[02:13:05.020 --> 02:13:06.300]   - Sure.
[02:13:06.300 --> 02:13:09.300]   - If there is principles which you want to see
[02:13:09.300 --> 02:13:12.420]   an institution become and embody
[02:13:12.420 --> 02:13:14.420]   in the next several decades,
[02:13:14.420 --> 02:13:16.380]   there's opportunities to do that.
[02:13:16.380 --> 02:13:19.380]   And you, as a great leader, also need to have a sense
[02:13:19.380 --> 02:13:21.840]   of when is the opportunity to do that.
[02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:24.460]   And October 7th really woke up the world
[02:13:24.460 --> 02:13:27.980]   on all sides, honestly.
[02:13:27.980 --> 02:13:31.860]   Like, there is serious issue going on here.
[02:13:31.860 --> 02:13:35.220]   And then the protests woke up the university.
[02:13:35.220 --> 02:13:37.620]   There's a serious issue going on here.
[02:13:37.620 --> 02:13:40.920]   It's an opportunity to speak on free speech
[02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:43.060]   and on genocide, both.
[02:13:43.980 --> 02:13:44.820]   - Yes.
[02:13:44.820 --> 02:13:50.300]   - Do you see the criticism that you are a billionaire donor
[02:13:50.300 --> 02:13:54.340]   and you sort of used your power and financial influence
[02:13:54.340 --> 02:13:58.100]   unfairly to affect the governing structure of Harvard,
[02:13:58.100 --> 02:13:59.020]   in this case?
[02:13:59.020 --> 02:14:01.180]   - First of all, I never threatened to use financial
[02:14:01.180 --> 02:14:02.220]   or other resources.
[02:14:02.220 --> 02:14:05.620]   The only thing I did here was I wrote public letters.
[02:14:05.620 --> 02:14:08.300]   I spoke privately to a couple members of the board.
[02:14:08.300 --> 02:14:10.700]   I spoke for 45 minutes to the chairman.
[02:14:10.700 --> 02:14:12.560]   None of those conversations were effective
[02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:14.780]   or went anywhere, as far as I could tell.
[02:14:14.780 --> 02:14:19.780]   I think my public letters and then some of the posts I do,
[02:14:19.780 --> 02:14:25.420]   and that little three-minute video excerpt had an impact.
[02:14:25.420 --> 02:14:30.480]   But it wasn't about, I mean, you can criticize me
[02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:32.800]   for being a billionaire, but that had, you know,
[02:14:32.800 --> 02:14:34.540]   it was really the words.
[02:14:34.540 --> 02:14:37.880]   It's a bit like, again, going back to the corporate analogy,
[02:14:37.880 --> 02:14:39.940]   it's not the fact that you own 5% of the company
[02:14:39.940 --> 02:14:42.180]   that causes people to vote in your favor.
[02:14:42.180 --> 02:14:44.500]   It's the fact that your ideas are right.
[02:14:44.500 --> 02:14:47.380]   And I think, you know, I was disappointed
[02:14:47.380 --> 02:14:48.620]   after the congressional testimony,
[02:14:48.620 --> 02:14:50.940]   the board of Harvard said that they were 100% behind,
[02:14:50.940 --> 02:14:54.600]   unanimously 100% behind President Gay.
[02:14:54.600 --> 02:14:56.940]   And so clearly I was ineffective.
[02:14:56.940 --> 02:15:01.220]   And ultimately what took her down was other,
[02:15:01.220 --> 02:15:03.560]   I would say activists who identified issues
[02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:05.780]   with academic integrity.
[02:15:05.780 --> 02:15:08.060]   And then she lost the confidence of the faculty.
[02:15:08.060 --> 02:15:11.220]   And once that happens, it's hard to stay.
[02:15:11.220 --> 02:15:14.080]   And I wanted her to be fired basically,
[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:17.620]   or be forced to resign because of failures of leadership,
[02:15:17.620 --> 02:15:18.780]   'cause that would have sent a message
[02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:20.100]   about the importance of leadership.
[02:15:20.100 --> 02:15:22.460]   You know, failure to stop a emergence
[02:15:22.460 --> 02:15:24.180]   of antisemitism on campus.
[02:15:24.180 --> 02:15:26.180]   And, you know, there's some news today,
[02:15:26.180 --> 02:15:28.100]   the protests are getting worse.
[02:15:28.100 --> 02:15:30.340]   - Is there some tension between free speech
[02:15:30.340 --> 02:15:33.060]   on college campuses and disciplining students
[02:15:33.060 --> 02:15:34.740]   for calls of genocide?
[02:15:34.740 --> 02:15:36.820]   - Yes, there's certainly a tension.
[02:15:36.820 --> 02:15:39.660]   And I think, first of all,
[02:15:39.660 --> 02:15:41.260]   I think free speech is incredibly important
[02:15:41.260 --> 02:15:42.100]   and I'm on the side,
[02:15:42.100 --> 02:15:44.220]   I'm a lot closer to absolutism on free speech
[02:15:44.220 --> 02:15:45.580]   than otherwise.
[02:15:45.580 --> 02:15:48.020]   The issue I had was the hypocrisy, right?
[02:15:48.020 --> 02:15:52.340]   They were restricting other kinds of speech on campus,
[02:15:52.340 --> 02:15:54.940]   principally conservative speech, conservative views.
[02:15:54.940 --> 02:15:58.980]   So it wasn't a free speech absolutist campus.
[02:15:58.980 --> 02:16:02.560]   And the protests were actually quite threatening to students.
[02:16:02.560 --> 02:16:05.740]   And there are limits to even absolutist free speech.
[02:16:05.740 --> 02:16:08.940]   And they begin where people feel, you know,
[02:16:08.940 --> 02:16:12.380]   intimidation, harassment, and, you know,
[02:16:12.380 --> 02:16:14.860]   threat to bodily harm, et cetera.
[02:16:14.860 --> 02:16:17.300]   You know, that kind of speech is generally,
[02:16:17.300 --> 02:16:19.180]   and again, it's pretty technical,
[02:16:19.180 --> 02:16:21.300]   but as people feel like they're in imminent harm
[02:16:21.300 --> 02:16:22.420]   by virtue of the protest,
[02:16:22.420 --> 02:16:25.100]   that speech is at risk of not meeting the standards
[02:16:25.100 --> 02:16:26.420]   for free speech.
[02:16:26.420 --> 02:16:28.940]   But Harvard is a private corporation.
[02:16:28.940 --> 02:16:30.660]   And as a private corporation,
[02:16:30.660 --> 02:16:32.340]   they can put on what restrictions they want.
[02:16:32.340 --> 02:16:34.380]   And Harvard had introduced only a few months
[02:16:34.380 --> 02:16:36.700]   before bullying and harassment policies.
[02:16:36.700 --> 02:16:39.180]   And that's why Representative Stefanik focused on,
[02:16:39.180 --> 02:16:40.740]   does this, it's not like she said,
[02:16:40.740 --> 02:16:42.200]   does calling for genocide against the Jews
[02:16:42.200 --> 02:16:43.500]   violate your free speech policy?
[02:16:43.500 --> 02:16:46.060]   She says, does calling for genocide against the Jews
[02:16:46.060 --> 02:16:48.940]   violate your policies on bullying and harassment?
[02:16:48.940 --> 02:16:50.460]   And I think everyone looked at this
[02:16:50.460 --> 02:16:52.060]   when they said, it depends on the context.
[02:16:52.060 --> 02:16:52.900]   And they said, look,
[02:16:52.900 --> 02:16:54.900]   if you replace Jews with some other ethnic group,
[02:16:54.900 --> 02:16:58.020]   students have been, who've used the N word, for example,
[02:16:58.020 --> 02:17:00.940]   have been thrown off campus, were suspended.
[02:17:00.940 --> 02:17:02.580]   You know, students who've, you know,
[02:17:02.580 --> 02:17:06.900]   hate speech directed at LGBTQ people
[02:17:06.900 --> 02:17:09.380]   has led to disciplinary action.
[02:17:09.380 --> 02:17:13.340]   But, you know, attacking, spitting on Jewish students,
[02:17:13.340 --> 02:17:15.580]   or, you know, kind of roughing them up a bit,
[02:17:15.580 --> 02:17:18.220]   seemed like, you know,
[02:17:18.220 --> 02:17:20.840]   or calling for their elimination
[02:17:20.840 --> 02:17:22.180]   didn't seem to violate the policy.
[02:17:22.180 --> 02:17:24.260]   So it's, you know, look,
[02:17:24.260 --> 02:17:26.300]   I think a university should be a place
[02:17:26.300 --> 02:17:29.020]   where you have broad views and open viewpoints
[02:17:29.020 --> 02:17:30.260]   and broad discussion.
[02:17:31.660 --> 02:17:32.540]   But it should also be a place
[02:17:32.540 --> 02:17:34.940]   where students don't feel threatened going to class,
[02:17:34.940 --> 02:17:37.180]   where their learning is not interrupted,
[02:17:37.180 --> 02:17:39.500]   when final exams are not interrupted,
[02:17:39.500 --> 02:17:42.940]   by, you know, people coming in and with loud protest.
[02:17:42.940 --> 02:17:44.380]   Students asked me when I went up there,
[02:17:44.380 --> 02:17:45.660]   what would you do if you were Harvard president?
[02:17:45.660 --> 02:17:47.420]   I said, and this was before I knew what was happening
[02:17:47.420 --> 02:17:48.260]   on the Dartmouth campus.
[02:17:48.260 --> 02:17:50.340]   I said, I would, I'd convene everyone together.
[02:17:50.340 --> 02:17:51.220]   This is Harvard.
[02:17:51.220 --> 02:17:53.140]   We have access to the best minds in the world.
[02:17:53.140 --> 02:17:55.220]   Let's have a better understanding of the history.
[02:17:55.220 --> 02:17:56.700]   Let's understand the backdrop.
[02:17:56.700 --> 02:17:58.220]   Let's focus on solutions.
[02:17:58.220 --> 02:18:00.860]   Let's bring Arab and Jewish and Israeli students together.
[02:18:00.860 --> 02:18:03.700]   Let's form groups to create communication.
[02:18:03.700 --> 02:18:05.920]   That's how you solve this kind of problem.
[02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:07.940]   And none of that stuff has been done.
[02:18:07.940 --> 02:18:09.260]   It's not that hard.
[02:18:09.260 --> 02:18:12.740]   - Do you think this reveals a deeper problem
[02:18:12.740 --> 02:18:18.500]   in terms of ideology and the governance of Harvard
[02:18:18.500 --> 02:18:21.860]   in maybe the culture of Harvard?
[02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:23.580]   - Yes.
[02:18:23.580 --> 02:18:26.500]   So on governance, the governance structure is a disaster.
[02:18:26.500 --> 02:18:27.540]   So the way it works today
[02:18:27.540 --> 02:18:29.420]   is Harvard has two principal boards.
[02:18:29.420 --> 02:18:31.100]   There's the board of the corporation,
[02:18:31.100 --> 02:18:33.140]   the so-called Fellows of Harvard.
[02:18:33.140 --> 02:18:36.020]   It's a board of, I think, 12 independent directors
[02:18:36.020 --> 02:18:36.940]   and the president.
[02:18:36.940 --> 02:18:39.900]   There's no shareholder vote.
[02:18:39.900 --> 02:18:41.640]   There's no proxy system.
[02:18:41.640 --> 02:18:44.340]   It's really a self-perpetuating board
[02:18:44.340 --> 02:18:47.040]   that effectively elects its own members.
[02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:48.980]   So there's, you know, once it becomes,
[02:18:48.980 --> 02:18:52.140]   once the balance tips politically one way or another,
[02:18:52.140 --> 02:18:55.540]   they can, you know, it can be kept that way forever.
[02:18:55.540 --> 02:18:57.280]   There's no kind of rebalancing system.
[02:18:57.280 --> 02:18:59.260]   You know, if a US corporation goes off the rails,
[02:18:59.260 --> 02:19:01.540]   so to speak, the shareholders can get together
[02:19:01.540 --> 02:19:02.700]   and vote off the directors.
[02:19:02.700 --> 02:19:04.820]   There's no ability to vote off the directors.
[02:19:04.820 --> 02:19:06.020]   Then there's the board of overseers,
[02:19:06.020 --> 02:19:09.000]   which is, I think, 32 directors.
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.140]   And there, a few years ago,
[02:19:11.140 --> 02:19:13.140]   if you could put together 600 signatures,
[02:19:13.140 --> 02:19:14.220]   you could run for that board
[02:19:14.220 --> 02:19:15.780]   and put up a bunch of candidates
[02:19:15.780 --> 02:19:18.300]   and about five or six get elected each year.
[02:19:18.300 --> 02:19:20.740]   And a group did exactly that.
[02:19:20.740 --> 02:19:24.940]   And it was an oil and gas kind of disinvestment group.
[02:19:24.940 --> 02:19:25.780]   They got the signatures.
[02:19:25.780 --> 02:19:27.180]   A couple of them got elected
[02:19:27.180 --> 02:19:29.700]   and Harvard then changed the rules.
[02:19:29.700 --> 02:19:33.320]   And they said, now we need 3,200 signatures.
[02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:35.620]   And by the way,
[02:19:35.620 --> 02:19:38.380]   if there are these dissident directors on the board,
[02:19:38.380 --> 02:19:41.280]   we're only gonna allow, we're gonna cap them at five.
[02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:43.860]   So if three were elected in the oil and gas thing,
[02:19:43.860 --> 02:19:46.060]   now there are only two seats available.
[02:19:46.060 --> 02:19:48.420]   And then a group of former students,
[02:19:48.420 --> 02:19:50.940]   kind of younger alums, one of whom I knew,
[02:19:50.940 --> 02:19:51.780]   approached me and said,
[02:19:51.780 --> 02:19:53.260]   "Look, Bill, we should run for the board."
[02:19:53.260 --> 02:19:55.220]   And they decided this pretty late,
[02:19:55.460 --> 02:19:57.900]   only a few weeks before the signatures were due.
[02:19:57.900 --> 02:19:59.580]   And they love your support.
[02:19:59.580 --> 02:20:00.700]   I took a look at their platform.
[02:20:00.700 --> 02:20:01.580]   I thought it looked great.
[02:20:01.580 --> 02:20:03.300]   I said, "Look, happy to support."
[02:20:03.300 --> 02:20:06.760]   And I posted about them, did a Zoom with them.
[02:20:06.760 --> 02:20:08.660]   And they got thousands of signatures.
[02:20:08.660 --> 02:20:10.260]   Collectively, the four got, whatever,
[02:20:10.260 --> 02:20:12.340]   12,000 signatures or something like this.
[02:20:12.340 --> 02:20:16.380]   And they missed by about 10% the threshold.
[02:20:16.380 --> 02:20:18.580]   And what did Harvard do in the middle of the election?
[02:20:18.580 --> 02:20:23.380]   They made it very, very difficult to sign up for a vote.
[02:20:23.380 --> 02:20:25.040]   And it just makes them look terrible.
[02:20:25.040 --> 02:20:29.180]   And they've got now thousands of alums upset that...
[02:20:29.180 --> 02:20:30.700]   And again, this wasn't an election.
[02:20:30.700 --> 02:20:32.940]   This was just to put the names on the slate.
[02:20:32.940 --> 02:20:34.420]   So the only candidates on the slate
[02:20:34.420 --> 02:20:38.500]   are the ones selected by the existing members.
[02:20:38.500 --> 02:20:39.940]   And so it's...
[02:20:39.940 --> 02:20:44.760]   Businesses fail because of governance failures.
[02:20:44.760 --> 02:20:48.140]   Universities fail because of governance failures.
[02:20:48.140 --> 02:20:50.020]   It's not really the president's fault
[02:20:50.020 --> 02:20:51.880]   because the job of the board
[02:20:51.880 --> 02:20:54.220]   is to hire and fire the president
[02:20:54.220 --> 02:20:57.060]   and help guide the institution academically and otherwise.
[02:20:57.060 --> 02:20:58.000]   So that's governance.
[02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:01.540]   On ideology, I was like, "How can this be?"
[02:21:01.540 --> 02:21:03.980]   October 7th, the event that woke me up
[02:21:03.980 --> 02:21:05.820]   was 30 student organizations
[02:21:05.820 --> 02:21:08.300]   came out with a public letter on October 8th,
[02:21:08.300 --> 02:21:10.260]   literally the morning after this letter was created,
[02:21:10.260 --> 02:21:14.700]   and said, "Israel is solely responsible
[02:21:14.700 --> 02:21:16.620]   "for Hamas's violent acts."
[02:21:16.620 --> 02:21:20.340]   Again, Israel had not even mounted a defense at this point.
[02:21:20.340 --> 02:21:22.200]   And there were still terrorists running around
[02:21:22.200 --> 02:21:23.800]   in the southern part of Israel.
[02:21:23.800 --> 02:21:28.860]   And I'm like, "Harvard students,
[02:21:28.860 --> 02:21:33.620]   "34 Harvard student organizations signed this letter."
[02:21:33.620 --> 02:21:35.580]   And I'm like, "What is going on?"
[02:21:35.580 --> 02:21:36.740]   WTF, right?
[02:21:36.740 --> 02:21:41.000]   And that's when I went up on campus
[02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.020]   and I started talking to the faculty.
[02:21:43.020 --> 02:21:44.340]   And that's when I started hearing about,
[02:21:44.340 --> 02:21:47.500]   "Actually, Bill, it's this DEI ideology."
[02:21:47.500 --> 02:21:48.940]   I'm like, "What?"
[02:21:49.040 --> 02:21:51.000]   (laughing)
[02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.280]   Diversity, equity, inclusion.
[02:21:53.280 --> 02:21:55.800]   Obviously, I'm familiar with these words
[02:21:55.800 --> 02:21:59.400]   and I see this in the corporate context.
[02:21:59.400 --> 02:22:00.240]   And they say, "Yeah."
[02:22:00.240 --> 02:22:01.060]   And they started talking to me
[02:22:01.060 --> 02:22:04.640]   about this oppressor, oppressed framework,
[02:22:04.640 --> 02:22:08.160]   which is effectively taught on campus
[02:22:08.160 --> 02:22:09.840]   and represents the backdrop
[02:22:09.840 --> 02:22:11.320]   for many of the courses that are offered
[02:22:11.320 --> 02:22:14.880]   and the various, some of the studies
[02:22:14.880 --> 02:22:16.480]   and other degree offerings.
[02:22:16.480 --> 02:22:19.780]   I'm like, "I had not even heard of this."
[02:22:19.780 --> 02:22:22.380]   And I'm a pretty aware person,
[02:22:22.380 --> 02:22:23.820]   but I was completely unaware.
[02:22:23.820 --> 02:22:24.740]   And basically, they're like,
[02:22:24.740 --> 02:22:26.780]   "Look, Israel is deemed an oppressor
[02:22:26.780 --> 02:22:30.020]   "and the Palestinians are deemed the oppressed.
[02:22:30.020 --> 02:22:32.740]   "And you take the side of the oppressed
[02:22:32.740 --> 02:22:37.120]   "and any acts of the oppressed to dislodge the oppressor,
[02:22:37.120 --> 02:22:40.340]   "regardless of how vile or barbaric, okay."
[02:22:40.340 --> 02:22:44.460]   I'm like, "Okay, this is a super dangerous ideology."
[02:22:44.460 --> 02:22:48.280]   And so, I wrote a questioning post about this.
[02:22:48.280 --> 02:22:50.120]   I'm like, "Here's what I'm hearing.
[02:22:50.120 --> 02:22:51.520]   "Is this right?"
[02:22:51.520 --> 02:22:53.720]   Then I had someone, a friend of mine sent me
[02:22:53.720 --> 02:22:57.820]   Christopher Rufo's book, "America's Cultural Revolution,"
[02:22:57.820 --> 02:23:01.040]   which is sort of a sociological study
[02:23:01.040 --> 02:23:02.920]   of the origins of the DEI movement
[02:23:02.920 --> 02:23:04.960]   and critical race theory.
[02:23:04.960 --> 02:23:07.160]   And I found it actually
[02:23:07.160 --> 02:23:09.480]   one of the more important books I've read.
[02:23:09.480 --> 02:23:13.200]   And also, I found it quite concerning.
[02:23:13.200 --> 02:23:15.520]   And really, it's sort of a,
[02:23:15.520 --> 02:23:19.180]   ultimately, DEI comes out of a kind of a Marxist,
[02:23:19.180 --> 02:23:24.000]   socialist backdrop way to look at the world.
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.020]   And so, I think there are a lot of issues with it,
[02:23:26.020 --> 02:23:27.920]   but unfortunately, it's advancing,
[02:23:27.920 --> 02:23:29.220]   I ultimately concluded,
[02:23:29.220 --> 02:23:34.000]   racism as opposed to fighting it,
[02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.980]   which is what I thought it was ultimately about.
[02:23:36.980 --> 02:23:39.200]   - So, maybe you can speak to that book a little bit.
[02:23:39.200 --> 02:23:43.560]   So, there's a history that traces back across decades,
[02:23:43.560 --> 02:23:47.800]   and then that infiltrated college campuses.
[02:23:47.800 --> 02:23:49.920]   - So, basically, what Rufo argues
[02:23:49.920 --> 02:23:54.240]   is that the Black Power movement of the '60s really failed.
[02:23:54.240 --> 02:23:55.940]   It was a very violent movement,
[02:23:55.940 --> 02:23:59.280]   and many of the protagonists ended up in jail.
[02:23:59.280 --> 02:24:01.880]   And out of that movement,
[02:24:01.880 --> 02:24:04.680]   a number of kind of thought leaders,
[02:24:05.640 --> 02:24:09.200]   this guy named Marcuse and others,
[02:24:09.200 --> 02:24:12.120]   built this framework, kind of an approach.
[02:24:12.120 --> 02:24:14.080]   Said, "Look, if we're gonna be successful,
[02:24:14.080 --> 02:24:16.420]   "it can't be a violent movement, number one.
[02:24:16.420 --> 02:24:18.120]   "And number two, we need to infiltrate,
[02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:20.120]   "if you will, the universities.
[02:24:20.120 --> 02:24:22.920]   "And we need to become part of the faculty.
[02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:25.980]   "And we need to teach the students.
[02:24:25.980 --> 02:24:29.020]   "And then once we take over the universities
[02:24:29.020 --> 02:24:32.380]   "with this ideology, then we can go into government,
[02:24:32.380 --> 02:24:34.140]   "and then we can go into corporations,
[02:24:34.140 --> 02:24:35.600]   "and we can change the world."
[02:24:35.600 --> 02:24:37.120]   - So, I thought, important book.
[02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:39.440]   And the more I dug in,
[02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:42.400]   the more I felt there was credibility to this,
[02:24:42.400 --> 02:24:45.720]   not just the kind of sociological backdrop,
[02:24:45.720 --> 02:24:47.960]   but to what it meant on campus.
[02:24:47.960 --> 02:24:50.600]   And Harvard faculty were telling me
[02:24:50.600 --> 02:24:54.880]   that there really is no such thing as free speech on campus,
[02:24:54.880 --> 02:24:58.520]   and that there was a survey done a year or so ago,
[02:24:58.520 --> 02:25:02.180]   the Harvard faculty, and only 2% of the faculty admitted,
[02:25:02.180 --> 02:25:03.800]   even in an anonymous survey,
[02:25:03.800 --> 02:25:07.000]   admitted to having a conservative point of view.
[02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.680]   So, we have a campus that's 98% non-conservative,
[02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:15.600]   liberal, progressive, that's adopted this DEI construct.
[02:25:15.600 --> 02:25:20.240]   And then I learned from a member of the search committee
[02:25:20.240 --> 02:25:21.480]   for the Harvard president,
[02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:25.440]   that they were restricted in looking at candidates,
[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:28.440]   only those who met the DEI offices criteria.
[02:25:28.440 --> 02:25:30.920]   And I shared this in one of my postings,
[02:25:30.920 --> 02:25:32.720]   and I was accused of being a racist.
[02:25:33.220 --> 02:25:38.220]   Um, but, uh, and that's someone who believes in,
[02:25:38.220 --> 02:25:42.000]   that diversity is a very good thing for organizations,
[02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.480]   and that equity and fairness is really important,
[02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:47.920]   and having an inclusive culture is critical, you know,
[02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:49.880]   for a functioning of our organization.
[02:25:49.880 --> 02:25:52.080]   You know, so here I was, someone who was like,
[02:25:52.080 --> 02:25:54.240]   "Okay, DEI sounds good to me,"
[02:25:54.240 --> 02:25:59.240]   at least in the small D, small E, I version of events,
[02:25:59.240 --> 02:26:02.560]   but this DEI ideology is really problematic.
[02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:06.720]   - So what's a way to fix this in the next few years?
[02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:11.520]   Uh, the infiltration of DEI
[02:26:11.520 --> 02:26:14.600]   with the uppercase version of universities,
[02:26:14.600 --> 02:26:16.520]   and the things that have troubled you?
[02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:20.040]   The things you saw at Harvard and elsewhere.
[02:26:20.040 --> 02:26:22.360]   - The same way this was an eye-opening event for me,
[02:26:22.360 --> 02:26:24.880]   it has been for a very broad range of other people.
[02:26:24.880 --> 02:26:27.520]   I've never gotten, you know, I mentioned general growth,
[02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:28.720]   I got a lot of nice letters from people
[02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:31.640]   for making money on a stock that went up a hundred times.
[02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:36.640]   Uh, but I literally get hundreds of emails,
[02:26:36.640 --> 02:26:39.160]   letters, texts, handwritten letters,
[02:26:39.160 --> 02:26:43.280]   typed letters from people, the ages of 25 to 85,
[02:26:43.280 --> 02:26:45.160]   saying, "Bill, this is so important,
[02:26:45.160 --> 02:26:46.900]   "thanks for speaking out on this.
[02:26:46.900 --> 02:26:49.620]   "You were saying what, you know, so many of us believe,
[02:26:49.620 --> 02:26:51.000]   "but have been afraid to say."
[02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:52.280]   You know, it's a, I described it
[02:26:52.280 --> 02:26:54.960]   as almost a McCarthy-esque kind of movement,
[02:26:54.960 --> 02:26:58.360]   and that if you challenge the DEI construct,
[02:26:58.360 --> 02:26:59.600]   people accuse you of being a racist,
[02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:01.620]   it's happened to me already.
[02:27:01.620 --> 02:27:04.200]   You know, I'm perhaps, you know,
[02:27:04.200 --> 02:27:06.680]   I'm much less vulnerable than a university professor
[02:27:06.680 --> 02:27:10.560]   who can get shouted off campus and canceled.
[02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:12.500]   I'm sort of difficult to cancel,
[02:27:12.500 --> 02:27:15.400]   but that doesn't mean people aren't gonna try.
[02:27:15.400 --> 02:27:17.800]   And, you know, I've been the victim
[02:27:17.800 --> 02:27:22.600]   of a couple of interesting articles in the last few days,
[02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:25.580]   or at least one in particular in the Washington Post,
[02:27:25.580 --> 02:27:27.620]   written by what I thought was a well-meaning reporter,
[02:27:27.620 --> 02:27:29.360]   but it's just clear that, you know,
[02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:31.500]   I've taken on some big parts
[02:27:31.500 --> 02:27:34.900]   of at least the progressive establishment, DEI.
[02:27:34.900 --> 02:27:37.940]   I'm also a believer that Biden should have stepped aside
[02:27:37.940 --> 02:27:40.200]   a long time ago, and it's only getting worse.
[02:27:40.200 --> 02:27:45.220]   You know, so I'm attacking the president, DEI,
[02:27:45.220 --> 02:27:51.180]   elite universities, and you make some enemies doing that.
[02:27:51.180 --> 02:27:54.080]   - But I should say, you know, I'm still at MIT,
[02:27:54.080 --> 02:27:57.060]   and I love MIT, and I believe in the power
[02:27:57.060 --> 02:28:01.980]   of great universities to explore ideas,
[02:28:01.980 --> 02:28:05.100]   to inspire young people to think,
[02:28:05.100 --> 02:28:07.980]   to inspire young people to lead.
[02:28:07.980 --> 02:28:12.660]   - Let me ask, okay, how can you explore how to think
[02:28:12.660 --> 02:28:17.200]   when you're only shared a certain point of view, right?
[02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:19.260]   How can you learn about leadership
[02:28:19.260 --> 02:28:22.020]   when the governance and leadership
[02:28:22.020 --> 02:28:25.700]   of the institution is broken, and exposure to ideas?
[02:28:25.700 --> 02:28:28.040]   If you're limited in the ideas that you're exposed to.
[02:28:28.040 --> 02:28:29.140]   So I think universities are at risk.
[02:28:29.140 --> 02:28:31.380]   I mean, the concerning thing, right,
[02:28:31.380 --> 02:28:34.060]   is if 34 student organizations that each have,
[02:28:34.060 --> 02:28:36.580]   I don't know, 30 members or maybe more, right,
[02:28:36.580 --> 02:28:39.140]   that's 1,000, okay, that's a meaningful percentage
[02:28:39.140 --> 02:28:42.820]   of the campus, perhaps, that ultimately respond.
[02:28:42.820 --> 02:28:45.960]   Now, 10 or so of the 30 withdrew the statement
[02:28:45.960 --> 02:28:50.300]   once many of the members realized what they had written.
[02:28:50.300 --> 02:28:52.340]   So I don't think, it seems like the statement
[02:28:52.340 --> 02:28:54.020]   was signed by the leadership
[02:28:54.020 --> 02:28:56.860]   and not necessarily supported by all the various students
[02:28:56.860 --> 02:28:59.340]   that were members.
[02:28:59.340 --> 02:29:03.580]   But if the university teaches people these precepts,
[02:29:03.580 --> 02:29:05.420]   this is the next generation of leaders.
[02:29:05.420 --> 02:29:07.100]   Normally, if you think about,
[02:29:07.100 --> 02:29:09.860]   I wrote my college thesis on university admissions,
[02:29:09.860 --> 02:29:13.100]   the reason why controlling the gates
[02:29:13.100 --> 02:29:16.060]   of the Harvard institution,
[02:29:16.060 --> 02:29:17.260]   the admissions office is important,
[02:29:17.260 --> 02:29:20.380]   is that many of these people who graduate end up with
[02:29:20.380 --> 02:29:25.380]   the top jobs in government and ultimately become judges.
[02:29:25.380 --> 02:29:29.500]   They permeate through society.
[02:29:29.500 --> 02:29:31.340]   So it really matters what they learn.
[02:29:31.340 --> 02:29:36.340]   And if they're limited to one side of the political aisle
[02:29:36.340 --> 02:29:40.780]   and they're not open to a broad array of views,
[02:29:40.780 --> 02:29:42.860]   and this represents some of the most elite institutions
[02:29:42.860 --> 02:29:45.340]   in our country, I think it's very problematic
[02:29:45.340 --> 02:29:47.180]   for the country long-term.
[02:29:47.180 --> 02:29:48.860]   - Yeah, I 100% agree.
[02:29:48.860 --> 02:29:51.300]   And I also felt like the leadership
[02:29:51.300 --> 02:29:56.220]   wasn't even part of the problem
[02:29:56.220 --> 02:29:58.260]   as much as they were almost out of touch,
[02:29:58.260 --> 02:30:03.260]   like unaware that this is an important moment,
[02:30:03.260 --> 02:30:07.980]   it's an important crisis, it's an important opportunity
[02:30:07.980 --> 02:30:09.140]   to step up as a leader
[02:30:09.140 --> 02:30:11.260]   and define the future of an institution.
[02:30:11.260 --> 02:30:13.620]   So I don't even know where the source of the problem is.
[02:30:13.620 --> 02:30:17.500]   It could be literally government structure
[02:30:17.500 --> 02:30:18.340]   as we've been-
[02:30:18.340 --> 02:30:19.180]   - I think it's two things.
[02:30:19.180 --> 02:30:20.500]   I think it's governance structure.
[02:30:20.500 --> 02:30:23.380]   I also think universities are selecting,
[02:30:23.380 --> 02:30:24.940]   they're not selecting leaders.
[02:30:24.940 --> 02:30:25.780]   - Yeah.
[02:30:25.780 --> 02:30:31.780]   - It's not clear to me that university
[02:30:31.780 --> 02:30:35.540]   should necessarily be run by academics, right?
[02:30:35.540 --> 02:30:38.860]   The dean of a university,
[02:30:38.860 --> 02:30:41.780]   the person who helps,
[02:30:41.780 --> 02:30:46.860]   there's sort of the business of the university, right?
[02:30:46.860 --> 02:30:49.340]   And then there's the academics of the university
[02:30:49.340 --> 02:30:51.500]   and having a, I would argue,
[02:30:51.500 --> 02:30:55.340]   having a business leader run these institutions
[02:30:55.340 --> 02:30:57.860]   and then having a board that's involved,
[02:30:57.860 --> 02:31:01.140]   a board that has itself diverse viewpoints
[02:31:01.140 --> 02:31:03.100]   and by the way, permanently structured
[02:31:03.100 --> 02:31:04.500]   to have diverse viewpoints
[02:31:04.500 --> 02:31:07.500]   is a much better way to run a university
[02:31:07.500 --> 02:31:10.540]   than picking an academic that the faculty supports.
[02:31:10.540 --> 02:31:12.180]   Because one of the things I learned
[02:31:12.180 --> 02:31:14.020]   about how faculty get hired at universities,
[02:31:14.020 --> 02:31:17.340]   ultimately it's signed off by the board,
[02:31:17.340 --> 02:31:20.340]   but the new faculty are chosen
[02:31:20.340 --> 02:31:22.300]   by each of the various departments.
[02:31:22.300 --> 02:31:25.300]   And once the departments tip,
[02:31:25.300 --> 02:31:26.820]   there's sort of a tipping point politically
[02:31:26.820 --> 02:31:29.500]   where once they tip in one direction,
[02:31:29.500 --> 02:31:33.260]   the faculty recruit more people like themselves.
[02:31:33.260 --> 02:31:36.660]   And so the departments become more and more progressive,
[02:31:36.660 --> 02:31:38.060]   if you will, with the passage of time.
[02:31:38.060 --> 02:31:40.740]   And they only advance candidates that match their,
[02:31:40.740 --> 02:31:42.980]   that meet their political objectives.
[02:31:42.980 --> 02:31:47.140]   It's not a great way to build an institution
[02:31:47.140 --> 02:31:48.540]   which allows for--
[02:31:48.540 --> 02:31:50.260]   - Small D diversity.
[02:31:50.260 --> 02:31:53.020]   - Allows for, yeah, diversity.
[02:31:53.020 --> 02:31:56.820]   And diversity, by the way, is not just race and gender.
[02:31:56.820 --> 02:31:59.480]   And that's also something I feel very strongly about.
[02:31:59.480 --> 02:32:02.660]   - Well, luckily engineering robotics
[02:32:02.660 --> 02:32:04.140]   is touched last by this.
[02:32:04.140 --> 02:32:05.680]   It is touched, but you know,
[02:32:05.680 --> 02:32:10.620]   when I'm at the computing building,
[02:32:10.620 --> 02:32:14.340]   Stata and the new one, politics doesn't infiltrate,
[02:32:14.340 --> 02:32:17.460]   or I haven't seen it infiltrate quite as deeply as elsewhere.
[02:32:17.460 --> 02:32:19.860]   - It's in the biology department at Harvard,
[02:32:19.860 --> 02:32:22.060]   'cause biology is controversial now.
[02:32:22.060 --> 02:32:23.100]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[02:32:23.100 --> 02:32:25.340]   - 'Cause biology and gender, you know,
[02:32:25.340 --> 02:32:27.980]   there are faculty, there's a woman at Harvard
[02:32:27.980 --> 02:32:31.300]   who was literally canceled from faculty as a member,
[02:32:31.300 --> 02:32:33.000]   I think she was at the med school,
[02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:36.380]   and she was, you know, she made the argument
[02:32:36.380 --> 02:32:38.260]   that there are basically, you know,
[02:32:38.260 --> 02:32:40.780]   two genders determined by biology.
[02:32:40.780 --> 02:32:42.140]   She wasn't allowed to stay.
[02:32:42.140 --> 02:32:45.540]   That's another topic for another time.
[02:32:45.540 --> 02:32:47.380]   - That's another topic.
[02:32:47.380 --> 02:32:49.020]   - You should do a show on that one.
[02:32:49.020 --> 02:32:50.900]   That'd be an interesting one.
[02:32:50.900 --> 02:32:53.780]   - So as you said, technically, Claudine Gay,
[02:32:53.780 --> 02:32:58.080]   the president of Harvard, resigned over plagiarism,
[02:32:58.080 --> 02:33:01.620]   not over the thing that you were initially troubled by.
[02:33:01.620 --> 02:33:03.540]   - It's hard to really know, right?
[02:33:03.540 --> 02:33:05.140]   It's not like a provable fact.
[02:33:05.140 --> 02:33:06.420]   I would say at a certain point in time,
[02:33:06.420 --> 02:33:08.740]   she lost the confidence of the faculty,
[02:33:08.740 --> 02:33:10.420]   and that was ultimately the catalyst.
[02:33:10.420 --> 02:33:12.580]   And whether that was, how much of that
[02:33:12.580 --> 02:33:14.900]   was the plagiarism issue, and how much of that
[02:33:14.900 --> 02:33:16.500]   was some of the things that preceded it,
[02:33:16.500 --> 02:33:18.460]   or was it all of these issues in their entirety,
[02:33:18.460 --> 02:33:21.240]   we don't really, there's no way to do a calculus.
[02:33:21.240 --> 02:33:23.620]   - Can you explain the nature of this plagiarism
[02:33:23.620 --> 02:33:25.140]   from what you remember?
[02:33:25.140 --> 02:33:28.140]   - So Aaron Subbarium and Christopher Ruffo,
[02:33:28.140 --> 02:33:30.580]   one from the Free Beacon, and Chris, you know,
[02:33:30.580 --> 02:33:33.520]   surfaced some allegations on or identified
[02:33:33.520 --> 02:33:35.860]   some plagiarism issues that I would say
[02:33:35.860 --> 02:33:40.860]   the initial examples were use of the same words
[02:33:40.860 --> 02:33:45.260]   with proper attribution, some missing footnotes.
[02:33:45.260 --> 02:33:49.380]   And then over time, with, I guess, more digging,
[02:33:49.380 --> 02:33:52.020]   they released, I think, ultimately,
[02:33:52.020 --> 02:33:57.020]   something like 76 examples of what they call plagiarism
[02:33:57.020 --> 02:34:01.520]   in, I think, eight of 11 of her articles.
[02:34:01.520 --> 02:34:03.900]   And one of the other things that came forth here
[02:34:03.900 --> 02:34:06.180]   is, as president of the university,
[02:34:06.180 --> 02:34:07.940]   she had sort of the thinnest transcript,
[02:34:07.940 --> 02:34:10.500]   academically, of any previous president.
[02:34:10.500 --> 02:34:13.220]   You know, very small, relatively small body of work.
[02:34:13.220 --> 02:34:14.740]   And then when you couple that with the amount
[02:34:14.740 --> 02:34:16.660]   of plagiarism that was pervasive,
[02:34:16.660 --> 02:34:18.980]   and then, I guess, some of the other examples
[02:34:18.980 --> 02:34:20.680]   that surfaced were not missing quotation marks,
[02:34:20.680 --> 02:34:23.780]   where the authors of the work felt
[02:34:23.780 --> 02:34:26.360]   that their ideas had been stolen.
[02:34:26.360 --> 02:34:29.260]   And really, plagiarism is academic fraud.
[02:34:29.260 --> 02:34:32.000]   There are indicia, one indicia of plagiarism
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:33.140]   is a missing footnote.
[02:34:33.140 --> 02:34:35.040]   That could also be a clerical error.
[02:34:35.040 --> 02:34:39.540]   And so, when a professor's accused of plagiarism,
[02:34:39.540 --> 02:34:41.060]   the university does sort of a deep dive.
[02:34:41.060 --> 02:34:43.800]   They have these administrative boards,
[02:34:43.800 --> 02:34:46.740]   and it can take six months, nine months, a year,
[02:34:46.740 --> 02:34:50.740]   to evaluate, you know, intent matters.
[02:34:50.740 --> 02:34:53.660]   Was this intentional theft of another person's idea?
[02:34:53.660 --> 02:34:55.060]   That's academic fraud.
[02:34:55.060 --> 02:34:57.260]   Or was this sloppy, you know, you missed,
[02:34:57.260 --> 02:35:01.260]   or just humanity, right, you miss a footnote here or there.
[02:35:01.260 --> 02:35:04.600]   And I think once it got to a place
[02:35:04.600 --> 02:35:06.500]   where people felt it was theft
[02:35:06.500 --> 02:35:09.740]   of someone else's intellectual property,
[02:35:09.740 --> 02:35:11.980]   that's when it became intolerable
[02:35:11.980 --> 02:35:13.900]   for her to stay as president of Harvard.
[02:35:13.900 --> 02:35:15.500]   - So is there a spectrum for you
[02:35:15.500 --> 02:35:18.320]   between the different kinds of plagiarism,
[02:35:18.320 --> 02:35:23.320]   maybe plagiarizing words, and plagiarizing ideas,
[02:35:23.320 --> 02:35:28.540]   and plagiarizing novel ideas?
[02:35:28.540 --> 02:35:29.580]   - Of course.
[02:35:29.580 --> 02:35:31.220]   The common understanding of plagiarism,
[02:35:31.220 --> 02:35:34.140]   if you look in the dictionary, it's about theft.
[02:35:34.140 --> 02:35:37.700]   Theft requires a intent.
[02:35:37.700 --> 02:35:40.180]   Did the person intentionally take
[02:35:40.180 --> 02:35:42.940]   someone else's ideas or words?
[02:35:42.940 --> 02:35:47.940]   Now, if you're writing a novel, right, words matter more.
[02:35:47.940 --> 02:35:49.780]   Right, if you're taking Shakespeare
[02:35:49.780 --> 02:35:52.060]   and presenting it as your own words.
[02:35:52.060 --> 02:35:55.880]   If you're, you know, writing about ideas,
[02:35:55.880 --> 02:35:56.760]   you know, ideas matter,
[02:35:56.760 --> 02:35:58.520]   but you're not supposed to take someone else's words
[02:35:58.520 --> 02:36:00.980]   without properly acknowledging them,
[02:36:00.980 --> 02:36:03.780]   whether it's quotation marks or otherwise.
[02:36:03.780 --> 02:36:08.080]   But in the context of a academic's life's work before AI,
[02:36:08.080 --> 02:36:14.020]   everyone's gonna have missing quotation marks and footnotes.
[02:36:14.020 --> 02:36:15.980]   I remember writing my own thesis.
[02:36:15.980 --> 02:36:18.100]   You know, I would write, I would take,
[02:36:18.100 --> 02:36:20.140]   there were books you couldn't take out of Widener Library,
[02:36:20.140 --> 02:36:21.860]   so I'd have index cards,
[02:36:21.860 --> 02:36:23.660]   and I'd write stuff on index cards,
[02:36:23.660 --> 02:36:24.720]   and I'd put a little citation
[02:36:24.720 --> 02:36:27.860]   to make sure I remember to cite it properly.
[02:36:27.860 --> 02:36:30.500]   And, you know, scrambling to do your thesis,
[02:36:30.500 --> 02:36:32.480]   get it in on time.
[02:36:32.480 --> 02:36:34.460]   What's the chances you forget at what point
[02:36:34.460 --> 02:36:36.700]   what are your words versus the author's words,
[02:36:36.700 --> 02:36:38.860]   and you forgot to put quotation marks?
[02:36:38.860 --> 02:36:42.780]   Just the humanity, you know, the human fallibility of it.
[02:36:42.780 --> 02:36:44.780]   So, you know, you don't get,
[02:36:44.780 --> 02:36:48.100]   it's not academic fraud to have human fallibility,
[02:36:48.100 --> 02:36:50.700]   but it's academic fraud if you take someone else's ideas
[02:36:50.700 --> 02:36:53.460]   that are an integral part of your work.
[02:36:53.460 --> 02:36:56.500]   - Is there a part of you that regrets that,
[02:36:56.500 --> 02:36:59.020]   at least from the perception of it,
[02:36:59.020 --> 02:37:01.660]   the president of Harvard stepped down over plagiarism
[02:37:01.660 --> 02:37:05.420]   versus over refusing to say
[02:37:05.420 --> 02:37:09.020]   that the calls for genocide are wrong?
[02:37:09.020 --> 02:37:11.980]   - Again, I think it would have sent a better message
[02:37:11.980 --> 02:37:15.880]   if a leader fails as a leader,
[02:37:15.880 --> 02:37:20.380]   and that's the reason for their resignation or dismissal,
[02:37:20.380 --> 02:37:24.220]   then she gets, if you will, caught on a technical violation
[02:37:24.220 --> 02:37:26.300]   that had nothing to do with failed leadership,
[02:37:26.300 --> 02:37:29.100]   because I don't know what lesson that,
[02:37:29.100 --> 02:37:31.580]   you know, what lesson that teaches the board
[02:37:31.580 --> 02:37:32.780]   about selecting the next candidate.
[02:37:32.780 --> 02:37:34.500]   I mean, the future of Harvard,
[02:37:34.500 --> 02:37:36.100]   a lot of it's gonna depend on who they pick
[02:37:36.100 --> 02:37:37.920]   as the next leader.
[02:37:37.920 --> 02:37:40.620]   Here's an interesting anecdote
[02:37:40.620 --> 02:37:44.560]   that I think has not surfaced publicly.
[02:37:44.560 --> 02:37:46.540]   So a guy named Larry Bacow
[02:37:46.540 --> 02:37:48.580]   was the previous president of Harvard.
[02:37:48.580 --> 02:37:50.900]   Larry Bacow was on the search committee,
[02:37:50.900 --> 02:37:53.700]   and they were looking for a new president.
[02:37:53.700 --> 02:37:57.340]   And what was strange was they picked an old white guy
[02:37:57.340 --> 02:37:59.900]   to be president of Harvard
[02:37:59.900 --> 02:38:03.060]   when there was a call for a more diverse president.
[02:38:03.060 --> 02:38:07.860]   And what I learned was Harvard actually ran a process,
[02:38:07.860 --> 02:38:11.320]   had a diverse new president of Harvard,
[02:38:11.320 --> 02:38:14.340]   and in the due diligence on that candidate
[02:38:14.340 --> 02:38:17.300]   shortly before the announcement of the new president,
[02:38:17.300 --> 02:38:19.780]   they found out that that presidential candidate
[02:38:19.780 --> 02:38:21.020]   had a plagiarism problem.
[02:38:22.220 --> 02:38:23.900]   And the search had gone on long enough.
[02:38:23.900 --> 02:38:26.780]   They couldn't restart a search to find another candidate.
[02:38:26.780 --> 02:38:29.340]   So they picked Larry Bacow off the board,
[02:38:29.340 --> 02:38:32.060]   off the search committee to be the next president of Harvard
[02:38:32.060 --> 02:38:33.660]   as kind of an interim solution.
[02:38:33.660 --> 02:38:37.220]   And then there was that much more pressure
[02:38:37.220 --> 02:38:39.700]   to have a more diverse candidate this time around,
[02:38:39.700 --> 02:38:42.220]   'cause it was a big disappointment to the DEI office,
[02:38:42.220 --> 02:38:44.940]   if you will, and I would say to the community at large.
[02:38:44.940 --> 02:38:47.780]   Harvard, of all places, couldn't have a,
[02:38:47.780 --> 02:38:50.340]   you know, a racially diverse president.
[02:38:50.340 --> 02:38:51.740]   It's an important message.
[02:38:51.740 --> 02:38:58.500]   So the strange thing is that they didn't do due diligence
[02:38:58.500 --> 02:39:00.700]   on President Gay,
[02:39:00.700 --> 02:39:03.340]   and that it was a relatively quick process.
[02:39:03.340 --> 02:39:05.420]   So the whole thing I think is worthy
[02:39:05.420 --> 02:39:08.340]   of further, you know, exploration.
[02:39:08.340 --> 02:39:10.820]   - So this goes deeper than just the president.
[02:39:10.820 --> 02:39:11.700]   - Yeah, for sure.
[02:39:11.700 --> 02:39:15.200]   When a company fails, most people blame the CEO.
[02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:18.460]   I generally blame the board, right?
[02:39:18.460 --> 02:39:19.860]   'Cause the board's job is to make sure
[02:39:19.860 --> 02:39:21.060]   the right person's running the company,
[02:39:21.060 --> 02:39:23.100]   and if they're failing, help the person.
[02:39:23.100 --> 02:39:25.780]   If they can't help the person, make a change.
[02:39:25.780 --> 02:39:27.220]   That's not what's happened here.
[02:39:27.220 --> 02:39:30.260]   The board's hand was sort of forced from the outside,
[02:39:30.260 --> 02:39:31.420]   whereas they should have made their own decision
[02:39:31.420 --> 02:39:32.860]   from the inside.
[02:39:32.860 --> 02:39:34.540]   - Do you still love Harvard?
[02:39:34.540 --> 02:39:35.580]   - Sure.
[02:39:35.580 --> 02:39:39.420]   It's a 400-odd-year institution.
[02:39:39.420 --> 02:39:43.900]   It's enormously helpful to me in my life, I'm sure.
[02:39:43.900 --> 02:39:46.760]   My sister also went to Harvard.
[02:39:47.780 --> 02:39:51.660]   And, you know, the experiences,
[02:39:51.660 --> 02:39:54.880]   learnings, friendships, relationships.
[02:39:54.880 --> 02:39:58.780]   You know, again, I'm very happy with my life.
[02:39:58.780 --> 02:40:00.220]   Harvard was an important part of my life.
[02:40:00.220 --> 02:40:02.220]   I went there for both undergrad and business school.
[02:40:02.220 --> 02:40:04.900]   I learned a ton, met a lot of faculty,
[02:40:04.900 --> 02:40:06.580]   a lot from a number of my closest friends,
[02:40:06.580 --> 02:40:10.500]   who I still really keep in touch with, high, mid, then.
[02:40:10.500 --> 02:40:15.500]   So yeah, it's a great place, but it needs a reboot.
[02:40:15.500 --> 02:40:17.660]   - Yeah, I still have hope.
[02:40:17.660 --> 02:40:21.020]   I think universities are really important institutions.
[02:40:21.020 --> 02:40:21.860]   - You know, when I went to Harvard,
[02:40:21.860 --> 02:40:23.420]   there were 1,600 people in my class.
[02:40:23.420 --> 02:40:26.420]   I think today's class is about the same size.
[02:40:26.420 --> 02:40:28.700]   And their online education
[02:40:28.700 --> 02:40:31.660]   really has not sort of taken off, right?
[02:40:31.660 --> 02:40:34.180]   So I heard Peter Thiel speak at one point in time,
[02:40:34.180 --> 02:40:38.380]   and he's like, what great institution do you know
[02:40:38.380 --> 02:40:43.380]   that's truly great that hasn't grown in 100 years, right?
[02:40:44.620 --> 02:40:49.020]   And the incentives, in some sense, of the alums are for,
[02:40:49.020 --> 02:40:50.900]   it's a bit like a club.
[02:40:50.900 --> 02:40:53.100]   If you're proud of the elitism of the club,
[02:40:53.100 --> 02:40:54.820]   you don't want that many new members.
[02:40:54.820 --> 02:40:57.980]   But the fact that the population has grown of the country
[02:40:57.980 --> 02:41:00.540]   is so, you know, significantly,
[02:41:00.540 --> 02:41:03.880]   since certainly I was a student in 1984,
[02:41:03.880 --> 02:41:05.940]   and the fact that Harvard recruits people
[02:41:05.940 --> 02:41:07.460]   from all over the world,
[02:41:07.460 --> 02:41:09.740]   it's really serving a smaller and smaller percentage
[02:41:09.740 --> 02:41:11.460]   of the population today.
[02:41:11.460 --> 02:41:13.140]   And, you know, some of our most talented
[02:41:13.140 --> 02:41:16.860]   and successful entrepreneurs, anyway.
[02:41:16.860 --> 02:41:19.900]   You know, it's a token of success
[02:41:19.900 --> 02:41:22.580]   that they didn't make it through their undergraduate years.
[02:41:22.580 --> 02:41:24.020]   You know, they left as a freshman,
[02:41:24.020 --> 02:41:25.460]   or they didn't attend at all.
[02:41:25.460 --> 02:41:28.220]   - For entrepreneurs, yes, but it's still a place.
[02:41:28.220 --> 02:41:30.500]   - Very important for research,
[02:41:30.500 --> 02:41:32.540]   very important for advancing ideas.
[02:41:32.540 --> 02:41:36.340]   And yes, in shaping dialogue
[02:41:36.340 --> 02:41:40.700]   and the next generation of Supreme Court justices.
[02:41:40.700 --> 02:41:45.160]   And, you know, members of government, politicians.
[02:41:45.160 --> 02:41:46.660]   So yes, it's critically important,
[02:41:46.660 --> 02:41:51.660]   but it's not doing the job it should be doing.
[02:41:51.660 --> 02:41:55.900]   - Neri Oxman, somebody you mentioned several times
[02:41:55.900 --> 02:41:56.740]   throughout this podcast,
[02:41:56.740 --> 02:42:00.180]   somebody I had a wonderful conversation with,
[02:42:00.180 --> 02:42:02.580]   a friendship with, I've known,
[02:42:02.580 --> 02:42:03.940]   looked up to her, admired her,
[02:42:03.940 --> 02:42:06.660]   has been a fan, I've been a fan of hers for a long time,
[02:42:06.660 --> 02:42:09.600]   of her work, and of her as a human being.
[02:42:10.660 --> 02:42:12.540]   Looks like you're a fan of hers as well.
[02:42:12.540 --> 02:42:13.380]   - Yes.
[02:42:13.380 --> 02:42:16.380]   - What do you love about Neri?
[02:42:16.380 --> 02:42:18.020]   What do you admire about her as a scientist,
[02:42:18.020 --> 02:42:19.540]   artist, human being?
[02:42:19.540 --> 02:42:23.940]   - I think she's the most beautiful person I've ever met.
[02:42:23.940 --> 02:42:26.620]   And I mean that from like the center of her soul.
[02:42:26.620 --> 02:42:32.460]   She's the most caring, warm, considerate,
[02:42:32.460 --> 02:42:36.980]   you know, thoughtful person I've ever met.
[02:42:36.980 --> 02:42:41.980]   And she couples those remarkable qualities
[02:42:41.980 --> 02:42:45.420]   with brilliance, incredible creativity,
[02:42:45.420 --> 02:42:48.760]   beauty, elegance, grace.
[02:42:48.760 --> 02:42:51.860]   Yeah, I'm talking about my wife,
[02:42:51.860 --> 02:42:55.240]   but I'm talking incredibly dispassionately.
[02:42:55.240 --> 02:42:58.620]   But I mean what I say.
[02:42:58.620 --> 02:43:01.300]   She's the most remarkable person I've ever met.
[02:43:01.300 --> 02:43:03.580]   And I've met a lot of remarkable people.
[02:43:03.580 --> 02:43:06.220]   And I'm incredibly fortunate to spend
[02:43:06.220 --> 02:43:09.580]   a very high percentage of my lifetime with her,
[02:43:09.580 --> 02:43:13.980]   ever since I met her, you know, six years ago.
[02:43:13.980 --> 02:43:15.540]   - So she's been a help to you
[02:43:15.540 --> 02:43:17.580]   through some of the rough moments you described?
[02:43:17.580 --> 02:43:18.420]   - For sure.
[02:43:18.420 --> 02:43:19.880]   I mean, I met her at the bottom,
[02:43:19.880 --> 02:43:23.660]   which is not a bad place to meet someone, if it works out.
[02:43:23.660 --> 02:43:27.700]   - Is there some degree of yin and yang
[02:43:27.700 --> 02:43:29.300]   with the two personalities you have?
[02:43:29.300 --> 02:43:33.060]   You have described yourself as emotional and so on,
[02:43:33.060 --> 02:43:35.860]   but it does seem the two of you
[02:43:35.860 --> 02:43:37.420]   have slightly different styles
[02:43:37.420 --> 02:43:39.020]   about how you approach the world.
[02:43:39.020 --> 02:43:41.420]   - Oh, well, interestingly, we have a lot alike.
[02:43:41.420 --> 02:43:45.620]   You know, we come from very similar places in the world.
[02:43:45.620 --> 02:43:47.020]   You know, there are times where you feel like
[02:43:47.020 --> 02:43:48.980]   we've known each other for centuries.
[02:43:48.980 --> 02:43:51.340]   You know, I met her parents for the first time,
[02:43:51.340 --> 02:43:55.780]   you know, a long time ago, almost six years ago as well.
[02:43:55.780 --> 02:43:59.740]   And I knew her parents were from Eastern Europe originally.
[02:43:59.740 --> 02:44:01.780]   So I asked her father, like, what, you know,
[02:44:01.780 --> 02:44:05.220]   what city did her family come from originally?
[02:44:05.220 --> 02:44:08.540]   And I called my father and asked him, you know,
[02:44:08.540 --> 02:44:10.580]   "Dad, what's, you know, Grandpa Abraham,
[02:44:10.580 --> 02:44:13.460]   where's he from, what's the name of the city?"
[02:44:13.460 --> 02:44:16.940]   And then I put the two cities into Google Maps
[02:44:16.940 --> 02:44:20.260]   and they were 52 miles apart, which I thought was pretty cool.
[02:44:20.260 --> 02:44:23.580]   Then of course, at some point we did genetic testing,
[02:44:23.580 --> 02:44:24.820]   (both laughing)
[02:44:24.820 --> 02:44:27.660]   make sure we weren't related, which we were not.
[02:44:27.660 --> 02:44:31.360]   But we share incredible commonality on values.
[02:44:31.360 --> 02:44:35.060]   We are attracted to the same kind of people.
[02:44:35.060 --> 02:44:37.780]   You know, she loves my friends, I love hers.
[02:44:37.780 --> 02:44:40.340]   We love doing the same kind of things.
[02:44:40.340 --> 02:44:43.020]   We're attracted to, you know,
[02:44:43.020 --> 02:44:44.820]   we like spending time the same ways.
[02:44:44.820 --> 02:44:51.060]   And she has, yes, more emotion, more elegance.
[02:44:51.060 --> 02:44:55.340]   She doesn't like battles, but she's very strong.
[02:44:57.140 --> 02:44:58.780]   But she's more sensitive than I am.
[02:44:58.780 --> 02:45:02.380]   - Yeah, you are constantly in multiple battles
[02:45:02.380 --> 02:45:07.380]   at the same time, and there's often the media,
[02:45:07.380 --> 02:45:11.220]   social media, it's just fire everywhere.
[02:45:11.220 --> 02:45:14.520]   - You know, that hasn't really been the case for a while.
[02:45:14.520 --> 02:45:16.740]   I've had relative peace for a long time,
[02:45:16.740 --> 02:45:19.260]   'cause as I stopped being, as I haven't had to be
[02:45:19.260 --> 02:45:22.420]   the kind of activist I was earlier in my career,
[02:45:22.420 --> 02:45:23.940]   I think since October 7th, yes,
[02:45:23.940 --> 02:45:25.740]   I do feel like I've been in a war.
[02:45:25.740 --> 02:45:30.740]   - Can you tell me the saga of the accusations against Neri?
[02:45:30.740 --> 02:45:36.220]   - So I did not actually surface the plagiarism allegations
[02:45:36.220 --> 02:45:39.100]   against President Gay that were surfaced by, you know,
[02:45:39.100 --> 02:45:42.060]   Aaron and maybe Christopher Ruffo as well,
[02:45:42.060 --> 02:45:45.100]   or maybe Chris helped promote what Aaron
[02:45:45.100 --> 02:45:50.100]   and some anonymous person identified.
[02:45:50.100 --> 02:45:51.860]   But I certainly, it was a point in time
[02:45:51.860 --> 02:45:54.480]   where the board had said we're 100% behind her,
[02:45:54.480 --> 02:45:58.020]   and unanimously, and I really felt she had to go.
[02:45:58.020 --> 02:45:59.660]   So it didn't bother me at all
[02:45:59.660 --> 02:46:02.340]   that they had identified problems with her work.
[02:46:02.340 --> 02:46:05.980]   So I shared, I reposted those posts,
[02:46:05.980 --> 02:46:08.340]   and then when the board, she ultimately resigned,
[02:46:08.340 --> 02:46:11.340]   and she got a $900,000 a year professorship
[02:46:11.340 --> 02:46:12.940]   continuing at Harvard, I said, look,
[02:46:12.940 --> 02:46:15.820]   in light of her limited academic record
[02:46:15.820 --> 02:46:19.520]   and these plagiarism allegations, she had to go.
[02:46:21.660 --> 02:46:24.520]   I knew when I did so, I assumed,
[02:46:24.520 --> 02:46:26.080]   I was actually a bit paranoid
[02:46:26.080 --> 02:46:28.320]   about that thesis I had written.
[02:46:28.320 --> 02:46:29.780]   I only had one academic work,
[02:46:29.780 --> 02:46:32.720]   but I hadn't checked it for plagiarism,
[02:46:32.720 --> 02:46:35.480]   and I thought that's gonna happen.
[02:46:35.480 --> 02:46:39.680]   Actually, I had someone, I did not have a copy on hand,
[02:46:39.680 --> 02:46:44.160]   so I got a copy of my thesis, and I remember writing it.
[02:46:44.160 --> 02:46:46.080]   Harvard at the time was pretty,
[02:46:46.080 --> 02:46:47.080]   they kind of give you a lecture
[02:46:47.080 --> 02:46:49.000]   about making sure you have all your footnotes
[02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:50.600]   and quotation marks.
[02:46:50.600 --> 02:46:53.340]   I learned later that apparently they had a copy
[02:46:53.340 --> 02:46:55.900]   of my thesis at the New York Public Library,
[02:46:55.900 --> 02:47:00.900]   and a member of the media told me he was there online
[02:47:00.900 --> 02:47:03.820]   with a dozen other members of the media,
[02:47:03.820 --> 02:47:06.420]   all trying to get a copy of my thesis
[02:47:06.420 --> 02:47:08.340]   to run it through some AI.
[02:47:08.340 --> 02:47:10.200]   They had to first do optical character recognition
[02:47:10.200 --> 02:47:13.640]   to convert the paper document into digital,
[02:47:13.640 --> 02:47:18.820]   but fortunately, through a miracle, I didn't have an issue.
[02:47:19.700 --> 02:47:21.500]   I didn't think about Nary, of course,
[02:47:21.500 --> 02:47:25.660]   who has whatever, 130 academic works,
[02:47:25.660 --> 02:47:28.680]   and so we were just at the end of a vacation
[02:47:28.680 --> 02:47:33.680]   for Christmas break, and I was early in the morning
[02:47:33.680 --> 02:47:36.660]   for vacation time, and all of a sudden,
[02:47:36.660 --> 02:47:38.460]   I hear my phone ringing in the other room,
[02:47:38.460 --> 02:47:40.260]   or vibrating in the other room multiple times.
[02:47:40.260 --> 02:47:41.460]   I'm like, "Hmm."
[02:47:41.460 --> 02:47:42.640]   I pick up the phone.
[02:47:42.640 --> 02:47:45.480]   It's our communication guy, Fran McGill,
[02:47:45.480 --> 02:47:47.900]   and he's like, "Bill, Business Insider
[02:47:47.900 --> 02:47:49.820]   has apparently identified a number of instances
[02:47:49.820 --> 02:47:52.260]   of plagiarism in Nary's dissertation.
[02:47:52.260 --> 02:47:53.220]   Let me send you this email."
[02:47:53.220 --> 02:47:58.060]   He sent me the email, and they had identified
[02:47:58.060 --> 02:48:01.260]   four paragraphs in her 330-page dissertation
[02:48:01.260 --> 02:48:03.200]   where she had cited the author,
[02:48:03.200 --> 02:48:06.260]   but she had used the vast majority of the words,
[02:48:06.260 --> 02:48:08.260]   and those paragraphs were from the author,
[02:48:08.260 --> 02:48:10.460]   and she should have used quotation marks,
[02:48:10.460 --> 02:48:11.420]   and then there was one case
[02:48:11.420 --> 02:48:15.700]   where she paraphrased correctly an author,
[02:48:15.700 --> 02:48:20.020]   but did not footnote that it was from his work,
[02:48:20.020 --> 02:48:23.340]   and so we were presented with this,
[02:48:23.340 --> 02:48:25.060]   and told they're gonna publish in a few hours,
[02:48:25.060 --> 02:48:26.500]   and we're like, "Well, can we get to the next day?
[02:48:26.500 --> 02:48:28.180]   We're just about to head home,"
[02:48:28.180 --> 02:48:30.620]   and they're like, "No, we're publishing by noon.
[02:48:30.620 --> 02:48:32.260]   We need an answer by noon,"
[02:48:32.260 --> 02:48:35.860]   and so we downloaded the copy of her thesis
[02:48:35.860 --> 02:48:39.960]   on the slow internet, and Nary checked it out,
[02:48:39.960 --> 02:48:40.900]   and she said, "You know what?
[02:48:40.900 --> 02:48:43.000]   Looks like they're right," and I said,
[02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.180]   "Look, you should just admit your mistake,"
[02:48:45.180 --> 02:48:48.580]   and she wrote a very simple, gracious,
[02:48:48.580 --> 02:48:51.940]   "Yes, I should have used quotation marks,"
[02:48:51.940 --> 02:48:54.900]   and on the author I failed to cite,
[02:48:54.900 --> 02:48:56.820]   she pointed out that she cited them eight other times
[02:48:56.820 --> 02:48:59.740]   and wrote a several-paragraph section of her thesis
[02:48:59.740 --> 02:49:01.780]   acknowledging his work,
[02:49:01.780 --> 02:49:05.160]   and none of these were important parts of her thesis,
[02:49:05.160 --> 02:49:06.220]   but she acknowledged her mistake,
[02:49:06.220 --> 02:49:08.420]   and she said, "I apologize for my mistake,"
[02:49:08.420 --> 02:49:11.840]   and I apologized to the author who I failed to cite,
[02:49:11.840 --> 02:49:12.980]   and I stand on the shoulders
[02:49:12.980 --> 02:49:15.620]   of all the people who came before me
[02:49:15.620 --> 02:49:17.660]   and looking to advance work,
[02:49:17.660 --> 02:49:19.540]   and we sort of thought it was over.
[02:49:19.540 --> 02:49:20.380]   We head home.
[02:49:20.380 --> 02:49:23.780]   In flight on the way home,
[02:49:23.780 --> 02:49:25.700]   although we didn't realize this till we got back
[02:49:25.700 --> 02:49:27.980]   the following day, Business Insider published
[02:49:27.980 --> 02:49:29.560]   another article and said,
[02:49:29.560 --> 02:49:32.900]   "Nary Oxman admits to plagiarism."
[02:49:32.900 --> 02:49:35.420]   Plagiarism, of course, is academic fraud,
[02:49:35.420 --> 02:49:37.300]   and this thing goes crazy viral.
[02:49:37.300 --> 02:49:40.280]   Oh, Bill, the title is Bill Ackman's Wife.
[02:49:41.100 --> 02:49:44.060]   Celebrity academic Nary Oxman,
[02:49:44.060 --> 02:49:45.380]   and they use the term celebrity
[02:49:45.380 --> 02:49:48.700]   because there are limits
[02:49:48.700 --> 02:49:51.740]   to what legitimate media can go after,
[02:49:51.740 --> 02:49:55.900]   but celebrities, there's a lot more leeway in the media
[02:49:55.900 --> 02:49:56.740]   and what they can say,
[02:49:56.740 --> 02:49:58.420]   so that's why they call her a celebrity.
[02:49:58.420 --> 02:50:00.680]   First time ever she'd been called a celebrity,
[02:50:00.680 --> 02:50:06.580]   and they basically, she's admitting to academic fraud,
[02:50:06.580 --> 02:50:09.860]   and then they said, and then the next day,
[02:50:10.700 --> 02:50:14.160]   at 5.19 p.m., I remember the timeline pretty well,
[02:50:14.160 --> 02:50:17.500]   an email was sent to Fran McGill saying,
[02:50:17.500 --> 02:50:21.820]   you know, we've identified, you know,
[02:50:21.820 --> 02:50:25.580]   two dozen other instances of plagiarism in her work,
[02:50:25.580 --> 02:50:27.380]   15 of which are Wikipedia entries
[02:50:27.380 --> 02:50:29.380]   where she copied definitions,
[02:50:29.380 --> 02:50:32.180]   and the others were mostly software,
[02:50:32.180 --> 02:50:34.980]   hardware manuals for various devices
[02:50:34.980 --> 02:50:37.100]   or software she used in her work,
[02:50:37.100 --> 02:50:38.220]   most of which were in footnotes
[02:50:38.220 --> 02:50:40.860]   where she described a nozzle for a 3D printer
[02:50:40.860 --> 02:50:42.020]   or something like this,
[02:50:42.020 --> 02:50:45.660]   and they said, we're publishing, you know, tonight.
[02:50:45.660 --> 02:50:50.420]   The email they sent to us was 6,900 words,
[02:50:50.420 --> 02:50:53.180]   it was 12 pages, it was practically indecipherable,
[02:50:53.180 --> 02:50:55.820]   you couldn't even read it in an hour,
[02:50:55.820 --> 02:50:57.140]   and we didn't have some of the documents
[02:50:57.140 --> 02:50:59.000]   they were referring to,
[02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.140]   and I'm like, Nary, you know what I'm gonna do?
[02:51:01.140 --> 02:51:03.640]   I think it'll be useful to provide context here.
[02:51:05.260 --> 02:51:06.100]   I'm gonna do a review
[02:51:06.100 --> 02:51:08.820]   of every MIT professor's dissertations,
[02:51:08.820 --> 02:51:11.240]   every published paper, AI has enabled this,
[02:51:11.240 --> 02:51:15.340]   and so that was, I put out a tweet basically saying that,
[02:51:15.340 --> 02:51:17.100]   and we're doing a test run now,
[02:51:17.100 --> 02:51:18.100]   'cause we have to get it right,
[02:51:18.100 --> 02:51:20.060]   and I think it'll be a useful exercise,
[02:51:20.060 --> 02:51:21.820]   provide some context, if you will,
[02:51:21.820 --> 02:51:25.180]   and then this thing goes crazy viral,
[02:51:25.180 --> 02:51:30.580]   and, you know, Nary is a pretty sensitive person,
[02:51:30.580 --> 02:51:32.460]   pretty emotional person,
[02:51:32.460 --> 02:51:35.060]   and someone who's a perfectionist,
[02:51:35.060 --> 02:51:36.420]   and having everyone in the world
[02:51:36.420 --> 02:51:37.820]   thinking you committed academic fraud
[02:51:37.820 --> 02:51:39.340]   is a pretty damning thing.
[02:51:39.340 --> 02:51:41.740]   Now, they did say they did a thorough review
[02:51:41.740 --> 02:51:43.900]   of all of her work, and this is what they found,
[02:51:43.900 --> 02:51:46.220]   and I'm like, sweetheart, that's remarkable,
[02:51:46.220 --> 02:51:49.420]   right, you did 130 works, 73 of which were peer-reviewed,
[02:51:49.420 --> 02:51:51.380]   blah, blah, blah, and she's published in Nature Science
[02:51:51.380 --> 02:51:53.020]   and all these different publications,
[02:51:53.020 --> 02:51:56.120]   so that's actually, that's a pretty good batting average,
[02:51:56.120 --> 02:52:00.060]   but, you know, they can't, this is wrong, right?
[02:52:00.060 --> 02:52:01.920]   This is not academic fraud, okay,
[02:52:01.920 --> 02:52:03.220]   these are inadvertent mistakes,
[02:52:03.220 --> 02:52:04.460]   and the Wikipedia entries,
[02:52:04.460 --> 02:52:06.420]   Nary actually used Wikipedia as a dictionary,
[02:52:06.420 --> 02:52:08.380]   this is the early days of Wikipedia,
[02:52:08.380 --> 02:52:11.260]   and they also referred to the MIT handbook,
[02:52:11.260 --> 02:52:14.820]   which has a whole section on plagiarism, academic handbook,
[02:52:14.820 --> 02:52:17.900]   and if you read it, which I ultimately did,
[02:52:17.900 --> 02:52:20.220]   they make clear a few things.
[02:52:20.220 --> 02:52:23.540]   Number one, there's plagiarism, academic fraud,
[02:52:23.540 --> 02:52:26.180]   and there's what they call inadvertent plagiarism,
[02:52:26.180 --> 02:52:28.740]   which is clerical errors where you make a mistake,
[02:52:28.740 --> 02:52:30.500]   and it depends on intent,
[02:52:30.500 --> 02:52:33.460]   and there's a link that you can go to,
[02:52:33.460 --> 02:52:36.260]   which is a section on, if you get investigated at MIT,
[02:52:36.260 --> 02:52:37.760]   what happens, what's the procedure,
[02:52:37.760 --> 02:52:40.060]   what's the initial stage, what's the investigative stage,
[02:52:40.060 --> 02:52:42.940]   what's the procedure, if they identify it,
[02:52:42.940 --> 02:52:46.740]   and they make very clear that academic fraud is,
[02:52:46.740 --> 02:52:49.940]   and they list plagiarism, you know, research theft,
[02:52:49.940 --> 02:52:54.140]   a few other things, but it does not include honest errors.
[02:52:54.140 --> 02:52:57.980]   Honest errors are not plagiarism under MIT's own policies,
[02:52:57.980 --> 02:53:00.660]   and in the handbook, they also have a big section
[02:53:00.660 --> 02:53:03.100]   on what they call common knowledge,
[02:53:03.100 --> 02:53:04.500]   and common knowledge depends
[02:53:04.500 --> 02:53:06.420]   on who you're writing your thesis for,
[02:53:06.420 --> 02:53:12.100]   and so if it's a fact that is known by your audience,
[02:53:12.100 --> 02:53:14.460]   you're not required to quote or cite,
[02:53:14.460 --> 02:53:16.100]   and so all those Wikipedia entries
[02:53:16.100 --> 02:53:17.900]   were for things like sustainable design,
[02:53:17.900 --> 02:53:18.940]   computer-aided design.
[02:53:18.940 --> 02:53:21.260]   She just took a definition from Wikipedia,
[02:53:21.260 --> 02:53:24.500]   common knowledge to her readers,
[02:53:24.500 --> 02:53:28.060]   no obligation under the handbook, totally exempt.
[02:53:28.060 --> 02:53:31.540]   On the, using the same words, she referred to,
[02:53:31.540 --> 02:53:33.820]   like, whatever, some kind of 3D printer.
[02:53:33.820 --> 02:53:36.060]   She was, the Stratasys 3D printer,
[02:53:36.060 --> 02:53:38.380]   and she quoted from the manual, right away.
[02:53:38.380 --> 02:53:40.060]   Stratasys is a company you've consulted for,
[02:53:40.060 --> 02:53:42.500]   they're very, you don't need to, that's not something,
[02:53:42.500 --> 02:53:43.580]   you're not stealing their ideas,
[02:53:43.580 --> 02:53:46.180]   you're describing a nozzle for a device
[02:53:46.180 --> 02:53:48.060]   you use in your work in a footnote.
[02:53:48.060 --> 02:53:50.720]   That's not a theft of idea, right?
[02:53:50.720 --> 02:53:54.160]   And so I'm like, this is crazy,
[02:53:54.160 --> 02:53:56.780]   and so this has gotta stop.
[02:53:56.780 --> 02:54:01.220]   And so I reach out to the, a guy I knew
[02:54:01.220 --> 02:54:03.420]   was on the board of Business Insider, the chairman,
[02:54:03.420 --> 02:54:05.860]   and his name is gonna come public shortly.
[02:54:05.860 --> 02:54:09.500]   I committed to that time to keep his name confidential.
[02:54:09.500 --> 02:54:11.620]   It's now surfaced publicly in the press.
[02:54:11.620 --> 02:54:13.580]   - Can I just pause real quick here?
[02:54:13.580 --> 02:54:17.300]   Just to, I don't know, there's a lot of things
[02:54:17.300 --> 02:54:20.460]   I wanna say, but you made it pretty clear,
[02:54:20.460 --> 02:54:23.040]   but just as a member of the community,
[02:54:24.100 --> 02:54:27.060]   there's also a common sense test.
[02:54:27.060 --> 02:54:31.700]   I think you're more precisely legal and looking at,
[02:54:31.700 --> 02:54:34.060]   but there's just a bullshit test,
[02:54:34.060 --> 02:54:38.520]   and nothing that Nary did is plagiarism
[02:54:38.520 --> 02:54:41.260]   in the bad meaning of the word.
[02:54:41.260 --> 02:54:43.740]   Plagiarism right now is becoming another ism,
[02:54:43.740 --> 02:54:47.100]   like racism or so on, using as an attack word.
[02:54:47.100 --> 02:54:48.760]   I don't care what the meaning of it is,
[02:54:48.760 --> 02:54:52.300]   but there's the bad academic fraud, like theft.
[02:54:52.300 --> 02:54:55.540]   Theft of an idea, and maybe you can say
[02:54:55.540 --> 02:54:57.540]   a lot of definitions and this kind of stuff,
[02:54:57.540 --> 02:54:59.860]   but then there's just a basic bullshit test
[02:54:59.860 --> 02:55:02.720]   where everyone knows this is a thief,
[02:55:02.720 --> 02:55:05.340]   and this is definitely not a thief.
[02:55:05.340 --> 02:55:08.580]   And there's nothing about anything that Nary did,
[02:55:08.580 --> 02:55:12.420]   anything, in her thesis or in her life,
[02:55:12.420 --> 02:55:16.340]   everyone that knows her, she's a rock star, right?
[02:55:16.340 --> 02:55:19.540]   I just wanna make it clear, it really hurt me
[02:55:19.540 --> 02:55:21.620]   that the internet, whatever is happening,
[02:55:21.620 --> 02:55:26.620]   could go after, could go after a great scientist,
[02:55:26.620 --> 02:55:29.380]   'cause I love science,
[02:55:29.380 --> 02:55:32.040]   and I love celebrating great scientists,
[02:55:32.040 --> 02:55:37.420]   and it's just really messed up that whatever the machine,
[02:55:37.420 --> 02:55:40.660]   we could talk about business inside or whatever,
[02:55:40.660 --> 02:55:45.420]   social media, mass hysteria, whatever is happening,
[02:55:45.420 --> 02:55:48.580]   like we need the great scientists of the world,
[02:55:48.580 --> 02:55:50.620]   'cause that's like the future depends on them,
[02:55:50.620 --> 02:55:52.820]   and so we need to celebrate them and protect them
[02:55:52.820 --> 02:55:56.300]   and let them flourish and let them do their thing,
[02:55:56.300 --> 02:56:00.240]   and keep them out of this, whatever shitstorm
[02:56:00.240 --> 02:56:03.020]   that we're doing to get clips and advertisements
[02:56:03.020 --> 02:56:05.860]   and drama and all this, we need to protect them.
[02:56:05.860 --> 02:56:08.620]   So I just wanna say there's nobody I know,
[02:56:08.620 --> 02:56:13.380]   and a million friends that are scientists,
[02:56:13.380 --> 02:56:15.460]   world-class scientists, Nobel Prize winners,
[02:56:15.460 --> 02:56:18.340]   they all love Nary, they all respect Nary,
[02:56:18.340 --> 02:56:22.460]   she did zero wrong, and then the rest of the conversation
[02:56:22.460 --> 02:56:25.180]   we're gonna have about how broken journalism is and so on,
[02:56:25.180 --> 02:56:28.260]   but I just wanna say that there's nothing
[02:56:28.260 --> 02:56:31.780]   that Nary did wrong, it's not a gray area or so on.
[02:56:31.780 --> 02:56:35.940]   I also personally don't love that Claudine Gay
[02:56:35.940 --> 02:56:37.940]   is a discussion about plagiarism,
[02:56:37.940 --> 02:56:42.200]   'cause it distracts from the fundamentals that is broken,
[02:56:42.200 --> 02:56:46.860]   this becomes some weird technical discussion,
[02:56:46.860 --> 02:56:49.900]   but in the case of Nary, did nothing wrong,
[02:56:49.900 --> 02:56:53.300]   great scientist, great engineer at MIT and beyond,
[02:56:53.300 --> 02:56:55.900]   she's doing a cool thing now, so anyway.
[02:56:55.900 --> 02:56:57.140]   - Could not have said it better myself.
[02:56:57.140 --> 02:56:59.340]   Now, obviously, I'm focusing on the technical part.
[02:56:59.340 --> 02:57:02.500]   - Right, 'cause you wanna be precise here.
[02:57:02.500 --> 02:57:04.500]   - Well, it's not even that, I mean, yes,
[02:57:04.500 --> 02:57:06.900]   I have said that we're gonna sue Business Insider,
[02:57:06.900 --> 02:57:10.820]   and in 35 years of my career of someone
[02:57:10.820 --> 02:57:13.780]   who has not every article has been a favorable one,
[02:57:13.780 --> 02:57:16.100]   not every article has been an accurate one,
[02:57:16.100 --> 02:57:18.720]   I've never threatened to sue the media,
[02:57:18.720 --> 02:57:23.720]   and I've never sued the media, but this is so egregious.
[02:57:23.720 --> 02:57:26.100]   It's not just that she did nothing wrong,
[02:57:26.100 --> 02:57:29.100]   but they accused her of academic fraud,
[02:57:29.100 --> 02:57:33.440]   they did it knowing, they referenced MIT's own handbook,
[02:57:33.440 --> 02:57:35.340]   so they had to read all the same stuff
[02:57:35.340 --> 02:57:38.240]   that I read in the handbook, they did that work.
[02:57:38.240 --> 02:57:43.700]   Then after I escalated this thing to the,
[02:57:43.700 --> 02:57:46.380]   Henry Blodgett, the chairman of Business Insider,
[02:57:46.380 --> 02:57:49.140]   to the CEO of Axel Springer,
[02:57:49.140 --> 02:57:50.620]   I even reached out to Henry Kravis
[02:57:50.620 --> 02:57:51.540]   at a certain point in time,
[02:57:51.540 --> 02:57:53.180]   one of the controlling shareholders of the company
[02:57:53.180 --> 02:57:58.180]   through KKR, laying out the factual errors in the article.
[02:57:58.180 --> 02:58:02.780]   Business Insider went public after they said
[02:58:02.780 --> 02:58:05.520]   Neri committed academic fraud and plagiarism,
[02:58:05.520 --> 02:58:07.700]   and said we didn't challenge any,
[02:58:07.700 --> 02:58:11.620]   the facts remain undisputed in the article.
[02:58:11.620 --> 02:58:15.420]   So it's basically Neri committed plagiarism,
[02:58:15.420 --> 02:58:18.140]   that's story one, Neri admits to plagiarism,
[02:58:18.140 --> 02:58:19.540]   she admits to plagiarism,
[02:58:19.540 --> 02:58:22.340]   she admitted to making a few clerical errors,
[02:58:22.340 --> 02:58:24.140]   that's the only thing she admitted to,
[02:58:24.140 --> 02:58:25.500]   and she graciously apologized,
[02:58:25.500 --> 02:58:27.580]   so they said Neri admits to plagiarism,
[02:58:27.580 --> 02:58:30.140]   apologizes for plagiarism, that's incredibly damning.
[02:58:30.140 --> 02:58:32.500]   And by the way, we're doing an investigation,
[02:58:32.500 --> 02:58:34.140]   'cause we're concerned that there might've been
[02:58:34.140 --> 02:58:38.660]   inappropriate process, but the facts of the story
[02:58:38.660 --> 02:58:41.300]   have not been disputed by Neri Oxman or Bill Ackman,
[02:58:41.300 --> 02:58:44.900]   and that was totally false, I had done it privately,
[02:58:44.900 --> 02:58:48.260]   I'd done it publicly on Twitter, on X,
[02:58:48.260 --> 02:58:51.060]   I laid out, I have a whole text stream,
[02:58:51.060 --> 02:58:53.220]   a WhatsApp stream with the CEO of the company,
[02:58:53.220 --> 02:58:55.940]   and they doubled down, they doubled down again,
[02:58:55.940 --> 02:58:58.100]   and so I don't sue people lightly.
[02:58:58.100 --> 02:59:02.860]   And you stay tuned.
[02:59:02.860 --> 02:59:07.860]   - So you're, at least for now, moving forward with--
[02:59:07.860 --> 02:59:10.140]   - It's a certainty we're moving forward.
[02:59:11.060 --> 02:59:13.780]   There's a step we can take prior to suing them,
[02:59:13.780 --> 02:59:18.300]   where we basically send them a letter
[02:59:18.300 --> 02:59:20.600]   demanding they make a series of corrections,
[02:59:20.600 --> 02:59:24.460]   that if they don't make those corrections,
[02:59:24.460 --> 02:59:26.620]   the next step is litigation.
[02:59:26.620 --> 02:59:28.700]   I hope we can avoid the next step,
[02:59:28.700 --> 02:59:32.100]   and I'm just making sure that when we present the demand
[02:59:32.100 --> 02:59:35.820]   to Business Insider and ultimately to Axel Springer,
[02:59:35.820 --> 02:59:40.620]   that it's incredibly clear how they defamed her,
[02:59:40.620 --> 02:59:42.480]   the factual mistakes in her stories,
[02:59:42.480 --> 02:59:45.180]   and what they need to do to fix it.
[02:59:45.180 --> 02:59:46.380]   And if we can fix it there,
[02:59:46.380 --> 02:59:48.180]   we can move on from this episode,
[02:59:48.180 --> 02:59:50.540]   and hopefully avoid litigation.
[02:59:50.540 --> 02:59:51.460]   So that's where we are.
[02:59:51.460 --> 02:59:52.860]   - I don't know, you're smarter than me,
[02:59:52.860 --> 02:59:54.820]   there's technical stuff, there's legal stuff,
[02:59:54.820 --> 02:59:56.100]   there's journalistic stuff,
[02:59:56.100 --> 03:00:00.100]   but just fuck you, Business Insider, for doing this.
[03:00:00.100 --> 03:00:03.540]   I don't know much in this world,
[03:00:03.540 --> 03:00:06.820]   but journalists aren't supposed to do that.
[03:00:06.820 --> 03:00:08.140]   - No, look, we're gonna surface
[03:00:08.140 --> 03:00:10.380]   all of this stuff publicly, ultimately.
[03:00:10.380 --> 03:00:13.500]   The email was not to Neri,
[03:00:13.500 --> 03:00:15.240]   saying there was plagiarism in her work.
[03:00:15.240 --> 03:00:17.900]   The email came from a reporter named Catherine Long.
[03:00:17.900 --> 03:00:21.180]   And the headline was, "Your wife committed plagiarism.
[03:00:21.180 --> 03:00:24.500]   "Shouldn't she be fired from MIT?"
[03:00:24.500 --> 03:00:25.980]   Just like you caused Claudine Gay
[03:00:25.980 --> 03:00:27.980]   to be fired from Harvard.
[03:00:27.980 --> 03:00:30.860]   It was a political agenda.
[03:00:30.860 --> 03:00:32.940]   She doesn't like me, okay?
[03:00:32.940 --> 03:00:34.980]   And she was trying to hurt me,
[03:00:34.980 --> 03:00:37.180]   and they couldn't find plagiarism in my thesis.
[03:00:37.180 --> 03:00:40.860]   And being the subject of short,
[03:00:40.860 --> 03:00:42.100]   being a short seller,
[03:00:42.100 --> 03:00:44.940]   the Herbalife battle went on for years,
[03:00:44.940 --> 03:00:47.580]   they tried to do everything to destroy my reputation.
[03:00:47.580 --> 03:00:49.020]   So they'd already gone through my trash,
[03:00:49.020 --> 03:00:50.820]   they'd already done all that work.
[03:00:50.820 --> 03:00:53.980]   So anything they could possibly find,
[03:00:53.980 --> 03:00:59.540]   I've always lived a very clean life, okay, thankfully.
[03:00:59.540 --> 03:01:01.060]   And if you're gonna be an activist short seller,
[03:01:01.060 --> 03:01:02.620]   you better, 'cause they're gonna find out
[03:01:02.620 --> 03:01:05.020]   dirt on you if it exists.
[03:01:05.020 --> 03:01:07.700]   And so they're like, "How can we really hurt Bill?"
[03:01:07.700 --> 03:01:10.340]   By the way, Neri had left MIT years earlier.
[03:01:10.340 --> 03:01:11.420]   When the reporter found out
[03:01:11.420 --> 03:01:13.620]   she was no longer a member of the MIT faculty,
[03:01:13.620 --> 03:01:14.620]   they were enraged.
[03:01:14.620 --> 03:01:15.940]   They didn't believe us.
[03:01:15.940 --> 03:01:17.300]   They made us like,
[03:01:17.300 --> 03:01:19.420]   prove to us she's no longer on the MIT faculty,
[03:01:19.420 --> 03:01:20.700]   'cause they wanted to get her fired.
[03:01:20.700 --> 03:01:25.700]   And by the way, malice is one of the important factors
[03:01:25.700 --> 03:01:28.380]   in determining whether defamation's taking place.
[03:01:28.380 --> 03:01:31.460]   And this was a malice-driven,
[03:01:31.460 --> 03:01:33.380]   this was not about news.
[03:01:33.380 --> 03:01:36.220]   And the unfortunate thing about journalism
[03:01:36.220 --> 03:01:38.500]   is Business Insider made a fortune from this.
[03:01:38.500 --> 03:01:41.700]   This story was published and republished
[03:01:41.700 --> 03:01:44.620]   by thousands of media organizations around the world.
[03:01:44.620 --> 03:01:46.500]   It was the number one trending thing on Twitter
[03:01:46.500 --> 03:01:47.880]   for like two days.
[03:01:47.880 --> 03:01:50.980]   Every newspaper,
[03:01:50.980 --> 03:01:53.940]   it was on the front page of every Israeli newspaper,
[03:01:53.940 --> 03:01:56.580]   you know, it was on the front page of the Financial Times.
[03:01:56.580 --> 03:01:59.860]   Okay, so this, and she's building a business.
[03:01:59.860 --> 03:02:03.900]   And you know, if you're CEO of a science company
[03:02:03.900 --> 03:02:05.340]   and you committed academic fraud,
[03:02:05.340 --> 03:02:07.340]   that's incredibly damaging.
[03:02:07.340 --> 03:02:10.940]   But I ultimately convinced her that this was good.
[03:02:10.940 --> 03:02:13.780]   I said, sweetheart, you're amazing.
[03:02:13.780 --> 03:02:14.620]   You're incredible.
[03:02:14.620 --> 03:02:15.680]   You're incredibly talented,
[03:02:15.680 --> 03:02:17.780]   but you're mostly known in the design world.
[03:02:17.780 --> 03:02:20.660]   Now, everyone in the universe, okay,
[03:02:20.660 --> 03:02:22.780]   has heard of Neri Oxman, okay?
[03:02:22.780 --> 03:02:24.660]   We're gonna get this thing cleared up.
[03:02:24.660 --> 03:02:27.620]   You're gonna be doing an event in six months
[03:02:27.620 --> 03:02:29.140]   where you're gonna tell the world,
[03:02:29.140 --> 03:02:30.140]   you're gonna go out of stealth mode,
[03:02:30.140 --> 03:02:31.780]   you can tell the world about all the incredible things
[03:02:31.780 --> 03:02:33.540]   that you're building and you're designing
[03:02:33.540 --> 03:02:35.460]   and you're creating.
[03:02:35.460 --> 03:02:37.940]   And you're gonna, it's gonna be like the iPhone launch
[03:02:37.940 --> 03:02:39.740]   'cause everyone's gonna be paying attention
[03:02:39.740 --> 03:02:42.380]   and they're gonna wanna see your work.
[03:02:42.380 --> 03:02:44.740]   And you know, that's how I tried to cheer her up.
[03:02:44.740 --> 03:02:45.740]   But I think it's true.
[03:02:45.740 --> 03:02:48.580]   - It is true, and you're doing your,
[03:02:48.580 --> 03:02:49.700]   your job is a good part
[03:02:49.700 --> 03:02:52.140]   in seeing the silver lining of all of this.
[03:02:52.140 --> 03:02:54.460]   How has, just from observing her,
[03:02:54.460 --> 03:02:57.840]   how did she, you know,
[03:02:59.060 --> 03:03:01.380]   stay strong through all of this psychologically?
[03:03:01.380 --> 03:03:04.620]   'Cause at least I know she's pushing ahead with the work.
[03:03:04.620 --> 03:03:06.100]   - Oh, she's full speed ahead in her work.
[03:03:06.100 --> 03:03:07.100]   She's built an amazing team.
[03:03:07.100 --> 03:03:11.500]   She's hired 30 scientists, roboticists,
[03:03:11.500 --> 03:03:14.900]   people who, biologists, plant specialists,
[03:03:14.900 --> 03:03:19.900]   material scientists, engineers, really incredible crew.
[03:03:19.900 --> 03:03:22.180]   She's built this 36,000 square foot lab in New York City.
[03:03:22.180 --> 03:03:23.340]   That's a one of a kind.
[03:03:23.340 --> 03:03:25.140]   It's still, you know, they're working out of it.
[03:03:25.140 --> 03:03:26.060]   It's still under construction
[03:03:26.060 --> 03:03:27.460]   while they're working out of it.
[03:03:28.740 --> 03:03:30.740]   And so she's gonna do amazing things.
[03:03:30.740 --> 03:03:34.800]   But as I said, she's an extremely sensitive person.
[03:03:34.800 --> 03:03:36.700]   She's a perfectionist, okay?
[03:03:36.700 --> 03:03:39.460]   Imagine thinking that the entire world
[03:03:39.460 --> 03:03:41.620]   thinks you've committed academic fraud.
[03:03:41.620 --> 03:03:44.060]   And so that was very hard for her.
[03:03:44.060 --> 03:03:46.260]   She's a very positive person, but I saw her,
[03:03:46.260 --> 03:03:51.260]   and I would say her darkest emotional period, for sure.
[03:03:51.260 --> 03:03:54.020]   She's doing much better now.
[03:03:54.020 --> 03:03:55.420]   But you can kill someone.
[03:03:56.260 --> 03:03:59.860]   You can kill someone by destroying their reputation.
[03:03:59.860 --> 03:04:01.500]   People commit suicide.
[03:04:01.500 --> 03:04:05.580]   People go into these deep, dark depression.
[03:04:05.580 --> 03:04:07.940]   - Well, my worry, primarily,
[03:04:07.940 --> 03:04:09.860]   when I saw what Business Insider was doing,
[03:04:09.860 --> 03:04:14.580]   is that they might dim the light
[03:04:14.580 --> 03:04:20.220]   of a truly special scientist and creator.
[03:04:20.220 --> 03:04:21.940]   - It's not gonna happen.
[03:04:21.940 --> 03:04:26.460]   - But I also worry about others, like Nary,
[03:04:26.460 --> 03:04:30.980]   young Naries, that this sends a signal to
[03:04:30.980 --> 03:04:32.680]   that might scare them.
[03:04:32.680 --> 03:04:36.380]   And, you know, journalism shouldn't scare
[03:04:36.380 --> 03:04:38.180]   aspiring young scientists.
[03:04:38.180 --> 03:04:41.940]   - The problem is the defamation law in the U.S.
[03:04:41.940 --> 03:04:45.960]   is so favorable to the publisher, to the media,
[03:04:45.960 --> 03:04:50.220]   and so unfavorable to the victim.
[03:04:50.220 --> 03:04:52.340]   And the incentives are all wrong.
[03:04:52.340 --> 03:04:54.580]   You know, when you went from paper version
[03:04:54.580 --> 03:04:56.300]   of journalism to digital,
[03:04:56.300 --> 03:04:58.400]   and you could track how many people click,
[03:04:58.400 --> 03:05:04.360]   and it's a medium that advertising drives the economics,
[03:05:04.360 --> 03:05:06.880]   and if you can show an advertiser more clicks,
[03:05:06.880 --> 03:05:08.720]   you can make more money, right?
[03:05:08.720 --> 03:05:12.180]   So a journalist is incentivized to write a story
[03:05:12.180 --> 03:05:13.260]   that will generate more clicks.
[03:05:13.260 --> 03:05:15.480]   How do you write a story that'll generate more clicks?
[03:05:15.480 --> 03:05:18.460]   You get a billionaire guy, okay?
[03:05:18.460 --> 03:05:20.460]   And then you go after his wife,
[03:05:20.460 --> 03:05:22.660]   and you make a sensationalist story,
[03:05:22.660 --> 03:05:25.580]   and you give them no time to respond, right?
[03:05:25.580 --> 03:05:27.940]   You know, look at the timing here.
[03:05:27.940 --> 03:05:31.580]   On the first story, you know, they gave us three hours.
[03:05:31.580 --> 03:05:35.060]   On the second one, the following day, 5.19 p.m.,
[03:05:35.060 --> 03:05:37.740]   the email comes in, not to Nary, not to her firm,
[03:05:37.740 --> 03:05:39.660]   but to my communications person,
[03:05:39.660 --> 03:05:43.300]   who tracks us down by 5.30, you know, 10 minutes later.
[03:05:43.300 --> 03:05:47.100]   And they publish their story 92 minutes after,
[03:05:47.100 --> 03:05:49.540]   and they sent us, we're gonna surface all these documents
[03:05:49.540 --> 03:05:50.700]   in our demand.
[03:05:50.700 --> 03:05:53.980]   Read the email they sent,
[03:05:53.980 --> 03:05:55.820]   whether you could even decipher it.
[03:05:55.820 --> 03:05:59.100]   You know, it's, there was no,
[03:05:59.100 --> 03:06:02.820]   and by the way, there's a reason why academic institutions,
[03:06:02.820 --> 03:06:05.040]   when a professor's accused of plagiarism,
[03:06:05.040 --> 03:06:07.280]   why they have these very careful processes
[03:06:07.280 --> 03:06:09.340]   with multiple stages, and they take,
[03:06:09.340 --> 03:06:11.380]   they can take a year or more,
[03:06:11.380 --> 03:06:12.900]   because it depends on intent.
[03:06:12.900 --> 03:06:15.580]   Was this intentional?
[03:06:15.580 --> 03:06:18.900]   In order to be a crime, an academic crime,
[03:06:18.900 --> 03:06:21.060]   you gotta prove that they intentionally stole.
[03:06:21.060 --> 03:06:22.300]   Look, in some cases it's obvious,
[03:06:22.300 --> 03:06:24.140]   in some cases it's very subtle,
[03:06:24.140 --> 03:06:26.100]   and they take this stuff super seriously.
[03:06:26.100 --> 03:06:29.500]   But they basically accused Nary of academic crime,
[03:06:29.500 --> 03:06:30.820]   and then 92 minutes later,
[03:06:30.820 --> 03:06:33.220]   they said she committed an academic crime,
[03:06:33.220 --> 03:06:34.580]   and that should be a crime,
[03:06:34.580 --> 03:06:37.660]   and that should be punishable with litigation,
[03:06:37.660 --> 03:06:39.900]   and there should be a real cost,
[03:06:39.900 --> 03:06:42.140]   and we're gonna make sure there's a real cost,
[03:06:42.140 --> 03:06:44.420]   reputationally and otherwise to Business Insider,
[03:06:44.420 --> 03:06:45.820]   and to Axel Springer,
[03:06:45.820 --> 03:06:48.540]   'cause ultimately you gotta look to the controlling owner.
[03:06:48.540 --> 03:06:50.540]   You know, they're responsible.
[03:06:50.540 --> 03:06:52.500]   - I'll just say that you, in this regard,
[03:06:52.500 --> 03:06:57.500]   are inspiring to me for facing basically
[03:06:57.500 --> 03:07:07.740]   an institution that's whole purpose is to write articles.
[03:07:07.740 --> 03:07:10.380]   So you're like going into the fire.
[03:07:10.380 --> 03:07:13.180]   - My kid's school, the epithet for the school,
[03:07:13.180 --> 03:07:15.940]   or the saying, is go forth unafraid.
[03:07:15.940 --> 03:07:16.780]   (laughs)
[03:07:16.780 --> 03:07:18.500]   I think it's a good way to live.
[03:07:18.500 --> 03:07:21.460]   And again, words can't harm me.
[03:07:21.460 --> 03:07:24.900]   You know, the power of X,
[03:07:24.900 --> 03:07:29.660]   and we do owe Elon enormous thanks for this,
[03:07:29.660 --> 03:07:31.860]   is now, so for example,
[03:07:31.860 --> 03:07:32.940]   The Washington Post wrote a story
[03:07:32.940 --> 03:07:34.820]   about me a couple days ago,
[03:07:34.820 --> 03:07:38.820]   and I didn't think the story was a fair story.
[03:07:38.820 --> 03:07:41.500]   So within a few hours of the story being written,
[03:07:41.500 --> 03:07:44.060]   I'm able to put out a response to the story
[03:07:44.060 --> 03:07:46.340]   and send it to a million, 200,000 people,
[03:07:46.340 --> 03:07:48.580]   and it gets read and reread.
[03:07:48.580 --> 03:07:49.420]   I haven't checked,
[03:07:49.420 --> 03:07:53.260]   but probably 5 million people saw my response.
[03:07:53.260 --> 03:07:54.700]   Now, those are the people on X.
[03:07:54.700 --> 03:07:55.900]   It's not everyone in the world.
[03:07:55.900 --> 03:07:57.740]   There's still, there's a disconnection
[03:07:57.740 --> 03:08:00.580]   between the X world and the offline world.
[03:08:00.580 --> 03:08:04.780]   But, you know, reputation in my business
[03:08:04.780 --> 03:08:06.740]   is basically all you have.
[03:08:06.740 --> 03:08:09.020]   And as they say, you can take a lifetime
[03:08:09.020 --> 03:08:09.860]   to build a reputation
[03:08:09.860 --> 03:08:11.340]   and take five minutes to have it disappear,
[03:08:11.340 --> 03:08:13.660]   and the media plays a very important role,
[03:08:13.660 --> 03:08:15.140]   and they can destroy people.
[03:08:15.140 --> 03:08:18.780]   At least we now have some ability to fight back.
[03:08:18.780 --> 03:08:20.940]   We have a platform we can surface our views.
[03:08:20.940 --> 03:08:22.740]   You know, the typical old days,
[03:08:22.740 --> 03:08:24.140]   they write an incredibly damning article
[03:08:24.140 --> 03:08:25.620]   and you point out factual errors,
[03:08:25.620 --> 03:08:26.660]   and then like two months later,
[03:08:26.660 --> 03:08:28.620]   they bury a little correction on page whatever.
[03:08:28.620 --> 03:08:29.820]   By then the person was fired
[03:08:29.820 --> 03:08:33.740]   or their life was destroyed or their reputation's damaged.
[03:08:33.740 --> 03:08:35.940]   You know, I was with Warren Buffett talking about media,
[03:08:35.940 --> 03:08:38.900]   and it's something he, a business he really loves.
[03:08:38.900 --> 03:08:40.820]   And he says, "You know what, Bill?"
[03:08:40.820 --> 03:08:42.820]   He said, "A thief with a dagger."
[03:08:42.820 --> 03:08:44.300]   The only person who can cause you more harm
[03:08:44.300 --> 03:08:47.340]   than a thief with a dagger is a journalist with a pen.
[03:08:47.340 --> 03:08:50.620]   And those were very powerful words.
[03:08:50.620 --> 03:08:54.140]   - So you think X, formerly known as Twitter,
[03:08:54.140 --> 03:08:56.660]   is a kind of neutralizing force to that,
[03:08:56.660 --> 03:09:00.020]   to the power of centralized journalistic institutions?
[03:09:00.020 --> 03:09:02.540]   - 100%, and I think it's a really important one.
[03:09:02.540 --> 03:09:05.140]   And it's really been eye-opening for me
[03:09:05.140 --> 03:09:08.660]   to see how stories get covered in mainstream media.
[03:09:08.660 --> 03:09:10.940]   And then you actually, you know, what I do on X
[03:09:10.940 --> 03:09:14.300]   is I follow people on multiple sides of an issue.
[03:09:14.300 --> 03:09:17.380]   And you can, or I post on a topic
[03:09:17.380 --> 03:09:18.900]   and I get to hear the other side.
[03:09:18.900 --> 03:09:21.180]   You know, I read the replies.
[03:09:21.180 --> 03:09:23.380]   And, you know, the truth is something
[03:09:23.380 --> 03:09:25.700]   that people have had a lot of question about,
[03:09:25.700 --> 03:09:29.540]   particularly in the last, I would say, five years,
[03:09:29.540 --> 03:09:31.620]   you know, beginning with, you know,
[03:09:31.620 --> 03:09:34.140]   Trump's talking about fake news.
[03:09:34.140 --> 03:09:36.940]   And a lot of what Trump said about fake news is true.
[03:09:36.940 --> 03:09:39.860]   You know, the world, a big part of the world hated Trump
[03:09:39.860 --> 03:09:43.740]   and did everything they could to discredit him, destroy him.
[03:09:43.740 --> 03:09:48.500]   And, you know, he did a lot of things, perhaps deserving
[03:09:48.500 --> 03:09:52.420]   of being discredited, used by a very imperfect,
[03:09:52.420 --> 03:09:55.900]   in some cases, harmful leader.
[03:09:55.900 --> 03:09:58.460]   But, you know, everything from pre-election,
[03:09:58.460 --> 03:10:03.460]   you know, the Hunter Biden laptop story in the New York Post
[03:10:03.620 --> 03:10:08.620]   that, you know, then Twitter, you know,
[03:10:08.620 --> 03:10:12.940]   made it difficult for people to share and to read,
[03:10:12.940 --> 03:10:17.740]   you know, COVID, you know,
[03:10:17.740 --> 03:10:20.500]   the Jay Bhattacharyas of the world
[03:10:20.500 --> 03:10:23.340]   questioning the government's response,
[03:10:23.340 --> 03:10:27.700]   questioning, you know, long-term lockdowns,
[03:10:27.700 --> 03:10:29.820]   questioning keeping kids out of school,
[03:10:29.820 --> 03:10:32.320]   questions about masks, about vaccines,
[03:10:33.180 --> 03:10:35.300]   which are still not definitively answered,
[03:10:35.300 --> 03:10:39.860]   no counterbalance to the power of the government
[03:10:39.860 --> 03:10:42.860]   when the government can shut down avenues for free speech.
[03:10:42.860 --> 03:10:47.140]   And where the mainstream media has kind of towed the line
[03:10:47.140 --> 03:10:49.580]   in many extents to the government's actions.
[03:10:49.580 --> 03:10:53.300]   So having a independently owned powerful platform
[03:10:53.300 --> 03:10:58.220]   is very important for truth, for free speech,
[03:10:58.220 --> 03:10:59.580]   for hearing the other side of the story,
[03:10:59.580 --> 03:11:02.100]   for counterbalancing the power of the government.
[03:11:02.100 --> 03:11:06.900]   Elon is getting, you know, a lot of pushback.
[03:11:06.900 --> 03:11:09.780]   You know, the SpaceXs and Teslas of the world
[03:11:09.780 --> 03:11:14.740]   are experiencing a lot of government, you know,
[03:11:14.740 --> 03:11:16.820]   questions and investigations.
[03:11:16.820 --> 03:11:18.420]   And, you know, even the president of the United States
[03:11:18.420 --> 03:11:21.140]   came out and said, look, he needs to be investigated.
[03:11:21.140 --> 03:11:23.580]   You know, I'm getting my own version of that
[03:11:23.580 --> 03:11:26.100]   in terms of some negative media articles.
[03:11:26.100 --> 03:11:27.940]   I don't know what's next.
[03:11:27.940 --> 03:11:30.460]   But yeah, if you stick your neck out in today's world
[03:11:30.460 --> 03:11:33.260]   and you go against the establishment,
[03:11:33.260 --> 03:11:37.900]   or at least the existing administration,
[03:11:37.900 --> 03:11:40.780]   you can find yourself in a very challenged place.
[03:11:40.780 --> 03:11:42.940]   And that discourages people from sharing stuff.
[03:11:42.940 --> 03:11:45.300]   And that's why anonymous speech is important.
[03:11:45.300 --> 03:11:46.900]   Some of which you find on Twitter.
[03:11:46.900 --> 03:11:48.020]   - You mentioned Trump.
[03:11:48.020 --> 03:11:50.260]   I have to talk to you about politics.
[03:11:50.260 --> 03:11:51.100]   - Sure.
[03:11:51.100 --> 03:11:52.580]   - Amongst all the other battles,
[03:11:52.580 --> 03:11:54.860]   you've also been a part of that one.
[03:11:54.860 --> 03:11:55.900]   Maybe you can correct me on this,
[03:11:55.900 --> 03:11:56.860]   but you've been a big supporter
[03:11:56.860 --> 03:11:59.220]   of various democratic candidates over the years.
[03:12:00.140 --> 03:12:02.380]   (sighs)
[03:12:02.380 --> 03:12:05.700]   - But you did say a lot of nice things
[03:12:05.700 --> 03:12:10.060]   about Donald Trump in 2016, I believe.
[03:12:10.060 --> 03:12:11.460]   - So I was interviewed by Andrew Sorkin
[03:12:11.460 --> 03:12:13.300]   a week after Trump won the election.
[03:12:13.300 --> 03:12:14.140]   - Yes.
[03:12:14.140 --> 03:12:15.460]   - And I made my case for why I thought
[03:12:15.460 --> 03:12:16.420]   he could be a good president.
[03:12:16.420 --> 03:12:17.540]   - Yes.
[03:12:17.540 --> 03:12:19.940]   So what was the case back then?
[03:12:19.940 --> 03:12:22.180]   To which degree did that turn out to be true?
[03:12:22.180 --> 03:12:24.700]   And to which degree did it not?
[03:12:24.700 --> 03:12:26.140]   To which degree was he a good president?
[03:12:26.140 --> 03:12:27.980]   To which degree was he not a good president?
[03:12:27.980 --> 03:12:29.900]   - Look, I think what I said at the time
[03:12:29.900 --> 03:12:34.540]   was the United States is actually a huge business.
[03:12:34.540 --> 03:12:36.380]   And it reminds me a bit of the type
[03:12:36.380 --> 03:12:38.220]   of activist investments we've taken on over time,
[03:12:38.220 --> 03:12:39.540]   where this really, really great business
[03:12:39.540 --> 03:12:41.140]   has kind of lost its way.
[03:12:41.140 --> 03:12:43.540]   And with the right leadership, we can fix it.
[03:12:43.540 --> 03:12:46.260]   And if you think about the business of the United States
[03:12:46.260 --> 03:12:48.660]   today, right, you've got $32 trillion worth of debt,
[03:12:48.660 --> 03:12:52.740]   so it's over-leveraged, or it's highly leveraged,
[03:12:52.740 --> 03:12:54.860]   and the leverage is only increasing.
[03:12:54.860 --> 03:12:59.700]   We're losing money, i.e. revenues aren't covering expenses.
[03:12:59.700 --> 03:13:00.980]   The cost of our debt is going up
[03:13:00.980 --> 03:13:01.820]   as interest rates have gone up,
[03:13:01.820 --> 03:13:03.980]   and the debt has to be rolled over.
[03:13:03.980 --> 03:13:08.260]   We have enormous administrative bloat in the country.
[03:13:08.260 --> 03:13:12.540]   The regulatory regime is incredibly complicated
[03:13:12.540 --> 03:13:14.780]   and burdensome and impeding growth.
[03:13:14.780 --> 03:13:19.980]   Our relations with our competitor nations
[03:13:19.980 --> 03:13:23.580]   and our friendly nations are far from ideal.
[03:13:23.580 --> 03:13:25.820]   And those conditions were present in 2020 as well.
[03:13:25.820 --> 03:13:27.980]   They're just, I would say, worse now.
[03:13:27.980 --> 03:13:30.060]   And I said, look, it's a great thing
[03:13:30.060 --> 03:13:33.260]   that we have a businessman as president.
[03:13:33.260 --> 03:13:36.100]   And in my lifetime, it's really the first businessman,
[03:13:36.100 --> 03:13:38.420]   as opposed to, I mean, maybe Bush to some degree
[03:13:38.420 --> 03:13:42.300]   was a business person, but I thought, okay.
[03:13:42.300 --> 03:13:45.060]   I always wanted the CEO to be CEO of America,
[03:13:45.060 --> 03:13:46.460]   and now we have Trump.
[03:13:46.460 --> 03:13:48.380]   I said, look, he's got some personal qualities
[03:13:48.380 --> 03:13:50.980]   that seem less ideal,
[03:13:50.980 --> 03:13:52.500]   but he's gonna be president of the United States.
[03:13:52.500 --> 03:13:53.780]   He's gonna rise to the occasion.
[03:13:53.780 --> 03:13:55.620]   This is gonna be his legacy.
[03:13:55.620 --> 03:13:58.420]   And he knows how to make deals.
[03:13:58.420 --> 03:14:01.060]   And he's gonna recruit some great people
[03:14:01.060 --> 03:14:02.700]   into his administration, I hoped.
[03:14:02.700 --> 03:14:06.740]   And growth can solve a lot of our problems.
[03:14:06.740 --> 03:14:09.340]   So if we can get rid of a bunch of regulations
[03:14:09.340 --> 03:14:10.940]   that are holding back the country,
[03:14:10.940 --> 03:14:11.940]   we can have a president.
[03:14:11.940 --> 03:14:16.940]   Obama was a, I would say, not a pro-business president.
[03:14:16.940 --> 03:14:18.900]   He did not love the business community.
[03:14:18.900 --> 03:14:20.660]   He did not love successful people.
[03:14:21.620 --> 03:14:25.420]   And having a president who just changed the tone
[03:14:25.420 --> 03:14:27.980]   on being a pro-business president,
[03:14:27.980 --> 03:14:29.220]   I thought would be good for the country.
[03:14:29.220 --> 03:14:30.940]   And that's basically what I said.
[03:14:30.940 --> 03:14:33.860]   And I would say Trump did a lot of good things.
[03:14:33.860 --> 03:14:35.740]   And a lot of people,
[03:14:35.740 --> 03:14:38.340]   you can get criticized for acknowledging that.
[03:14:38.340 --> 03:14:43.100]   But I think the country's economy accelerated dramatically.
[03:14:43.100 --> 03:14:45.940]   And that, by the way, the capitalist system
[03:14:45.940 --> 03:14:48.660]   helps the people at the bottom best
[03:14:48.660 --> 03:14:51.140]   when the system does well and when the economy does well.
[03:14:51.140 --> 03:14:54.260]   The black unemployment rate was the lowest in history
[03:14:54.260 --> 03:14:55.260]   when Trump was president.
[03:14:55.260 --> 03:14:58.300]   And that's true for other minority groups.
[03:14:58.300 --> 03:14:59.860]   So he was good for the economy.
[03:14:59.860 --> 03:15:05.220]   And he recognized some of the challenges
[03:15:05.220 --> 03:15:07.220]   and issues and threats of China early.
[03:15:07.220 --> 03:15:10.500]   He kind of woke up NATO.
[03:15:10.500 --> 03:15:12.340]   Now, again, the way he did all of this stuff,
[03:15:12.340 --> 03:15:13.300]   you can object to.
[03:15:13.300 --> 03:15:18.300]   But NATO actually started spending more money on defense
[03:15:18.300 --> 03:15:20.180]   in the early part of Trump's presidency
[03:15:20.180 --> 03:15:21.900]   because of his threats,
[03:15:21.900 --> 03:15:23.140]   which turned out to be a good thing
[03:15:23.140 --> 03:15:28.140]   in light of ultimately the Russia-Ukraine war.
[03:15:28.140 --> 03:15:30.380]   And I think if you analyze Trump objectively
[03:15:30.380 --> 03:15:33.220]   based on policies, he did a lot of good for the country.
[03:15:33.220 --> 03:15:38.220]   I think what's bad is he did some harm as well.
[03:15:38.220 --> 03:15:44.740]   I do think civility disappeared in America
[03:15:44.740 --> 03:15:45.940]   with Trump as president.
[03:15:45.940 --> 03:15:48.220]   A lot of that's his personal style.
[03:15:48.220 --> 03:15:49.620]   And how important is civility?
[03:15:49.620 --> 03:15:50.540]   I do think it's important.
[03:15:50.540 --> 03:15:55.540]   I do think he was attacked very aggressively by the left,
[03:15:55.540 --> 03:15:58.460]   by the media that made him paranoid.
[03:15:58.460 --> 03:16:01.460]   It probably interfered with his ability to be successful.
[03:16:01.460 --> 03:16:05.340]   He had the Russian collusion investigation overhang.
[03:16:05.340 --> 03:16:07.860]   And when someone's attacked,
[03:16:07.860 --> 03:16:09.060]   they're not gonna be at their best,
[03:16:09.060 --> 03:16:10.300]   particularly if they're paranoid.
[03:16:10.300 --> 03:16:12.260]   I think there's some degree of that.
[03:16:12.260 --> 03:16:16.860]   But I'm giving kind of the best of defense of Trump.
[03:16:16.860 --> 03:16:21.860]   Just you look at how he managed his team, right?
[03:16:21.860 --> 03:16:25.140]   Very few people made it through the Trump administration
[03:16:25.140 --> 03:16:27.380]   without getting fired or quitting.
[03:16:27.380 --> 03:16:29.380]   And who say they're the greatest person in the world
[03:16:29.380 --> 03:16:30.220]   when he hired them,
[03:16:30.220 --> 03:16:33.500]   and they're a total disaster when he fired them.
[03:16:33.500 --> 03:16:36.060]   It's not an inspiring way to be a leader
[03:16:36.060 --> 03:16:38.860]   and to attract really talented people.
[03:16:38.860 --> 03:16:42.220]   I think the events surrounding the election,
[03:16:42.220 --> 03:16:44.780]   I think January 6th,
[03:16:44.780 --> 03:16:47.820]   he could have done a lot more to stop a riot.
[03:16:47.820 --> 03:16:50.500]   I don't consider it an insurrection,
[03:16:50.500 --> 03:16:52.980]   but a riot that takes place in our Capitol
[03:16:52.980 --> 03:16:56.540]   and where police officers are killed or die,
[03:16:56.540 --> 03:17:01.220]   commit suicide for failure as they sought to do their job.
[03:17:01.220 --> 03:17:02.940]   He stepped in way too late to stop that.
[03:17:02.940 --> 03:17:04.300]   He could have stopped it early.
[03:17:04.300 --> 03:17:07.100]   Many of his words, I think, inspired people,
[03:17:07.100 --> 03:17:10.620]   some of whom with malintent to go in there and cause harm
[03:17:10.620 --> 03:17:12.300]   and literally to shut down the government.
[03:17:12.300 --> 03:17:15.380]   There were some evil people, unfortunately, there.
[03:17:15.380 --> 03:17:18.340]   So he's been a very imperfect president,
[03:17:18.340 --> 03:17:23.340]   and also, I think, contributed to the extreme amount
[03:17:23.340 --> 03:17:24.660]   of divisiveness in our country.
[03:17:24.660 --> 03:17:29.660]   So I was ultimately disappointed by the note of optimism.
[03:17:29.660 --> 03:17:33.980]   And again, I always support the president.
[03:17:33.980 --> 03:17:37.140]   I trust the people, ultimately, to select our next leader.
[03:17:37.140 --> 03:17:39.260]   It's a bit like who wants to be a millionaire.
[03:17:39.260 --> 03:17:40.180]   When you go to the crowd,
[03:17:40.180 --> 03:17:42.420]   and the crowd says a certain thing,
[03:17:42.420 --> 03:17:43.780]   you got to trust the crowd.
[03:17:43.780 --> 03:17:47.460]   But usually in who wants to be a millionaire,
[03:17:47.460 --> 03:17:48.820]   it's a landslide in one direction.
[03:17:48.820 --> 03:17:51.820]   So you know which letter to pick.
[03:17:51.820 --> 03:17:53.420]   Here we had an incredibly close election,
[03:17:53.420 --> 03:17:54.340]   which itself is a problem.
[03:17:54.340 --> 03:17:57.340]   So my dream, and what I've tried a little bit,
[03:17:57.340 --> 03:17:59.620]   played politics in the last little period,
[03:17:59.620 --> 03:18:01.340]   to support some alternatives to Trump
[03:18:01.340 --> 03:18:02.500]   so that we have a president.
[03:18:02.500 --> 03:18:05.260]   I use the example.
[03:18:05.260 --> 03:18:07.220]   Imagine you woke up in the morning, it's election day,
[03:18:07.220 --> 03:18:11.900]   whatever it is, it's November 4th, whatever, 2024,
[03:18:11.900 --> 03:18:13.460]   and you still haven't figured out who to vote for
[03:18:13.460 --> 03:18:15.780]   'cause the candidates are so appealing
[03:18:15.780 --> 03:18:18.460]   that you don't know which lever to pull
[03:18:18.460 --> 03:18:20.420]   because it's a tough call.
[03:18:20.420 --> 03:18:23.140]   That's the choice we should be making as Americans.
[03:18:23.140 --> 03:18:25.260]   It shouldn't be, I'm a member of this party,
[03:18:25.260 --> 03:18:26.260]   and I'm only gonna vote this way.
[03:18:26.260 --> 03:18:27.740]   I'm a member of that party, I'm gonna vote the other way,
[03:18:27.740 --> 03:18:29.380]   and I hate the other side.
[03:18:29.380 --> 03:18:31.420]   And that's where we've been, unfortunately, for too long.
[03:18:31.420 --> 03:18:32.500]   - Or you might be torn
[03:18:32.500 --> 03:18:34.400]   because both candidates are not good.
[03:18:34.400 --> 03:18:36.140]   - Yeah.
[03:18:36.940 --> 03:18:39.180]   - I love a future where I'm torn
[03:18:39.180 --> 03:18:42.220]   because the choices are so amazing.
[03:18:42.220 --> 03:18:44.660]   - The problem is the party system is so screwed up,
[03:18:44.660 --> 03:18:46.660]   and the parties are self-interested,
[03:18:46.660 --> 03:18:50.620]   and there's another governance problem, right?
[03:18:50.620 --> 03:18:51.900]   An incentive problem.
[03:18:51.900 --> 03:18:54.940]   Michael Porter, who was one of my professors
[03:18:54.940 --> 03:18:57.740]   at Harvard Business School, wrote a brilliant piece
[03:18:57.740 --> 03:18:59.740]   on the American political system
[03:18:59.740 --> 03:19:01.740]   and all the incentives and market dynamics
[03:19:01.740 --> 03:19:04.620]   and what he called a competitive analysis,
[03:19:04.620 --> 03:19:05.980]   and it's a must-read.
[03:19:05.980 --> 03:19:09.300]   I should dig it up and send it around on X,
[03:19:09.300 --> 03:19:13.100]   but it explains how the parties and the incentives
[03:19:13.100 --> 03:19:16.180]   of these sort of self-sustaining entities
[03:19:16.180 --> 03:19:19.620]   that where the people involved are not incentivized
[03:19:19.620 --> 03:19:21.020]   to do what's best for the country.
[03:19:21.020 --> 03:19:22.260]   It's a problem.
[03:19:22.260 --> 03:19:24.780]   - You've been a supporter of Dean Phillips
[03:19:24.780 --> 03:19:28.540]   for the 2024 U.S. presidential race.
[03:19:28.540 --> 03:19:29.380]   - Yes.
[03:19:29.380 --> 03:19:31.060]   - What do you like about Dean?
[03:19:31.060 --> 03:19:35.060]   - I think he's a honest, smart, motivated,
[03:19:35.060 --> 03:19:38.660]   capable, proven guy as a business leader,
[03:19:38.660 --> 03:19:43.660]   and I think in six, almost in his three terms in Congress,
[03:19:43.660 --> 03:19:46.580]   he ran when Trump was elected.
[03:19:46.580 --> 03:19:49.500]   He said his kids cried, his daughters cried.
[03:19:49.500 --> 03:19:51.860]   Inspired him to run for office.
[03:19:51.860 --> 03:19:54.180]   Ran in a Republican district in Minnesota
[03:19:54.180 --> 03:19:55.820]   for the last 60 years.
[03:19:55.820 --> 03:19:57.220]   Was elected in a landslide.
[03:19:57.220 --> 03:19:59.020]   Has been reelected twice.
[03:19:59.020 --> 03:20:00.820]   Moved up the ranks in the Congress.
[03:20:00.820 --> 03:20:05.820]   Respected by his fellow members of Congress.
[03:20:05.820 --> 03:20:08.980]   Advanced some important legislation during COVID.
[03:20:08.980 --> 03:20:13.860]   Senior roles on various foreign policy committees.
[03:20:13.860 --> 03:20:14.700]   Centrist.
[03:20:14.700 --> 03:20:17.780]   Considered, I think, the second most
[03:20:17.780 --> 03:20:19.660]   bipartisan member of the Congress.
[03:20:19.660 --> 03:20:21.620]   I'd love to have a bipartisan president.
[03:20:21.620 --> 03:20:23.780]   That's the only way to kind of go forward,
[03:20:23.780 --> 03:20:26.660]   but we'd enormously benefit if we had a president
[03:20:26.660 --> 03:20:30.060]   that chose policies on the basis
[03:20:30.060 --> 03:20:31.060]   of what's best for the country
[03:20:31.060 --> 03:20:32.860]   as opposed to what his party wanted.
[03:20:32.860 --> 03:20:36.380]   What I like about him is he's financially independent.
[03:20:36.380 --> 03:20:39.300]   He's not a billionaire, but he doesn't need the job.
[03:20:39.300 --> 03:20:43.180]   The party hates him now 'cause he challenged the king, right?
[03:20:43.180 --> 03:20:46.220]   And so, but he's willing to give up his political career
[03:20:46.220 --> 03:20:47.620]   'cause what he thought was best for the country.
[03:20:47.620 --> 03:20:49.300]   He tried to get other people to run who were of higher
[03:20:49.300 --> 03:20:50.780]   profile, had more name recognition.
[03:20:50.780 --> 03:20:52.100]   None would.
[03:20:52.100 --> 03:20:54.380]   No one wants to challenge Biden.
[03:20:54.380 --> 03:20:56.700]   You know, if they want to be, have a chance to stay
[03:20:56.700 --> 03:21:01.060]   in office or run in the future, but he's very principled.
[03:21:01.060 --> 03:21:04.860]   I think he would be a great president, but he needs,
[03:21:04.860 --> 03:21:09.620]   his shot is Michigan, but he needs to raise money
[03:21:09.620 --> 03:21:12.220]   in order to, he's only got a couple of weeks
[03:21:12.220 --> 03:21:13.380]   and he's gotta be on TV there.
[03:21:13.380 --> 03:21:14.980]   That's expensive.
[03:21:14.980 --> 03:21:16.660]   So we'll see.
[03:21:16.660 --> 03:21:18.100]   - So he has to increase name recognition
[03:21:18.100 --> 03:21:18.940]   and all that kind of stuff.
[03:21:18.940 --> 03:21:20.900]   Also, as you mentioned, he's young.
[03:21:20.900 --> 03:21:23.020]   - Yeah, he's 55, but he's a young 55.
[03:21:23.020 --> 03:21:24.140]   You see him play hockey.
[03:21:24.140 --> 03:21:26.020]   - Yeah, I mean, I guess 55, no matter what,
[03:21:26.020 --> 03:21:27.500]   is a pretty young age.
[03:21:27.500 --> 03:21:28.540]   - I'm 57.
[03:21:28.540 --> 03:21:29.780]   I feel young.
[03:21:29.780 --> 03:21:32.540]   I can do more pull-ups today than I could as a kid.
[03:21:32.540 --> 03:21:34.540]   So that's a standard.
[03:21:34.540 --> 03:21:36.460]   - You're at the top of your tennis game.
[03:21:36.460 --> 03:21:38.260]   - I'm at the top of my tennis game, for sure.
[03:21:38.260 --> 03:21:40.180]   - Maybe there's someone that would disagree with that.
[03:21:40.180 --> 03:21:42.500]   - And by the way, the other thing to point out here is,
[03:21:42.500 --> 03:21:45.220]   and I have been pointing this out as of others,
[03:21:45.220 --> 03:21:47.140]   Biden is, I think he's done.
[03:21:47.140 --> 03:21:48.380]   I mean, it's embarrassing.
[03:21:48.380 --> 03:21:49.740]   It's embarrassing for the country,
[03:21:49.740 --> 03:21:52.620]   having him as a presidential candidate,
[03:21:52.620 --> 03:21:54.540]   let alone the president of the country.
[03:21:54.540 --> 03:21:56.180]   It's crazy.
[03:21:56.180 --> 03:21:59.500]   And it's just gonna get worse and worse.
[03:21:59.500 --> 03:22:01.340]   And he should, you know,
[03:22:01.340 --> 03:22:05.180]   the worst of his legacy is his ego
[03:22:05.180 --> 03:22:06.860]   that prevents him from stepping aside.
[03:22:06.860 --> 03:22:07.700]   And that's it.
[03:22:07.700 --> 03:22:09.060]   It's his ego.
[03:22:09.060 --> 03:22:12.620]   And it is so wrong and so bad and so embarrassing.
[03:22:12.620 --> 03:22:15.380]   You know, when you talk to people,
[03:22:15.380 --> 03:22:19.140]   I was in Europe, I was in London a few days ago,
[03:22:19.140 --> 03:22:21.180]   and people were like, "Bill,
[03:22:21.180 --> 03:22:22.900]   "how can this guy be a president?"
[03:22:22.900 --> 03:22:24.700]   And it's a bit like, again,
[03:22:24.700 --> 03:22:25.900]   I go back to my business analogy.
[03:22:25.900 --> 03:22:28.540]   Being a CEO is like a full contact sport.
[03:22:28.540 --> 03:22:29.780]   Being president of the United States
[03:22:29.780 --> 03:22:34.340]   is like some combination of wrestling, marathon running,
[03:22:34.340 --> 03:22:36.500]   you know, being a triathlete.
[03:22:36.500 --> 03:22:39.900]   I mean, you gotta be at the serious physical shape
[03:22:39.900 --> 03:22:42.500]   and at the top of your game to represent this country.
[03:22:42.500 --> 03:22:44.500]   And he is a far cry from that.
[03:22:44.500 --> 03:22:45.660]   And it's just getting worse.
[03:22:45.660 --> 03:22:47.020]   And it's embarrassing.
[03:22:47.340 --> 03:22:49.700]   And he's got, he cannot be,
[03:22:49.700 --> 03:22:51.700]   and by the way, every day he waits,
[03:22:51.700 --> 03:22:54.460]   he's handing the election to Trump
[03:22:54.460 --> 03:22:56.100]   because it's harder and harder
[03:22:56.100 --> 03:22:58.020]   for an alternative candidate to surface.
[03:22:58.020 --> 03:23:00.620]   Now, Dean is the only candidate left
[03:23:00.620 --> 03:23:03.180]   on the Democratic side that can still win delegates.
[03:23:03.180 --> 03:23:05.060]   He's on the ballot in 42 states.
[03:23:05.060 --> 03:23:08.780]   And the best way for Biden to step aside
[03:23:08.780 --> 03:23:11.100]   is for Dean to show well in Michigan.
[03:23:11.100 --> 03:23:13.420]   - And so you think there is a path with the delegates
[03:23:13.420 --> 03:23:14.420]   and all that kind of stuff?
[03:23:14.420 --> 03:23:15.260]   - 100%.
[03:23:15.260 --> 03:23:18.100]   So what has to happen is,
[03:23:18.100 --> 03:23:23.100]   New Hampshire, he went from zero to 20% of the vote
[03:23:23.100 --> 03:23:25.700]   in 10 weeks with no name recognition.
[03:23:25.700 --> 03:23:26.540]   You know, I helped a little bit.
[03:23:26.540 --> 03:23:29.020]   Elon helped, we did spaces for him.
[03:23:29.020 --> 03:23:31.260]   We had 350,000 people on the spaces.
[03:23:31.260 --> 03:23:34.020]   Some originally, 40,000 live or something,
[03:23:34.020 --> 03:23:35.580]   and then the rest after.
[03:23:35.580 --> 03:23:38.620]   And then he was on the ground in New Hampshire.
[03:23:38.620 --> 03:23:39.900]   And New Hampshire is one of the states
[03:23:39.900 --> 03:23:42.140]   where you don't need to be registered to a party
[03:23:42.140 --> 03:23:43.580]   to vote for that candidate.
[03:23:43.580 --> 03:23:45.140]   So it's like jump ball.
[03:23:45.140 --> 03:23:46.100]   And he got 20%.
[03:23:46.100 --> 03:23:48.540]   And that's with a lot of independents
[03:23:48.540 --> 03:23:50.140]   and Democrats voting for Haley.
[03:23:50.140 --> 03:23:55.060]   Haley, who I like and who I've supported,
[03:23:55.060 --> 03:23:58.420]   does not look like she's gonna make it.
[03:23:58.420 --> 03:24:01.060]   You know, Trump is really kind of running the table.
[03:24:01.060 --> 03:24:04.900]   And so vote for Haley as an independent in Michigan,
[03:24:04.900 --> 03:24:06.540]   maybe throw away your vote.
[03:24:06.540 --> 03:24:08.220]   I think it increases the likelihood
[03:24:08.220 --> 03:24:10.980]   that Dean can get those independent votes.
[03:24:10.980 --> 03:24:14.700]   If he could theoretically, again, he needs money.
[03:24:14.700 --> 03:24:16.020]   He could beat Biden in Michigan.
[03:24:16.020 --> 03:24:17.620]   Biden's doing very poorly in Michigan.
[03:24:17.620 --> 03:24:18.860]   His polls are terrible.
[03:24:18.860 --> 03:24:21.620]   The Muslim community is not happy with him.
[03:24:21.620 --> 03:24:25.580]   And he really has spent no time there.
[03:24:25.580 --> 03:24:27.980]   And so if he's embarrassed in Michigan,
[03:24:27.980 --> 03:24:29.540]   it could be a catalyst for him withdrawing,
[03:24:29.540 --> 03:24:30.820]   then Dean will get funding.
[03:24:30.820 --> 03:24:34.220]   If he wins Michigan or shows well in Michigan,
[03:24:34.220 --> 03:24:37.860]   and people say he's viable, he's the only choice we have,
[03:24:37.860 --> 03:24:39.780]   he'll attract from the center,
[03:24:39.780 --> 03:24:41.060]   he'll attract from people,
[03:24:41.060 --> 03:24:42.460]   Republicans who won't vote for Trump,
[03:24:42.460 --> 03:24:45.340]   of which they're a big percentage, could be 60% or more.
[03:24:45.340 --> 03:24:47.940]   It could be 70% won't vote for Trump.
[03:24:47.940 --> 03:24:49.940]   And also from the Democrats.
[03:24:49.940 --> 03:24:52.300]   So I think he's a really interesting candidate,
[03:24:52.300 --> 03:24:53.380]   but we gotta get the word out.
[03:24:53.380 --> 03:24:54.980]   - Yeah, I got a chance to chat with Dean.
[03:24:54.980 --> 03:24:55.820]   I really like him.
[03:24:55.820 --> 03:24:56.660]   I really like him.
[03:24:56.660 --> 03:25:00.340]   And I think the next president of the United States
[03:25:00.340 --> 03:25:04.860]   is gonna have to meet and speak regularly
[03:25:04.860 --> 03:25:08.620]   with Zelensky, Putin, and Yahoo, with world leaders,
[03:25:08.620 --> 03:25:12.580]   and have some of the most historic conversations,
[03:25:12.580 --> 03:25:14.820]   agreements, negotiations.
[03:25:14.820 --> 03:25:17.540]   And I just don't see Biden doing that.
[03:25:17.540 --> 03:25:18.360]   - No.
[03:25:18.360 --> 03:25:23.360]   - And not for any reason, but sadly, age.
[03:25:23.360 --> 03:25:25.620]   - Think about it this way.
[03:25:25.620 --> 03:25:27.700]   When Biden's present now,
[03:25:27.700 --> 03:25:30.720]   you saw his recent impromptu press conference,
[03:25:30.720 --> 03:25:34.500]   which he did after the special prosecutor report,
[03:25:34.500 --> 03:25:37.580]   basically saying the guy was way past his prime.
[03:25:37.580 --> 03:25:40.060]   And then he confused the president of Mexico
[03:25:40.060 --> 03:25:42.060]   and the president of Egypt.
[03:25:42.060 --> 03:25:44.740]   So they're very careful when they roll him out.
[03:25:44.740 --> 03:25:45.700]   And he's scripted,
[03:25:45.700 --> 03:25:47.740]   and he's always reading from a lectern.
[03:25:47.740 --> 03:25:50.860]   Imagine the care they have in exposing him.
[03:25:50.860 --> 03:25:52.980]   And when they expose him, it's terrible.
[03:25:52.980 --> 03:25:54.780]   Okay, imagine how bad it is for real.
[03:25:54.780 --> 03:25:56.740]   - It's not good.
[03:25:56.740 --> 03:25:58.820]   - No, really bad for America.
[03:25:58.820 --> 03:26:01.480]   And I'm upset with him and upset with his family.
[03:26:01.480 --> 03:26:03.180]   I'm upset with his wife.
[03:26:03.180 --> 03:26:05.920]   This is the time where the people closest to you
[03:26:05.920 --> 03:26:08.160]   have to put their arms around you and say,
[03:26:08.160 --> 03:26:13.160]   dad, honey, you've done your thing.
[03:26:13.160 --> 03:26:15.040]   This is gonna be your legacy,
[03:26:15.040 --> 03:26:16.600]   and it's not gonna be a good one.
[03:26:16.600 --> 03:26:19.080]   - Great leaders should also know when to step down.
[03:26:19.080 --> 03:26:21.280]   - Yeah, and one of the best tests of a leader
[03:26:21.280 --> 03:26:23.440]   is succession planning.
[03:26:23.440 --> 03:26:26.280]   This is a massive failure of succession planning.
[03:26:26.280 --> 03:26:31.180]   - Outside of politics, let me look to the future.
[03:26:31.180 --> 03:26:35.020]   First, in terms of the financial world.
[03:26:36.000 --> 03:26:38.160]   What are you looking forward to
[03:26:38.160 --> 03:26:40.000]   in the next couple of years?
[03:26:40.000 --> 03:26:41.480]   You have a new fund.
[03:26:41.480 --> 03:26:43.480]   Like, what are you thinking about
[03:26:43.480 --> 03:26:47.400]   in terms of investment, your own,
[03:26:47.400 --> 03:26:49.640]   and the entire economy,
[03:26:49.640 --> 03:26:52.820]   and maybe even the economy of the world?
[03:26:52.820 --> 03:26:54.960]   - Sure, so the SEC doesn't allow,
[03:26:54.960 --> 03:26:58.600]   doesn't like us to talk about new funds
[03:26:58.600 --> 03:27:00.800]   that we're launching that we filed with the SEC.
[03:27:00.800 --> 03:27:01.960]   - Sure.
[03:27:01.960 --> 03:27:03.360]   - But I would say I do,
[03:27:04.220 --> 03:27:06.400]   and by the way, if anyone's ever interested in a fund,
[03:27:06.400 --> 03:27:07.960]   they should always read the prospectus carefully,
[03:27:07.960 --> 03:27:08.940]   including the risk factors.
[03:27:08.940 --> 03:27:10.660]   That's very, very important.
[03:27:10.660 --> 03:27:13.720]   But I like the idea of democratizing
[03:27:13.720 --> 03:27:16.220]   access to good investors,
[03:27:16.220 --> 03:27:19.760]   and I think that's an interesting trend,
[03:27:19.760 --> 03:27:21.600]   so we wanna be part of that trend.
[03:27:21.600 --> 03:27:25.840]   In terms of financial markets, generally, the economy,
[03:27:25.840 --> 03:27:27.400]   you know, a lot of it is gonna depend
[03:27:27.400 --> 03:27:28.600]   upon the next leader of the country,
[03:27:28.600 --> 03:27:30.780]   so we're kinda right back there.
[03:27:30.780 --> 03:27:32.240]   You know, the leadership of the United States
[03:27:32.240 --> 03:27:33.280]   is important for the U.S. economy,
[03:27:33.280 --> 03:27:34.520]   it's important for the global economy,
[03:27:34.520 --> 03:27:36.120]   it's important for global peace,
[03:27:36.120 --> 03:27:40.400]   and we've gone through a really difficult period,
[03:27:40.400 --> 03:27:42.800]   and it's time, we need a break.
[03:27:42.800 --> 03:27:44.440]   But, you know, look, I think the United States
[03:27:44.440 --> 03:27:45.920]   is an incredibly resilient country.
[03:27:45.920 --> 03:27:47.900]   We have some incredible moats.
[03:27:47.900 --> 03:27:49.840]   Among them, we have the Atlantic and the Pacific,
[03:27:49.840 --> 03:27:51.520]   and we have, you know, peaceful neighbors
[03:27:51.520 --> 03:27:53.480]   to the North and the South.
[03:27:53.480 --> 03:27:55.680]   We're an enormously rich country.
[03:27:55.680 --> 03:27:58.080]   Capitalism still works effectively here.
[03:27:58.080 --> 03:28:00.000]   I get optimistic about the world
[03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:02.280]   when I talk to my friends who are either venture capitalists
[03:28:02.280 --> 03:28:05.440]   or my hobby of backing these young entrepreneurs.
[03:28:05.440 --> 03:28:07.620]   I talk to a founder of a startup
[03:28:07.620 --> 03:28:08.920]   if you wanna get optimistic about the world,
[03:28:08.920 --> 03:28:12.120]   so I think technology is gonna save us.
[03:28:12.120 --> 03:28:13.200]   I think AI, of course,
[03:28:13.200 --> 03:28:17.440]   has its frightening Terminator-like scenarios,
[03:28:17.440 --> 03:28:20.320]   but I'm gonna take the opposite view,
[03:28:20.320 --> 03:28:25.000]   that this is gonna be a huge enabler of productivity,
[03:28:25.000 --> 03:28:27.160]   scientific discovery, drug discovery,
[03:28:27.160 --> 03:28:30.040]   and it's gonna make us healthier, happier, and better.
[03:28:30.960 --> 03:28:34.760]   So I do think, you know, the internet revolution was,
[03:28:34.760 --> 03:28:36.960]   you know, had a lot of good, obviously some bad.
[03:28:36.960 --> 03:28:38.820]   I think the AI revolution's gonna be similar,
[03:28:38.820 --> 03:28:42.120]   but we're at this other really interesting juncture
[03:28:42.120 --> 03:28:45.400]   in the world, you know, with technology,
[03:28:45.400 --> 03:28:48.160]   and we're gonna have to use it for our good.
[03:28:48.160 --> 03:28:50.120]   On the media front, I'm happy about X,
[03:28:50.120 --> 03:28:53.300]   and I think Elon's gonna be successful here.
[03:28:53.300 --> 03:28:54.840]   I think advertisers will realize
[03:28:54.840 --> 03:28:56.000]   it's a really good platform.
[03:28:56.000 --> 03:28:58.560]   The best way to reach me,
[03:28:58.560 --> 03:29:01.000]   if you wanna sell something to me,
[03:29:01.000 --> 03:29:04.120]   I've actually bought stuff on some ads in X.
[03:29:04.120 --> 03:29:04.960]   I don't remember the last time
[03:29:04.960 --> 03:29:07.600]   I responded to direct-response advertising.
[03:29:07.600 --> 03:29:10.320]   You know, in terms of my business,
[03:29:10.320 --> 03:29:11.320]   I have an incredible team.
[03:29:11.320 --> 03:29:13.920]   It's tiny, and we're one of the smallest firms
[03:29:13.920 --> 03:29:15.960]   relative to the assets we manage.
[03:29:15.960 --> 03:29:20.480]   It's a bit like, you know, the Navy SEALs,
[03:29:20.480 --> 03:29:22.640]   you know, not the U.S. Army.
[03:29:22.640 --> 03:29:24.860]   We have only 40 people at Pershing Square,
[03:29:24.860 --> 03:29:26.520]   so it's a tight team.
[03:29:26.520 --> 03:29:28.080]   I think we'll do great things.
[03:29:28.080 --> 03:29:29.520]   I think we're early on.
[03:29:29.520 --> 03:29:31.560]   You know, my ambitions, investment-wise,
[03:29:31.560 --> 03:29:34.160]   I've always wanted to, I've always said
[03:29:34.160 --> 03:29:36.600]   I'd like to have a record as good as Warren Buffett's.
[03:29:36.600 --> 03:29:38.600]   The problem is, each year he adds on another year.
[03:29:38.600 --> 03:29:40.160]   He's now in his 93rd year,
[03:29:40.160 --> 03:29:44.120]   so I've got 36 more years to just get where he is,
[03:29:44.120 --> 03:29:46.480]   and I think he's gonna add a lot more years.
[03:29:46.480 --> 03:29:49.720]   I'm excited about seeing what Nary's gonna produce.
[03:29:49.720 --> 03:29:51.720]   You know, she's building an incredible company.
[03:29:51.720 --> 03:29:53.600]   They're trying to solve a lot of problems
[03:29:53.600 --> 03:29:57.280]   with respect to products and buildings
[03:29:57.280 --> 03:29:58.840]   and their impact on the environment.
[03:29:58.840 --> 03:30:01.480]   Her vision is, how do we design products
[03:30:01.480 --> 03:30:03.920]   that by virtue of the product's existence,
[03:30:03.920 --> 03:30:05.040]   the world is a better place?
[03:30:05.040 --> 03:30:08.120]   You know, today, you make, you know,
[03:30:08.120 --> 03:30:12.360]   her world is a world where the existence of the new car
[03:30:12.360 --> 03:30:13.920]   actually is better for the environment
[03:30:13.920 --> 03:30:15.480]   than if the new car hadn't existed,
[03:30:15.480 --> 03:30:17.840]   and think about that in every product scale.
[03:30:17.840 --> 03:30:18.800]   That's what she's working on.
[03:30:18.800 --> 03:30:20.340]   I don't wanna give away too much,
[03:30:20.340 --> 03:30:22.760]   but you're gonna see some early examples
[03:30:22.760 --> 03:30:24.200]   of what she's working on.
[03:30:24.200 --> 03:30:26.460]   So again, I get excited about the future.
[03:30:27.460 --> 03:30:31.380]   And crises are sort of a terrible thing to waste,
[03:30:31.380 --> 03:30:32.740]   and we've had a number of these here.
[03:30:32.740 --> 03:30:35.020]   I think this disaster in the Middle East,
[03:30:35.020 --> 03:30:37.880]   my prediction is the next few months,
[03:30:37.880 --> 03:30:40.720]   this war will largely be over
[03:30:40.720 --> 03:30:42.780]   in terms of getting rid of Hamas.
[03:30:42.780 --> 03:30:47.780]   I think I can envision a world in which Saudi Arabia,
[03:30:47.780 --> 03:30:49.900]   some of the other Gulf states come together,
[03:30:49.900 --> 03:30:54.540]   take over the governance and reconstruction of Gaza,
[03:30:54.540 --> 03:30:56.700]   security guarantees are put in place,
[03:30:56.700 --> 03:30:59.500]   the Abraham Accords continue to grow,
[03:30:59.500 --> 03:31:02.640]   a deal is made, terrorists are ostracized.
[03:31:02.640 --> 03:31:08.340]   That this October 7th experience on the Harvard,
[03:31:08.340 --> 03:31:12.460]   Penn, MIT, Columbia, unfortunately, other campuses
[03:31:12.460 --> 03:31:15.660]   is a wake-up call for universities generally.
[03:31:15.660 --> 03:31:19.820]   You know, people see the problems with DEI,
[03:31:19.820 --> 03:31:22.880]   but understand the importance of diversity and inclusion,
[03:31:22.880 --> 03:31:24.300]   but not as a political movement,
[03:31:24.300 --> 03:31:28.700]   but as a way that we return to a meritocratic world
[03:31:28.700 --> 03:31:30.180]   where someone's background is relevant
[03:31:30.180 --> 03:31:33.620]   in understanding their contribution.
[03:31:33.620 --> 03:31:36.100]   But it's not, we don't have race quotas
[03:31:36.100 --> 03:31:38.860]   and things that were made illegal years ago
[03:31:38.860 --> 03:31:42.300]   actually being implemented in organizations on campus.
[03:31:42.300 --> 03:31:45.020]   So I think there's, if we can go through a corrective phase,
[03:31:45.020 --> 03:31:47.620]   and I'm an optimist, and I hope we get there.
[03:31:47.620 --> 03:31:51.260]   - So you have hope for the entirety of it, even for Harvard.
[03:31:51.260 --> 03:31:53.900]   - I have hope even for Harvard.
[03:31:53.900 --> 03:31:56.540]   It's generally hard to break 400-year-old things.
[03:31:56.540 --> 03:31:58.100]   - Well, I share your hope,
[03:31:58.100 --> 03:32:02.540]   and you're a fascinating mind, a brilliant mind,
[03:32:02.540 --> 03:32:06.500]   persistent, as you like to say, and fearless.
[03:32:06.500 --> 03:32:08.740]   The fearless part is truly inspiring,
[03:32:08.740 --> 03:32:10.980]   and this was an incredible conversation.
[03:32:10.980 --> 03:32:12.940]   Thank you, thank you for talking today, Bill.
[03:32:12.940 --> 03:32:14.500]   - Thank you, Lex.
[03:32:14.500 --> 03:32:15.980]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:32:15.980 --> 03:32:17.100]   with Bill Ackman.

[03:32:22.940 --> 03:32:24.860]   from Jonathan Swift.
[03:32:24.860 --> 03:32:29.100]   A wise person should have money in their head,
[03:32:29.100 --> 03:32:30.860]   but not in their heart.
[03:32:30.860 --> 03:32:35.140]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[03:32:35.140 --> 03:32:37.740]   (upbeat music)
