[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.200]   - Well, sometimes we find it hard to pray
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.600]   because we are under spiritual attack.
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.280]   And sometimes we find it hard to pray
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.160]   because we lack personal discipline.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.620]   And in a 1988 sermon, Pastor John explained
[00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.320]   the physical side of prayerful alertness.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.080]   That's one reason for sharing today's clip.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.520]   The other reason is that two weeks ago,
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.000]   we were talking about wrestling and prayer back in ABJ 1795.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.100]   And at the end of that episode,
[00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.040]   Pastor John threw in a little definition of prayer
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.520]   as being quote, a wartime walkie talkie.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.620]   Prayer as a wartime walkie talkie.
[00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.200]   You might remember that from a couple of weeks ago.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.160]   At the end of that episode,
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.680]   I mentioned that we had never really talked here
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.000]   on the podcast about that phrase,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.580]   which is one of Pastor John's favorite metaphors for prayer.
[00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.880]   And today I wanna give you a glimpse
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.460]   into how he uses that metaphor.
[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.880]   Prayer is not a domestic intercom to ring the butler.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.680]   It's a wartime walkie talkie to connect us with the general.
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.520]   And Pastor John explains this really well
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.400]   in a sermon clip from 1988.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.240]   Here he is.
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:09.120]   - Now, if you've been around Bethlehem a little while,
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.840]   you might have picked up that one of my favorite analogies
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.800]   of prayer is a wartime walkie talkie.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.760]   And I like to contrast the wartime walkie talkie of prayer
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.360]   with the domestic intercom.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.960]   And what I like to say is,
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.480]   one of the reasons that prayer malfunctions
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.040]   is because people take a wartime walkie talkie
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.980]   and try to turn it into a domestic intercom
[00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.120]   in which they ring up the butler
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.960]   to please bring another pillow to the den.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.700]   Prayer was designed for the battlefield
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.440]   as a wartime walkie talkie,
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.440]   not to increase the pad of the saints
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.880]   through a domestic intercom.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.680]   Now, keep that image in your mind
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.760]   as I read these verses again,
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.000]   and then I wanna paint a picture for you
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.260]   of the situation it looks to me like Paul is in.
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.360]   Continue steadfastly in prayer,
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.640]   being watchful in it with thanksgiving.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.000]   Pray for us also that God may open a door for the word
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.420]   to declare the mystery of Christ
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.620]   on account of which I'm in prison,
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.420]   that I may make it clear as I ought to speak.
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.020]   Here's one way to picture what's going on here.
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.020]   Paul, Epiphras, Luke, Timothy, Aristarchus,
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.260]   that's the team mentioned in this book in other verses,
[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.400]   kind of storm troopers,
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.780]   you could picture them as on the front lines.
[00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.340]   They have an assignment to penetrate
[00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.860]   the enemy line of Satan
[00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.140]   and to take captive for God,
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.140]   souls who are being blinded and held by Satan.
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.540]   They attempt to spearhead a breach through the enemy line
[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.180]   and they hit a massive counterforce.
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.020]   The result, at least two of them,
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.340]   Aristarchus and Paul are in a prison camp.
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.900]   It looks as though the enemy has gotten
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.860]   a significant tactical victory,
[00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.860]   but Paul in the camp manages to scratch a note
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.140]   and smuggle it out of the camp to the soldiers
[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.220]   who are not at this point on the front line.
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.700]   They're called Colossians back up country in the high ground
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.020]   and the note at this point simply says,
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.020]   "Use walkie talkie, call the commander,
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.020]   have him fire a missile, gives the coordinates
[00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.620]   and tell him to blow the door off of this prison
[00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.180]   and open a door for the word of God
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.280]   to go forward behind those lines
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.780]   and to rescue those people that we were after
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.880]   when we got waylaid here in this prison."
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.540]   Now, the point so far is this,
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.060]   we're all soldiers and we're all on the battlefield.
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.340]   Some of us are in different places on the battlefield
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.500]   and some penetrating a front line
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.620]   can get into grave difficulty.
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.460]   And the job of the rest of the soldiers
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.120]   is to use the walkie talkie of prayer
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.020]   to call in air cover and firepower
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.740]   for those stormtroopers.
[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.460]   We are crucial in evangelism indirectly through prayer.
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:53.620]   So here is what the text, verses two to four,
[00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.220]   answers for us indirect supporters.
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.060]   It answers how to pray and what to pray.
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.380]   It gives three answers to each of those questions.
[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.140]   Let's look at them briefly.
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.860]   First of all, how to pray.
[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.340]   Verse two, the first way is persistently.
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.220]   Verse two, continue steadfastly in prayer
[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.220]   or your version might say, devote yourselves to prayer.
[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.660]   Be persistent, continuous, devoted.
[00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.460]   Here's a way to illustrate this.
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.460]   Prayer is not like these new telephones that you can buy
[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.340]   that don't have any cords.
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.680]   Our sons won one of these telephones
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.600]   by selling a lot of magazines.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.700]   So we now have one of these Tweety Bird telephones
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.380]   and you can just pull the little aerial up,
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.420]   flick it on and walk around the house,
[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.420]   talking, go out in the yard.
[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.220]   Now, prayer is not like these telephones
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.300]   because as soon as you take that telephone off the hook
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.500]   and start using it, the power runs out of it.
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.340]   It starts getting weaker and weaker and weaker.
[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.340]   And if you keep on using it, it's useless.
[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.780]   You gotta stop using it.
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.780]   You gotta hang it up in order for it to get power again.
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.100]   Prayer is exactly the opposite.
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.500]   If you hang prayer up on the wall of your bedroom
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.060]   when you leave in the morning,
[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.520]   it will be dead when you come home at night, very likely.
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.220]   But the best way to keep prayer powerful
[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.360]   is to hook it like I got this little doohickey
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.580]   right on me here.
[00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.280]   See, that's hooked up to this.
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.280]   You just keep it hooked on your belt
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.340]   and make sure it stays on.
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.700]   I gotta flick this thing off between services
[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.060]   or I've got no juice, the battery runs out.
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.120]   Prayer is just the opposite.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.300]   You gotta keep it on
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.300]   because it gets more and more and more powerful
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.500]   the more you use it.
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.380]   I think that's what's meant by be persistent in prayer.
[00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.940]   It doesn't run out of juice.
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.860]   It's more and more effective as you devote yourself to it
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.020]   and continue in it.
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.900]   So when you're done in the morning,
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.180]   suppose you spend five minutes or 10 or 20 or 30 minutes
[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.780]   in prayer in the morning,
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.380]   don't hang it up, hang it on right here
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.660]   and don't flick it off, flick it on.
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.820]   So there's a little red light showing
[00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.440]   and you can get beeps and a little tweety sound
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.820]   during the day from God
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.020]   and he can just listen to you
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.420]   anytime you wanna pick it up.
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:31.420]   Second way to pray after persistently is watchfully.
[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.540]   You see that in verse two?
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:38.460]   Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it.
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.380]   Now, why do we need to be watchful and what does that mean?
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.620]   Satan, who is the enemy that we're against
[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.340]   and who is holding people bondage
[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:54.020]   knows how dangerous this walkie talkie is to his purposes.
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.100]   And so he will try to jam the airwaves
[00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.740]   so you can't get through.
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:03.580]   He'll try to steal the unit so that you can't use it
[00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.900]   and he'll try to put you to sleep with some drug
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.980]   while you're talking on it.
[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.660]   Now, how does he do those three things?
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.260]   He's the prince of the power of the air.
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.940]   Picture him now, he's just everywhere as it were,
[00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:20.180]   at least his influence is everywhere.
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.940]   And our airwaves gotta get to God
[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.900]   through this walkie talkie of prayer
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.980]   and it's as though he can jam the airwaves
[00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.500]   by filling our atmosphere
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:36.500]   with an incredible number of non-essential things
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.460]   so that the atmosphere over our brain
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.540]   is so cluttered with insignificant
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.860]   and sometimes very worldly things
[00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.500]   that our little effort to send our signal up
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.300]   just goes click and doesn't even get through.
[00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.860]   And he's really good at cluttering your brain
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.900]   with non-essential airwaves
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.900]   that jam his or your desires to get through.
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.820]   How does he steal the unit?
[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:10.740]   He steals the unit by tricking you into thinking it's broken
[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.980]   so that you lay it down and walk away from it.
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:18.820]   And the third way, namely causing us to go to sleep
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.580]   with some drug as we talk.
[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.340]   There are a lot of ways he does this.
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:30.140]   Let me tell you the most common way that he does this.
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:34.460]   Satan puts you to sleep in prayer
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.660]   most commonly by tricking you
[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.100]   into staying up too late the night before.
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.660]   Now I think this is a real serious business here
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.420]   and I'm preaching to myself mainly.
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:50.260]   God designed you to need a certain amount of sleep.
[00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:51.980]   Most people are about the same,
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.980]   you might be a little different.
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.340]   If you don't get that amount of sleep,
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.020]   you get irritable and that's a sin
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.900]   and therefore not getting enough sleep
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.900]   is giving a foothold to the devil.
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.260]   It leads to depression.
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:09.220]   It leads to falling asleep during prayer.
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.420]   So when you start to fall asleep during prayer
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.260]   and you say, "Oh, gotta fight the fight here."
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:17.380]   Look, that fight was lost the night before.
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:21.780]   And the problem is we don't see the fight the night before.
[00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:25.300]   We don't recognize that when it's time to go to bed
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.460]   in order to get God's prescribed amount of sleep,
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.140]   we don't realize Satan is the one
[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.860]   who's tricking us to watch another TV program.
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.580]   Satan is the one who's keeping us reading the book.
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.020]   Satan is the one who keeps us
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.620]   in the newspaper and the magazine.
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.020]   Satan is the one who keeps us out in the yard
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.060]   poking around or whatever.
[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.940]   Because Satan knows if I can cut it back
[00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.540]   to six or five or four hours,
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:51.740]   I'll wreck their day.
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:56.300]   I'll wreck their day and make them useless for God
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:00.260]   and I will put them to sleep during prayer.
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:05.780]   Vigilance or watchfulness is the only answer that I know of.
[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:10.540]   That is when the temptation comes to fight back
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.980]   with an awareness of what God has called you to do.
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.660]   Now, I don't know the last or final answer
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.180]   to why God designed human beings
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:22.620]   to be unconscious one third of their life.
[00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.460]   That's a great puzzle to me.
[00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.940]   But He did.
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:30.940]   I think it has to do with wanting to teach us
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.980]   that we are not God.
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.700]   I think sleep is the most humbling experience
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.140]   that anybody ever has.
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.660]   If there's any point in your life
[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.060]   where you are utterly childlike and helpless,
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.820]   it's when you're unconscious in bed at night.
[00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:47.180]   And God designed you to go unconscious
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.700]   about a third of your life.
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.220]   Probably more than a third if you count
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.060]   how much you slept when you were a baby or a child.
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:59.220]   You just gotta own up to that and stop trying to be God.
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.300]   I do anyway.
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:05.660]   The third way we are to pray besides persistently
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:09.660]   and watchfully is thankfully.
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.100]   Continue steadfastly in prayer, it says,
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.780]   being watchful in it with thanksgiving.
[00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.020]   Now, in case the wartime analogy
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.180]   makes you jittery,
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.420]   suppose this wartime talk that I'm using
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:23.780]   causes you to think in terms of,
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:25.540]   oh, it just means you're biting your nails
[00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.340]   and your heart is thumping and your hands are sweating.
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.580]   This is an awful view of the Christian life.
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:32.780]   Well, that would be an awful view of the Christian life.
[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:37.780]   So this word is added to get rid of that image.
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.780]   If that's what wartime signifies to you
[00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:43.660]   rather than the thrill of conquest,
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.500]   then thanksgiving is added here
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.420]   to mellow things out a little bit.
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:54.460]   We ought, as we call in the headquarters
[00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:58.940]   to guide us through the minefields of temptation
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.620]   and to give us the firepower we need
[00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:05.140]   and to blast doors off the hinges in our lives,
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.860]   we ought to mingle with all of our requests,
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:10.620]   sentences like this.
[00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:14.180]   The missile hit right on target, sir.
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:15.380]   Thank you.
[00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:18.020]   The door was blown off its hinges, sir.
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.260]   Thank you.
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.980]   We're heading out in full force, sir.
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.380]   Thank you.
[00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.660]   The arm of Aristarchus has been healed, sir.
[00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:27.540]   Thank you.
[00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.620]   We're coming in, sir, with 20 captives.
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:31.460]   Thank you.
[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:37.820]   You see, the battle belongs to the Lord.
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.620]   All the crucial engagements with Satan
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.820]   in the wilderness, in Gethsemane,
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.060]   on the cross, at the empty tomb,
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:51.060]   every one of them were triumphantly won by Jesus Christ.
[00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.820]   We do not fight one single battle
[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:59.780]   with the mindset that we are going to be losers in the end.
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:03.980]   We fight all of our battles knowing that in Jesus Christ,
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:07.100]   we will win and therefore gratitude
[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:11.060]   ought to ring through this walkie talkie all the time.
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.700]   If it doesn't, something will malfunction
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:16.900]   in the walkie talkie.
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:20.500]   It has this little sensor in there that begins to click
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.820]   when there's not enough gratitude going through.
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.100]   That's the answer to the question,
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:32.100]   how to pray as supporters of stormtroopers.
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.780]   Paradigm shaping definition of prayer here.
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.180]   One of the reasons we feel so weak in our prayer lives
[00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:40.740]   is that we have tried to make a domestic intercom
[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:44.100]   out of a wartime walkie talkie, end quote.
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.220]   So such a great clip.
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:50.260]   This clip is from John Piper's May 29th, 1988 sermon titled
[00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.220]   Walk in Wisdom Toward Those Outside.
[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:56.660]   The whole thing is available right now at desiringgod.org.
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.420]   If you have a sermon clip to share, email me.
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:01.260]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title,
[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.220]   the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio
[00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:04.740]   and make a note of what stands out to you.
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.500]   Put the word clip in the subject line of an email
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.700]   and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:13.340]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.540]   Well, Friday we return with Pastor John
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.580]   and we will all return to 2 Thessalonians.
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:22.740]   Who is this mysterious man of lawlessness
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.660]   who appears in chapter two?
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:26.780]   We'll find out on Friday.
[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.100]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.060]   We'll see you then.
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:44.260]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
