[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400]   Well, enough of that nonsense.
[00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.560]   All right, what do we got?
[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.560]   Let's keep rolling.
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.040]   See, I'm getting quicker now, Jesse.
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.040]   OK.
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.040]   I'm picking up the pace.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.960]   So next question is from Sam.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.840]   He's a 28-year-old PhD student.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.480]   And he says, "I found the 500 words a day formula for slow productivity to be a useful
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.480]   frame.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.360]   However, as a PhD student in computer science, a lot of my work doesn't involve much writing.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.560]   How would I adapt the 500 words a day target for my research?"
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.800]   So the context of the 500 words a day reference there from Sam is at some point, I don't know,
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.320]   maybe a few months ago, on the podcast, I talked about John McPhee.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.320]   I think I was probably talking about an essay I wrote for my newsletter, whatever.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.080]   The point is I was emphasizing that John McPhee is seen in the context of his entire career
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.760]   as being very productive.
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.760]   He's written all these books.
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.760]   He has the Pulitzers.
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.800]   He has the National Book Award and a huge bibliography.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.880]   But he doesn't actually work that much on any given day.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.800]   In fact, his target is he admits just to write 500 words a day.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.560]   So this was a classic example of slow productivity.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.380]   This working at this natural, sustainable pace over time can produce great stuff.
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.160]   So if we expand the timeline at which we're evaluating productivity to be a career or
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.260]   the last 10 years, as opposed to having a narrow timeline of today or the last week,
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.680]   you get this much more sustainable rhythm of work.
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.160]   You don't have to be busy or killing yourself every day with work to produce stuff that
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.160]   you're proud of.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.160]   Okay.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.120]   So Sam is saying, "What is the equivalent of 500 words a day if you're not a writer?"
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.200]   And I think that's a good question.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.960]   So we could address this first of all, just specifically in terms of Sam's particular
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.960]   context, which is a PhD student.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.720]   And you look, I see that, I feel your pain there, Sam.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.800]   I used to do a lot of appearances at boot camps, graduate student dissertation boot
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.800]   camps.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.800]   I used to do this at Georgetown.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.660]   I would also do it at a nearby Catholic university when I knew some professors over there.
[00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.320]   It's very common that you would do these once a year gatherings, they're called dissertation
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.400]   boot camps, where grad students get together to hear talks and motivate each other to work
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.860]   on their dissertations.
[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.440]   And I was a broken record at these boot camps because all of the advice was always centered
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.920]   on write every day, get your writing done.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.300]   Don't forget to write because in a lot of disciplines, writing is the actual primary
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.220]   activity that pushes a thesis forward.
[00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.380]   Not the case of mathematics, not the case in computer science.
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.880]   You write papers eventually, but research is not writing.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.540]   It's solving math equations, trying to figure out theorems, running experiments.
[00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.580]   And so I used to come to these boot camps and I was a broken record.
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.140]   I would say, stop saying writing is your generic verb for working.
[00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.100]   For a lot of people, the core of their work has nothing to do with actually writing.
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.980]   So I feel your pain, Sam.
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.060]   Writing is, should not be seen as a universal verb for doing deep work in graduate school.
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.560]   But what I want to do here is generalize out and answer this for people in general.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.700]   I don't want to get too academia specific.
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.940]   So let's just be in general.
[00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:23.980]   How do we translate this general philosophy of 500 words a day to other types of work?
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:33.300]   What I think is key here is this notion of slow and steady and timeline expansion.
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.060]   If you expand your timeline on which you are evaluating your productivity to something
[00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.900]   at the scale of years, then often a varied slow and steady approach is going to work
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.580]   quite well.
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.540]   And when you're evaluating your production on what you really care about at that type
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:59.540]   of expanded timeline, you begin to see the futility or the performative unnecessity of
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.860]   really hard days.
[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.420]   You know, I'm just burning the midnight oil.
[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.420]   I've been writing all day.
[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.580]   I'm going to write till midnight tonight and wake up really early to write.
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.820]   You could do that.
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.340]   And maybe in the moment you'll be like, man, I know I'm being productive because look how
[00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.340]   hard I'm working.
[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.880]   But when you're talking about what do I produce over the next five years, that's not sustainable.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.460]   It also doesn't really matter.
[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:26.020]   Working quality work again and again in the right setting, giving the work the respect
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.320]   and the support it needs to be good.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.320]   Going up and down in intensity.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.320]   You know what?
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.320]   I'm taking a week off.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.320]   I didn't get there.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.320]   I was sick today.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.320]   I didn't write.
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.320]   I didn't do my homework.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.780]   Did you produce something that you're proud of?
[00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.660]   And that is going to be best served by slow, steady quality.
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:48.260]   So I think that's how we generalize John McPhee is 500 words a day is you don't have to be
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:57.360]   exhausted or frantic today to having ended up produce something great next year.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.780]   You need to slowly accrete good quality work at a reasonable rate.
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.020]   And that also happens to be a much more sustainable way to live and work.
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.780]   So that's what I would say.
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:15.880]   Slow steady don't not work, but don't be so proud of yourself for staying up real late.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.020]   That just means you forgot a deadline and you will guaranteed win a Pulitzer Prize like
[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.580]   John McPhee.
