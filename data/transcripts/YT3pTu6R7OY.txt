[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   When I tried to read mathematics, it would take an hour a page and I'd get some of the ideas but not others.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.240]   And usually it would be six months later that suddenly it would click.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:21.800]   And so I think I thought of myself as sort of slow, but I never grew up in some sense.
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.640]   And as far as I can tell, I've been getting better at things slowly and steadily.
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:36.240]   It was only when I was older that I noticed that most people do something wonderful and then they get stuck.
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.360]   And I started to make theories of why do people get stuck and how to avoid it.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.840]   And the best thing is to, if you've done something, you should be ashamed of it instead of proud of it.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:57.560]   And I notice a lot of people keep saying, "Well, I thought of that a long time ago," and they keep trying to get recognition.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.680]   And why bother?
