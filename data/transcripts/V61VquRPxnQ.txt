[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   As humans, we are very drawn to anecdotal experience.
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.680]   We really like stories and we find stories very compelling.
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.280]   And one of the things I've found
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.360]   in all of these years of using data
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.040]   is that I really believe in data.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.400]   And that's my core, I've trained as an economist.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.720]   My economics work is very situated in data, I love it.
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.920]   If you tell me, here's a piece of data,
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.480]   here's a great randomized trial
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.920]   and here's what you learned from it,
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.520]   I find that very compelling.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.140]   One of the things I've learned over time
[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.140]   is that not everyone finds data as compelling as I do.
[00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.880]   And there is sometimes a lot of value
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.840]   in helping people understand
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.120]   why data is just a lot of anecdotes altogether.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.640]   When we think about how we can better incorporate
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.080]   the use of data in decisions,
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.080]   one key is to make sure you are asking the question
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.960]   in a thoughtful way that is seeking an answer
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.840]   rather than making our decisions in the moment that someone is coming at us with an anecdote.
