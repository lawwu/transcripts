[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.700]   I think recovery is, it's not about finding a, let's just use the word peace. It's not about
[00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.480]   finding a sense of peace that you stay in. You know, balance is not, I'm on both feet standing
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.320]   still. Balance is like, like this, right? And as we're taking risks in life, as we should
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.820]   to really build awesome lives, sometimes we're going to feel way off kilter, but with the
[00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.720]   recovery process to be able to recognize when I'm out of balance sooner or out of peace sooner and
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.040]   return to it quicker, recover again and again, you know, and have the tools to know, you know,
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.240]   what are the emotional conditions that I might be facing on every day? And what, what, what am I
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:48.100]   made of up and who am I that might bring to that? So for instance, something I give to a lot of my
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:56.680]   clients is we call it like the emotional weather forecast. You know, when the first part of this
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.360]   is they've got to really know themselves. And that's something that we see in 12 step a lot,
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.320]   although we hear if, if, you know, people identify their character defects, not everybody I know is
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.060]   familiar with 12 step, but that's one of the, but as part of identifying your defects, you're also
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.400]   identifying your virtues, right? Just like a balance sheet. You want to know your liabilities
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:21.400]   and your assets. And sometimes those things are, sometimes they, they, they change. And if something
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.300]   that's a liability in this situation might be an asset in this situation, right? Like if
[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:35.240]   uncontrolled anger and violence in my home, when my kids do something wrong and I'm not doing this,
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:43.160]   but it is, is a liability, you know, if my family's attacked, it's an asset, right? So understanding what
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:51.140]   these defects and virtue or assets and liabilities are so that I really know myself. And, and, and that
[00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.160]   can be through a process of, of, of sharing with others. And in the 12 step, that's how they do it.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.740]   We do it in therapy all of the time to kind of know who I am. You know, actually one of, there's a line in
[00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.820]   one of the AA literature that Bill Wilson wrote and he gives a definition of humility and it goes
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.980]   something like this, that humility is an honest recognition of who and what we've become followed
[00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.980]   by a deep desire to become who we can be. And it's not about like that. I'm all bad. It's just to note it,
[00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.460]   to, to, to recognize who I am. If I don't know where I'm starting, I can't know, just like finding
[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.660]   directions. If I asked, you know, to get directions to the studio and your team started giving me
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:42.200]   directions from, uh, uh, over the Canyon, but I was, you know, South of here, they're going to give me
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.080]   the directions to turn left on this road and right on this. And I'm going to, I'm not going to know how
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.580]   to get there. I'm not, I'm going to be disoriented. I'm going to feel lost. I got to, it starts with
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.480]   really knowing where I am, who, and who, and what I am. And from there, then we can start to build a
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.620]   life. So one of the things I give people a lot is once they kind of understand these assets and,
[00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.860]   and, and liabilities of theirs, you know, to, to look at each day ahead and say, you know,
[00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.940]   first we start off with gratitude, you know, it kind of gives a mindset and gratitude just isn't
[00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.200]   about being thankful for things. I really believe gratitude is meeting what is, as it is, you know,
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.820]   that, uh, I always, when I give people this and when I practice it myself, I try at least to be
[00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.520]   one of the things I'm grateful for to be something that I'm challenged by. And not just to say,
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.420]   I'm going to learn a lesson from this, but I might not know what that is, but to really express
[00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.920]   gratitude for some challenge I'm, I'm, I'm having. So that's kind of a mindset. And then the next thing
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.880]   is just laying out your plans for the day and, and not like a detailed calendar, but like, you know,
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.820]   I'm going to wait, you know, take the kids to school, go to work, travel, you know, have a business
[00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:55.300]   dinner tonight. Right. And then, so I kind of know what's happening that day. And then from there,
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.440]   look at what are my, what's my emotional state currently? What am I experiencing now? Especially
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.000]   if it's like fears, resentments, anger, guilt, shame, it could be something else. It could just
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.200]   be like, I'm feeling, I feel really solid today. But when I can take the, what's going to happen today
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.760]   and what I'm already experiencing, I can look at what I'm doing today and think, you know, there are
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.240]   some character liabilities or defects that might come up. Like if I have to travel today and I've
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.680]   got to take three flights instead of one, I can know that if I know myself, I might say I could, I have
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:35.180]   the ability to become impatient, controlling, and, and look at my day to say, almost predict what are the
[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:41.240]   emotional disturbances that can, that can happen that day. And then coupled with the state that I'm in,
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.820]   if I'm already upset about something else, I've got a higher likelihood of going into these
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:52.340]   reactive patterns that I don't necessarily want to go into. And so, you know, much like going on a trip
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.780]   where I would look and see what the weather's going to be, you know, if it's going to be,
[00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.940]   looks like it's going to be rainy the whole time I'm there, I'm going to pack a raincoat. Now that
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:06.160]   doesn't mean I'm not going to get wet, but once I start getting wet, I can go get my raincoat and put it
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.640]   on. Same thing in this, you know, the last part of it is to look for what I'm going to watch for
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:18.360]   because of my plans and my emotional state. Now I know that I have to watch for being like maybe short
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.920]   or controlling. I want to watch for these character defects or liabilities. And then what do I want to
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:30.340]   strive for? I'm going to strive for being patient, tolerant, kind. Now, just because I write this down,
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.260]   just like the rain jacket doesn't mean I'm not going to experience these things. But when I can
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:41.780]   look at like a day as an example, I can break it down and in a chunk where, you know, I'm not going
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.380]   to be shocked by I'm being impatient. And as soon as I get impatient, I can remember, oh, this is what
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.480]   I'm looking, this is what I want to watch out for today. What do I need to, and I wanted to strive
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.020]   for being tolerant and patient. So then I can, you know, use one of the tools that I might have that
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.320]   I've laid out. You know, it might just be, if I'm in the airport, walk away, take a breath,
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:07.160]   you know, and, and recognize and remind myself, this is what I'm striving for today. And in this
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:14.800]   exercise, we're putting out in front of us, what we might be experiencing based on what we know about
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.160]   ourselves and what we've learned about ourselves. And when we can do that, we, you know, we can start
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:26.600]   living each day a little bit better, or at least I find this with my clients that they can chunk it down
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:32.080]   and say, you know, they're not surprised by these emotional reactions. And, and, and, you know,
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.100]   like I said earlier, we, we want to help people. I try to help people learn how to feel bad,
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:43.660]   you know, to, to recognize that, okay, I'm feeling disturbed. I'm in a reaction. Let me lean into it
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.460]   rather than run away from it. And we run away from it in different ways. I mean, snapping at the lady
[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:54.400]   at the counter or, you know, might be someone that now I just totally withdraw and don't say anything.
[00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.760]   Yeah. Numbing out is very common nowadays. Yeah. I just want to repeat these different
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:08.320]   categories. A small list of gratitudes, including perhaps some things that we're grateful that
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.020]   challenge us or things that we've received or whatever it happens to be a quick list of gratitudes,
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:18.740]   plan for the day, what the internal emotional weather is, like, how am I feeling? Irritated,
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:24.060]   rested, whatever. It could be three or four things, what to watch for and what to strive for. I do think
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:30.860]   it's an extremely useful, obviously zero cost, minimal, minimal time investment protocol for lack
[00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:38.340]   of a better word that everyone, not just people who struggle with addiction, but everyone can benefit
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:47.820]   from because I think we, we tend to be so conscious of like what to look for, what to strive for coming
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.800]   out of a morning journaling or a great night's sleep. But then, you know, it's amazing how by three,
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:57.640]   3 p.m. somebody cuts us off in traffic or, you know, or we're being bombarded with too many things and all
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:02.480]   of a sudden we're, we're not necessarily unpeeled, but we're not our, our, our best self. Do you think
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.380]   there's value in sharing your list with somebody else?
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:10.920]   Connection with others is so important, especially when I share something like this, that's vulnerable
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:16.920]   with them because it's not just about holding me accountable, but now, now I'm, I'm, I'm expressing
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:23.500]   it in a way that others see it and we can have communication with them about, you know, having
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:28.180]   them share it back with you too. I have like 10 guys that I share this with every day, you know, and not
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.720]   that the way that I do things is the way that everybody should, but I ask other people that I give
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:40.100]   this to, to share it because, you know, you're, you're now expressing it and expressing something
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:45.360]   kind of brings it more into existence than if I'm just doing it myself internally. And we've got to
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:51.060]   put these things in front of us because we will forget very quickly, you know, or you, like you said,
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.720]   coming out of a morning journaling or meditation session feels great.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:59.020]   I think most people decide to make a change and then, you know, on one day, and then they don't
[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:04.420]   think about it again in the way that they thought about it for months. Like it happens every year on
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:10.480]   New Year's. They're not putting it out in front of them every day to be a reminder of what I'm going
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.800]   after, what's important to me.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:18.800]   Thank you.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.860]   you
