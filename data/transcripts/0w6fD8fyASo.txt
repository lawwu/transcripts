[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.200]   - Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.640]   Well, God is happy in himself, amen.
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.020]   And God wants us to be happy in himself, amen.
[00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.320]   And if you start to apply biblical categories here
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.040]   to this topic, you begin to ask this question.
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.200]   How does God's joy become my joy?
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   That's our question today.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.600]   A really good one from a listener named Heather in Chicago.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.360]   Hello, Pastor John, thank you for this podcast, she writes.
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.120]   My question for you is about the nature of who God is
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.020]   and how he relates to our joy.
[00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.400]   Can you explain to me from the Bible,
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.720]   the person and work of the Holy Spirit
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.280]   as the love and joy shared between the Father and the Son?
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.600]   I don't quite understand this
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.200]   without making his person seem more like a force
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.520]   or a cosmic energy.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.760]   And then how does the person of the Spirit
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.880]   enable us to experience God's joy within us?
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.280]   It seems like those two realities connect
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.080]   to the person of the Spirit and the joy in us,
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.120]   but it doesn't connect for me, not yet.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.680]   Can you help me understand these two dynamics
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.360]   from the Bible?
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.320]   - I think it's crucial as we try to understand
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.460]   our relationship with the Holy Spirit,
[00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.760]   that we fix it firmly in our minds
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.460]   that we are dealing with a distinct person.
[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.880]   Just fix it.
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.620]   So that, whatever else is uncertain,
[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.240]   don't let that be uncertain.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.480]   A person, a divine person,
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.240]   the third person of the Trinity.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.040]   In fact, I've been struck recently,
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.700]   even before I heard this question,
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.540]   I've been struck recently how the New Testament
[00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.220]   encourages us to enjoy fellowship
[00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.220]   with each of the three divine persons of the Trinity.
[00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:07.060]   Not just fellowship with God in the abstract or general way,
[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.180]   but fellowship with God, the Father,
[00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.980]   fellowship with God, the Son,
[00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.240]   fellowship with God, the Spirit.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.260]   For example, 1 Corinthians 1.9 says
[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.820]   that God called us into the fellowship of his Son.
[00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.500]   2 Corinthians 13.14 refers to the fellowship
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.500]   of the Holy Spirit.
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.500]   1 John 1.3 says our fellowship is with the Father.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.240]   So we're taught to have fellowship, communion,
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.780]   personal relations with the Father, the Son,
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.620]   the Holy Spirit.
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.200]   And you know what book I would recommend, Tony.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.900]   John Owen, "Of Communion with God."
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.380]   Nobody, I don't think, in the history of the church
[00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.180]   has helped people come to terms
[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.260]   with what it means to relate to each person
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.740]   of the Trinity like John Owen.
[00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.660]   I would recommend "Of Communion with God" by John Owen.
[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.820]   Now that implies that the Holy Spirit is a person,
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.020]   someone you can relate to, talk to,
[00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.740]   which is exactly the way Jesus spoke of him.
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.740]   He says in John 14.26, "The helper, the Holy Spirit,
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.960]   "whom the Father will send in my name,
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.000]   "he, and yes, it is masculine,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.780]   "not neuter to agree with spirit, pneuma,
[00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.460]   "he will teach you all things."
[00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.360]   So he is distinct from the Father
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.220]   because the Father sends him,
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.300]   and he's a teacher when he comes,
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.780]   not just a force or gas.
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.300]   And the apostle Paul picks up on this very reality
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.820]   of the Spirit as distinct from the Father
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.820]   and a very personal teacher in 1 Corinthians 2.10 and 13
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.780]   where he says, "The Spirit searches everything,
[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.560]   "even the depths of God."
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.640]   What an amazing statement.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.360]   "The Spirit searches the depths of God,
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.360]   "and we impart things of God in words taught by the Spirit."
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.920]   So just like Jesus, Paul picking it up
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.680]   and continuing what Jesus taught.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.080]   So Jesus and Paul treat the Holy Spirit
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.860]   not as an impersonal force or power,
[00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.840]   but as a person who comes and teaches
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.840]   and indwells believers and who can be related to personally.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:51.280]   Then consider that Jesus said in John 4.24,
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.540]   "God is Spirit, and those who worship him
[00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.840]   "must worship him in spirit and in truth."
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.080]   In other words, God is not material,
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.320]   he's not physical, he is Spirit.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.320]   Which means when we say that one of the persons
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.080]   of the Trinity is the Spirit of God,
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.560]   we are saying he is the Spirit of a Spirit.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.920]   Now, what does that mean?
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.560]   What does it mean to say the Spirit has a Spirit?
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.280]   We are not saying he's the image of the Spirit
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.100]   or the radiance of Spirit or the logos or word of Spirit,
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.740]   all of which are said about the Son.
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.740]   So what are we saying when we refer to the Holy Spirit
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.520]   of God who is himself as Trinity Spirit?
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.780]   Here's what Edwards says, Jonathan Edwards,
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.780]   who has helped me so much, quote,
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.200]   "The word spirit in scripture,
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.200]   "when used concerning minds or spirits,
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:15.140]   "is put for the disposition, inclination,
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.260]   "or temper of the mind."
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.580]   For example, when Ephesians 4.27 says,
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.140]   "Be renewed in the spirit of your mind,"
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.400]   the disposition or temper of your mind.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.220]   So I suppose, I'm still quoting Edwards,
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.820]   so I suppose when we read of the Spirit of God
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.560]   who we are told is a Spirit,
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.140]   it is to be understood of the disposition or temper
[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.900]   or affection of the mind.
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:53.740]   Now, the sum of God's temper or disposition is love,
[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.740]   for he is infinite love, 1 John 4, 8, end of quote.
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:03.260]   Now, when he says that, we must resist,
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.080]   we must resist, as Heather pointed out,
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.060]   the temptation to think of love as a mere force
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.480]   or power rather than a person.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.620]   Edwards is not denying the personhood of the Holy Spirit
[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.740]   when he talks of him as the temper or the disposition
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:19.700]   or the love of God.
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.740]   Edwards is simply trying to put
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.420]   all the biblical pieces together.
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:28.060]   The New Testament doesn't just come out and tell us
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.540]   in a doctrinal statement, the Holy Spirit is a person.
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:32.380]   He doesn't say that,
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.860]   or the person is the very embodiment of the love of God.
[00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.060]   The various statements of the New Testament
[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.540]   point in this direction,
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.980]   but you have to put the pieces together,
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.900]   which means we need to be careful.
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.660]   Oh, how careful, lest we go off the rails
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.700]   and become heretics.
[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.500]   I think all of our human efforts,
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.580]   I'd say this in general now about Edwards, myself,
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.580]   or anybody else, all of our human efforts
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:05.820]   to conceptualize the relationships within the Trinity
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:09.860]   need to confess that we see through a glass darkly
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.860]   until we know even as we are known,
[00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.140]   which means be careful.
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.100]   Now, here's another point,
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:22.380]   pointer to the question that Heather's concerned about.
[00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:27.340]   1 John 4, 12 and 13 points to the Holy Spirit
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.780]   as the love of God in us.
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.380]   Here's what it says.
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:36.380]   If we love one another, God abides in us
[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:41.700]   and his love is perfected in us.
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:46.060]   By this, we know that we abide in him and he in us
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.220]   because he has given us of his spirit.
[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.580]   So if you put all that together,
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.900]   God in us, his love in us,
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.180]   his spirit in us,
[00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.780]   all seem to point to the fact
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:06.460]   that the way the love of God abides in us
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:10.900]   is by his spirit, that is his disposition, his temper,
[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:15.020]   that is his love in person abiding in us,
[00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.980]   by the person of the Holy Spirit.
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.100]   Now, the piece that remains to be added
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.220]   for Heather's question is joy.
[00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:28.140]   And this is added by pondering
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:33.140]   that the love that God is from all eternity
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:37.340]   is not a sacrificial love between the Father and the Son.
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.140]   They are infinitely beautiful,
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:43.460]   infinitely worthy of each other's love,
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.380]   which means that they delight in each other infinitely.
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.500]   That's what their love is.
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:54.500]   This is my loved son in whom I am totally delighted.
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:59.260]   That's my paraphrase of well-pleased.
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.700]   To say that the love of the Father and the Son
[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:07.060]   for each other is embodied in the spirit
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:10.460]   is to say that the spirit in his essence
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:15.460]   is God's joyful love, loving joy in person
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:19.620]   because God's loving from eternity
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.220]   has been his enjoying from eternity.
[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.260]   That's how the persons of the Godhead
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.140]   have related to each other.
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.540]   They're not disappointed.
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.020]   They don't have to overcome any obstacles
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:33.720]   to delight in each other.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:38.720]   So when Jesus says, "My joy I give to you," John 15, 11,
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:43.660]   or when he says, "Enter into the joy of your master,"
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:47.640]   Matthew 25, 11, he is welcoming us
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:52.640]   into the fullest experience of the Son's love for the Father.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:58.820]   And it seems right then to say this is experienced
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.640]   by being filled with the Holy Spirit,
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.300]   who is the very person who is the love of God
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.780]   and the joy of God.
[00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:12.380]   Paul speaks in 1 Thessalonians 1, 6
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.980]   of the joy of the Holy Spirit,
[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:20.980]   the joy which the Holy Spirit gives by coming himself
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:25.340]   to live in us as the very love and joy of God.
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:30.340]   So I pray that God would help you, Heather,
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:36.120]   and all of us, as we humbly and carefully
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.480]   try to faithfully put the pieces
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.600]   of God's precious word together.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.440]   - Amen.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.420]   Yeah, these are some profound pieces, too,
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:48.760]   some of the most precious pieces, precious realities
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.200]   that we can ever try to wrap our brains around.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.880]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.080]   And thank you for joining us today.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.320]   If you want to ask Pastor John,
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:01.080]   email your questions to us at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.040]   Well, we will be back next week
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:08.160]   to look at the challenges posed by our own personal doubt.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.240]   Can we struggle with doubt
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.120]   and experience joy in God as well?
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.160]   That's Monday.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.780]   Thursday, we look at how to fight off the inner skeptic
[00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.340]   when we have doubts about what we read in the Bible.
[00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.920]   Monday, can I doubt God and have joy in him?
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.840]   Thursday, fighting off the inner skeptic
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.480]   in our Bible reading.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.520]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.720]   We'll see you next week.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.300]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:43.880]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
