[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Good Monday morning to you. Thanks for listening to the podcast.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.500]   We're going to start this week talking about prayer.
[00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.500]   Sometimes we say that we are wrestling in prayer for something.
[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.500]   We hear others use that phrase as well.
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.000]   And that phrase, "wrestling in prayer," is a biblical one,
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.500]   used by the Apostle Paul in the book of Colossians.
[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.000]   But it only appears one time.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   So, what does he mean, biblically speaking, to wrestle in prayer?
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.500]   That's the question from a listener to the podcast named Jason.
[00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.500]   Pastor John, hello. I listen to your podcast daily through my iPhone.
[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.500]   Thank you for helping me think through questions,
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.500]   even questions I didn't even know should be asked.
[00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.000]   Here's mine.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   In Colossians 4, verse 12, Paul affirms Epaphras
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.500]   because he is always wrestling or struggling in prayer for the church of Colossae.
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.000]   What does it mean to wrestle in prayer?
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.500]   Who is the wrestling against?
[00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.000]   How do I, and all of us, learn to wrestle like this, to wrestle in prayer ourselves?
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Well, the first thing I'd say is that kind of question is so good, so important.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.500]   And it's so simple.
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.000]   You're reading along and you tend to just breeze by something.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   And he's stopping and saying, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   What's that really like?"
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   He says he's wrestling in prayer.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.500]   What would that feel like?
[00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.500]   What would I be doing differently than I'm doing?
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.500]   It's just a great question and good for me to think about.
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.000]   And I think, and this is the best I know how to proceed,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   the best way forward in answering a question like that
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.500]   is not first to look into my experience and say,
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.000]   "Okay, where have I done that? What's wrestling like for me?"
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Because I might just read in my experience into the text.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.500]   So I think the best thing to do is to take the word "wrestle" or "struggle"
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.000]   or whatever the word happens to be you're working on
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   and look up the ways in the Bible with a concordance.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   How Paul, or whoever you're reading, used it in other settings
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.500]   so that the word, in this case, the Greek "agonizomai"
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.000]   and you can hear the word "agonize" in English in the Greek "agonizomai."
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Where has he used that word?
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Or you could just use the English with "wrestle" or "struggle."
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.500]   And what light might that shed on the way you pray?
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.000]   So let's start with Colossians 4.12
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   because that's the text he's asking about.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.500]   Here's what it says.
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.000]   "Epiphras, who is one of you,"
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.500]   so Epiphras was from Colossae, but he was with Paul.
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.000]   That's why Paul knew how he was praying.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   "Epiphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   greets you always struggling," or wrestling,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   "on your behalf in his prayers, that you may stand mature
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.500]   and fully assured in all the will of God."
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.500]   So the answer that Epiphras is after in his prayers
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.500]   for the Colossian believers would be that they stand
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.000]   and that they stand mature and be fully assured of God's favor
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   and God's will as they live their Christian life.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   But what Jason is asking about is not what they're praying for,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   not what Epiphras is praying for,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.500]   but about the way Epiphras is praying.
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.000]   And he's wrestling.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.500]   He says he's wrestling and he wants to know, and I want to know,
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.000]   "Well, what's that like? Should I be doing more of that?
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   And if I did, what would it look like?"
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   So let's go to those other uses of the word wrestle or struggle or fight
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   or however that agonizomai is translated.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Probably the most important one is right here in Colossians,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   back in chapter 1, verse 28-29.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Paul says, "Christ we proclaim,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   warning everyone, teaching everyone with all wisdom,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   that we may present everyone mature in Christ."
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Same goal as Epiphras' prayer, by the way.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   "For this I toil."
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Now, that's not the word,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   but the modifying participle that comes after is the word.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.500]   "For this I toil," wrestling.
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.000]   "For this I toil," struggling,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   "with all the energy that he powerfully works within me."
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   "He works within me."
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Now, two things stand out there concerning this wrestling.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   One is the word toil.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   So this form of wrestling is work. It's work.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   So Paul is saying that his teaching, his warning,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   his ministry efforts to present the Colossians mature in Christ
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   is toil. It's work.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   It's the kind of work that involves wrestling,
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   and it sounds like, in other words,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   there are hardships and obstacles in this work
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   that have to be wrestled out of the way.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   It requires exertion and effort,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   as if there were this big boulder on the path,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   and you've got to wrestle, put your shoulder into it,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   and push it out of the way so you can get on with your work
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   of teaching and working and praying
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   for these people.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   It's a rigorous kind of work.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   So I think it would be right for us to say that,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   in Paul's understanding, Epaphras, in praying,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   was doing something similar.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   The kind of prayer that he undertook for the Colossians
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   involved toil.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   The kind of toil that included wrestling with hindrances
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   or barriers, it's got to be pushed out of the way
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   in order to be able to keep praying.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Now the other thing that stands out, it's almost
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   the opposite, or at least it's a relief
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   from the pressure of putting your shoulder against a boulder.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   The other thing that stands out in Colossians 1:29
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   is this, wrestling with all the energy
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   that Christ powerfully works within me.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   So Paul does not think of his ministry wrestling
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   as something he does in his own strength,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   even though there's enormous effort and toil.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   It's not being done in his own strength to try to get Christ
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   to be active for him.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   It's just the other way around.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   He says Christ is super active prior to his effort
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   and in his effort, enabling his effort to toil with wrestling.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   And I think that's the idea with prayer.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   You don't pray, even though it may be hard,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   there may be work in it, but you don't do it
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   in your own strength.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   And I think in 1 Timothy 6:12, Paul is saying, in effect,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   that the fight of faith is exactly that.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   That word "fight" there is agonizami.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   He says, "Fight the good fight of faith, Timothy."
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   And the word "fight" is the same word as "wrestle"
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   and "struggle."
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   So the point is that the very nature of the Christian life
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   is that we are to live by faith and fight all our battles
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   by faith, that is, seeking to rely on the strength of another
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   and do everything we do, easy or hard, by faith,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   by relying on the one who is at work in me,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   enabling me to do what I'm striving to do.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   So even though the word "wrestle" sounds demanding,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   what it demands, above all, is faith that God is the one
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   who wrestles in us and through us and for us.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Another implication of wrestling comes from the way he uses it
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   in 1 Corinthians 9.25, where he says, "Every athlete"—
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   now, that word "athlete" is one who wrestles,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   one who struggles—
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   "Every athlete, every wrestler, exercises self-control
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   in all things.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   They do it to receive a perishable wreath,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   but we an imperishable.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   So I do not run aimlessly.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   I do not box as one beating the air,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   but I discipline my body and keep it under control."
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   I think this implies that Epaphras, in his praying
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   for the Colossians, used self-control,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   and he disciplined himself in his prayer.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Maybe that means in order to find the time in his busy life,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   he had to get up earlier.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   So he denied himself half an hour's sleep,
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   and he pommeled his body, as it were, to say, "Body, get up!
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   This bed feels really good right now."
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   And he says to his body, like an athlete who gets up
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   to train at 5 a.m., he says, "Get up, body."
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   And he devoted himself to focused time in prayer
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   for his loved ones back in Colossae.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   That took control of his own inner impulses,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   which might have preferred to stay in bed.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Maybe one more example.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   This time it comes from the way the Gospel of John uses
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   agonizomai, or wrestle or struggle.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   John 8, 1836, Jesus said to Pilate,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   "My kingdom is not of this world.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would be fighting."
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Now, that's the word.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   And you know that in this context, that means they'd be pulling out
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   their swords and sticking your soldiers in the throat
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   to keep me from being handed over to you.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   So agonizomai here isn't wrestle a boulder out of the way.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   It's kill somebody to keep them from making your Jesus ineffective,
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   at least as they understood it.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   So that means literally fighting against the Roman soldiers
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   with swords and clubs.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   So I think when Paul says that Epaphras is wrestling, struggling,
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   or fighting, there really is warfare going on.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   So I'm drawing in the warfare imagery now,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   not just the athletic imagery.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   You've got athletes who need discipline.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Now you've got war, and you need to defeat an enemy.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   And we all know from Ephesians 6, 12, that Paul says,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   "We don't wrestle against flesh and blood."
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Now, that's a different word for wrestle in the Greek,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   but the idea is the same.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   We don't wrestle against flesh and blood,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   but against principalities and power.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   So when Paul says that Epaphras is fighting, not just wrestling,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   but fighting in prayer, he probably includes the reality that Satan
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   does not like what Epaphras is doing at all and is trying to stop him,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   and he must take the sword of the Spirit and the shield of faith
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   and quench the prayer-destroying, fiery darts with that shield of faith
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   and with the sword of a good promise from God.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   So those are a few of the ways that prayer is like a wrestling match.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   It's like wrestling in hard work with obstacles to be removed.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   It's like wrestling with athletic efforts,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   with the need for self-control and discipline.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   It's like wrestling in a fight with swords when the devil has to be driven off.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Anyone who has ever tried to pray in any focused or sustained way
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   for some spiritual breakthrough knows something of this kind of struggle.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   So don't think of prayer always as an easy conversation.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   You hear so many people talk about prayers,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   "It's wonderful to have a little conversation with Jesus."
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Well, it is sweet, and it is easy sometimes.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   But often it is a walkie-talkie during war.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   The bombs are dropping. The enemy fire is heavy all around.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Prayer is embattled, and we are called to get on the frequency
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   of the heavenly headquarters and send in for fire cover here.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   It's like, "I've got to have the Air Force quick, Father, because I'm in trouble."
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   But never forget, even our call for help is an act of help
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   from the Lord who is innocent for us.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   Yeah, so good. Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   That prompted me to look just now on this podcast.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   In 10 years, we've never talked about prayer as a wartime walkie-talkie,
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   but that's a point that you've made a lot over the years.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   We need to pull some sermon clips on this, I think.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   More on that later. We'll pick that up in the APJ series.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Thank you for joining us today.

[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Wednesday, we're going to address the love of money.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   When we think of the love of money, we tend to think of the lavish lifestyle
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   of a billionaire sultan in the Middle East,
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   or we think of a big tech CEO who catapults himself
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   into outer space just for the fun of it.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   Mostly the love of money we ascribe to the irreligious, the opulent,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   those with lavish lifestyles that gives evidence to a love of money in their heart.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   But the Bible speaks of the love of money in different terms altogether.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   A love of money inside the heart of the religious zealot,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   an idol that infects even the staunchest religious person,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   even those who claim to follow the law in detail and with great zeal.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   This is a fascinating point. Pastor John is going to make it on Wednesday.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   I'm your host, Tommy Reinke. We'll see you back here for that.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Thanks for listening.
