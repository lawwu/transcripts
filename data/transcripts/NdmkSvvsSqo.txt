[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.120]   Welcome to Bogleheads on Investing podcast number 20.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:24.080]   Today, I am happy to have Jeff Levine, a tax expert and a financial advisor, and we'll
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:31.440]   be talking about the CARES Act, the SECURE Act, and tax loss harvesting.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:39.560]   [music]
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.040]   Hi everyone, my name is Rick Ferry and I'm the host of Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.880]   This episode, as with all episodes, is sponsored by the John C. Bogle Center for Financial
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.080]   Literacy, a 501(c)(3) corporation.
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.120]   Today, my special guest is Jeff Levine.
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.560]   Jeff is a certified public accountant, a certified financial planner, and a nationally recognized
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.920]   thought leader on tax issues within the financial planning community.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.320]   Jeff is the lead financial planner nerd for Kitsis.com, home of the popular Nerd's iView
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.820]   blog, and the founder of Fully Vested Advice Incorporated, which provides financial education
[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.920]   and consulting services to industry professionals.
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.360]   He is also the director of advanced planning at Buckingham Strategic Wealth.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.080]   With no further ado, I am very happy to have on our show Jeff Levine.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.080]   Welcome Jeff.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.080]   Thank you, Rick.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.080]   Thank you for having me.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:45.480]   Jeff, you're a great resource for everything that's been going on with various legislation
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:52.560]   and taxes, and you are a bona fide tax geek, and we're really pleased to have you on the
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.160]   show today.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.160]   Before we get into the nitty gritty details, could you tell us how you became a tax geek?
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.160]   Sure.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.000]   You know, I kind of by accident, probably like most people who end up in that.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.240]   I don't think anybody grows up and like, "Man, I want to be nose deep in the tax code every
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.600]   day of my life."
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.720]   But it all started really by happenstance.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.760]   When I was younger, my parents got divorced and my mom started looking for work, and as
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.840]   it turns out, I had gone to school with Ed Slott, who probably many of your listeners
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.840]   know.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.240]   I went to school with his niece.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.920]   His sister-in-law had said to my mother, "You know, I think he's looking for an administrative
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.360]   assistant, a secretary, something along those lines," and I was pretty young at the time.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.360]   But my mom ended up taking that job, and over the course of the years, she's actually become
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.760]   the managing partner of the firm and has been for quite a while sometime.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.120]   For our listeners who don't know, Ed Slott is probably one of the nation's most respected
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:59.520]   authorities on individual retirement accounts, and he gave you your first job and I guess
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.520]   your first paycheck.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.400]   I mean, Ed Slott's father gave me my very first $100 bill after working a week on school
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.000]   spring break, I think when I was like 13 or 14 years old.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.920]   And when everybody hears that story, and they also know that I worked for Ed Slott and Company
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.200]   for about a decade, they just kind of think like, "Oh, of course, you were anointed from
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.880]   birth to work there, like the boy king."
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.320]   And it couldn't have been further from the truth.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:31.520]   I actually wanted to be a doctor from the time I was two until 21, 22, my kind of senior
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:38.600]   year in college, and I spoke with a lot of doctors in the emergency room, and I had been
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.920]   doing EMS, and so I got very close with them.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.440]   And they all told me, "If you can find something else you love, go do that."
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.560]   And so, here I am trying to take their advice, I say, "You know what, I've always loved math.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.720]   I enjoy working with people and helping people.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.560]   I'm going to become a financial advisor.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.280]   I've heard Ed talk about these people for years and how they can help people.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.800]   That's what I'm going to do."
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.760]   And so I started and I called up and asked around a bunch of people who I trusted.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.720]   They said, "Here's a good company to go to and do your training with."
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.480]   So I called them up, and I got an invitation to come work with them.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.560]   And the first week we went in and it was, "Rah, rah, we're going to help people," and
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.560]   I was all excited.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.320]   Week two was an unbelievable motivational lecture, still probably the best motivational
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.160]   concept I've ever heard.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.240]   For those listeners who are not familiar with it, it's called 212 Degrees, and the whole
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.640]   concept was essentially water from 32 degrees on up to 211 degrees, goes from cold water
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.160]   to hot water, but it's still water, right?
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.920]   And you put in all this energy into the system, but by putting one extra degree of energy,
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.720]   now you go from 211 degrees to 212, and you create steam and you power locomotives and
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.360]   engines and all these sorts of things.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.760]   So I've always asked myself, whenever I'm not seeing the results that I think I want
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.120]   to see, am I at 211 degrees?
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.320]   Have I done so much work, but just not that one little extra bit?
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.320]   So that was awesome.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.160]   And as a science nerd also, it really resonated with me and has still stuck with me to this
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.560]   day so many years later.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.960]   Then week three was all about life insurance, which was fine, you have to understand the
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.080]   tools of the trade if you're going to be a financial planner.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.600]   But by week four it was, "Great, you're all experts, bring in a list of 100 people
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.240]   you know and let's see how we can help them."
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.160]   Which of course, Rick, as you know, was, "Let's see how many people you know that we can call
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.400]   and shove product down their throat."
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.120]   And I had this real crisis of conscience, I said, "What am I going to do?
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.400]   I can't do this."
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.400]   How could I legitimately look somebody in the eye and say, "Trust me with your life
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.840]   savings," when because of my unique relationship, knowing Ed Slott and the group of advisors
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.580]   that he was training, I literally knew like 300 people who were way more qualified than
[00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.440]   I was to do it.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.200]   So I did something I almost never do, I quit and I said, "I'm sorry, this is not for
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.200]   me."
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.160]   And I had no idea what I was going to do with my life.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.340]   At the time, I was actually thinking about going back to school for emergency disaster
[00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.800]   management and working with FEMA.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.320]   Ultimately, I happened to go down and help my mother and Ed at a program they were having
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.200]   purely for registration, they were just short on people, and was sharing the story I told
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:22.480]   with you and an advisor at another table happened to hear me and said, "You know, I happened
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.280]   to overhear you last night, I work in a CPA firm and we do all the planning for that firm,
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.600]   so we don't have to like hunt down people, there's just plenty of people who need help
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.960]   and we just help the ones that want it.
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.400]   And would you like to come work with me?
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.640]   You seem like a nice kid and a bright kid.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.880]   How would you like to come move down to Miami and work with us in the CPA firm?"
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:46.520]   And so I went down to Miami and after about a year or so, it wasn't quite what I had
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.960]   expected.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.460]   So to end this very long story and kind of to get to where we are today.
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.880]   So Ed called me up into his office and said, "How would you like to work with us?
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.380]   Essentially, we need some young blood here.
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.840]   You seem to have an ability to grasp this stuff, how would you like to work with us?"
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.320]   And when somebody who's the best in the country at something says, "Would you like to work
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.320]   with me?"
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.320]   The answer is yes.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.320]   I don't care what they do.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.600]   If they're the best garbage man in the country, I'm going to go work with them because I want
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.280]   to learn how to do things really well.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.760]   But I kind of took it as a challenge and went ahead and did that.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.880]   And they were almost 10 years of the best years of my life.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.920]   I mean, it was a great learning experience.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:31.920]   But as I ventured out and created my own RIA about three and a half years ago, that began
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:36.680]   to take more of my time and I decided to ultimately, Ed and I parted ways very amicably.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.520]   We're still great friends.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.640]   So I went out on my own and shortly after that, Michael Kitsis, who I know you're familiar
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.720]   with as well, he reached out to me and said, "Jeff, I don't know what you're planning
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.040]   on doing, but would you like to do some stuff together?"
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.200]   And again, when anybody who's a top in the country at anything, and I think Michael really
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.520]   is the preeminent thought leader of our industry right now, when it says, "Would you like
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.520]   to do something together?"
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.520]   The answer is yes.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.600]   So Michael and I began to work there.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.920]   I ultimately became the lead financial planning nerd, technically, is my title over at that
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.120]   platform.
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:14.000]   And then after about three years, the RIA had grown to the point where we really felt
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   for Michael and I to be aligned and for us to have some more scale on the advisory side.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.640]   So Michael and I both left our existing advisory firms to team up.
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:28.200]   And so now I spend part of my time as the director of advanced planning over at Buckingham
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.120]   Strategic Wealth and Buckingham Wealth Partners.
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.320]   And in addition to that, I spend the rest of my time with Michael over on the Nerds
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.120]   Eye View platform at kitsis.com.
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.600]   I wake up every morning and I'm excited to go to work.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.440]   So let's get into some tax stuff.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.440]   Sure.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:50.920]   So the most recent thing is the Corona's Aid Relief and Economic Security Act or CARES
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:57.800]   Act, which is a $2 trillion emergency fiscal stimulus package.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.780]   And it's just loaded with all kinds of stuff.
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:03.760]   So my first group of questions will be about the CARES Act.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:09.120]   And then we'll talk about the SECURE Act, which was signed into law late last year,
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.980]   which changed a lot of things.
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.740]   And then we'll talk about tax loss harvesting, which is something Boglehead have near and
[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:16.740]   dear to their hearts.
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:21.840]   So I want to get through those three big things today, and we're going to do it in 50 minutes
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.840]   or less.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:23.840]   So are you ready?
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.420]   That's a big ask, but let's do it.
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:27.420]   Let's try.
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.420]   All right.
[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:29.420]   So CARES Act.
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.420]   Go.
[00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:35.720]   It's like, tell me the history of the world.
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:40.220]   So I mean, I think the question that's on most people's mind is, what am I getting?
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.080]   Like, what type of check am I getting?
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.900]   That seems to be the number one question people have asked so far is, am I getting a check?
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:49.360]   And once the answer is yes, how much is it?
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:57.640]   Each adult taxpayer is entitled to a $1,200 recovery rebate check as a starting point.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.720]   Now I say as a starting point because we're going to have to adjust this for some higher
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.060]   earners that are listening.
[00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:10.540]   But as a starting point, $1,200 to adult taxpayers, single individual, $1,200, head of household,
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:16.640]   let's give them $1,200, and a married couple who filed a joint return, $2,400 for two times
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:17.840]   1,200.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:24.500]   In addition to that, each taxpayer is also entitled to a $500 credit for each qualifying
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.500]   child.
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:31.560]   And qualifying child here is the same way as a child tax credit is qualified for.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:36.920]   So we're looking for children under the age of 17 here, so 16 and under, and there's an
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.440]   additional $500 there.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:44.800]   So for argument's sake, a married couple with a joint return who have three children would
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:50.920]   be entitled as a starting point to a $3,900 recovery rebate check.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.640]   Are these checks actually going to be coming in the mail?
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.640]   Are you getting a credit against your income taxes when you file your income tax?
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.400]   How is it going to work?
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:05.880]   So it is considered a credit against your 2020 taxes.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:11.720]   The easiest way I could think about explaining it is, imagine that the government is pretending
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:18.440]   that everybody who's entitled to their rebate check paid that amount in for their 2020 taxes
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:23.600]   already on January 1st of this year, and now they're just refunding it back to you.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.920]   They said, "Oops, you paid too much, here's your own money back."
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.240]   That's the simplest way to think about this in one's mind.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:34.480]   Now in terms of how those checks are actually going to be processed, it's going to vary.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:39.560]   So for individuals who are receiving social security benefits, the likelihood is that
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:44.120]   those checks will be processed, or those distributions will be processed to the account into which
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.360]   they're getting their social security payment.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:52.080]   For individuals who have a direct deposit account on file with the IRS from either their
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:59.640]   2018 or 2019 tax return, whichever is the most recent, then those direct deposit accounts
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.240]   will receive that rebate.
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:06.240]   And then for all others, it will likely go to the address of record where you filed your
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.240]   last tax return.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.480]   And notably, there are some problems here.
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:15.040]   For instance, somebody who had a refund in 2018 that was processed, that might've been
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.840]   over a year ago already, and what if they closed that account?
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:19.840]   What happens?
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.920]   Where does that check go?
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:25.280]   Or what if somebody moved from the last time they filed their tax return?
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.760]   In that second instance, there is actually a remedy, something I would encourage your
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:33.400]   listeners to do right now if they're thinking they may get a check, is go online, print
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:39.200]   out IRS form 8822, form 8822.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.240]   And what that is, it's just a simple change of address form with the IRS.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:48.280]   It says to the IRS, "Hey, you have my old address, use this one going forward."
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.080]   And that would be a good way to make sure that your check, if it's going to be a check,
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.740]   goes to the correct place.
[00:12:53.740 --> 00:13:01.020]   So this is a 2020 tax refund, but of course, you're not filing your tax returns until 2021.
[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:06.580]   Now, some people have already filed their 2019 taxes and some people have not yet.
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.140]   So there must be some sort of a strategy here.
[00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:16.180]   In other words, if your income for 2019 is lower than your income for 2018, you probably
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:21.420]   want to file your tax returns, especially if you want to get it below the $150,000 for
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:26.060]   married filing jointly, or less than that if you're single, correct?
[00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.060]   That's exactly right.
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:30.020]   And the reason that's important is, I think you just hit on it.
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:33.660]   So we talked about a starting point before, right, for those checks.
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:38.100]   But as income exceeds certain thresholds, notably, as you mentioned, for married couples
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:45.100]   filing a joint return, $150,000; for single filers, $75,000; and for head of households,
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.060]   $112,500.
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:54.500]   Because your AGI for those applicable years, 2018 or 2019, exceeds those amounts, the recovery
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:58.820]   rebate check that you get now, or recovery rebate direct deposit, whatever you want to
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:06.460]   say, will be lowered by $5 for every $100 you're over those thresholds.
[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:12.140]   So as you mentioned, if your income is lower in 2019 than it was in 2018, it very well
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:16.980]   may pay to file that 2019 return to get that on file with the IRS.
[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:21.980]   So they use that as the number to base this recovery rebate credit on.
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:29.220]   What if it's the case where in 2018 that person didn't make that much money, but in 2019 they
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:32.180]   made a lot of money, but they already filed their return?
[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.380]   Can they pull it back?
[00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:38.100]   Unfortunately, I don't see a way for you to pull back that.
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.100]   I didn't say it was me.
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.100]   I didn't say that.
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.100]   Fair enough.
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.260]   And it is not me.
[00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:50.380]   But I was saying, boy, if this person did not file their 2019 return, they would have
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:54.300]   gotten a larger check by waiting.
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.780]   But unfortunately, you're saying they can't pull it back.
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:02.420]   Once that return is submitted and it's on file with the IRS, and the last thing you
[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:07.100]   want to do is do anything that is fraudulent on a tax return.
[00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.260]   I've heard some people who said, "Oh, you know what I'm going to do?
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:15.340]   I'm just going to report $1 of income for 2019 on a tax return.
[00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:19.700]   This way I get my recovery rebate check, and then I'll just amend my return later."
[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:25.380]   That's still filing a return, and when you file your return, you're saying under penalties
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:29.400]   of perjury that the information on there is true to the best of your knowledge.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.980]   And so that is not something you want to be doing right now.
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:37.100]   If your return's on file, unfortunately, you should have procrastinated more.
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.020]   What's wrong with you?
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:43.900]   Being a procrastinator really helped with the CARES Act in a lot of ways.
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:48.180]   For instance, one, as you just mentioned, the other one is if you didn't take your 2019
[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:53.380]   RMD as a first-year person who has RMDs, in other words, you turned 70 and a half last
[00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:58.260]   year in 2019, this year you can actually waive two of them.
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.540]   They've rewarded procrastination in this law.
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:01.540]   It's very strange.
[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:04.300]   Well, let me ask a question about that because you hit upon it.
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.140]   I know you were getting ahead.
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:12.880]   One of the other provisions of the CARES Act is if you're 72 and a half or if you're
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:17.840]   70 and a half and you started taking required minimum distributions and therefore you would
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:22.300]   have to continue taking them, that you can skip a year.
[00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:23.300]   So you can skip.
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.300]   Indeed.
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.300]   Right.
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:28.920]   But what if you already took it for 2020?
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:29.920]   This is a tough one.
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:35.720]   So first off, let's start with the easy answer is if you are a beneficiary, a non-spouse
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:40.220]   beneficiary like you had a parent or grandparent who left you an IRA or a 401(k) and you took
[00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:44.480]   that distribution, you are just SOL, as they say, right?
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.560]   There's nothing you can do to fix that.
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.520]   You're out of luck, unfortunately.
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:53.560]   For owners of an account like an IRA owner or 401(k) owner, there's a couple of ways
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.680]   which this may be fixable.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:01.400]   The first and easiest way it could be fixed is if you happen to be within the 60-day window,
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.600]   which essentially means at this point you took your distribution from, you know, beginning
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.320]   of February on forward, roughly.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:12.960]   If that's the case, then if you're within the 60-day window and you're not violating
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:17.080]   the once-per-year rollover rule, which means if it's coming from an IRA, you haven't done
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:24.480]   an IRA to IRA 60-day rollover within the past 365 days, then you can simply roll your distribution
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.480]   back in.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.800]   Normally, you can't roll over an RMD, but this isn't an RMD.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.120]   They just said no RMDs for that year.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.160]   So that's very interesting.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.200]   I can actually say, oh, no, no, this was not my RMD.
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.720]   It was just a rollover.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:42.000]   I can put it back into the account within 60 days, and then I'm good.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   Yes.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Yes.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   That would be the simplest way.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   There is a more complicated way for those who may be outside that 60-day rollover window,
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.840]   and that's by using a separate provision of this CARES Act, which created what's called
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:01.200]   a coronavirus distribution, and we can kind of get into the details of that later, but
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:09.280]   one of the key points of a coronavirus distribution is that you have up until three years after
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.580]   the distribution to repay it.
[00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:17.800]   So you have to qualify for a coronavirus distribution, which essentially means you or someone you
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:23.200]   know, either you or someone that's a member of your household, a dependent, your spouse,
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:30.960]   contracted the coronavirus, or you had some sort of financial hardship because of it related
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:31.960]   to your work.
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:37.120]   So you were furloughed, you lost hours, business closed, something along those lines, and I
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:42.800]   think the way it's written, I think IRS means for this to be interpreted fairly liberally,
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:48.680]   and if you can kind of force that distribution into this coronavirus-related distribution
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:53.840]   box, if you will, then again, you have three years from the date you took that distribution
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.840]   to pay it back.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:19:01.040]   So those are two ways you could potentially fix an unwanted "RMD" that is no longer really
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.480]   an RMD for this year.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.880]   Okay, let me ask one last question about this and we'll move on to the next thing.
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:10.900]   That is that I have a lot of clients who take an RMD monthly.
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:15.160]   So they started taking it in January, they took it in February, they took it the beginning
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.240]   of March before this law came out.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.280]   Can they stop, or do they have to take their full distribution?
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:25.200]   In other words, once you begin to take it for the year, do you have to take the whole
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.720]   thing or can you stop right now?
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.840]   You absolutely do not have to continue taking it.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:36.920]   And here's the thing, normally there's, well, not normally, but there is this once-per-year
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.560]   rollover rule.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.680]   There may be ways to help resolve that for individuals.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.600]   For instance, two suggestions I would have.
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:51.640]   One is if this distribution came from a plan, and let's say you took a February 15th RMD
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:58.400]   and a March 15th RMD, and you're listening to this today, and whatever today is as you're
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:02.440]   listening to it, you're within 60 days from both of those distributions.
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:07.640]   If they came from a plan, like a 401(k), they can actually both go back to an IRA.
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:13.280]   The once-per-year rollover rule doesn't apply to plan to IRA distributions.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:17.160]   The second thing would be, let's say this did come from an IRA, which is very likely
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:22.700]   because a lot of people end up rolling over their dollars to IRAs later on for more flexibility
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.000]   in terms of investments, et cetera, more control.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.200]   If it is the case that those February 15th and March 15th distributions already occurred,
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.960]   and let's just say hypothetically today is April 3rd, we're still within 60 days, then
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:41.560]   one of those distributions could go back into the IRA you took it from, or another one.
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:48.680]   The other one you could convert, because an IRA to a Roth IRA conversion, like via a 60-day
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:55.580]   rollover from the IRA to the Roth IRA, is also not considered part of the once-per-year
[00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.560]   rollover rule restrictions.
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:02.000]   So yes, it still means it's taxable, but now at least it's growing tax-free in a Roth IRA.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.400]   So there's another way to potentially go about that.
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.700]   >>COREY: Let's talk about the unemployment aspect of it, and something that's pretty
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:12.880]   interesting, besides going in and getting basic unemployment benefits if you get laid
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:18.160]   off or furloughed, or you're out of work because of this, is a couple of interesting things
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.280]   about the CARES Act.
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:26.880]   I'll say them both here, but number one is you're eligible for it if you're self-employed,
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:32.280]   and secondly, everybody gets an extra $600 per week.
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:36.980]   So why don't you tackle the $600 one first, and then talk about the unemployment benefit
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:41.720]   for self-employed people, which normally you don't get?
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.720]   >>ANDREW: That's absolutely correct.
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:49.280]   So in terms of the extra $600, first off, I would say when it comes to unemployment
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:55.120]   as a general rule of thumb with this bill, just think it's bigger, it's longer, and more
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.120]   people qualify.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.520]   It is like unemployment on steroids.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:04.240]   With that said, the unemployment of $600, really what they were looking for is like,
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:09.640]   "Hey, we've got to replace more of someone's regular income," because believe it or not,
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.360]   the average unemployment today across the nation, and unemployment, I should mention,
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.960]   is a very fractured system.
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.000]   Unemployment is not a federal benefit that is typically offered.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.920]   It's a state benefit that now the federal government is going to help fulfill and to
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:29.280]   backstop in terms of the finances of it, but each state has its own unemployment rules
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:34.840]   and time frame for how long they may last and amount of money, but the average unemployment
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:40.920]   across the US is only about $385, so less than $400.
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.160]   Let's just call it even $400.
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.160]   >>COREY: Per week.
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.160]   >>ANDREW: Per week.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:48.040]   That's not going to be enough to support most families getting through this tough time.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:54.600]   So by adding the $600, now we're up to $1,000 a week, a meaningful amount that, again, at
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:59.440]   least has the ability to help make sure that most people can pay the immediate bills that
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:04.640]   they need to pay in order to continue to exist during this really unprecedented time.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:10.960]   Notably, that $600 plus the $400, so let's call it $1,000 for roughly the average payment
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:15.600]   that someone would receive under these unemployment provisions, is more than what some people
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.200]   make on a regular basis.
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:24.560]   And so that was one of the holdups, very temporarily, albeit, but there was a temporary holdup because
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:27.960]   there was some debate in the Senate as to, is this right?
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:32.800]   Should we actually incentivize people to collect unemployment and make more money rather than
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.600]   go back to work and earn less?
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:39.800]   And ultimately they came to the decision that it would be too challenging to do this separately,
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:44.160]   one-off for each state, because again, each state has different programs, and that may
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.480]   ultimately be the result of what happens, but it'll be a small percentage of people,
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:53.320]   and of those it applies to, only a small percentage will likely take advantage of the system that
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.320]   way.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:57.400]   Now, with regard to the second part of the question, or really the first part, but kind
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:01.520]   of circling back to that first part about self-employed individuals, you're right, because
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:05.680]   unemployment means like, you typically don't get an unemployment unless you've been fired
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:10.520]   or let go, and you can't do that to yourself if you're, I mean, otherwise, any time a self-employed
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.840]   person wasn't having a good run of it, they would just say, you know what, I fired myself,
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:18.040]   let me collect some unemployment insurance.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:25.200]   However, in disasters, we very frequently see legislation coming about that creates
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:32.400]   an unemployment fund for individuals who are self-employed, because they are also impacted,
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.080]   and that's exactly what we see here.
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:40.040]   So there's a special provision of this law called Pandemic Unemployment Assistance.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:45.240]   And Pandemic Unemployment Assistance is basically a catch-all provision that says, if you don't
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:51.560]   qualify for unemployment compensation for some other reason, i.e. maybe you're self-employed,
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:59.720]   then you will get an equivalent unemployment compensation check via this Pandemic Unemployment
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:00.720]   Assistance program.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.120]   I just want to clarify one thing.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:10.720]   If it's a couple and both spouses are unemployed now, and one of them may have been self-employed
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:16.280]   and have lost business, and the other one was employed and lost their job, they both
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:21.840]   can collect unemployment and they both can collect the $600?
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:22.840]   Is that true?
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.520]   Generally speaking, the answer would be yes.
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:30.920]   But I would say that the other thing to keep in mind is you always want to know what your
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:36.360]   state laws are for unemployment assistance, unemployment compensation, because at the
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:40.120]   heart of it, there's a lot of state law that goes into this.
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:44.960]   Now, certainly if you didn't collect unemployment because of state law, you should be able to
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:49.440]   potentially qualify for that same Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program that we had
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.440]   just referenced.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.200]   I just want to clarify one thing.
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:58.880]   If I'm self-employed, am I only going to get the $600 that the federal government is giving
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:25:59.880]   me?
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:04.880]   Or am I also going to qualify for state unemployment insurance, which I normally wouldn't get?
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:11.680]   So you will ultimately qualify for what amounts to your state plus the federal $600.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:18.720]   But it may all ultimately be administered to you via this federal Pandemic Unemployment
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.360]   Assistance program.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:24.800]   The state is not creating an unemployment compensation fund for self-employed individuals,
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.400]   but the net result to someone is the same as if they would have gotten a state check
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.720]   plus a federal check.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.840]   Let me ask an investment question, because this has been asked to me already a couple
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.920]   of times.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:41.800]   Part of the provision of the CARES Act is someone who is paying rent can stop paying
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:47.720]   rent, and I don't know under what circumstances they can stop paying rent, and they will not
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.520]   be evicted.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:54.200]   And since the courts are basically closed, even if you wanted to evict them as a landlord,
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.200]   you could not.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.280]   Now, you could talk about that, but since this is an investment show, I'm going to look
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.960]   at the other side of that.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:05.160]   The other side of that is a lot of people own rental property.
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:09.320]   They own a house, they own a couple of apartments, they own some condos or whatever, and they
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:10.480]   rent it out.
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:18.920]   Now, I've already run into two people who their renter has said, "I'm not paying you,"
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.520]   because of the new law.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.160]   What recourse would those people have?
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:26.720]   Because they still have to pay their mortgage on that property.
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:32.640]   Absolutely, and the first thing I would make sure to caution listeners is that we'll mention
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:37.400]   here what's going on in the CARES Act, but it's always important to check your local
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:42.120]   laws and see what's happened there as well, because property issues are often a matter
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:47.540]   of state law, and governors, et cetera, may have instituted certain emergency regulations
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:50.840]   that may supplement what we're about to talk about here.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:57.920]   But in particular, what the CARES Act does is it says that if an individual has a federally
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:04.760]   backed loan, and there's a forbearance there, so if you're pausing that essentially, then
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:10.320]   there can be a pause, if you will, of the renter as well, paying that rent to the individual
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.760]   who owns that property.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:16.920]   In addition, there's also some rules in there that prevent individuals from what they call
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:21.480]   covered dwellings, which means that you're getting help some way, shape, or form from
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.480]   the federal government.
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:27.480]   So either you participate in any number of programs that are organized for housing, or
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:32.920]   you've got a federally backed mortgage on the property, either as a loan or as a multifamily
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:38.360]   loan, then there's going to be certain restrictions on you being able to evict tenants, even if
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:41.740]   they're not paying their rent at this point in time.
[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:48.700]   If your renters stop paying rent because they lose their jobs, and you have a loan that
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:55.820]   is backed by some federal program, and you're the landlord, you could go to your lender
[00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:57.140]   and get forbearance.
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:04.820]   So in other words, you could ask for leniency in delaying your own mortgage on that property.
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:09.500]   Many states have already done that as kind of a proactive measure, too.
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:15.540]   They've just said there is a general moratorium on rent payments, all you have to do is call
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:17.260]   your mortgage provider and do that.
[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:22.620]   So it's really worth checking out the rules where you are locally here, because again,
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:27.420]   this issue is so intertwined between state rules and the federal rules that we now have
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:30.300]   altered by the CARES Act.
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:34.780]   The last item on the CARES Act that I'd like to address is the payroll tax, and there's
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:36.420]   two items here.
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.420]   Could you talk about those, please?
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:39.420]   Sure.
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:46.580]   There is one available credit that is for certain businesses who have really struggled.
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:51.180]   Either parts of their business or all of their business has been essentially shut down by
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:57.220]   government order of one sort or another, or they've seen revenues from their business
[00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:02.680]   drop by more than 50% from the same quarter in the previous year.
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:07.380]   So for argument's sake, in Q2 of 2019, they had $100,000.
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:14.780]   They would have to have below $50,000 in Q2 2020 for that to kick on and for that credit
[00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:15.780]   to be available.
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:19.780]   But look, a lot of businesses are having a tough time right now, and many of them have
[00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:22.020]   seen their revenues cut in such a fashion.
[00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:29.140]   So they would be eligible for a credit of up to 50% times the W-2 wages that they're
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:34.300]   paying to each employee, up to a maximum of $10,000 per employee.
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:38.860]   So that credit is for employment taxes only.
[00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:41.980]   So people need to make sure that this doesn't, you know, they don't conflate this with income
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:42.980]   taxes.
[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:47.220]   This just applies to the employment taxes, so things like FICA, et cetera.
[00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:48.860]   But still, a nice credit.
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:53.420]   Now, for anybody who doesn't qualify for that credit, or even those that do but still, let's
[00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:58.820]   say, owe a tax in addition to it, there is another provision of the CARES Act that says
[00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:06.620]   the payroll taxes, again, the employment taxes that you owe from now through the end of the
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:12.460]   year, you can delay those for a significant period of time.
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:18.580]   Half of them can be delayed up until December 31st of 2021, so we're looking at almost two
[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.260]   years from now.
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:26.260]   And the other half can be deferred up until as late as December 31st, 2022.
[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:29.940]   So a really significant liquidity break.
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:32.300]   Now, it doesn't get rid of the liability for those companies.
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:34.940]   In other words, that's a tax you're still going to have to pay.
[00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:41.040]   But from a liquidity point, like if you need money now, that's a nice way to help reduce
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:44.260]   your current expenses on your cash flow statement.
[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:49.860]   Okay, this is the absolute last two questions on the CARES Act.
[00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:51.500]   When do I have to file my tax returns?
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:52.500]   That has all changed.
[00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:56.420]   And if I'm self-employed, do I have to pay estimated taxes?
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:58.340]   And that would include retirees.
[00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:03.340]   So as it stands now, we've seen a couple bits of IRS information and guidance, and frankly,
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:06.080]   I wouldn't blame any of your listeners if they were confused.
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.780]   It's been so piecemeal over the last couple of weeks.
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:12.640]   There's been kind of conflicting guidance out there simply because they put out one
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.420]   thing today and two days later, they change it.
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:22.260]   As it stands now, as we're recording this, the tax filing deadline for individual taxpayers
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:27.700]   has been shifted out to July 15th of 2020.
[00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:33.620]   And that is also the payment date for taxes, so July 15th, 2020, for both of those items.
[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:36.140]   Two things I would note, though, for listeners.
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:41.100]   One is that your business returns, if you didn't do that, let's say you had a S Corporation
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:48.600]   or a partnership return, as of now, they were still scheduled to be submitted on March 15th
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:50.200]   of 2020.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:54.160]   So if you haven't filed an extension yet, I would encourage you to do so immediately.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:58.040]   The other thing I would point out here is that a question that has come very frequently
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:03.080]   to me so far since this guidance was released was, does this mean now that the extension
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:08.680]   for a tax return is January 15th next year, in other words, six months from the July 15th
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:09.680]   deadline?
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.680]   And the answer is no.
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:16.780]   The extended deadline continues to be October 15th of 2020.
[00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:20.400]   What about paying estimated quarterly taxes?
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.400]   Sure.
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:25.840]   So self-employed individuals, really anybody who has to pay employment tax, excuse me,
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:35.200]   quarterly estimated taxes, their Q1 is due on July 15th at the same time the 2019 income
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.960]   tax return is due.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:41.240]   Now, interestingly, some of your listeners who've been paying estimates for many of years,
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:45.400]   they probably are thinking to themselves, "But wait, what about Q2's estimate?
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.400]   Isn't that due June 15th?"
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:50.240]   And the answer is yes, it still is.
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.240]   Of course.
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.240]   Yeah.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.240]   It's very strange.
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:57.360]   So this year, you'll be paying your Q2 estimate before you pay your Q1 estimate, but that's
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.840]   just the way it looks.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:05.200]   Look, Rick, we need ... This is employment guarantee for people of my ill.
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:11.280]   It's just always inventory when it comes to this stuff because the rules are just ... Simplification
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.280]   is never simplification.
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:18.520]   If there's anything else you could add that's important about the CARES Act for most investors,
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.520]   then we need to move on to the SECURE Act.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:21.520]   Sure.
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:26.240]   I would simply state that for those listeners who are business owners as well, and if you're
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:31.320]   having a hard time, there are a variety of loan programs that you may be eligible for
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.320]   through the Small Business Administration in particular.
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:39.480]   So some of those, in particular what's called the Paycheck Protection Program, is something
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.280]   I would highly encourage listeners to look at.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:49.140]   It is an opportunity to get up to a 10-year loan at a 4% interest rate, so very favorable
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:53.920]   interest rate over that period of time, especially for a small business that is potentially struggling.
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:58.080]   The loan will be 100% backed by the Small Business Administration.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:04.520]   And in particular, if the loan is used for certain items in the first eight weeks following
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:12.360]   issuance of that loan, so things like payroll, etc., health insurance, benefits for employees,
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:16.260]   that portion in the first eight weeks is entirely forgivable.
[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:19.300]   So it's as close to free money as one can get.
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:23.800]   In fact, it's so good even if they forgive the loan as part of that process in those
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:29.160]   first eight weeks for the specified expenses, then it's not even included in your income.
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:32.520]   Normally discharging debt is included in taxable income.
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:33.520]   It's not here.
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:38.680]   So I would strongly encourage business owners to look at these things, in particular, again,
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:42.680]   what's called the Paycheck Protection Program, PPP.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:43.680]   Check it out.
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:44.680]   Yeah.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:48.000]   And unfortunately, I was just reading today that one of the states have stopped taking
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.440]   applications because they've been overwhelmed, which I would understand why.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.440]   Okay.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:58.000]   Then we need to get on to the SECURE Act, which happened back December.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   What are the highlights?
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.640]   Well, I think the biggest highlight for those who are savers and who have for many years
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:12.600]   planned on leaving IRA, 401(k), 403(b), and other retirement assets to children, grandchildren,
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:19.400]   etc., is that the stretch IRA has been eliminated for the majority of beneficiaries that are
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.060]   not a spouse.
[00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:26.880]   In short, the previous law allowed individuals who are named on a beneficiary form to take
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:30.120]   small distributions over the course of their lifetime.
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:36.000]   And that meant, in general, you know, for even middle-aged individuals, fairly small
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   distributions.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:44.080]   For argument's sake, a 40-year-old has an IRS-given 43.6-year life expectancy, meaning
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:48.300]   that they would have to divide their account by 43.6 and take that as a requirement of
[00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:49.840]   distribution that year.
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:55.380]   At age 40, you're talking about taking like 2.5% of the account.
[00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:56.780]   That's a really small percentage.
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:03.000]   So many individuals not only had small distributions for years, but in addition to that, they were
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.120]   able to see their account grow.
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:07.840]   You know, you did better than 2.5% when you're only taking out 2.5%.
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.360]   Your account's bigger the next year.
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:16.160]   Now, the SECURE Act says, with the overwhelming—I should say, rather, with very few exceptions,
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:21.960]   the overwhelming majority of beneficiaries that are not a spouse will now have to take
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:27.800]   everything out of the inherited IRA, inherited 401(k), et cetera, within 10 years after
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:28.920]   the year of death.
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:34.280]   So really compressing the time over which those distributions must occur.
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:37.960]   And just for your listeners' sake, they're probably wondering, "Well, Jeff, you said,
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:41.360]   you know, a very limited number of beneficiaries, but what are they?
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.360]   What are those groups?"
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.840]   Well, it's a spouse, which we've already said.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:49.040]   It could also be a disabled individual, which is defined under law essentially as someone
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:53.680]   who can't work at all, unable to engage in any substantially gainful activity is the
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:54.680]   term.
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:59.840]   A chronically ill individual, so those are the individuals that typically can't do two
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:06.200]   out of six, what are known as activities of daily living, so eating, bathing, going to
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:10.640]   the bathroom, transferring, those sorts of things on their own.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:16.080]   The fourth group would be any individual who's not more than 10 years younger than the person
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.120]   who died.
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:20.600]   So if you leave it to a brother or a sister and they're, you know, three years younger,
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:23.880]   they can stretch, but they aren't really getting that many more years since they were only
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:26.540]   three or four years younger than you to start with.
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:31.660]   And the last one, and the one that causes the most confusion is the decedent's minor
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:32.660]   children.
[00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:38.320]   Now, note, Rick, I said the decedent's minor children, not minor children in general.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:42.600]   And that's been one of the confusing areas that I've seen since the law was passed, people
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.560]   thinking any minor child qualifies.
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:50.960]   It's only if the person who died left it to their own minor children and they only get
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:55.880]   that break of not having to take it out over 10 years until they reach age of majority.
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:59.560]   Once they hit age of majority, the 10 years starts then and they have to take it out over
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:01.200]   that 10 year period.
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:05.300]   So I've been working with a lot of clients on trying to figure out how to stretch this
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:06.840]   IRA.
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:14.520]   And one of the things I came up with was if you are a spouse or you're a couple, and let's
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:21.400]   say you each had equal IRA but you really didn't need the required minimum distributions
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:27.680]   on it to live because you had other money, that you might want to, in each of your IRA
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:34.040]   accounts, you might want to name the children as the beneficiaries instead of the spouse
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.360]   as the beneficiary.
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:42.080]   Therefore, if it's a husband and wife and a husband dies younger, which historically
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:46.480]   has been the case, the children would get the husband's beneficiary in which they would
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:50.720]   have 10 years to take the money over that 10 year period of time.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:56.440]   And then the wife lives another 10 years and then she dies and then the children get the
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:00.520]   second half of it and they take that over another 10 years.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:03.560]   So actually you've been able to stretch it out over 20 years.
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:04.560]   Absolutely.
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:09.320]   And one of the things that I would also say is people may run into pushback sometimes
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:13.960]   if they look to do that now and say, maybe the spouse says, "Well, what if I need the
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:14.960]   money?"
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:15.960]   Well, no big deal.
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:19.040]   You can kind of have your cake and eat it too here.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:25.200]   You can name the spouse as the primary beneficiary, name the kids as contingent beneficiaries
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:29.040]   and people should always have contingent beneficiaries on their beneficiary form.
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:35.080]   And if at the time the first to die spouse passes away, the surviving spouse says, "You
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:38.560]   know, I really don't need that money," then they can disclaim it.
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:42.280]   In fact, they can disclaim a portion of it and whatever they disclaim is essentially
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:44.720]   the legal equivalent of plain dead.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:49.320]   That money will then pass down to those kids who will get the 10 year window at that point.
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:56.240]   But that's absolutely a great way to extend and artificially create a longer period of
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:58.380]   time to take that distribution out.
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:02.320]   Another way potentially to do that would be just to have more beneficiaries instead of
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:07.960]   naming the kids directly for 50% each, let's say there were two kids.
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:12.400]   If each of those two kids had two adult children of their own, so talking grandparents here
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:19.400]   doing this for their children and adult grandchildren, maybe they decide to do 30% to each kid and
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:27.240]   then 10% to each grandkid as an immediate way to pass assets simply to spread that income
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.240]   out over more returns.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:32.600]   In other words, if I can't make more years to spread it out over, I'll make more returns
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:35.440]   to spread it out over to keep that tax bill low.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:40.440]   So a lot of different ways you can go to try and mitigate the impact of this secure act
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.560]   for sure.
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:47.760]   One of the other things we discussed was if you have one child who is doing very well
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:54.840]   financially making $500,000 a year and you had another one who decided to go into a non-profit
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:42:01.680]   and is making a much, much, much lower amount and is in a much lower tax rate that you leave
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:08.400]   other assets, after-tax assets to the one who is making half a million a year and you
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:15.320]   leave the IRA retirement assets to the one who is only making $30,000 or $40,000 a year
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:17.240]   because they're in a low tax bracket.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:23.160]   So you could equal that out somehow, but that would keep more wealth in the family overall
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:25.400]   based on how you distributed your assets.
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.600]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:32.920]   That's another great way to go and certainly even for those who really want to force the
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:33.920]   stretch.
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:36.800]   Let's say, "I really wanted my kids to stretch."
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:41.380]   There's even a potential way to artificially recreate that potentially for some individuals
[00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:46.800]   using what's called a charitable remainder trust, essentially leaving your IRA to a trust
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:51.880]   where when the beneficiary of that trust dies, the rest goes to charity.
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:56.680]   But during their lifetime, they can take an income stream from that trust and it can replicate
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:02.680]   to a large degree for certain individuals the benefits of a stretch IRA.
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:07.760]   Now obviously, there are some downsides to it as well that people need to be aware of.
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:12.960]   For instance, if the beneficiary of that trust dies relatively young, a lot of those assets
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:18.320]   could be "lost" to charity, which is not the worst thing in the world from an altruistic
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:22.600]   standpoint but from protecting one's family might have some consequences.
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:25.920]   So there's at times a need for generational planning.
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:31.080]   But this is what I would encourage your audience to do and it's just simply to talk with a
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:32.080]   knowledgeable professional.
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:36.160]   Like if this is something that you've done your entire life and worked and built up a
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:40.160]   million or $2 million or whatever it is that's a lot of money to you and you want it to go
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:46.000]   to your kids or other individuals and you want it to be as tax-efficient as possible,
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   take a few moments, get a little bit of information, or read up.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   Simply read up.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.360]   There's lots of resources out there.
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:58.440]   I think I've probably written 100,000 words on the SECURE Act already on our Kitsis.com
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:43:59.440]   website.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:02.120]   So there's plenty of information out there.
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:06.720]   Just make sure that you're looking at this because it's a big deal.
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:07.720]   It's a big deal.
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:12.040]   And the bigger your retirement account, the bigger the potential issue is and impact is
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:13.040]   for your beneficiaries.
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:14.080]   Okay.
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:19.560]   One more item on the SECURE Act is it pushes the required minimum distribution age out
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:22.200]   to age 72.
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:23.560]   Any comments on that?
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:24.560]   Sure.
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:25.560]   Yeah.
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:30.760]   That's precisely correct that we get a deferral of the required minimum distribution age.
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:36.200]   Now, notably, those who turned 70 and a half last year were going to have to continue to
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:39.080]   take an RMD this year in 2020.
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:42.880]   Of course, now the CARES Act, which we just discussed, kind of supersedes that.
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:46.120]   And so now they don't have an RMD this year either.
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:49.200]   If people want to know, you know, what does this actually mean to me?
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.320]   Very simply, here's what it is.
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:56.960]   If your birthday is January 1st to June 30th, so you're a first half of the year birthday,
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:00.840]   then you start taking RMDs now under the SECURE Act's rules.
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:04.680]   Two years later than you would have if the SECURE Act had not passed.
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:09.920]   And if your birthday is in the second half of the year, then you push back your RMDs
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:15.200]   one calendar year based on what it would have been had the SECURE Act not passed.
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:18.760]   Now, I will make one other important note here because it comes up often.
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:22.880]   And Rick, I know a lot of your listeners are very charitably inclined, and some of them
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:30.400]   may look to use their IRA to make those so-called qualified charitable distributions where they
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:33.320]   send certain money from their IRAs directly to charity.
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:41.080]   It's a fantastic tax-efficient way of supporting the causes that you're passionate about.
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:48.000]   That date did not get pushed back until the age 72 date along with the RMDs.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.400]   It is still 70 and a half years of age.
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:56.000]   Now, obviously someone at 70 and a half doesn't have an RMD anymore.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.840]   But if you want to give to charity, that's still a very tax-efficient way to do it.
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:03.520]   And you can still do it from your IRA at age 70 and a half.
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:09.680]   Once you hit 72, then it will also begin to offset your RMD at that time as well.
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:13.800]   And you can do Roth conversions between 70 and a half continued just like you would normally
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.280]   before you were 70 and a half.
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:17.880]   You can do those up until 72 also.
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:18.880]   Exactly.
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:21.720]   And this year for anybody because there's no required minimum distribution.
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:26.160]   Normally, as you know, you have to take that required minimum distribution first.
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:30.760]   And then you can kind of convert anything above and beyond that if you want, which has
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:34.200]   the effect of essentially pushing your income up first and then saying, "Well, if you want
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:38.160]   more income above and beyond your RMD, sure, you can add that on."
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.440]   This year, you don't have that to worry about.
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:45.240]   So maybe that's the answer for some people is instead of taking their RMD as normal,
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:48.440]   just convert it to a Roth and you're in the same tax situation as you normally would,
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:54.080]   except now you've got a pile of money growing tax-free forever and ever for you and your
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.080]   beneficiaries.
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:59.920]   So, it seems to me that you're in a really unique situation if you're maybe 71 years
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:05.800]   old where this year you don't have to make a required minimum distribution.
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:14.160]   You could donate $100,000 of your IRA to charity and you wouldn't have to pay any taxes on
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:20.200]   that distribution and then any other amount you could take out, you could put it into
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:21.200]   your Roth.
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:24.760]   I imagine that's true for if you're 75 or 76 years old.
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:25.760]   Absolutely.
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:29.600]   You get to do – you have free reign essentially over your IRA this year.
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:34.320]   You can decide how much to give via the QCD up to that $100,000 amount and at the same
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:37.760]   time, you could do a Roth conversion and you could do it in any order.
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:42.960]   You could do 10,000 Roth conversion today, a $5,000 QCD later this year.
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:48.400]   As long as you're just limiting yourself to that $100,000 QCD amount at some time,
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.680]   you could choose whatever you want.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:50.680]   It's fantastic.
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:54.880]   There's a lot of flexibility that's offered in this challenging time.
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:48:00.840]   No one would choose to have the reason for these special rules apply but since they do,
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:03.120]   we might as well use them to the best we can.
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:08.680]   Let's talk about something that our Bogleheads talk about all the time on bogleheads.org
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:12.880]   and I had a lot of questions about this when I announced that you were going to be my guest
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:22.240]   and it has to do with tax laws harvesting and tax swapping into a similar security and
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:27.400]   what does the IRS mean by substantially identical securities?
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:34.320]   Boy, I wish I had a really clear cut like super knowledgeable answer that said, "You
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:38.960]   know, back in 1982, the IRS put out notice da-da-da-da-da."
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:45.400]   Unfortunately, this rule has been on the books for a long, long time and it is still
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:46.640]   very gray.
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:55.320]   Frankly, I think we've seen a further complication of the wash sale rules in the age of ETFs
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:49:02.960]   because in a world where you sell let's say Microsoft and you buy Google, you could find
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:07.840]   a fairly similar company but there's enough different dynamics with like an individual
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:13.960]   stock that you could make a pretty good argument for not substantially similar in most instances.
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:17.920]   When it comes to an ETF for argument's sake, and I know many of us…
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:18.920]   Hold on a second.
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:19.920]   Sure.
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:21.000]   You actually used a different phrase.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:27.640]   The IRS talks about substantially identical, you said substantially similar, which is actually
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:31.600]   used in a different part of the tax law and I think that is part of the confusion by the
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:32.600]   way.
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:34.880]   That's a fair point.
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:40.860]   You're correct to point that out exactly, that it is substantially identical.
[00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:48.260]   So I would say that the ETF issue that's risen up with a lot of people is, you know,
[00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:59.160]   if I change my, you know, S&P 500 ETF for a S&P 100 ETF, is that substantially identical?
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:04.200]   And there's really not a great answer because again, you'd say it's significantly different.
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:10.560]   You're only having 100 companies versus, you know, versus 500 or roughly, right?
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:12.760]   It's a slightly more than 500, the S&P 500.
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:19.320]   But that's, if you look at how they track one another and the correlation, they are
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:22.720]   really, really close in many instances.
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:30.480]   And so you could, the IRS, I could very easily see the IRS coming in and having that argument
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:35.480]   to say like, look, you have a 98% correlation, just hypothetically, you know, speaking.
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:38.080]   And how could you say that these aren't substantially identical?
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:41.760]   98% correlation is basically the same correlation.
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:46.640]   You're really essentially buying the same thing just with a different name on it.
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:50.360]   And so my view tends to be a little bit more conservative here.
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:53.720]   Of course, this goes against the whole wash sale principle, right?
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:57.480]   Like a lot of times people, or the idea of what people are trying to do, the whole point
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:02.360]   of what a lot of times people are trying to do here is to buy something that's really
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:07.040]   close that does replicate the same sort of investment performance because you're getting
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:11.060]   rid of something, but you may have wanted it in your portfolio, you're only selling
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:12.060]   it to get the loss.
[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:16.760]   So you want to replicate it with something that would mirror it as closely as possible.
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:22.360]   But by doing so, you may be subjecting yourself to a greater risk of having that loss disallowed
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:25.320]   if IRS were to examine your return.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:33.120]   I will say this, it's better to give yourself more distance.
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:37.880]   We're talking about a period of 30 days and I know right now is maybe not the best time
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:42.860]   to talk about how much will things change in 30 days because my goodness, how they've
[00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:46.720]   changed in the last 30 days from when we're recording this.
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:50.880]   But in general, those things tend to, you know, tend to work themselves out.
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:56.320]   I would just buy something that's clearly different and has a difference of doesn't
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:52:00.240]   track very closely the index that you were holding before.
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:04.880]   I'm a little bit more conservative on this than some of my colleagues.
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:11.840]   Certainly going from company A, S&P 500 to company B, S&P 500, that's going to be substantially
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:12.840]   identical.
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:14.200]   I don't think there's any question about that.
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:18.400]   But in terms of, let's say, going even from like equal weighted to cap weighted, the more
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:22.540]   distance you put between yourself and the previous position you sold for this 30-day
[00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:25.240]   period, the better off you're going to be.
[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:28.920]   I will be a little bit more liberal in my interpretation.
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:36.560]   Now I'm not a CPA, but I am an investment person and I've studied indexes and I've studied
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:42.060]   ETFs and I've studied index funds, so my interpretation is different.
[00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:53.200]   If you have Vanguard issuing an ETF that is tracking the crisp total market index and
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:53:00.360]   Vanguard is the issuer of that ETF and the market goes down 10% and you sell that Vanguard
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:07.640]   total market ETF that is tracking this crisp total market index and you turn around and
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:17.520]   you buy an iShare that is issued by a completely separate company, completely unrelated.
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:25.840]   The index they follow is a completely separate total market index, which is the S&P total
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:31.120]   market index and completely unrelated to the crisp index.
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:33.120]   They're different index providers.
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:37.720]   Yes, they are almost all the same securities.
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:42.720]   That it's at the issuer level, it's not substantially identical.
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.840]   Vanguard is not iShare.
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:46.760]   Just like Ford is not General Motors.
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:47.760]   They both make cars.
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:51.260]   In some cases, they both make almost identical cars.
[00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:57.320]   But when you have two completely separate unrelated issuers that are tracking different
[00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:01.860]   indexes, even though the indexes are very similar, they are not substantially identical.
[00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:10.200]   That's my view as a guy who has studied indexes and studied index providers and indexing methodologies.
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:15.240]   The methodologies of how the indexes are constructed are not substantially identical.
[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:16.240]   That's my view.
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:20.160]   I would respond to that with a few things.
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:25.100]   First off, if I was going to court and I had to argue this before the IRS, I'd certainly
[00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:29.920]   make that argument and I'd also have you hired as an expert witness to explain why they're
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:30.920]   very different.
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:35.520]   So that's the first thing, is get your ducks in a row and have the right team.
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:40.120]   But the other thing I would say is, I think part of this also comes down to just the practical
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:41.120]   element of this.
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:46.320]   If you're selling a really small position and in your portfolio and you're looking to
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:52.680]   claim a $2,000 or $3,000 loss, at the end of the day, if that got disallowed by the
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:55.140]   IRS, it's not going to be the end of the world.
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:59.160]   On the other hand, if you were selling a big position that you had purchased and we're
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:03.800]   talking about the difference of being able to claim a $100,000 loss or something like
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:07.680]   that, then maybe that's where you tend to be a little bit more ... And I agree, my position
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:09.560]   is a little bit conservative.
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:12.040]   I will admit that.
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:17.800]   But as someone who doesn't want to be on the other end of the IRS disallowing that and
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:22.480]   popping the person's income up $100,000 and seeing Medicare Part D and Part D premiums
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:26.320]   inflate and all the other nasty things that come along with it, I've grown a little bit
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:28.000]   conservative in that element.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.800]   I will mention one other thing about the wash sale rule, which I don't often get a chance
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:32.800]   to talk about.
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:35.120]   So it's great to be chatting about this today.
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:42.160]   And that's the number one thing that you should be most careful of if you're looking at wash
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:50.600]   sales, is to avoid selling the position inside your taxable account and buying it back in
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:52.820]   your retirement account.
[00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:58.000]   That is a really big no-no, because if you violate the wash sale rule in your taxable
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:02.200]   account and you buy it back there, as you well know, Rick, you're just adding to your
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:04.520]   basis in the second purchase.
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:10.120]   So you're ultimately going to be able to benefit from your basis and the amount that you spent
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:14.400]   on the various positions at some point or other, many years potentially in the future
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:18.060]   when you ultimately sell, but it's not lost forever.
[00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:24.520]   If you sell an investment in your taxable account and you buy it back in your IRA, that
[00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:26.880]   loss is actually lost forever.
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:30.160]   There's a revenue ruling out on this, and a revenue ruling applies across the board
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:32.040]   to taxpayers.
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:37.240]   And I will say this, your listeners may be wondering how are they going to know?
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:40.520]   And there's actually a great article, I don't remember whether it was the Wall Street Journal
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:45.320]   or maybe the Washington Post when this came out, they interviewed one of the old IRS commissioners
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:51.160]   and he said, "I have no idea how they'd ever even know that."
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:55.000]   But it is the rule and you're supposed to follow the rule, not what they catch you breaking
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   against the rule.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   Follow the rules.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   There's one other point about that too.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:05.480]   If a spouse buys it and their IRA within that 30-day period, it is still a wash sale.
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:06.480]   Indeed.
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:08.880]   Jeff, is there anything else you want to talk about?
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:11.480]   We have room for just one more item.
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:15.920]   I would just encourage everyone at this point in time, this may be a challenging year for
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:18.440]   a lot of individuals with income.
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:22.880]   If you've got savings put aside and you're living off that savings and your income is
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:27.600]   down this year, this may be an opportune time to look at doing Roth conversions while your
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:30.320]   income is lower than it otherwise would be.
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:35.280]   And certainly I would just say that with the few moments we have left, I know this is a
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:37.360]   challenging time for everybody.
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:44.360]   I hope that something here was of value to you today and I certainly wish nothing but
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:46.880]   the best of health and happiness for everyone listening.
