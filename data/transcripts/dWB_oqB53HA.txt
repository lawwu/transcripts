[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280]   Pastor John, we have a follow-up question from a listener named Isaac.
[00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.760]   Pastor John, in episode number 924, you said Christians are known as sin haters.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.060]   I agree wholly, but sometimes in living this out I become too self-focused.
[00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:21.320]   So what is the difference between hating sin, what you call for, and hating myself because
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.680]   I sin, which is so often what I feel?
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.480]   What's the difference between sin hate and self-hate?
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:37.120]   Let me first say something that will probably strike Isaac as depressing, and then I hope,
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:44.480]   because it's true and because it's real and because of the wider biblical context, be
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.880]   hope-giving and not just depressing.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:56.880]   I think it is impossible to really hate our sin and know that this sin originates in my
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.720]   corrupt heart and not hate that heart.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:13.560]   That is, hate my heart, my sinning self, insofar as I am corrupt, world-loving, God-hating,
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.920]   rebellious, and that is who we all are without the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:28.800]   Paul describes us in Ephesians 2, "Once we walked following the course of this world,
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.680]   following the prince of the power of the air and the spirit that is now at work in the
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.080]   sons of disobedience among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.120]   out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature"—this is not alien to
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.960]   us—"by nature children of wrath like the rest of mankind."
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.000]   You can't know yourself to be a child of wrath that is a person whom God is so angry
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   with and not be angry with yourself if you're in sync with God.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.680]   Now, of course, God enters into our lives with the power of the Spirit.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.720]   The old man is crucified.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.720]   Sins are forgiven.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.600]   A new nature is given through rebirth.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.720]   The Holy Spirit takes up residence in our hearts.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.200]   He begins to lead us in paths of righteousness.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:30.100]   We're not the same people anymore that we once were in such awful rebellion.
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.840]   So you might think, "Well, that's the end of that self-hate."
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.800]   There are two catches.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:45.600]   One is that Paul tells us to remember what we came from in Ephesians 2.12.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.400]   Remember that you were at that time—this is just ten verses later than what I just
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.360]   read from Ephesians 2—remember that you were at that time separated from Christ, alienated
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.680]   from the commonwealth of Israel, strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.320]   without God in the world.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.600]   So remember that.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.080]   Don't forget that.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.080]   Bring that to your mind.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.000]   Let it humble you.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.160]   Hate that old self.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:26.720]   The other catch is that in spite of our newness in Christ, the old nature must be seen, recognized
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.160]   now and put to death now, daily.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.560]   Put to death.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.160]   Paul said, "What is earthly in you?"
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.480]   Reckon to be dead that old nature.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.240]   You can't put your old nature to death if you love it.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.320]   In cases like this, you only kill what you hate.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.080]   It's not just sin that you kill.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:59.480]   It's the old you that keeps trying to raise its head, and you must hate that old you.
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.840]   And yes, it is a real you.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:14.040]   I base that on Romans 7, 24, where Paul cries out, "Wretched man that I am!"
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.200]   Not just "Wretched sin that I do!"
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.360]   He's not calling the work of the Holy Spirit wretched.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.960]   No, he's not.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.440]   He says in verse 18, "I know that nothing good dwells in me that is in my flesh."
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.840]   Well, he knows something good does dwell in him.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.120]   The Holy Spirit dwells in him.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.480]   A new nature dwells in him.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:44.160]   What he's calling wretched is his old, sinful nature.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.960]   And the way he says it is, "Wretched man that I am!"
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:58.000]   And he knows he's still responsible for those acts that crop up from his old nature.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.960]   So in that sense, I think there is a genuine and proper self-hatred that is essential to
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.200]   fighting the fight of faith.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:18.680]   Now, here are two or three warnings how that—what I just said—can go haywire.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:26.920]   Number one, I've already said it would be sin if you hated the new you that the Holy
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.080]   Spirit is shaping after the image of Christ.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:37.200]   Every hint of godliness, every degree of love to Christ, every mustard seed of faith should
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:43.040]   cause you to feel thankful that God is at work in you, making you new.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.520]   It's a sin to hate this new work of God.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:53.840]   Don't ever hate what God has wrought in you by the power of the Holy Spirit, and he
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.040]   is at work in you if you are born again.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.080]   And here are two more warnings how things can go haywire.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:11.960]   Jesus bases his whole argument for self-denial on the preciousness of the human soul, the
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.400]   value of everlasting existence.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.800]   Listen to how he says it.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.800]   This is Mark 8:34.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:25.640]   "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.640]   me."
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.640]   Here's his argument.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.440]   "For whoever would save his life will lose it."
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.040]   Well, you don't want to lose it.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:39.760]   But whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel's will save it.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.440]   And you do want to save it.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:49.320]   And then he adds, "For what does it profit a man if he gain the whole world and forfeit
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.640]   or lose his soul?"
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:59.040]   What can man give in return for his soul?
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:08.360]   The whole argument, the basis of Jesus' argument is you should love your soul.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:15.060]   That is, love it in the sense of doing whatever it takes to save it.
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:20.800]   So in this sense, we should never, never, never hate our soul.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.400]   That is, we should never act in a way that destroys the soul.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.240]   The whole world is acting as though they hate their soul by living in sin.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.840]   We should love our souls in the sense that we will do anything.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.440]   We will deny ourselves anything.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.900]   We will sell anything.
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.520]   We will go anywhere.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:48.920]   We will believe Jesus to the max, including any self-denial in order to save our souls.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.840]   That's the way Jesus is arguing.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:08:00.920]   So don't ever become a self-hater in the sense that you don't care about saving your soul,
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.560]   but only destroying it.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:09.760]   And the last warning about how things can go haywire in this recommendation that there's
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:17.840]   a genuine self-hatred that belongs to the Christian life is the third warning.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:28.600]   Don't dwell on your past corruption or on your present remaining corruption to the degree
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:37.880]   that it keeps you from leaning into hope with such joy that you are set free to love.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:46.120]   And here's the text, Philippians 3:13, "Brothers, one thing I do, forgetting what lies behind
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:54.400]   and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal of the prize of
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.000]   the upward call of God in Christ Jesus."
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.280]   So notice the key words, "forgetting what lies behind."
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:10.320]   So yes, remember your corruption, Ephesians 2:12, enough to humble yourself and keep yourself
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:17.400]   utterly dependent on grace, but forget your corruption if it ever keeps you back from
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:22.480]   pressing on toward the goal of the prize of the upward call of God in Christ with joy
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.440]   and hope and confidence and love.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:35.600]   So Isaac, that's how you measure whether your self-hatred is pathological and self-defeating
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:40.520]   or whether it is Christ-exalting and hope-giving.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.760]   Does it throw you onto grace in Christ?
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:51.840]   Does it intensify your love to Jesus and your confidence in his love for you and his readiness
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.000]   to use you for his glory?
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.240]   So say to yourself often, "I am the temple of the Holy Spirit.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.440]   I am not my own.
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.120]   I was bought with a price.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.560]   I will glorify God in my body."
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.800]   Yeah, amen.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.600]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the question, Isaac.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.640]   These are the wonderful questions that we really welcome, we love getting them, so thank
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.540]   you for sending us so many great questions over the years.
[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:24.720]   Of course, we can't respond to questions in writing, and we can only get to a fraction
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.520]   of them on the air, but your questions really are important to us, and they make this podcast
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.700]   possible.
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.700]   So thank you for sending them in.
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.640]   And for more details about this podcast or to catch up on old episodes or to subscribe
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:41.200]   to the audio feed so you can keep up on new episodes as we release them, even to send
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:48.120]   us a question of your own, go to our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.180]   Well tomorrow is Thanksgiving.
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.180]   Happy Thanksgiving.
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.720]   And we are going to return on Friday.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.080]   We're going to talk about a theme related to Thanksgiving, but it's essentially the
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:01.120]   question of are we overdoing the anti-prosperity gospel theme?
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:06.360]   Can we be so anti-prosperity gospel that we become less thankful for the abundant gifts
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.400]   that God has showered into our lives?
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:13.560]   It's a timely question, and it comes into us from a listener, and we will address that
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.560]   on Friday.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.060]   We'll see you then.
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:24.380]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
