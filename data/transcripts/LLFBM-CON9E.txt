[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520]   - I mean, wasn't the Higgs called the God particle
[00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.360]   at some point?
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.320]   - It was by a guy trying to sell popular science books, yeah.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.520]   - Yeah, but I mean, I remember 'cause when I was hearing it,
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.680]   I thought it would, I mean, that would solve a lot of,
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.960]   that unify a lot of our ideas of physics, was my notion.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.680]   But maybe you can speak to that.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.420]   Is it as big of a leap?
[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.760]   Is it a God particle, or is it a Jesus particle?
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.920]   (laughing)
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.640]   Which, you know, what's the big contribution of Higgs
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.440]   in terms of this unification power?
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.240]   - Yeah, I mean, to understand that,
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.720]   it maybe helps to know the history a little bit.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.360]   So when the, what we call electro weak theory
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.240]   was put together, which is where you unify electromagnetism
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.020]   with the weak force, and the Higgs is involved
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.920]   in all of that.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.080]   So that theory, which was written in the mid '70s,
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.000]   predicted the existence of four new particles,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.160]   the W plus boson, the W minus boson, the Z boson,
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.100]   and the Higgs boson.
[00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.400]   So there were these four particles
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.620]   that came with the theory,
[00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.080]   that were predicted by the theory.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.220]   In 1983, '84, the W's and the Z particles
[00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.920]   were discovered at an accelerator at CERN,
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.600]   called the super proton synchrotron,
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.840]   which was a seven kilometer particle collider.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.400]   So three of the bits of this theory had already been found.
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.160]   So people were pretty confident from the '80s
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.640]   that the Higgs must exist,
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.400]   because it was a part of this family of particles
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.640]   that this theoretical structure only works
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.080]   if the Higgs is there.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.200]   So what then happens,
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.040]   so this question about why is the LHC the size it is?
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.140]   Well, actually the tunnel that the LHC is in
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.440]   was not built for the LHC.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.760]   It was built for a previous accelerator
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.360]   called the large electron positron collider.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.360]   So that began operation in the late '80s, early '90s.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.880]   They basically, that's when they dug
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.080]   the 27 kilometer tunnel.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.640]   They put this accelerator into it,
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.360]   the collider that fires electrons and anti electrons
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.280]   at each other, electrons and positrons.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.800]   So the purpose of that machine was,
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.320]   well, it was actually to look for the Higgs.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.320]   That was one of the things it was trying to do,
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.040]   but it didn't have enough energy to do it in the end.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.440]   But the main thing it achieved was it studied
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.160]   the W and the Z particles at very high precision.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.920]   So it made loads of these things.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.180]   Previously you can only make a few of them
[00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.080]   at the previous accelerator.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.120]   So you could study these really, really precisely.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.320]   And by studying their properties,
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.840]   you could really test this electroweak theory
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.440]   that had been invented in the '70s
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.900]   and really make sure that it worked.
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.900]   So actually by 1999, when this machine turned off,
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.120]   people knew, well, okay, you never know
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.040]   until you find the thing.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.640]   But people were really confident
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.440]   this electroweak theory was right.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.440]   And that the Higgs almost,
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.480]   the Higgs or something very like the Higgs had to exist
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.860]   because otherwise the whole thing doesn't work.
[00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.640]   It'd be really weird if you could discover
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.520]   and these particles, they all behave exactly
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.960]   as your theory tells you they should.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.520]   But somehow this key piece of the picture is not there.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.560]   So in a way, it depends how you look at it.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.440]   The discovery of the Higgs on its own
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.640]   is obviously a huge achievement in many,
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.960]   both experimentally and theoretically.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.880]   On the other hand, it's like having a jigsaw puzzle
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.720]   where every piece has been filled in.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.640]   You have this beautiful image, there's one gap
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.000]   and you kind of know that that piece
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.520]   must be there somewhere, right?
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.520]   So the discovery in itself, although it's important,
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.080]   is not so interesting.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.000]   - It's like a confirmation of the obvious at that point.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.680]   - But what makes it interesting
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.720]   is not that it just completes the standard model,
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.600]   which is a theory that we've known,
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.400]   had the basic layout of for 40 years or more now.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.040]   It's that the Higgs actually is a unique particle.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.200]   It's very different to any of the other particles
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.520]   in the standard model.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.900]   And it's a theoretically very troublesome particle.
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.880]   There are a lot of nasty things to do with the Higgs,
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.480]   but also opportunities.
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.840]   So we don't really understand how such an object
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.880]   can exist in the form that it does.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.120]   So there are lots of reasons for thinking
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.200]   that the Higgs must come with a bunch of other particles
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.680]   or that it's perhaps made of other things.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.080]   So it's not a fundamental particle,
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.560]   that it's made of smaller things.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.200]   I can talk about that if you like a bit.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.600]   - That's still a notion.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.440]   So the Higgs might not be a fundamental particle,
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.840]   that there might be some, oh man.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.040]   So that is an idea.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.720]   It's not been demonstrated to be true.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.480]   But I mean, all of these ideas basically come
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.600]   from the fact that this is a problem
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.760]   that motivated a lot of development in physics
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.040]   in the last 30 years or so.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.440]   And it's this basic fact that the Higgs field,
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.960]   which is this field that's everywhere in the universe,
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.720]   this is the thing that gives mass to the particles.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.880]   And the Higgs field is different
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.800]   from all the other fields in that,
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.080]   let's say you take the electromagnetic field,
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.760]   which is, if we actually were to measure
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.080]   the electromagnetic field in this room,
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.560]   we would measure all kinds of stuff going on
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.640]   'cause there's light, there's gonna be microwaves
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.800]   and radio waves and stuff.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.600]   But let's say we could go to a really, really remote part
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.320]   of empty space and shield it and put a big box around it
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.720]   and then measure the electromagnetic field in that box.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.880]   The field would be almost zero,
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.440]   apart from some little quantum fluctuations.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.640]   But basically it goes to naught.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.800]   The Higgs field has a value everywhere.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.360]   So it's a bit like the whole,
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.120]   it's like the entire space has got this energy
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.080]   stored in the Higgs field, which is not zero.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.120]   It's finite.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.000]   It's a bit like having the temperature of space
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   raised to some background temperature.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.520]   And it's that energy that gives mass to the particles.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.080]   So the reason that electrons and quarks have mass
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.080]   is through the interaction with this energy
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.440]   that's stored in the Higgs field.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.440]   Now, it turns out that the precise value this energy has
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.240]   has to be very carefully tuned if you want a universe
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.780]   where interesting stuff can happen.
[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.300]   So if you push the Higgs field down,
[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.720]   it has a tendency to collapse to,
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.640]   well, there's a tendency,
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.280]   if you do your sort of naive calculations,
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.920]   there are basically two possible likely configurations
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.960]   for the Higgs field, which is either it's zero everywhere,
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.120]   in which case you have a universe
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.480]   which is just particles with no mass that can't form atoms
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.680]   and just fly about at the speed of light,
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.360]   or it explodes to an enormous value,
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.440]   what we call the Planck scale,
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.800]   which is the scale of quantum gravity.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.700]   And at that point, if the Higgs field was that strong,
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.540]   even an electron would become so massive
[00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.840]   that it would collapse into a black hole.
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.720]   And then you have a universe made of black holes
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.580]   and nothing like us.
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.280]   So it seems that the strength of the Higgs field
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.800]   is to achieve the value that we see
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.560]   requires what we call fine tuning of the laws of physics.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.980]   You have to fiddle around with the other fields
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.960]   in the standard model and their properties
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.400]   to just get it to this right sort of Goldilocks value
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.760]   that allows atoms to exist.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.200]   This is deeply fishy.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.040]   People really dislike this.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.040]   - Well, yeah, I guess, so what would be,
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.480]   so two explanations.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.680]   One, there's a God that designed this perfectly,
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.200]   and two is there's an infinite number
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.960]   of alternate universes, and we just happen to be in the one
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.760]   in which life is possible.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.000]   - Yeah, yeah. - Complexity.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.180]   So when you say, I mean, life, any kind of complexity,
[00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.560]   that's not either complete chaos or black holes.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.160]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.400]   - I mean, how does that make you feel?
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.240]   What do you make of that?
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.920]   That's such a fascinating notion
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.000]   that this perfectly tuned field
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.760]   that's the same everywhere is there.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.800]   What do you make of that?
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.840]   Yeah, what do you make of that?
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.920]   - I mean, yeah, so you laid out
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.320]   two of the possible explanations.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.520]   - Really? - Somewhat.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.160]   Yeah, I mean, well, someone,
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.800]   some cosmic creator went, yeah, let's fix that
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.780]   to be at the right level.
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.040]   That's one possibility, I guess.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.520]   It's not a scientifically testable one,
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.360]   but theoretically, I guess, it's possible.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.520]   - Sorry to interrupt, but there could also be,
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.120]   not a designer, but couldn't there be just,
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.600]   I guess, I'm not sure what that would be,
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.860]   but some kind of force that,
[00:07:52.860 --> 00:08:01.840]   some kind of mechanism by which this kind of field
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.840]   is enforced in order to create complexity.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.840]   Basically, forces that pull the universe
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.440]   towards an interesting complexity.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.040]   - I mean, yeah, I mean, there are people
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:16.960]   that have those ideas.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.280]   I don't really subscribe to them.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.200]   - As I'm saying, it sounds really stupid.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.760]   - No, I mean, there are definitely people
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.080]   that make those kind of arguments.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.680]   There's ideas that, I think it's Lee Smolin's idea,
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.680]   one, I think, that universes are born inside black holes.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.920]   And so universes, they basically have
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.160]   like Darwinian evolution of the universe,
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.480]   where universes give birth to other universes.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.400]   And if universes where black holes can form
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.440]   are more likely to give birth to more universes,
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.920]   so you end up with universes which have similar laws.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.160]   I mean, I don't know, whatever.
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.720]   - Well, I talked to Lee recently on this podcast,
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:56.720]   and he's a reminder to me that the physics community
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.240]   has so many interesting characters in it.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.600]   It's fascinating.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.440]   Anyway, sorry, so.
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.720]   - I mean, as an experimentalist, I tend to sort of think,
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.840]   these are interesting ideas,
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.400]   but they're not really testable,
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.360]   so I tend not to think about them very much.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.200]   So, I mean, going back to the science of this,
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.760]   there is an explanation.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.880]   There is a possible solution to this problem of the Higgs,
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.800]   which doesn't involve multiverses
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:21.200]   or creators fiddling about with the laws of physics.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.040]   If the most popular solution
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.080]   was something called supersymmetry,
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.400]   which is a theory which involves
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.360]   a new type of symmetry of the universe.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.320]   In fact, it's one of the last types of symmetries
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.200]   that is possible to have
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.040]   that we haven't already seen in nature,
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.240]   which is a symmetry between force particles
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.080]   and matter particles, so what we call fermions,
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.520]   which are the matter particles,
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.560]   and bosons, which are force particles.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.760]   And if you have supersymmetry,
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.160]   then there is a super partner for every particle
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.560]   in the standard model.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.160]   And without going into the details,
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.640]   the effect of this basically is that
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.960]   you have a whole bunch of other fields,
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.400]   and these fields cancel out
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.320]   the effect of the standard model fields,
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.480]   and they stabilize the Higgs field
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.680]   at a nice, sensible value.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.040]   So in supersymmetry, you naturally,
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.560]   without any tinkering about
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.820]   with the constants of nature or anything,
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.040]   you get a Higgs field with a nice value,
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.600]   which is the one we see.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.840]   So this is one of the reasons,
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.120]   and supersymmetry's also got
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.280]   lots of other things going for it.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.000]   It predicts the existence of a dark matter particle,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.680]   which would be great.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.800]   It potentially suggests that the strong force
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.400]   and the electroweak force unify at high energy.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.440]   So lots of reasons people thought
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.000]   this was a productive idea.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.440]   And when the LHC was, just before it was turned on,
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.240]   there was a lot of hype, I guess,
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.080]   a lot of an expectation that we would discover
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.920]   these super partners, because,
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.720]   and particularly the main reason was
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.840]   that if supersymmetry stabilizes the Higgs field
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.600]   at this nice Goldilocks value,
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.400]   these super particles should have a mass
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.160]   around the energy that we're probing at the LHC,
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.560]   around the energy of the Higgs.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.160]   So it was kind of thought, you discover the Higgs,
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.240]   you probably discover super partners as well.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.800]   - So once you start creating ripples in this Higgs field,
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.280]   you should be able to see these kinds of,
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.120]   you should be, yeah.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.600]   - So these super fields would be there.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.920]   When at the very beginning I said,
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.560]   we're probing the vacuum, what I mean is really that,
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.280]   you know, okay, let's say these super fields exist.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.320]   The vacuum contains super fields, they're there,
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.760]   these supersymmetric fields.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.240]   If we hit them hard enough, we can make them vibrate.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.400]   We see super particles come flying out.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.920]   That's the sort of, that's the idea.
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:21.760]   - That's the hope, okay.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:22.600]   - That's the whole point.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.240]   - But we haven't.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.120]   - But we haven't.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.520]   So, so far at least, I mean, we've had now a decade
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.560]   of data taking at the LHC.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.360]   No signs of super partners have,
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.960]   supersymmetric particles have been found.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.760]   In fact, no signs of any physics,
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.120]   any new particles beyond the standard model have been found.
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.120]   So supersymmetry is not the only thing that can do this.
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.040]   There are other theories that involve
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.760]   additional dimensions of space
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.280]   or potentially involve the Higgs boson
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.000]   being made of smaller things, being made of other particles.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.080]   - Yeah, that's an interesting, you know,
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.160]   I haven't heard that before.
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.080]   That's really, that's an interesting point.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.200]   Could you maybe linger on that?
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.000]   Like what, what could be,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.480]   what could the Higgs particle be made of?
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.800]   - Well, so the oldest, I think the original ideas
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.640]   about this was these theories called technicolor,
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.920]   which were basically like an analogy with the strong force.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.040]   So the idea was the Higgs boson was a bound state
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.080]   of two very strongly interacting particles
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.160]   that were a bit like quarks.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.800]   So like quarks, but I guess higher energy things
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.000]   with a super strong force.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:25.840]   So not the strong force,
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.640]   but a new force that was very strong.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.120]   And the Higgs was a bound state of these objects.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.080]   And the Higgs would in principle, if that was right,
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:37.040]   would be the first in a series of technicolor particles.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.200]   Technicolor, I think, not being a theorist,
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.560]   but it's not, it's basically not done very well,
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.240]   particularly since the LHC found the Higgs,
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.000]   that kind of, it rules out, you know,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.120]   a lot of these technicolor theories.
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.080]   But there are other things that are a bit like technicolor.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:55.080]   So there's a theory called partial compositeness,
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.160]   which is an idea that some of my colleagues
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.960]   at Cambridge have worked on,
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.000]   which is a similar sort of idea
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.800]   that the Higgs is a bound state
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.040]   of some strongly interacting particles,
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.600]   and that the standard model particles themselves,
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.800]   the more exotic ones like the top quark,
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:15.080]   are also sort of mixtures of these composite particles.
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.920]   So it's a kind of an extension to the standard model,
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.640]   which explains this problem with the Higgs bosons,
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:25.360]   Goldilocks value, but also helps us understand,
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.440]   we're in a situation now, again,
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.080]   a bit like the periodic table,
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.560]   where we have six quarks, six leptons,
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.600]   in this kind of, you can arrange in this nice table,
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.080]   and you can see these columns where the patterns repeat,
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.320]   and you go, "Hmm, okay,
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.280]   "maybe there's something deeper going on here."
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.240]   And so this would potentially be something,
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.080]   this partial compositeness theory,
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.960]   could explain, sort of enlarge this picture
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.040]   that allows us to see the whole symmetrical pattern,
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.800]   and understand what the ingredients,
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.520]   why do we have, so one of the big questions
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.720]   in particle physics is,
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:00.800]   why are there three copies of the matter particles?
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.520]   So in what we call the first generation,
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:03.480]   which is what we're made of,
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.360]   there's the electron, the electron neutrino,
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.760]   the up quark and the down quark,
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.240]   they're the most common matter particles in the universe,
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.360]   but then there are copies of these four particles
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.960]   in the second and the third generations,
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.720]   so things like muons and top quarks and other stuff.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.960]   We don't know why.
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.040]   We see these patterns, we have no idea where it comes from,
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.480]   so that's another big question,
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.600]   can we find out the deeper order
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.840]   that explains this particular periodic table
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.000]   of particles that we see?
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.920]   - Is it possible that the deeper order
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.000]   includes almost a single entity?
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.560]   So like something that I guess like string theory
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:44.560]   dreams about, is this essentially the dream?
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.720]   Is to discover something simple, beautiful and unifying?
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.440]   - Yeah, I mean, that is the dream.
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:54.120]   And I think for some people, for a lot of people,
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.040]   it still is the dream.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.440]   So there's a great book by Steven Weinberg,
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.400]   who is one of the theoretical physicists
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.000]   who was instrumental in building the standard model.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.640]   So he came up with some others with the electroweak theory,
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.560]   the theory that unified electromagnetism
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.400]   and the weak force.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.320]   And he wrote this book,
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.720]   I think it was towards the end of the '80s, early '90s,
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.640]   called "Dreams of a Final Theory,"
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.520]   which is a very lovely, quite short book
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.800]   about this idea of a final unifying theory
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.160]   that brings everything together.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.040]   And I think you get a sense reading his book
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.360]   written at the end of the '80s, early '90s,
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.200]   that there was this feeling that such a theory was coming.
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.760]   And that was the time when string theory
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.800]   had been, was very exciting.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.280]   So string theory, there's been this thing
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.680]   called the super string revolution
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.680]   and theoretical physics getting very excited.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.560]   They discovered these theoretical objects,
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.040]   these little vibrating loops of string
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.080]   that in principle,
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.040]   not only was a quantum theory of gravity,
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.440]   but could explain all the particles in the standard model
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.320]   and bring it all together.
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:54.120]   And as you say, you have one object, the string,
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.720]   and you can pluck it.
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.440]   And the way it vibrates gives you these different notes,
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.560]   each of which is a different particle.
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.720]   So it's a very lovely idea.
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.240]   But the problem is that,
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.120]   well, there's a few people discover
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.280]   that mathematics is very difficult.
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.240]   So people have spent three decades or more
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.680]   trying to understand string theory.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.960]   And I think, you know,
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.120]   if you spoke to most string theorists,
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.240]   they would probably freely admit
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.520]   that no one really knows what string theory is yet.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.560]   I mean, there's been a lot of work,
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:21.920]   but it's not really understood.
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.840]   And the other problem is that string theory
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.640]   mostly makes predictions about physics
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.160]   that occurs energies far beyond
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.200]   what we will ever be able to probe in the laboratory.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.800]   Yeah, probably ever.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.240]   - By the way, so sorry,
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.440]   take a million tangents,
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.680]   but is there room for complete innovation
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.800]   of how to build a particle collider
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.320]   that could give us an order of magnitude increase
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.800]   in the kind of energies,
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.120]   or do we need to keep just increasing the size of things?
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.040]   - I mean, maybe, yeah.
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.520]   I mean, there are ideas,
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.520]   to give you a sense of the gulf that has to be bridged.
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:03.520]   So the LHC collides particles at an energy
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:08.040]   of what we call 14 tera electron volts.
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.640]   So that's basically the equivalent
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.800]   of you've accelerated a proton through 14 trillion volts.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.800]   That gets us to the energies where the Higgs
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.840]   and these weak particles live.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.080]   They're very massive.
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:22.400]   The scale where strings become manifest
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.920]   is something called the Planck scale,
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.600]   which I think is of the order 10 to the,
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.320]   hang on, get this right,
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.440]   it's 10 to the 18 giga electron volts.
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:35.440]   So about 10 to the 15 tera electron volts.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.000]   So you're talking, you know,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.400]   trillions of times more energy,
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.480]   more than- - Yeah, 10 to the 15,
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.400]   or 10 to the 14th larger.
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.480]   - I may be wrong, but it's of that order.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.320]   It's a very big number.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.040]   So, you know, we're not talking just an order
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.240]   of magnitude increase in energy.
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.240]   We're talking 14 orders of magnitude energy increase.
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.840]   So to give you a sense of what that would look like,
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.640]   were you to build a particle accelerator
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.400]   with today's technology-
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.120]   - Bigger or smaller than our solar system?
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.800]   - As the size of the galaxy.
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:04.680]   - The galaxy.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.120]   - So you'd need to put a particle accelerator
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.920]   that circled the Milky Way
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.040]   to get to the energies where you would see strings
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.280]   if they exist.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:15.040]   So that is a fundamental problem,
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.280]   which is that most of the predictions
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.080]   of these unified theories,
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.720]   quantum theories of gravity,
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.320]   only make statements that are testable
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.840]   at energies that we will not be able to probe.
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.880]   And barring some unbelievable, you know,
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.840]   completely unexpected technological
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.760]   or scientific breakthrough,
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.640]   which is almost impossible to imagine.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.480]   You never say never, but it seems very unlikely.
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.760]   - Yeah, I can just see the news story.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:43.520]   Elon Musk decides to build a particle collider
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.240]   the size of our-
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.080]   - It would have to be,
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.840]   we'd have to get together with all our galactic neighbors
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.080]   to pay for it, I think.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.400]   It'd be like CERN on mega steroids.
