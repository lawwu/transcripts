[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:20.800]   the Gospel according to St. John, in the first chapter, and reading verses 12 and 13.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:31.640]   But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:39.160]   them that believe on his name, which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.560]   flesh, nor of the will of men, but of God.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.320]   Now, we've been engaged on a number of Sunday mornings in looking at this great statement,
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:57.440]   having first of all looked at it as it were in general, and having emphasized the fact
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:05.480]   that the ultimate object and purpose of the Incarnation, the Word being made flesh, was
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:12.960]   that we who believe in him should be made the children or the sons of God.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.880]   We have gone on to consider how we may know exactly that this is true of us, that we are
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.600]   indeed the children of God.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.800]   Now, this is important as we've seen from many, many angles and standpoints.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.000]   If God sent his Son into the world in order that we might be made the children of God,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.400]   well then we must realize that.
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.280]   But to be a Christian is not merely to be a nice or a good or a moral man, not merely
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.880]   one who likes the teaching of Jesus as they put it and does his best to put it into practice.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.200]   That isn't a Christian.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.360]   A Christian is a man who is born again, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.240]   of the will of men, but of God.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.280]   The Son of God became the Son of men, as Calvin put it, in order that the sinful sons of men
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.880]   might be made the sons of God.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.920]   We take it that this gospel was written in order to remind the first Christians who were
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.040]   tending to forget that great and glorious fact that that is nevertheless their position
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.520]   as Christians.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.320]   These early Christians were derided and were persecuted and thereby were ever prone to
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.800]   become discouraged.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.000]   So these gospels and the New Testament epistles were written to them in order that they might
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.440]   realize what God had done for them in Christ.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:49.360]   And here is the supreme thing, that we are made the children of God to as many as received
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.360]   him.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:58.120]   He gave him power, authority, the right to become the children of God.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.520]   And therefore we have argued that nothing is more important in this life and in this
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.520]   world as that we should be absolutely certain that we are the children of God.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:15.020]   Unfortunately the New Testament provides us with an abundance of tests which we can apply
[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.280]   to ourselves.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.160]   The only Christian that is ultimately of any value in a world like this is the assured
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.160]   Christian.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:30.640]   Assurance of salvation has always been the mark of a live church, not some vague belief
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.480]   or some hopefulness that ultimately we may become Christians.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.400]   It is the men who have known that they have passed from death to life and that they are
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.560]   indeed the children of God.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.720]   Therefore we are applying these tests to ourselves and having looked at our relationship in particular
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.840]   to the Son, we have looked at our relationship to the Father, and at the moment we are engaged
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.240]   in examining our relationship to the Holy Spirit in order to make certain that we are
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.960]   the children of God.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.200]   Because the moment you become a child of God you are in this relationship with the triune
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.200]   God.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:15.600]   Now, in looking in particular at our relationship to the Spirit, we have seen that the first
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.040]   epistle of John in particular gives us very rich teaching on that relationship.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.160]   But it is not confined to that.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.200]   There is that mighty statement in Romans 8, verse 14, "As many as are led by the Spirit
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.920]   of God, they are the sons of God."
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.400]   They were led by the Spirit.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.920]   So having looked at our general relationship to the Spirit, we are now examining in this
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:48.440]   particular way the evidence that we can have within ourselves that we are being led by
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.440]   the Spirit.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:58.840]   And we have seen that when the Spirit does lead, certain things inevitably happen.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.040]   We have found that he leads to this word.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.400]   We have found that he leads to prayer, and to certain types of prayer.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:13.760]   And then we came on and said a fortnight ago that he also leads us in the matter of conduct
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.200]   and of behavior.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.360]   And that is the matter we are dealing with at the moment.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.120]   Now we have to give the whole of last Sunday morning to a very general point and principle
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.960]   with regard to this.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:34.480]   Because the moment you begin to talk about the leading of the Spirit in any sense, you
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:43.720]   are at once exposed to the danger of separating between the Spirit and the Word.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.680]   And we illustrated this last Sunday morning in the case of the Quakers, who have recently
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.920]   called attention to themselves in a certain pronouncement.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.200]   And what we were anxious to do was to show that this recent pronouncement of the Quakers
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.400]   on morals is not at all a surprising thing.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:09.640]   It is the inevitable outcome of their false division between the Spirit and the Word,
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.760]   their exaltation of the inner light over the objective Word of God.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:22.080]   There is nothing which is more dangerous than to separate the Spirit from the Word.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.400]   The Spirit guides through the Word.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.320]   That is his customary way of leading us.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.240]   It is he who has indicted the Word.
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:38.480]   It is he who moved and carried along the ancients, the prophets, and others who have given us
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.480]   these records.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:46.640]   The way men of God speak, as Peter puts it, is that they were moved or carried along by
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.640]   the holy Gods.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.160]   Prophecy is not of any private interpretation.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.080]   And the same applies, of course, to the New Testament scriptures.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.680]   The apostle Peter again tells us that the writings of the apostle Paul are scriptures.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.880]   And of course they are.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:06.680]   And the Church, led by the Spirit, formed the canon of the New Testament and added it
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.360]   to the canon of the Old Testament because they believed that this is indeed the Word
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.760]   of God and not the mere ideas and theories and imaginings of men.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:23.400]   There is nothing more fatal than to put a wedge between the Spirit and the Word and
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:28.240]   to say you do not need the Word, that you are now directly guided and motivated and
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.360]   moved by the Holy Spirit himself, by his inner light.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:38.040]   Well, now, that is a very, very grievous danger.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:43.160]   And we were able to look at its manifestation in this striking modern instance.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.800]   But of course this is not confined to the Quakers.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.720]   All people in the Church today who do not recognize the authority of the Word are in
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.080]   exactly the same position.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:59.640]   And Unitarians are not confined to that particular body that calls itself the Unitarian Church,
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.880]   unless there are Unitarians in every section of the Church.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:11.120]   And they fall into precisely that same error of judging everything by their own reason
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:17.680]   or their own intuition or their own insights rather than by the plain objective teaching
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.200]   of the Word of God.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.180]   Very well, we must leave that.
[00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:28.640]   And having now then established that all-important principle that we are to be guided in conduct
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.920]   and behavior in our view of morals and of everything else by the illumination of the
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:40.520]   Spirit upon the Word and not by modern ideas or modern developments or modern theories,
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:47.360]   we now come to the more practical aspect of this great subject.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:52.920]   Very well then, there are three general points, it seems to me, which we must further note
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:57.720]   before we come to the actual details.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.880]   And here are the three.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:08.800]   The first is that this test of our being guided in the matter of conduct and of behavior by
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:16.920]   the Spirit through the Word is one of the most practical tests of all.
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.760]   And that is why it is one of the most important tests.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:29.160]   There is no greater danger to the Christian than the danger of what is called antinomianism.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.760]   And antinomianism means this, of course, that now we are saved and we are eternally safe
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.480]   and saved, therefore it doesn't matter what I do.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.100]   That's antinomianism.
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:46.360]   That because I'm born again, because I'm no longer in Adam, because I'm no longer under
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:54.520]   the law, that it doesn't matter what I do, that I'm free to live as I like and as I please.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:10:02.040]   Now that's a terrible danger, a danger that is dealt with so often in the Scriptures themselves.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:08.920]   The Apostle Paul was always being charged by his adversaries as a teacher of antinomianism
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:13.960]   when he taught so powerfully about the Christian being dead to the law and delivered from the
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.600]   law and dead to sin and so on.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.720]   This was the charge they always brought against him.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.160]   What shall we say then?
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.360]   Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.920]   He has said, you see, that where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.160]   Very well, they said.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.960]   That means that conduct doesn't matter.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.000]   The more we sin, the more we shall experience grace.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.400]   Let us therefore sin that grace may abound.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.080]   God forbids us, the Apostle.
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.280]   It's unthinkable.
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:49.840]   It is indeed to misunderstand the whole of the teaching of justification by faith only
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:55.560]   and our incorporation into Christ and the Spirit coming to live and to dwell within
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.560]   us.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:01.560]   We are dead to sin and we must no longer walk therein.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:09.600]   Very well then, you see, this is a most important test.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.920]   That's why we don't like it.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.760]   We like to dwell in the realm of feelings and experiences.
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:21.040]   We are like the people depicted by our Lord who say, "Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.640]   in thy name?" and this, that and the other.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:32.200]   But my dear friend, I don't care what experience you've had, if it hasn't affected your daily
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.720]   life and living, your ethics, your morals.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.400]   It isn't an experience produced by the Holy Spirit.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.960]   You are not born of God unless there is a change in your whole outlook and attitude
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:52.700]   to conduct and behavior and unless it is manifesting itself practically.
[00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:56.240]   You are not being led by the Spirit.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:02.760]   You are being led by some false spirit, some evil spirit masquerading as a spirit of light
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.560]   and as the Spirit of God.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.400]   No, no, no.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.760]   These things are again indissolubly linked together.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:20.440]   As the Spirit and the Word are, so the new birth and a new conduct are indissolubly linked
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.000]   and bound.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.540]   Therefore, this test of conduct and of behavior is a very practical one.
[00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.840]   You may say, "I never have these exalted feelings that people talk about.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:32.840]   I don't know.
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.200]   These are thrilling, exciting experiences of the Spirit.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.760]   How can I tell whether I'm a Christian?"
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.680]   You can tell in this way.
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.680]   Has your whole outlook upon life and living changed?
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:51.600]   If it has, you have good presumptive evidence of the fact that you are a Christian.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.480]   But we'll come to that in detail.
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:13:00.480]   I'm simply laying down now this principle that there is no more grievous error than
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.200]   that of antinomianism.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.240]   The Christian life is essentially a practical life.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.640]   It isn't only a practical life.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.360]   That's the error of today.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.800]   But it is a practical life.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:17.300]   It's a life that starts in the realm of the Spirit, this new birth.
[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:23.800]   But it manifests itself in all the practical details of life.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:33.400]   Well, let's go on to our second principle, which is this one, that this practical outworking
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:41.400]   of the life of the Spirit, or life in the Spirit, is something which is constant and
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:47.880]   meant to be constant in the life and experience of the Christian.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:52.920]   As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:14:01.440]   Now, he says, as many as are constantly being led, as many as go on being led, it's the
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.280]   continuous.
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:09.400]   And I do want to emphasize this continuous aspect.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:13.480]   The Christian is not to be good by fits and starts.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.400]   He is not to be good only at certain times of the year.
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:24.960]   There is not a scrap of evidence in the whole of Scripture for the observance of Lent, none
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:25.960]   at all.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:32.480]   Indeed, I could very easily show you and demonstrate to you that it is diametrically opposed to
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:41.400]   the teaching of the Scripture, and is nothing but a human carnal tradition introduced by
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.400]   men.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:47.760]   Now, there is no need to go any further than that chapter which we read at the beginning,
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.760]   which puts it all so perfectly.
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:54.400]   There it was at the end of Colossians 2.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:01.280]   Let no man beguile you of your reward in some sort of voluntary humility and worshipping
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.560]   of angels, and so on.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:07.840]   But still more specifically, wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:13.840]   of the world, why, as thou living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances?
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:20.920]   Touch not, taste not, handle not, which all are to perish with the using, after the commandments
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:29.720]   and doctrines of men, which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will-worship, exercising
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:36.720]   your will-power and your discipline, and humility and neglecting of the body, not in any honour
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.640]   to the satisfying of the flesh.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.480]   Well there it is, you see, there is the whole thing dealt with.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.080]   It looks very wonderful.
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.680]   Show of wisdom, will-worship.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.680]   During this period of Lent I don't smoke, or I don't drink, or I don't do this, that,
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.680]   or the other.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.320]   And here it is, it is marvellous.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:58.800]   During this period I am denying myself.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:04.960]   The answer of the New Testament to that is this, that you are to do what the Spirit leads
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:09.240]   you to do always, always.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:15.040]   Not only at certain times of the year, not only certain periods in the calendar of some
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.360]   human-made organisation.
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:20.160]   No, no, this is to be constant.
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.480]   You are always led by the Spirit.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:28.520]   If it is right to deny yourself during Lent, it is right to deny yourself always.
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:33.400]   And that is the teaching of the New Testament.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:38.400]   And here again you see something which is very subtle.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.160]   That of course is a relic of Roman Catholicism.
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.160]   Lent comes from them.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.760]   It has been taken over.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.260]   It was started by them, it has been continued by them.
[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.760]   One can easily understand it in such an organisation.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.840]   It gives power to the priest and so on.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:17:02.240]   But there is, as I say, no evidence whatsoever in favour of it in the New Testament.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:07.560]   And it just leads to this show of wisdom and man's willpower.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:15.280]   It is man adding his works to the grace of God, which is essentially Roman Catholic teaching.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:19.720]   Grace of God plus what man does, what the Church does, and so on.
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.760]   Well, my friends, let's get rid of this.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.840]   Let's not waste our time with it.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.720]   We are to be led by the Spirit always.
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:34.840]   And my third general principle is this one, that the leading of the Spirit in this matter
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:38.720]   of conduct and of behaviour is never anything mechanical.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:42.960]   And this is a continuation, of course, of the last point.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:49.480]   What I mean by saying that it is not mechanical, it does not mean a conformity to an imposed
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:53.680]   number of rules and regulations.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:59.640]   This again is quite a subtle point, and it is a trap which has often ensnared many Christian
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.640]   people.
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:07.920]   It is always easier to live under a rigid law than it is to live in the freedom of the
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:13.040]   Holy Spirit and his guidance.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.480]   What we all pray for is this.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.040]   We say, "Now we have become Christians.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.040]   What am I to do?
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.040]   What am I not to do?"
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.160]   And we rather like people who have it for us.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:24.120]   One, two, three, drill sergeant Christianity, you might call it.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.400]   Of course, it is much easier.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:32.520]   You do not have any thinking, you do not know any tensions, but that is not New Testament.
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:39.400]   That is typical of this false asceticism which the Apostle is denouncing at the end of the
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:43.720]   second chapter of the epistle to the Colossians.
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.240]   No, the Spirit does not lead us like that.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:53.520]   He leads us in the more general manner which you see he goes on to put before us in chapter
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.520]   3.
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:19:00.240]   "If ye then be risen in Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.480]   on the right hand of God.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:06.560]   Set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth."
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:09.000]   Now there is your principle.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.960]   In other words, he says, "Realize what you are and who you are as the children of God.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:19.560]   Realize that you now belong to that heavenly realm, that our citizenship is in heaven,
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:20.560]   not upon earth."
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.480]   Very well, set your affections there.
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.680]   You do not just say, "Now what is this?
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.920]   What am I supposed to do here?
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.040]   What am I not to do there?"
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.920]   That is a Redirectner view of Christianity.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.880]   That is not the New Testament Christianity.
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.160]   "Oh no, but you say to yourself, 'What am I?
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:40.520]   I am born not of blood, not of the will of the flesh, not of will of man, but of God.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:44.200]   I am belonging to Christ and I am a co-heir with him.
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.240]   My home is there.'"
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:50.720]   So you begin to see it in that way and then you carry out the implications.
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:55.040]   You are dead, he says, and your life is head with Christ in God.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.880]   It is theological.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.160]   You see yourself in Christ.
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.200]   Not a matter of rules and regulations and tabulations.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.760]   "I have done this and I have not done that."
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.480]   No, no, that is all wrong.
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.480]   That is mechanical.
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.480]   That is human.
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:13.560]   That is an imposed morality.
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:18.680]   Then of course it is the delight of all institutional Christianity, but it knows nothing about the
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.820]   freedom of the spirit.
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:25.600]   It knows nothing of the position of the early Christian.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:32.880]   Very well, I say, instead of thus conforming to a pattern and having these mechanical notions
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:40.200]   of morality and ethics and conduct and behavior, he goes on to put it in more general terms.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:46.000]   "When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall he also appear with him in glory."
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.120]   See that is the difference in the outlook.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.960]   Not what am I to do now that I am a Christian.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:55.040]   Oh, I am a Christian and he is going to appear and I am going to see him and I am going to
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.040]   be made like him.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.720]   Very well, what do I do?
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:02.080]   "Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth," and so on.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:08.920]   He gives the details in order that we may see how inevitably the principle will work
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:14.960]   itself out in this way and manner.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:21.840]   Very well, let me summarize that third general principle by putting it like this.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:31.160]   If our conduct is not the outcome of our doctrine, if our behavior is not dictated to us by the
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:38.120]   fact that we realize who and what we are as the children of God and in Christ, then it
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:42.480]   is not New Testament ethics and morality.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.880]   It is philosophical morality.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.920]   It is men's morality.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:52.120]   This is always a deduction which one draws.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.720]   How often have we seen it?
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.720]   Here is the analysis of every New Testament epistle.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:01.800]   You start with your great doctrine, then he says, "Therefore," and if your conduct
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:09.440]   and behavior are not determined by this "therefore," which deduces it all from the doctrine, it
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.280]   is a false asceticism.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:19.640]   It is not the way the Holy Spirit leads the children of God in this matter of their daily
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.640]   conduct and behavior.
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:28.320]   Well, now then, there it seems to me are the general points which govern this all-important
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.800]   matter.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:34.480]   But come, let us go on to the details.
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:42.800]   And I go on to the details mainly for this reason, that what we are trying to do in this
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:48.920]   whole series of sermons is to give comfort to God's people.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:53.960]   What is in the forefront of my mind is not merely to inculcate a certain way of living,
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:58.200]   but to give people assurance of salvation.
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:03.000]   So as we come to the details, what I am concerned about is that we should examine ourselves
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.520]   in the light of them and say, "Well, that is true of me, and if that is true of me,
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:10.600]   I am being led by the Spirit of God."
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:16.680]   I may not have known great experiences, alas, but I do know this.
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.600]   Now, that is not a criticism of the great experiences.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:23.320]   We all ought to have them, and we all ought to seek them.
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.800]   It is possible to know God and to know Christ.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.720]   Do not stop short of that.
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:33.160]   But I say, you can be a Christian and know your way short of that.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:39.800]   So I am putting this before you, not that I may fall into the error I have been denouncing,
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:45.320]   but rather that I may encourage you, as you examine yourself, to find that you have got
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.320]   full assurance.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:49.320]   Well, what are these details?
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:58.120]   How may I know that the Holy Spirit is indeed leading me in this very practical way?
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:01.320]   Well, here is my first answer.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:11.200]   It is in the second chapter of the Epistle to the Philippians, in the statement in verses
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:19.520]   12 and 13, "Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:32.040]   only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:43.280]   For it is God which worketh in you both the will and the do of his good pleasure."
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.280]   What does that tell us?
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:47.880]   Well, what it tells us is this.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:56.120]   You, says the apostle, must work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:02.840]   And he says you do so because it is God who is working in you to work it out with fear
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:05.560]   and trembling.
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:09.000]   It is God that worketh in you both the will and to do.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   Well, very well, this becomes a very valuable test, doesn't it, in this way?
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:25.200]   The Christian is conscious of this fact that God is working in him, both the will and to
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.200]   do.
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.360]   It is the Holy Spirit who does that.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:35.440]   God works in us, in and through and by the Holy Spirit.
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:43.440]   And he works in us both to will, to desire, and to do.
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:49.840]   So this, to me, is a very wonderful and a very consoling test.
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:58.480]   We become conscious of his working within us.
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.480]   And I am going to add this.
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:04.840]   It is a very subtle and a very profound test to me.
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:09.080]   We are conscious not only that he is working in us, but we are conscious that he is working
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:15.560]   in us often against our own desire.
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:19.360]   He won't leave us alone.
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:29.040]   If I may adapt the words of George Matheson here, "Oh, love that wilt not let me go."
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:34.560]   There you are as a Christian, but you have been enticed by the world and its attractions,
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:39.120]   its way of living and way of thinking, and quite unconsciously.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.120]   You have been backsliding.
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.800]   You have been going back into that old life.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:47.140]   You didn't do anything very deliberately, but you have just been slipping and sliding.
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:48.600]   But you are back in it.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.320]   And there you are, you are beginning to enjoy it again.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:56.000]   And you think it is rather wonderful and very clever.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.120]   And then you are suddenly disturbed.
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.480]   You are pulled up.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.800]   You feel it is wrong, and you don't like this feeling.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:05.800]   It is disturbing you.
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.440]   You want to go on enjoying it.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.440]   You say, "Of course, I am a Christian.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.800]   I believed in Christ at that particular point, and I became a member of a church."
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:16.800]   But the Spirit says, "No, you be careful."
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.200]   Can you as a true Christian go on doing this?
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:26.200]   That is the Spirit of God working within us, both to will and to do.
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.760]   You see, he addresses us, and he disturbs us.
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.080]   He pulls us up.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.080]   He upbraids us.
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.080]   He condemns us.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.440]   He makes us feel guilty.
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:36.680]   And he says, "Now, this is what you ought to be doing."
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.880]   And he reminds you of your Christian duties, which you have been neglecting.
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:40.880]   You have stopped reading the Word.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.880]   You have stopped praying.
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.120]   You have stopped attending the house of God.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.120]   He brings you back.
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.120]   He disturbs you.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.760]   He is the God that works within you, both to will and to do.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.640]   And you are rebellious, and you are fighting.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:59.520]   But my dear friend, in all that, you are having an absolute proof that you are a Christian.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:04.600]   You are not dead in trespasses and sins, if that is true of you.
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:08.080]   The man who is not a believer, who is not born again, he does not know this.
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:13.920]   He may get what is called twinges of conscience, but that is an entirely different thing.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.120]   That is just a man looking at his own standard.
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:21.920]   Here it is the pressure of the Spirit within, and the very definite activity of the Spirit.
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:23.560]   And you try and get away from him.
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:27.480]   You go out with your friends, or you shut your books, and you try and listen to this
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.960]   or that, but he will not let you.
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:34.000]   It is God that worketh in you, pulling you back, disturbing you, sending some sort of
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:42.900]   Nathan the prophet to you as he sent him to David, and making him put questions to you.
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:52.360]   It is God that worketh in us, both to will and to do.
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:56.120]   Do you know the working of God in you?
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:00.800]   You find now that you are not allowed to sin with impunity?
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:06.720]   Do you find that you are not allowed to enjoy a sinful life and an unworthy life?
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:13.340]   Are you constantly being pulled up and upbraided and condemned and convicted?
[00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:17.020]   That is a sign that you are being led by the Spirit.
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:20.000]   He does it in the matter of willing and of desiring.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.580]   He does it in the matter of doing.
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:23.940]   He provides the desire.
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:24.940]   He gives the energy.
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:26.420]   It is all from him.
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:27.420]   He works in us.
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:28.820]   That is why we are able to work it out.
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:29.820]   We could not otherwise.
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:31.500]   We would have no strength.
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:35.180]   But being born, not of blood, not of the will of the flesh, not of the will of man, but
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:40.340]   of God, we have got the Spirit in us, and there is energy.
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:48.300]   And he works within us, both to will and to do, of his good pleasure.
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:54.820]   Well I leave it at that, but it is to me not only a very wonderful thing, but a very comforting
[00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:58.580]   and a very consoling thing.
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:01.820]   Don't come to a second, which is this.
[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:04.260]   The Spirit always leads us to self-examination.
[00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:05.260]   Self-examination.
[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:17.340]   And again observe, I say, not only during Lent, but the whole year.
[00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:20.460]   Not because we have arrived at a certain date.
[00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:24.580]   You cannot reconcile that kind of thing with the freedom and liberty of the Spirit in the
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:25.580]   New Testament.
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:28.580]   It is utterly incompatible.
[00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:36.300]   And that is how we fool ourselves.
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:41.820]   We who do it on January 1st are equally guilty, remember.
[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:44.260]   This is out of the realm of calendars altogether.
[00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:52.620]   This is the operation of the Spirit, the leading of the Spirit.
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:31:00.820]   Now I say the Spirit always leads us to self-examination.
[00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:01.820]   What does that mean?
[00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:04.500]   It means this.
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:12.860]   That whosoever is led by the Spirit is never glib, never feels that he or she is complete,
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:16.460]   because you say, "I have believed in Christ."
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:23.620]   Never feels that everything has been done, and that all I do now is to rest on my oars,
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:27.340]   and I need have no troubles.
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:30.380]   That is inconceivable under the leading of the Spirit.
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:31.380]   Why?
[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:35.900]   Well, for this reason.
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:40.540]   That the Spirit's function is to bring us into conformity to the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:43.540]   the Son of God.
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:53.420]   His work is to carry out this injunction, "Be ye holy, for I am holy, saith the Lord."
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:59.580]   You see, it is at this point the Spirit safeguards us from an easy believism, and the notion
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:05.140]   that as long as I say I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, I am a Christian.
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.760]   But you are not.
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:09.380]   The devils believe and tremble.
[00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:13.420]   Many people have said that they believe, but their lives have denied it, having the form
[00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:16.940]   of godliness, but denying the power of the love.
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:23.860]   The New Testament is full of warnings against what were once called false professors, men
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:29.260]   and women who make a profession of Christianity, but who clearly are not Christians.
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:33.540]   Our Lord constantly warned people against that.
[00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:41.580]   The New Testament epistles are equally full of these same serious, solemn warnings.
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:45.780]   And any man who is led by the Spirit is afraid of that.
[00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:48.500]   He is aware of the danger.
[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:52.860]   And therefore I say he is never glib, he is never self-satisfied, and above all, he is
[00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:55.980]   never superficial.
[00:32:55.980 --> 00:33:02.820]   Now here you see the great dividing line as between the cults and a kind of cultic Christianity
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:06.140]   and New Testament Christianity.
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:09.700]   The cults give it you all in one act.
[00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:11.660]   So simple, there is nothing in it.
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:14.260]   Do this, there you are.
[00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:15.260]   Penny in the slot.
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:18.180]   You have got your full blessing, everything you want.
[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:23.860]   That is the characteristic always of the cults and of Christianity that is cultic rather
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:27.340]   than New Testament.
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:33.820]   Because the New Testament Christianity is that which is always based upon the leading
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:40.740]   of the Spirit, and he is a person, and he is the Holy Spirit.
[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:47.660]   And in his presence the best man feels that he is vile, and that he is unworthy, and that
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:49.700]   he is sinful.
[00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:53.140]   The other man feels as long as he is signed on the dotted line, it is all done, you are
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:54.140]   all right, you are in.
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:59.980]   No, no, says this man, this is a new birth, I have got new life.
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:00.980]   Am I aware of it?
[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:03.980]   Am I sure of it?
[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:07.020]   "Prove your own selves," says the New Testament.
[00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:12.740]   "Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith," writes the Apostle Paul to the church
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:13.740]   at Corinth.
[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:16.980]   You will find it in the last chapter of his second epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:22.900]   "Prove yourselves, examine your own selves, make certain that you are in the faith."
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.780]   Peter says exactly the same thing.
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:28.020]   "Make your calling and election sure," he says.
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:32.140]   "Don't live on assumptions, don't be glib, don't be superficial, don't feel
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:34.060]   it is all finished.
[00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:39.980]   Oh, just realize what you are as a child of God, and the moment you do and begin to examine
[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:43.820]   yourself you will be dissatisfied.
[00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:51.380]   You will feel, 'This is not right, this is not enough, this is unworthy.'"
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:55.860]   The Spirit always leads us along that line.
[00:34:55.860 --> 00:35:02.360]   You will find, if you trouble to read the literature, that the greatest saints have
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.460]   always spent time in self-examination.
[00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:10.380]   Indeed, we can say this about them, that their greatest danger was to overdo that and to
[00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:13.120]   become introspective and morbid.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:17.740]   But that is a much better danger, if I may so put it, than the danger of glibness and
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:24.140]   superficiality, the danger that does not even realize the possibility of being false.
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:31.260]   "Make your calling and election sure," therefore you examine yourself, you prove
[00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:32.260]   your own self.
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:40.100]   It is in the Word, it is in the life and the practice of the most notable instances of
[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:45.860]   true Christianity exemplified in the lives of the saints.
[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:46.860]   Well I leave it at that.
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:49.640]   I say this, if you like, let's look at it like this.
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:53.980]   If you don't know what it is to be afraid that you may be a Laodicean, I don't think
[00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:58.820]   you are a Christian.
[00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:04.140]   No man can read that letter to the church of the Laodiceans with the Spirit leading
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:09.300]   him and guiding him without having a certain amount of fear.
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:13.060]   These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation
[00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:14.060]   of God.
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:19.580]   "I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot."
[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:23.700]   In other words, you are just respectable and nothing else.
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:31.340]   You don't like being hot nor cold, you like being balanced and dignified and decent and
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:32.340]   polite.
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:40.420]   "I would that thou wert cold or hot, so then because thou art lukewarm and neither
[00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:45.100]   cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth.
[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:50.500]   Because thou sayest, 'I am rich and increased with goods and of need of nothing,'" this
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:57.980]   is all spiritual, "and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:58.980]   and naked."
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:07.240]   The man who doesn't realize that that's his condition is in a bad case.
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:08.940]   But you say, "We are not all in that condition."
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:11.380]   All I am saying is this.
[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:15.100]   Are you never afraid that you are in that condition?
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:19.740]   Or are you one of these people who says, "I am rich and increased with goods."
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:22.340]   I have never had a doubt since I became a Christian.
[00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.060]   I have never had any trouble at all.
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:25.060]   I know.
[00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:32.780]   Don't you ever have any fear about yourself?
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:38.460]   This is what, listen, "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
[00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:40.180]   churches."
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:44.540]   And the Spirit comes to us and He says, "Look here, are you Laodicean?
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:48.940]   Are you quite sure you are not resting on your oars and are not self-satisfied in this
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:51.460]   bed sense?"
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.780]   It's a very good test, my friend.
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:56.220]   The Spirit searches.
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:38:01.340]   He searches the deep things of God and He searches the depths of our being and personality.
[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:05.280]   And the man who is led by Him is the man who gives Him time to do that.
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.420]   And He will hold these things before you.
[00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:10.660]   And there may be times when He will almost make you feel that you are not a Christian
[00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:12.700]   at all.
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:18.020]   But you will know that you are because when you feel the utter uncleanness and condemnation,
[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:24.860]   you know that the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, still cleanseth from all sin and unrighteousness.
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:31.180]   And you don't lie down in utter condemnation and final despair and hopelessness.
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:37.260]   But He does lead to self-examination and it is an unmistakable sign of His leading.
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:44.020]   I say examine yourself very carefully unless you've ever, if you've never been disturbed
[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:49.420]   about yourself and have had a fear lest you be a Laodicean.
[00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:53.340]   But let me go on.
[00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:58.300]   Over and above leading us to self-examination, He leads to this, and this is the positive
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:02.780]   side of it.
[00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:08.020]   Breathings after holiness.
[00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:11.020]   Breathings after holiness.
[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:15.860]   It is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do.
[00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:19.940]   Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:21.860]   Don't forget that fear and trembling.
[00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:22.860]   That's it.
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.220]   That's where self-examination comes in.
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:25.780]   It will lead to fear and trembling.
[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:31.640]   Do the whole thing, says Paul, in fear and trembling.
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.660]   So you have breathings after holiness.
[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:46.500]   Or let me use other terminology, a longing for heart purity, a longing to be pure in
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:47.500]   heart.
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:54.380]   Now this is inevitable if we are led by the Holy Spirit.
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:57.980]   David knew something about it.
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:05.500]   Create within me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:10.260]   You see, he's not stopping with his particular sins any longer.
[00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:11.260]   The Christian doesn't.
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:12.260]   Your moral man knows that.
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:13.260]   He says, "I was a fool.
[00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:15.300]   I shouldn't have done that."
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.300]   But he stops there.
[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:18.620]   "I'm going to be better," he says, "and no more."
[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:19.620]   But the Christian doesn't.
[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:27.420]   The man who knows the Spirit of God, he says, "Create within me a clean heart, O God, and
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:29.420]   renew a right spirit within me.
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:35.380]   Give me a heart," he says, "that trembles at the approach of sin."
[00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:43.180]   Or you may prefer it in the language of the Apostle Paul in Romans 7, "O wretched man
[00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:50.180]   that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"
[00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:53.300]   A man who has never known that feeling is not a Christian.
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:56.620]   It's impossible.
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:02.660]   The Holy Spirit must make us feel that at some time or another.
[00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:03.660]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:05.580]   I don't say you should feel like that always.
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:08.460]   I don't believe that's a true interpretation of Romans 7.
[00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:13.180]   But what I do know is that if a man has never felt that to some degree, some time or another,
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:14.180]   he's not a Christian.
[00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:20.220]   If you have known that final despair about yourself and have said in me that it is to
[00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:27.900]   say, "My flesh dwelleth no good thing, O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:28.900]   me?"
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:32.900]   Breathings and longings after holiness.
[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:40.420]   Oh, our Lord has said it all, hasn't he?
[00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:42.340]   Who are the people who are blessed?
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:53.700]   Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.
[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:55.940]   Yes, that's it.
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:42:03.940]   The hungering and the thirsting, not after happiness, but after righteousness.
[00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:07.380]   The feeling that though you're a member of a church, though you believed in Christ, though
[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:09.440]   you're born again, that it isn't enough.
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:10.620]   You want to be righteous.
[00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:11.620]   You want to be holy.
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:18.420]   The Holy Spirit leads ever to that desire and in that direction.
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:24.020]   He never allows us to rest upon our oars and to feel that that decision was everything,
[00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:25.660]   or that since I said I believe.
[00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:26.660]   No, no.
[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:32.140]   He, when he works within us and he works in every Christian, he creates a great hunger
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:33.140]   after it.
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:35.260]   Oh, that I were more like him.
[00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:38.820]   Oh, that I were more like the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:43.220]   Oh, that I were righteous through and through.
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:44.340]   He makes you hunger.
[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:47.740]   He makes you thirst after it.
[00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:55.660]   Oh, for a heart to praise my God.
[00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:59.860]   A heart from sin set free.
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:06.220]   A heart that always feels the blood so freely shed for me.
[00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:14.740]   Well, I'll sum up this test again by putting it like this.
[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:23.620]   If you've got a greater desire to be holy than to be happy, you, my dear friend, are
[00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:28.300]   being led by the Spirit of God.
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:31.740]   It's a wonderful test.
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:40.260]   Your desire for holiness is greater than your desire for happiness.
[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:45.340]   Is it?
[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:46.340]   Can you say that?
[00:43:46.340 --> 00:44:01.060]   Can you say, "I don't care what happens to me, as long as it makes me more holy"?
[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:08.940]   The moment you can say that holiness is to you more important than happiness, you are
[00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:13.700]   a child of God and you are being led by the Spirit.
[00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:18.540]   Because you will know that whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth.
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:23.720]   And you will even thank God for chastisements, whatever form it may take, because you, looking
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:30.140]   back upon it, will say with a psalmist in Psalm 119, "It was good for me that I was
[00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:34.220]   afflicted, because before I was afflicted I went astray.
[00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:37.940]   It was good for me that I suffered illness, accident, loss.
[00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:47.740]   It made a better man of me, and I'd sooner be holy than be happy.
[00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:58.740]   Even though it be a cross that leadeth me nearer my God to thee."
[00:44:58.740 --> 00:44:59.740]   That's the test.
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:00.740]   That's the infallible test.
[00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:12.140]   "Nearer my God to thee, nearer to thee, even though it be a cross that leadeth or
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:19.420]   guideth me, still in my dreams I'd be nearer to thee."
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:20.420]   Whatever it is.
[00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:24.820]   Very well, my friends, let us apply these things.
[00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:30.340]   The last word I say on it this morning is this, and it follows, of course, each one
[00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:37.180]   of these leads to the next, an increasing sensitiveness, or sensitivity if you prefer
[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:44.020]   it, to temptation and to the very approach of sin.
[00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:51.900]   There it is, the cry for that heart that trembles at the very approach of sin.
[00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:58.220]   You're not only grieved by sin when you've committed it, but you're grieved because
[00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:00.020]   of the very approach of it.
[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:04.380]   "Ye that love the Lord hate evil."
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:08.940]   Doesn't it worry you that you don't hate evil as you should?
[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:12.220]   Doesn't it worry you that you still like things that you shouldn't, and that you can still
[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:17.820]   be appealed to and attracted by things that are unclean in this modern world of ours?
[00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:18.820]   Doesn't that worry you?
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:20.580]   If it does, it's the Spirit.
[00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:25.340]   If it doesn't, you haven't got the Spirit.
[00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:33.020]   Trembles at the approach of sin, and doesn't wait to be grieved until it's embraced it
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:36.340]   and has been defeated by it.
[00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:40.980]   Any man who can say that he's increasingly sensitive to the enticements, the attractions,
[00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:46.340]   the approach, the first moves of sin, is a man who's filled with the Spirit, he's being
[00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:50.260]   led by the Spirit, the Spirit's sensitive.
[00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:57.980]   And he above all detects it at its merest suggestion, at its first glimmering.
[00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:00.940]   Well, we leave it at that for this morning.
[00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:03.780]   God willing, we'll have to go on with this.
[00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:09.700]   But as I'm trying to show and to say, what we should be concerned about is this, is not
[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:15.900]   so much the details as our whole approach and attitude.
[00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:25.100]   Are we finding in all this evidences and proofs of the fact that we are indeed the children
[00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:35.140]   of God, born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of men, but
[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:37.500]   of God?
[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:39.460]   Amen.
[00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:43.380]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
