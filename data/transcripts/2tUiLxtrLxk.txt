[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500]   The following is a conversation with Rick Doblin,
[00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.640]   founder and executive director
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.920]   of the Multidisciplinary Association
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.740]   for Psychedelic Studies, MAPS.
[00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.520]   He is one of the seminal figures
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.960]   in both the cultural history
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.480]   and the cutting edge science of psychedelics.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.360]   He was there along with the biggest characters
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.800]   throughout this fascinating history of psychedelics,
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.680]   and he is here to tell the story.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.400]   Quick mention of our sponsors,
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.680]   Theragun, ExpressVPN, Blinkist, and Asleep.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.240]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.280]   As a side note, let me say that exploring the places
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.080]   the human mind can go can help us understand
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.200]   where it comes from, how it works,
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.660]   and how to engineer mental journeys,
[00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   whether that's through life experiences,
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.120]   chemical substances, brain-computer interfaces,
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.800]   or interactions with artificial intelligence systems.
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.160]   On a personal level, I think the dissolution of the ego
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.120]   for stretches of time is a powerful tool
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.040]   for understanding yourself.
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.680]   A lot of things can do this,
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.760]   including jiu-jitsu, literature, meditation,
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.680]   but psychedelics is definitely,
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.260]   or at least arguably, one of the most powerful,
[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.680]   from psilocybin to DMT.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.480]   I'm excited that people like Rick
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.360]   are leading the scientific research
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.820]   that reveals the efficacy and the safety of these substances
[00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.360]   so that their proper dosage and usage protocols
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.680]   can be understood, and people like me
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.180]   can safely and effectively use them,
[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.680]   not just for recreation,
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.560]   but for rigorous exploration of my own mind.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.560]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.800]   and here is my conversation with Rick Doblin.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.720]   Could you give an introduction to psychedelics,
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.160]   like a big, bold, whirlwind overview?
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.880]   What are psychedelics?
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.600]   What are the kinds of psychedelics out there,
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.900]   in whatever way you think is meaningful?
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.000]   - All right, well, when I started MAPS,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.760]   the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies,
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.040]   it was very important for me that psychedelic be in the name,
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.720]   and the way in which the original meaning of psychedelic,
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.640]   it's mind manifesting.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.480]   It was created by Humphrey Osmond
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.120]   in dialogue with Elotus Huxley,
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.400]   and so psychedelic means mind manifesting,
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.440]   and so we interpret that very broadly
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.600]   to mean dreams are psychedelic,
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.520]   anything that kind of brings things to the surface,
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.140]   holotropic breathwork, hyperventilation is psychedelic.
[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.560]   So most people think psychedelic
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.920]   is only about certain kind of chemical substances,
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.240]   either natural or synthetic,
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.920]   but we've got a much broader view of that.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.500]   Meditation can be psychedelic in some ways,
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.120]   but our primary focus is on the drugs,
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.120]   is on the medicines, or the, you might call them,
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.740]   some people might call them spiritual tools or sacraments.
[00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.480]   There's sort of two general categories of those.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.160]   One are what are called the classic psychedelics,
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.200]   and those are the ego-dissolving,
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.160]   sort of merged into unitive states.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.200]   Those are like LSD, psilocybin, mescaline,
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.120]   ayahuasca, ibogaine, DMT, things like that,
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.760]   and then there's MDMA,
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.840]   which some people even argue is not a psychedelic.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.480]   They'll say it's an empathogen or an antactogen,
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.960]   it's about touching within or empathy.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.680]   It doesn't do the same kind of ego dissolution
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.000]   that the classic psychedelics do,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.620]   but it brings material to the surface,
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.940]   and it changes the way we process information.
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:48.640]   And so I think you can quibble about whether it's a,
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.440]   it's certainly not a classic psychedelic,
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.640]   but I think MDMA is also a psychedelic.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.740]   Marijuana, I would say, is a psychedelic.
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.200]   Marijuana is closer to the classic psychedelics
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.000]   than it is to MDMA.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.080]   One point I like to make is dreams,
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.520]   because then everybody can relate to that.
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.520]   Dreams are psychedelic.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.520]   Dreams bring emotions, feelings, ideas, concepts,
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.440]   in symbolic form a lot of times,
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.400]   or just in raw emotions to the surface.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.060]   So when people hear the word psychedelic,
[00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.080]   often they are frightened by it.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.000]   It's about loss of control,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.160]   and it is to an extent loss of conscious control,
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.840]   particularly with the classic psychedelics.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.040]   But, you know, and we know with dreams
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.520]   that we can have frightening dreams, nightmares,
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.980]   but I think that anchoring the concept
[00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.120]   of psychedelic in dreams is really helpful
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.420]   for people to know that it's kind of a natural state,
[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.300]   and that there are other ways that you can catalyze it
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.640]   than by going to sleep,
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.660]   and that for thousands of years,
[00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.160]   substances have been used in that way.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.120]   - So you mentioned this idea
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.120]   of bringing something to the surface,
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.520]   which is really interesting.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.640]   So can you maybe elaborate the surface,
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.880]   and what is there in the depths of things,
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.880]   and how does ego dissolution fit into that?
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.460]   - Well, Aldous Huxley talked about the brain
[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.260]   as a reducing valve,
[00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.120]   that we have an enormous amount of information.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.240]   So right now, there's an air conditioning sound
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.880]   in the background,
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.340]   but that's not crucial to what you and I are doing,
[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.080]   talking to each other, so we kind of tune that out.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.800]   You know, there's all sorts of sights and sounds.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.160]   There's incoming information
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.080]   in all the different sense modalities,
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.080]   and we have to figure out what's important to us.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.220]   And so the mind, in a way,
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.220]   focuses a lot on what are our core needs,
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.420]   and we filter all the incoming information
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.860]   that we get towards focusing on what our core needs,
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.580]   and we can even get to Abraham Maslow
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.580]   and the hierarchy of needs about survival needs,
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.720]   belonging needs, esteem needs, you can go on.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.720]   So I think what I mean by bringing things to the surface
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.860]   is that we tend to not focus on a lot of things
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.980]   that are coming,
[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.020]   but we also push away things
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.180]   that are difficult emotionally,
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.480]   difficult cognitively.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.720]   You know, we all know that we're on this very short
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.360]   trajectory from birth to death,
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.880]   but we're not constantly thinking about dying,
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.480]   although that can actually be helpful,
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.920]   to focus us on what's really important.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.980]   Traumas are often suppressed,
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.360]   conflicts.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.440]   We see in America and around the world
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.600]   a kind of rise of irrationality
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:56.240]   where people push away their logic
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.160]   in order for their emotional tribal needs to be met.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.840]   A lot of people are suffering from early childhood traumas
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:05.720]   of a different kinds,
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.000]   or abandonment issues, or anything.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.840]   So we tend to focus on just what we need to survive
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.880]   and what we need for work and esteem.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.520]   And so psychedelics,
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.540]   by dissolving this ego control,
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:23.360]   or by with MDMA kind of strengthening our sense of self
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.920]   and our sense of self-acceptance,
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.700]   we can bring in other information
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.360]   that have previously been too complicated or too painful.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.760]   - You don't think of psychedelics
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.500]   as conjuring up something new.
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.680]   It is more revealing something that is already there.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.580]   - I think that's a very crucial thing.
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.340]   So yes,
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.400]   Sasha Shulgin,
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.480]   who sort of the godfather of MDMA,
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:55.760]   he sort of rediscovered it and brought it back into use.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:01.240]   He talked about his first experience was with mescaline.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.360]   His first psychedelic experience was with mescaline.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.000]   And he had a tremendous experience,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.240]   but what he said about it was
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.320]   he was having a human experience
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.820]   that the mescaline was helping him access
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:17.760]   rather than he was having a mescaline experience.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.660]   So that it's not like you pop a pill
[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.640]   and you always have the same kind of experience
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.560]   as everybody else.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.760]   The experience is not contained in the pill.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.360]   The pill opens you up
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.440]   and you have an experience of yourself.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.840]   Sometimes these are experiences
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.600]   that we've never consciously had.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.400]   But we can say right now that we know
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.760]   that our body below the level of our conscious awareness
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.560]   has all these self-healing mechanisms.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.520]   And we don't modulate them
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.640]   to a large extent by conscious control.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.420]   I mean, eventually we are learning more about the mind-body
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.080]   and we learn about the placebo effect,
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.280]   how what we think is the case.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.760]   But I think that there's experiences
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.660]   that are below our level of conscious awareness,
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.040]   particularly once we're adults,
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.700]   that are more of these unit of mystical experiences,
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.160]   sense of connection.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.680]   I think kids are like this a lot.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.680]   We kind of come from the void, you could say,
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.040]   and you're born and you have
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.840]   a different way of processing information.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.280]   One interesting point about that has to do with ketamine,
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.520]   which is been approved as ketamine for depression,
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.400]   but it's used for anesthesia.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:29.760]   And roughly one-tenth the anesthetic dose
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.800]   is a psychedelic dose.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.320]   And when it's used in anesthesia,
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.480]   there's what's called the emergent phenomena.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.360]   So this is you get enough ketamine for,
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.320]   you can be operated on, you're not in pain,
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.820]   you're not really there, your ego's knocked out,
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.580]   but you can still breathe.
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.220]   But as the operations get over
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.960]   and then people metabolize the ketamine,
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.760]   there's a process that they call the emergent phenomena.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.820]   It's like as you're emerging from this tranquilized state,
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.980]   and that's where you pass through the psychedelic phase.
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.480]   And they don't prepare people for that.
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.980]   And what we see is that a lot of adults
[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.160]   have difficult times with that.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.080]   But children don't seem to have those problems.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.000]   Children are a little bit more already
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.920]   in this kind of state.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.840]   And so ketamine is used quite frequently
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.080]   in children now for anesthesia.
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.560]   So all of that is to say to your question
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.840]   that I think the psychedelics reveal things
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.140]   that are within us.
[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:32.760]   Some things that are how we process information
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.960]   back when we were children.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.920]   Other things that we've never thought of before
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.980]   that are sort of baked into our consciousness.
[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:46.120]   You know, there's one drug 5-MEO-DMT.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.900]   It's this toxin from a Sonoran toad
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.160]   that many people consider it to be the most powerful
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.000]   of all the psychedelics.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.120]   And it kind of knocks the ego structures
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.620]   completely out of it.
[00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:01.480]   And we experience something different,
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.720]   but it's something I think that's always within us.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.760]   It's at a deeper layer.
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.240]   So we knock out some of the higher cognitive functions
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.200]   and then we experience things in a different way.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.040]   So my sense is that these are human experiences
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.040]   that the psychedelics bring us to.
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.440]   - Yeah, it's really profound.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.920]   And DMT is a really interesting example.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:23.520]   So Terence McKenna has talked about these machine elves.
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.360]   Right?
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:28.800]   And there's this, I think from the people I've heard speak
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.940]   about the experience, there's a sense
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:35.440]   that you are traveling elsewhere to meet entities,
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.040]   whether they're elves or not.
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.600]   So in your sense, you're not traveling elsewhere.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.720]   You're just revealing something that's within
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.680]   and maybe it's a particular mechanism
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.180]   of revealing what's already within.
[00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.600]   - Yeah, and I knew Terence.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.360]   I spent a lot of time talking with Terence
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:58.160]   and I do not ascribe to a lot of things that he was saying.
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.120]   He was tremendous entertainer
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.880]   and I think he did a lot of really good things
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.920]   and focused us on the power of psychedelics.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.180]   But I think I've never seen these quote machine elves.
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:14.120]   I think culture is more determinative
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.220]   of what people experience under psychedelics,
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:22.080]   your preconceptions, than we give it credit for.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.880]   And so I think there's a lot of priming that you could say
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.520]   that people receive by stories from their culture,
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:36.980]   with ayahuasca, it's about jaguars and Amazonian animals.
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.800]   And so I think these machine elves
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:44.800]   are this construct of Terence that other people do see.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:50.540]   There's actually some people that are very interested
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:54.240]   in doing a study and that they're well-funded
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:59.240]   and moving toward it to keep people on an IV infusion of DMT
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.600]   for them specifically to see,
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.480]   do they contact machine elves or aliens
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.480]   and what kind of information do they bring back
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:12.280]   from these other selves, other places or other entities?
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:16.520]   One question is, who are we?
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:20.500]   Are we connected to everything in the universe?
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.080]   We certainly know in many cases,
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.160]   you talk about waves or particles, the quantum approach.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:32.160]   So I don't interpret experiences that we have
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.480]   of some entity that's somehow or other
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.480]   deep in our consciousness that's not us.
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.660]   It's a part of who we are.
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.480]   So I tend to interpret it in that way.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:47.040]   - The question is, how big are we?
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:47.880]   - Yeah.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:52.880]   - I mean, that's, and how many ideas are within us
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:56.140]   that can be revealed by changing the perspective?
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:57.760]   You mentioned physics.
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.160]   One of the, what physicists,
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.200]   especially mathematical physicists or mathematicians do
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:08.740]   is they reveal truths by looking at a,
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:12.480]   by taking a slightly different perspective on a problem
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:17.240]   that reveals the simplicity of how it actually works
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.780]   in totally new ways.
[00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:19.840]   That's what Einstein did.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:23.200]   That's what, like every progress in physics
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.600]   and certainly every progress in mathematics
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.000]   requires you to take a different perspective.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.540]   And then perhaps that's exactly what psychedelics are doing.
[00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:36.840]   It's not that they're contacting aliens that are elsewhere.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.280]   It may be revealing the connection between us
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.260]   and other living life forms,
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.360]   or actually it might be revealing
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:47.280]   a totally new perspective on what life is
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.780]   or what consciousness is and giving us a glimpse at that,
[00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:53.920]   even though our cognitive capabilities are limited
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.040]   to fully grasp and understand it.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.480]   So it's just giving us an inkling of that somehow.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.080]   And it seems perhaps a little ridiculous,
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.520]   not from a scientific perspective,
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.620]   in the sense that we don't have a good physics of life
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.900]   or physics of intelligence or physics of consciousness,
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:13.600]   but getting a glimpse of that is giving us a little bit of,
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:18.560]   maybe an intuition of which way to head
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.740]   to build such a physics.
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.560]   - Yeah, yeah, I think so.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:28.560]   I think that there's this other concept
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.720]   I guess I would like to talk about briefly,
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.560]   this Jungian collective unconscious,
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.560]   this idea that somehow or other
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:40.260]   everything that has ever happened is still accessible,
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:45.260]   maybe not with as much data or as much resolution,
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:49.740]   but that there's wave resonances.
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:54.740]   So that I do believe that we can have experiences
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.280]   as part of this human collective unconscious
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.100]   that we're not from our own life.
[00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:01.940]   - Yeah.
[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:06.220]   - And that we can, like the holographic realities,
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:10.780]   and that there is a way to gather information
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.620]   that can be accurate about other times and places
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:20.020]   through depth investigations of our own consciousness.
[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.580]   But I think what I tend to believe
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:26.020]   is that it's because there's emotional resonances
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.860]   between where we're at now in this life
[00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:33.860]   and other kind of experiences
[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.220]   that people have had before.
[00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.220]   And we always hear about,
[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.540]   everybody who talks about past lives,
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.260]   they're always kings and queens.
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.740]   (Lex laughing)
[00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:47.460]   So I think that's, again, you filter things,
[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:48.820]   what you want to be true.
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:53.700]   But I do think that there is a way to access information
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:58.100]   beyond what we've taken in in our own temporal existence
[00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.700]   through our own five senses.
[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.540]   - In some ways, I really find that compelling,
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.100]   the notion that that information's already there,
[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:08.100]   and you're simply just moving the attention of your mind
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:09.980]   to different parts of that.
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.300]   - Yeah, I mean, we have that with the radio.
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.860]   I mean, you know, you got a frequency,
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:17.020]   you turn all this information.
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.780]   You could actually say right now,
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:19.940]   in the space between us,
[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.620]   we have the whole world's knowledge
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:23.100]   that's up on the internet.
[00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:23.940]   It's right here.
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:24.780]   - Yeah.
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.460]   - But we don't see it. - We just have to tune in.
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:27.300]   - Yeah.
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:31.660]   - What are the interesting differences,
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.540]   would you say, between the various psychedelics
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:35.380]   that you mentioned?
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:40.020]   Ayahuasca, DMT, acid LSD, marijuana, mescaline,
[00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.700]   PCP, psilocybin, MDMA.
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.820]   You mentioned a few of them that are really interesting.
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.220]   We'll talk about scientifically
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.340]   some of the different studies
[00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.940]   that have been conducted on each,
[00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:52.460]   but sort of at the high level,
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.140]   what are some interesting differences?
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:57.300]   - Well, one of the big ones that people make a big deal of
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.920]   that I think is completely misplaced
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.820]   is some are from nature, some are from the lab.
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:03.660]   - Right.
[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:05.420]   - So there's this kind of like romantic thought
[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:06.960]   that if it's from nature, it's good.
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.600]   If it's from the lab, it's somehow tainted by humanity.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.960]   And therefore, some people are like
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.500]   all for plant psychedelics.
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:19.080]   We see the policy changes that have been happening
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.280]   in a couple of cities, Cambridge, Somerville,
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.740]   not far from where we're at now,
[00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:27.320]   where they decriminalize plant medicines.
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.280]   So they call it decriminalizing nature.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.780]   So I think that there is,
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:36.320]   from my perspective,
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:40.120]   certain things from nature are poison.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:44.780]   Certain things from the lab are spiritual,
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:47.560]   even if they don't show up in nature like LSD.
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:51.520]   Now there is something, LSD is lysergic acid diethylamide.
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:54.760]   There is lysergic acid amide, LSA,
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.280]   which comes from morning glory seeds.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:57.560]   So it's very similar.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.480]   But at the same time,
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.720]   I'd say I don't buy into that distinction
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.240]   that there's some fundamental preference.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.840]   One of the things that Terence McKenna,
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.440]   since we talked about him,
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.480]   he talked about how if it's from nature, it's good.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.600]   And if it's not, we should be suspect.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.560]   Of course, he had a lot of great LSD experiences.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.040]   But actually, Terence, in 1984,
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.820]   we were at Esalen with a bunch of other people.
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:27.780]   This was before the crackdown on MDMA.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.560]   And this was some of the underground therapists
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.960]   and the above ground researchers
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:36.360]   were trying to talk about how to protect MDMA
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.720]   from this eventual crackdown.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.320]   And Terence was like, forget about it.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.960]   It's from the lab.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:42.800]   It's dangerous.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.120]   We have thousands of years of history,
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.200]   all these other things.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.480]   And what do we know about MDMA and blah, blah, blah.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.480]   I was like, Terence, you're so unscientific, bullshit.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:56.880]   Another way to say it is,
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:01.880]   and I just said, we need a study of the safety of MDMA.
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.520]   And so then Dick Price, who started Esalen,
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.880]   I said, I'll put 1,000, Dick Price, he put 1,000.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.640]   So Terence was actually the catalyst
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.480]   for the first study with MDMA.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.880]   - Wow.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.280]   - Just 'cause he was so frustrating
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.680]   about how plants are okay.
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.660]   And if it's from the lab, it's bad.
[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:20.200]   So that's one distinction.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.120]   The other distinction is this
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:27.620]   sense of classic psychedelics versus things like MDMA.
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.020]   So to what extent do they dissolve the ego?
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:34.460]   And you could say, to what extent do they cause visions,
[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:37.620]   the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor subtype,
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:41.540]   which is responsible for a lot of that,
[00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:43.180]   where these drugs are activating.
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:48.340]   Now mescaline, of all the psychedelics,
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.100]   chemically, it's the most similar to MDMA.
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.980]   It's a phenethylamine, which is MDMA.
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:57.700]   So in the '50s, there was the, '53, I think it was,
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.180]   the Army Chemical Warfare Service
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:03.340]   wanted to look at drugs for interrogations,
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.780]   mind control, nonlethal incapacitance.
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:10.780]   They did a study in eight substances.
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:13.740]   These were now toxicity studies in animals.
[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.620]   And on the one side was methamphetamine,
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:16.780]   on the other was mescaline,
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.920]   and MDMA was in the middle, chemically.
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.500]   So mescaline of these psychedelics
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:27.420]   tends to have a warmth that MDMA has.
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:30.580]   It's not as ego-dissolving quite as some of the others.
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.940]   I mean, it's the main active ingredient in peyote.
[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:34.840]   It is very psychedelic, very visual.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:39.240]   Another distinction with these different drugs
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.180]   is how long they last.
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.940]   And a lot of that has to do
[00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:45.100]   with the route of administration.
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:49.100]   So for example, if you smoke DMT,
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.300]   it takes 10, 15 minutes, and you're,
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.520]   within seconds, you're off in another world.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:59.520]   Similarly, 5-MeO-DMT, very rapid.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:03.140]   When you take DMT in the form of ayahuasca,
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:05.740]   where it's mixed with another substance
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:08.420]   that makes it so that it's orally active,
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.340]   then it's a couple hours.
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:16.260]   So LSD is eight, 10, 12 hours sometimes.
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:18.900]   Psilocybin is more like five or six hours,
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:21.300]   or four to six hours.
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.800]   MDMA is similar.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.000]   It's one reason why, in our research,
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.100]   we give an initial dose of MDMA,
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:31.120]   and then two hours later, we give half the initial amount
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:34.820]   to extend the plateau, because we want it to last longer
[00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:37.140]   for people to be in this therapeutic state.
[00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:40.460]   So that's another distinction is,
[00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.280]   you know, how long these drugs last.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.340]   Another distinction is which of them
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:47.180]   come from a religious context,
[00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.260]   have a religion built around them.
[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:52.180]   We have this sense that some people are saying
[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:54.820]   that 5-MeO-DMT and the Sonoran Toad,
[00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:57.420]   that they have this long history of indigenous use,
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:58.260]   but they don't.
[00:22:58.260 --> 00:22:59.420]   That's all modern, it's made up,
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.940]   and it's kind of a new approach.
[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:05.100]   However, there was thousands of years of use
[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.000]   of psilocybin mushrooms in religious contexts.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.260]   From 1600 BC to 396 AD,
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:17.100]   the world's longest mystery ceremonies,
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.900]   the Eleusinian Mysteries, you know,
[00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.240]   sort of the heart of Greek culture,
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.500]   the heart of Western culture,
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.780]   that was a psychedelic potion called kykeon
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:29.520]   that seems like it's very much like an LSD-like substance.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:35.420]   Ergot on grain, and you know, LSD comes from ergot.
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:39.620]   So I think that there are a lot of ways
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.100]   to look at these different substances.
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.060]   Another distinction is, you know,
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.700]   which one of them are being researched right now.
[00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:50.100]   In scientific contexts, and which are not.
[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.700]   And because of the rise of all these for-profit companies,
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:54.820]   and everybody's looking for what they can patent,
[00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.300]   what they can claim, the land grab,
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:01.180]   you know, more and more there are companies
[00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:04.300]   looking at every different kind of psychedelics.
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.340]   The ones that are most important
[00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.020]   that are not being researched, mescaline,
[00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.100]   but now there's a company to do mescaline,
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:13.940]   Journey CoLab, Ibogaine,
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:17.140]   which is crucial for opiate addiction.
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:21.380]   There's a new company, a branch of this company,
[00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:23.660]   Atai, that's gonna be looking at Ibogaine.
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:27.420]   So I'd say the rise of the for-profit companies
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:30.140]   is making it so that there's just gonna be
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.460]   an enormous amount of investigations
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:35.940]   into all these different psychedelics.
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:39.620]   But what we're gonna see is the development
[00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:41.700]   of new psychedelics that we don't know anything about
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:42.800]   that have not existed yet,
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.420]   because a lot of these for-profit companies
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:48.220]   are gonna wanna invent and patent
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:51.860]   and have composition of matter patents on new molecules.
[00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.660]   So I think we'll see a lot of that happening too.
[00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:54.500]   - That's really fascinating.
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.500]   I mean, there's a lot of doors you've opened
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:58.940]   and we're gonna walk through all of them,
[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:00.380]   including the research and so on.
[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:05.380]   But on this one little tangent of the future of psychedelics,
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:08.660]   so engineering new psychedelics,
[00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:12.120]   can you comment on maybe the chemistry
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.200]   and the biology of how psychedelics work
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:18.200]   and where's the space of possible engineering of psychedelics
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.520]   and what kind of things might they unlock
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:25.280]   in terms of the possible places our mind
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:30.280]   would be able to go and the effects of that,
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.320]   of improving health.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:35.760]   But maybe at the basic level of chemistry
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.840]   and the space of what could be engineered.
[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:41.220]   - Well, you reminded me,
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:42.540]   I'll get to exactly what you said,
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:47.540]   but you reminded me of a talk I heard by Buckminster Fuller
[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:49.160]   shortly before he died.
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.960]   And what he talked about is how technology
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.400]   was making things ever smaller,
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.800]   that we were able to pack more and more information
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.440]   into smaller and smaller spaces
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.560]   and that we're developing technologies
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.900]   of communications with people.
[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:08.800]   We now know the internet and things like that.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:13.440]   But what he said is that he thought the eventual evolution
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.700]   of this sort of research would move
[00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:20.340]   from this miniaturization to telepathy.
[00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.840]   - Yeah.
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.640]   - And I was like, it was a shocking thing
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.760]   for somebody like scientific like that to say that.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.440]   So will we unlock those parts
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.760]   where I talked about the collective unconscious?
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:38.760]   Will we be able to more consciously explore those areas?
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.300]   So I think that that's a possibility.
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:42.140]   - That's fascinating.
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:44.180]   - There was Stan Grof,
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:47.700]   who's the world's leading LSD researcher
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:51.660]   and has been my mentor, his wife, Brigitte.
[00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:54.220]   They were talking about stories that they had heard
[00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:59.220]   about MDMA that people take.
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.880]   And then on top of that, they do 5-MeO-DMT.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.380]   And so you get this ego dissolution,
[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:09.140]   but underneath it, you have this sense of ego,
[00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:14.140]   sort of sense of safety, of self-acceptance,
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:15.260]   kind of grounds it.
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:19.220]   So Stan was like, that's the future of psychiatry
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.700]   that you can watch without the terror
[00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:22.980]   of the ego dissolution,
[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.580]   the sense that you're losing your mind
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:26.220]   or you're going crazy or you're dying,
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:29.900]   or that you have this grounded sense of safety
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:32.160]   while you're dissolving your normal sense
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.840]   of how you see things.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.280]   - And being able to engineer in a fine-tuned way
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:41.020]   that exact experience, maybe fine-tuned to the person,
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.240]   as opposed to sort of this manual potion
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:46.960]   that's through experiment.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.760]   - Although I don't know about fine-tuning things
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.160]   to the person in the sense that we believe
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.320]   there's this inner healer,
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.080]   this kind of inner healing intelligence.
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.280]   We talked about it, the body repairs itself.
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:03.860]   I think we more need to create safety for people,
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:06.220]   and then what emerges will be customized
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.500]   to what they need to be looking at
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.160]   from this inner healing intelligence.
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.320]   At the same time, we will move to,
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:17.380]   we hear so much about the new approaches to oncology
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:23.260]   where you do genetic analysis of different kind of tumors,
[00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:25.960]   and then you have certain kind of chemotherapy agents,
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.980]   and you do personalized chemotherapy.
[00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:29.660]   I think we will have more
[00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:32.060]   like personalized psychedelic therapy,
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:34.680]   but it'll be more like a sequence of different drugs
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.460]   that people go through over an extended period of time,
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:40.340]   and then you kind of customize what's next,
[00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.560]   and sometimes you'll combine different drugs together,
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.420]   like this 5-MeO-DMT and MDMA,
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:48.940]   or a lot of times people do LSD-MDMA combinations
[00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:51.100]   or psilocybin-MDMA combinations.
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:56.740]   Chemistry, and it's not my strength,
[00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:01.460]   I'm more into clinical applications and policy,
[00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:03.780]   but I can say that from what I've learned
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.940]   from reading from others and research done by others
[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:10.540]   that different psychedelics have an impact
[00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:12.420]   on different neurotransmitters,
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:14.920]   different other parts of energies in the brain.
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:20.460]   The default mode network is what's considered
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:24.140]   to be like our sense of self,
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.780]   and it's part of the brain
[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:27.260]   that sort of is what I described before,
[00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:30.260]   scanning the world and filtering information
[00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:33.400]   for what's really important to us,
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:36.260]   and both focusing us on things
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:39.180]   and also helping us to ignore a lot of things.
[00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:43.820]   And the classic psychedelics all weaken the energy
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:45.940]   in this default mode system,
[00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.980]   and therefore you get this flood of information
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:49.860]   that you're not normally paying attention to,
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:52.820]   and then you start seeing in more creative ways
[00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:54.420]   or more connected.
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:57.980]   You actually move to beyond the verbal kind of thinking
[00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:01.500]   into sort of symbolic thinking a lot of times.
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.860]   And that's where you sometimes get
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:05.780]   these mystical sense of connection,
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:06.620]   how it's all one,
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:11.620]   and you get the sense also of how big the universe is
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.480]   and how small each one of us is.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:18.540]   So there's a lot of work that Sasha Shulgin
[00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:20.940]   and Albert Hoffman, who invented LSD
[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.300]   and first synthesized psilocybin
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:25.020]   on what they call structure activity relationships.
[00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:27.340]   What is the structural of the molecule?
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:31.060]   And then how do you predict what that new molecule
[00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.340]   that never existed before is going to do
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.540]   once you actually take it?
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:39.500]   And you can get close,
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:43.060]   but you never really know until you actually take the drug.
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:47.500]   And the way that Sasha ran his experiments
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:51.940]   is that he would take the drugs himself first in low doses,
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:55.020]   and he would sort of step up the doses
[00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.020]   to have more experiences.
[00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.020]   If he thought it was valuable,
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:58.680]   he'd share it with his wife, Anne.
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:01.100]   But then what they would do
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:02.580]   is if they both thought it was valuable,
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:04.940]   they had a group of 12 people
[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:07.340]   that they were with for many, many years,
[00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:10.780]   and they would distribute these new drug to these 12 people,
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:13.580]   and they would get the different perspectives.
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.940]   And he felt that 12 was like a minimum number
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:18.820]   'cause we're so unique how each of us see things.
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:21.060]   But then you kind of get a little bit of a consensus
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:22.580]   on how a lot of people are gonna see it.
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:25.580]   And then if that 12 people were positive about it,
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:27.380]   then they would turn it over to Leo Zeff,
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:29.220]   who he called the secret chief,
[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.340]   the leader of the underground psychedelic therapy movement,
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:33.780]   and then he would start exploring it in therapy.
[00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:38.340]   So there's still a lot of mysteries
[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:40.540]   as far as structure activity relationships,
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:42.260]   and it's not gonna be the case
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:45.380]   that people go into the lab and they tinker with molecules
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:47.620]   and they know exactly what they're gonna get.
[00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:51.540]   And a lot of it has to do with the,
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:54.820]   not so much chemistry as morphology.
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:56.700]   You could say the shape of the molecule
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:59.540]   and how does that interact with receptor sites.
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:02.140]   And so we're getting better at modeling all of that.
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.780]   - And how does that interaction relate
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:08.260]   to the morphing of the human experience
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.060]   and deeply understanding that perhaps
[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:13.180]   there's no equations yet for that kind of thing.
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:17.260]   You really have to build up intuition by experiencing it.
[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:20.620]   And over time, sort of subjective self-report,
[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:22.980]   like trying to build an understanding
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:24.780]   of the effects of the different chemistries.
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:28.020]   - Yeah, yeah, you can have approximate ideas,
[00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:29.260]   but to know exactly.
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:34.060]   So when I first tried MDMA, which was 1982,
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:37.340]   and this was after I had done lots of LSD
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:40.340]   and mescaline and mushrooms,
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:44.580]   I was shocked at how different it was
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:46.640]   than these other substances,
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.260]   and yet how profound it was.
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:52.100]   So are there whole new kind of categories
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.580]   of classes of drugs that we're not aware of
[00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:57.940]   that would be not so much this,
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:01.940]   like eco-dissolution or emotional?
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:05.860]   Well, what MDMA does is reduces activity in the amygdala,
[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:08.220]   the fear processing part of the brain.
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.420]   So it's not just chemistry,
[00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.820]   but it routes energy throughout the brain
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:12.660]   in a different way.
[00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:15.860]   It increases activity in the prefrontal cortex.
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:17.600]   So you think more logically.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:21.640]   That I think has an enormous impact on the effect of MDMA.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.200]   The other thing it does is it increases connectivity
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.760]   between the amygdala and the hippocampus.
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:30.340]   So it helps facilitate processing of things
[00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:31.700]   into long-term memory.
[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:35.440]   And with PTSD, trauma is like never in the past.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:36.520]   It's always about to happen.
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:39.560]   So will we one time develop drugs
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:43.520]   that would even be specific to certain kind of memories?
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:46.400]   We're working with a woman, Rachel Yehuda,
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:50.120]   who is at the Bronx VA.
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:52.340]   And she's done some studies
[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:55.300]   that are with the epigenetics of trauma.
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:58.820]   So she's worked with Holocaust survivors and their children.
[00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:03.560]   And she has identified epigenetic mechanisms
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:07.420]   by which trauma is passed from generation to the generations
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:10.540]   sort of like set points for anxiety, fear,
[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:11.740]   certain things like that.
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:16.080]   But the question is, can you actually transmit memories
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:18.720]   from one generation to the next?
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:22.720]   Now, this is not DNA changes
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:26.520]   which happen over a very long period of time
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.740]   and evolutionary scale.
[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:31.680]   But within one lifetime, within some experiences,
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:34.240]   your epigenetics, what turns on the genes
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:37.180]   or turns off certain genes, that can be impacted.
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:39.560]   And that's what we know now can be transmitted
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:41.880]   from generation to generation,
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:43.560]   either by the father or the mother
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:45.820]   through the sperm or the egg.
[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:48.720]   So it's pretty remarkable.
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:53.460]   So what Rachel is gonna try to do is MDMA research for PTSD
[00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:56.400]   and look at these epigenetic markers before and after
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:00.300]   and see if they change as a consequence of therapy.
[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:05.300]   So will we develop one day certain kind of chemicals
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:08.080]   that will be able to bring certain kind of memories
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.160]   to the surface?
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.600]   That's not inconceivable.
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.960]   - The epigenetic angle is fascinating,
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.600]   that there'll be these epigenetic perturbations
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:21.680]   that lead to memories living from one generation
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:24.200]   to the other and then bringing those memories
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:28.960]   to the surface and using that as signal
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.960]   to understand what exactly the psychedelics bring
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.640]   to the surface and not.
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:35.480]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.240]   Now the other portion of that though is culture.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:40.680]   I mean, culture is where we store all these memories
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:44.200]   and the stories that we get passed down.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.000]   - Especially with a lot of shared,
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.600]   you talk about the Holocaust or World War II,
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:53.560]   where it's deeply ingrained in the culture
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:56.740]   the impact of those events and sort of an aggregate
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:59.400]   the different perspectives on that particular event
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:03.120]   create a set of stories that you can plug into.
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:06.560]   And then they kind of resonate with some aspect of you
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:09.560]   that creates a memory that's connected to.
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.080]   Like when I think about World War II and the Holocaust,
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:15.720]   I think about my own family, but in some sense,
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:19.000]   it's also resonating with stories of many others.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.040]   So it's like somehow the two echo each other
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:24.960]   and I'm just providing my own little flavor on top.
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.680]   The meat of the stories are probably those
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.280]   that are shared with others.
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:32.320]   It's plugging into the collective unconscious.
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:36.200]   That's really fascinating, really plugging into,
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:40.680]   like precisely plugging into particular memories
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:45.680]   as a way to deal with trauma and PTSD, that kind of thing.
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:51.120]   - Yeah, I'll just add that the most important dream
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:55.000]   of my life ever was of a Holocaust survivor telling me
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   that he was miraculously saved from death
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.760]   and he knew that he was saved for a particular purpose,
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.560]   but he never knew what that purpose was.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.360]   So in the dream, I'm seeing him on his deathbed
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:11.600]   and then he shows me whatever happened to him
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.560]   during the Holocaust, you know,
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:16.320]   and then we're back in the room on his deathbed
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:20.480]   and he says, "Well, I know what my purpose was now."
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.080]   And I'm like, "Oh, great, what was it?"
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:24.400]   He says, "To tell you to be a psychedelic therapist
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.660]   "and to study psychedelics
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:28.440]   "and bring back psychedelic research."
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:31.920]   And I thought to myself, I've already decided to do this.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.080]   You can lay this on me, I can say yes,
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:35.240]   and then you can die in peace.
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:38.160]   And then he died in front of my eyes in the dream.
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:43.040]   So I think that that kind of cultural transmission
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:45.680]   that I got from when I was really young, you know,
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:50.060]   then manifested in this dream and that was this story
[00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:55.060]   about how people can be incredibly vicious
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:58.920]   and can be very motivated by irrational factors.
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:02.420]   And so I just feel that this kind of
[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:05.680]   multi-generational transmission of this story
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:09.240]   of the irrational being a murderous factor
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:15.400]   and something I needed to respond to was deeply ingrained.
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:19.960]   And I would say my guess is more culturally
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:22.080]   than this epigenetic mechanism.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:23.440]   - Yes.
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:27.200]   Yeah, but your sense is that whatever stimulated
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:32.200]   a certain part of human nature in World War II,
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:37.660]   especially Nazi Germany, but also in Stalinist Soviet Union
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.260]   still is within us, within all of us.
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:42.120]   Just like we were saying, you know,
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:47.000]   we embody quite a lot of things.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:47.840]   - Yeah.
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:52.400]   - And one of those is whatever the capacity for evil.
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:56.400]   It seems to be one of those things.
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.880]   - Yeah, there's a quote from Carl Jung
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:01.680]   from just a few years before he died.
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:05.800]   What he says, and I'll just paraphrase it,
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:09.200]   is that we need to understand psychology.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:14.240]   We need to understand who man is,
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:18.360]   that the greatest danger to us is man.
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.720]   There are no other dangers, really,
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.660]   that impact our species.
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:27.280]   And then he goes on to say that we are the source
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.120]   of all coming evil.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:34.000]   Now, this was 15 years or so after World War II.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.320]   But yeah, and I'd say one of the most important
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.240]   psychedelic experiences of my life was a DMT experience.
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:43.120]   Also, Terrence was there, Ralph Metzner,
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.880]   Andy Weil, a few others.
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:49.880]   And we were sitting around at Esalen smoking DMT.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.440]   And under the influence of DMT,
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:56.280]   which now this was the first time I've ever smoked DMT,
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:40:01.280]   I had this super rapid fraction of a second
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.520]   like dissolving of everything that I,
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:06.200]   well, first off, I saw a horizontal line,
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:07.540]   then I saw a vertical line,
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.920]   then it turned into a color, red, then it was red,
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:11.440]   then it turned into cubes,
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:14.240]   then it turned into like an MC Escher kind of like,
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:17.040]   I don't know, didn't make logical sense,
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.720]   and then I was gone.
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:23.360]   And then it was just this period of five, 10 minutes
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:26.540]   of just feeling part of this enormous wave
[00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:29.080]   of billions of years of evolution,
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:32.760]   how I had this sense that in my innermost sense
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:35.920]   of who I am uniquely individually,
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:37.800]   this inner voice that's talking to me,
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.680]   that I didn't develop English,
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:43.520]   that it's like a gift to me from millions of people.
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:47.600]   So that even in my most innermost sense,
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:48.720]   it's not just me,
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:51.080]   it's the product of everything that came before me,
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:53.680]   I'm part of this bigger system.
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.120]   And then I just thought, wow,
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.280]   just how many billions of years does it take
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.860]   to reach this point of self-awareness and all this,
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:01.120]   and it was glorious, beautiful,
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.520]   and then I had this thought,
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:06.900]   and this is where this kind of intellectual honesty,
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:07.740]   I guess you could say,
[00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:09.400]   I just thought, well, if I'm part of everything
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:11.080]   and everything's part of me,
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:12.900]   then it's not just the good parts
[00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:14.840]   that Hitler's part of me too.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:16.160]   - Yeah. - And that was just
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:19.160]   this shock like a stone sunk,
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:22.840]   and I just was very moody for the whole next day.
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:24.840]   But it was that acknowledgement
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:27.480]   that each of us carries these potentials,
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:29.480]   and what we activate is what matters,
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.160]   but what our potential are
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:34.120]   is the whole full range of things.
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.240]   - I don't know if you can comment
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:39.040]   about the DMT trip itself and what it's like,
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:42.120]   starting from the very basic geometric shapes
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:44.840]   and then launching yourself
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:48.920]   into the context of the enormity of space and time
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.180]   and the human history.
[00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:54.080]   Is there anything else to be said
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:57.760]   about that kind of visually
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:02.760]   or physically or emotionally about that journey?
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:06.860]   What it's like, that brief journey that reveals so much?
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:10.080]   - Well, I was with a group of people.
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:12.680]   The way we were doing it was,
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.840]   each of us would smoke DMT,
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:17.640]   have 10, 15 minutes experience while we closed our eyes,
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:19.360]   and everybody else was just chatting,
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:20.800]   and then the person who did the DMT
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:24.280]   would come back and tell their story of what happened.
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:26.000]   And then we'd think about it for a bit
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.640]   and then pass the pipe to the next person.
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:29.600]   And so this was like a whole evening.
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:32.360]   - So even, sorry to interrupt,
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:34.140]   even the conversations themselves then
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:35.720]   is part of the experience.
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.080]   - Yeah, exactly, yes, yes,
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:39.280]   because it's also what you bring back.
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:42.320]   I mean, I think that's, particularly for therapy,
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.280]   it's not so much about what the experience is,
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.520]   but it's what you bring back.
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:48.760]   And what do you integrate?
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:51.720]   And then also, how do you learn
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:54.600]   how to do these things on your own without the drugs?
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:56.360]   There is this way, because we're saying
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:58.400]   it's sort of a core human experience,
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:01.960]   the drug is the mediator, but can we do this on our own?
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:04.480]   And once you've seen it and felt it,
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:06.040]   then you have a little bit better sense
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:08.280]   to recreate it on your own.
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:10.240]   Although, you know, I've had dreams
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:13.240]   where I've been doing LSD and tripping.
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:14.560]   And it was just incredible.
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:17.320]   It was, I was tripping in my dreams,
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.760]   but I had not taken LSD.
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.000]   So there's this way in which we do that.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.040]   So I would say that from the DMT experience,
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:28.160]   the sense of safety, that's what I was trying to get at
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.760]   with this group of us and this group of friends
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:32.500]   trying to do this common exploration,
[00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:34.880]   that if you have this sense of safety,
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:38.200]   you're incredibly vulnerable
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:43.080]   because you are giving up your awareness, really,
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:44.840]   of what's happening around you.
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:49.520]   I think there's, what we're finding is that
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:52.960]   in our psychedelic research for PTSD
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:56.480]   and what we see with the vaccines,
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:59.200]   that even African-Americans are reluctant
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.460]   to volunteer for vaccines
[00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:03.720]   because they haven't had that sense of safety
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:05.700]   from the medical establishment.
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:10.480]   They don't volunteer for psychedelic therapy even as much.
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:14.240]   So the overlay has to be this sense of safety
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:18.280]   as you become vulnerable and looking inside, you're not.
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:21.400]   I was just actually told about how
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:23.520]   there's a lot of work being done inside prisons
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.520]   to teach mindfulness.
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.920]   And, you know, so one of the,
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:31.200]   Charlene, who's my assistant,
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:35.360]   is trying to do work on helping people in prison
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:37.920]   with trauma, potentially one day with MDMA
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.500]   or meditation or mindfulness.
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:42.800]   But one of the exercises was teaching people to,
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.000]   okay, here's how you deal with stress.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.760]   Just close your eyes and deep breathe.
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:48.160]   And what Charlene was saying is
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.420]   people don't close their eyes in prison.
[00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:52.320]   You don't feel safe to do that.
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:55.400]   So all that is just to say is that
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:59.760]   the context is the most important factor.
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:02.200]   So while I'll talk about the DMT experience,
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:07.120]   the context was this supportive sense of safety
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.080]   that I could be completely vulnerable
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:12.620]   and out of any kind of control.
[00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:13.920]   Women, I think, you know,
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:16.800]   often are less safe in this way than men
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.500]   because of all the sexual assaults.
[00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:25.140]   But what it can do by taking the ego orientation
[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:29.920]   offline to some extent, it opens you up to much more.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:32.580]   And to make a bigger point of that,
[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:35.880]   we could say that it's very similar
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:38.020]   to the Copernican Revolution.
[00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:40.020]   And people thought that the earth
[00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:41.680]   was the center of the universe.
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:46.320]   And the Inquisition murdered people that questioned that.
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:48.800]   Father Bruno burned at the stake.
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.360]   Actually, one of the things he said,
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:54.220]   I think that's worth all these years later saying,
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:55.600]   is that when the Inquisition
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:00.480]   sentenced him to burn at the stake
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:02.440]   for espousing this idea that the earth
[00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:05.680]   was not really the center of the universe,
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:08.400]   he said to the Inquisition, he said,
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.480]   "Your fear in sentencing me
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:13.660]   is greater than my fear in being sentenced."
[00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:18.080]   That their worldview was so rigid
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:21.680]   that they had to wipe out anybody that would question it.
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:26.280]   And so this idea of psychedelics
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:29.920]   displacing our ego as the center of the universe
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:32.520]   and to realize that we are just rotating
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:36.600]   around something much bigger than our individual life.
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:39.760]   Our ego is designed almost to protect this body
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:41.360]   while we're alive.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:44.160]   And you can understand all the good reasons why that is.
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:48.640]   But it also disconnects us from this bigger reality.
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.160]   And so the psychedelics, DMT,
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:53.640]   by knocking this sort of ego orientation
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:56.760]   or the default mode network offline,
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:00.560]   you open up to the bigger sweeps of history.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:03.520]   - So in that place of safety and vulnerability
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.960]   in that fascinating group of people,
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:08.040]   when their ego was dissolved in this way,
[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:09.880]   did they have similar experiences?
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:12.480]   Is there different places that their minds went?
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:17.400]   - Yeah, so once I had this kind of shattering experience
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:19.600]   that Hitler's part of me,
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:21.400]   no one else in the group had that.
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:24.040]   Probably a lot of them have maybe had that before
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:27.760]   or they realized that they're not just, you know,
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:30.480]   the good, the white hat, good people
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:31.520]   and that they're all good.
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:35.120]   And, you know, we got to fight against the bad people.
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:37.180]   You know, so no, people will go in different places.
[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:39.360]   And not only that, if you do it again,
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:40.460]   you'll go into a different place
[00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:42.520]   than you went to the first time,
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:44.960]   unless you have not resolved the issue.
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:48.480]   So I had a sequence of LSD trips that were very difficult,
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:52.680]   but it was like coming to the same sort of conundrum,
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:57.260]   the same challenge that I was unable to overcome.
[00:47:57.260 --> 00:48:00.020]   This idea of letting go and really fully dissolving,
[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:02.940]   letting the ego fully go.
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:04.800]   And I would have this sequence of trips
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:07.280]   over a couple of months where I would reach this point
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:08.760]   where I was too scared to move forward
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:10.260]   and I would just be holding on.
[00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:15.320]   So there are repeated themes sometimes.
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:18.240]   What Stan Grof has said, which I find very beautiful,
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:21.680]   is that the full expression of an emotion
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:24.200]   is the funeral pyre of that emotion.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:29.160]   And what that means is if you can fully let in something,
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:32.560]   then the essence of life has changed,
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:35.600]   is that it moves on, that everything's in motion.
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:37.280]   And if you can fully experience it,
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:39.360]   even if it's a sense that you're going to be trapped
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:42.600]   in eternity in this hellish state,
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:45.080]   if you surrender to that, that's the way out.
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:48.120]   You know, this full experience of something
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:52.200]   is this funeral pyre of that emotion.
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:54.680]   And so that runs against a lot
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:56.280]   of what modern psychiatry is doing too,
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:58.480]   which is to suppress symptoms.
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:01.620]   And to, instead of supporting people
[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:03.880]   to kind of explore these insecurities
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:06.280]   so that then they can contain them
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:07.520]   and then they can move on.
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:13.640]   - So yeah, resistance is not a way to make progress.
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:15.020]   - Right, right.
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:17.840]   Although, and one of the reasons
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:21.400]   why we do the supplemental dose during the MDMA,
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:26.120]   or why there's advantages in a 10-hour LSD experience,
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:28.520]   is that you have a lot of opportunities
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:31.080]   to come up against this resistance
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:32.920]   that may be too difficult to deal with.
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:34.680]   And then you kind of push it aside,
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.600]   and then a couple hours later, you come back to it,
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:37.560]   or you come back to it.
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:40.520]   - Press snooze every once in a while, if you're not ready.
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:41.480]   - It's hard to do that.
[00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:45.320]   I think with MDMA, you can negotiate.
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:48.120]   That's, I think, a part of its safety, in a sense.
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:50.840]   You can have this like, oh, I should be talking about this,
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:53.720]   but I, or I'm feeling this, but it's too much for me now.
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:54.680]   You can push it away.
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:57.080]   But with the classic psychedelics,
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:59.480]   this kind of membrane between the conscious
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:03.640]   and the unconscious, that once you take the drug
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:06.340]   and it weakens this membrane and things are coming up,
[00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:11.360]   it's very difficult to negotiate with it.
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:16.120]   The key to successful classic psychedelic trips
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:17.060]   is surrender.
[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:20.080]   - You've talked about that you first began
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:24.280]   to reconsider the negative health myths around psychedelics
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:25.800]   when you learned that the book,
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:27.880]   "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:30.600]   was written by Ken Kesey when he was in part
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:32.660]   under the influence of LSD.
[00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:36.200]   So how do you think LSD helped him, Ken Kesey,
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:39.560]   in writing that incredible book?
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:44.560]   - Yeah, there's a process that's called semantic priming.
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:49.720]   And so what that means is that I say night, you say day.
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:52.440]   There's kind of normal patterns of kind of,
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:56.800]   you say one word, what kind of words come to you next?
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:58.480]   And so they've done some research,
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:01.280]   they, meaning scientists, have done some research
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:04.720]   where you give people a psychedelic
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:07.440]   and then you do this semantic priming.
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:12.080]   And what you find is they have a wider range of associations
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:15.760]   than they normally would when they're not under psychedelics.
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:17.840]   So I think for Ken Kesey,
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:21.960]   he was able with psychedelics to get
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:26.400]   a deeper kind of emotional connection
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:28.320]   to some of these states of mind
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:30.840]   that people were in this mental institution,
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:35.560]   and that he could explore them more in depth
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:37.360]   and more eloquently.
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:40.040]   And also one of the things he talked about
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.800]   was the fog machine,
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:46.300]   was how people's minds were sort of clouded
[00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:48.400]   by the people that ran the institution
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:51.080]   and the fog machine would be coming in.
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:56.080]   So I think the imagery and the metaphors
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:58.520]   that he used a lot in the book
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:00.960]   could come to him during LSD experiences.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:05.680]   And then now he wasn't doing very,
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:10.480]   when you're writing, you have to be literate,
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:12.500]   you have to be able to write,
[00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:16.280]   so it would be more like beginning and ends of LSD trips
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:17.720]   instead of at the peak.
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:19.800]   But I think you would get a lot of these,
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:23.200]   the feeling tones or the images, the metaphors,
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:26.200]   I think he would get these extent,
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:27.520]   also LSD lasts so long,
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:30.160]   you can get these extended focus
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:34.040]   and you can really elaborate on images.
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:37.860]   And so much of psychedelic experiences
[00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:40.400]   are poetic and metaphorical.
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.680]   I mean, you can take veterans
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:48.560]   who've never read a book of poetry in their lives,
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:51.960]   and under the influence of MDMA,
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:54.240]   just what they describe, the imagery
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:56.400]   and the way they describe their experience
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:59.000]   is metaphorical, poetic, it's incredible.
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:04.840]   And so I think that Ken Kesey was able to channel
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:09.680]   what LSD did to his mind in a way
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:13.040]   that most people couldn't do,
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:15.520]   but he did because he was trying to write this novel
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:17.120]   and because he was so brilliant.
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:22.960]   - Yeah, I mean, we'll talk about psychedelics
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:28.200]   and treating, in bringing some trauma to the surface
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:29.640]   and dealing with all those kinds of things,
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:34.640]   but there's something also to the opening up of creativity,
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:37.360]   for whether it's for writing purposes
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:41.940]   or for in my world, for engineering, for invention.
[00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:43.880]   Innovation and invention itself
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:47.280]   is a deeply creative process.
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:52.280]   And it's fascinating to think with the aid of psychedelics,
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:56.360]   what kind of ideas can be brought to life.
[00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:59.060]   - Yeah, well, we have the whole phenomena
[00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:00.900]   of a lot of the people in Silicon Valley
[00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:02.680]   and else microdosing psychedelics
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:05.300]   in order to have a little touch more
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.600]   of this creative approach to things.
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:09.360]   - I would love it to see if it was,
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:12.460]   that's more like Terrence McKenna territory,
[00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:13.460]   correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:16.100]   but I would love to sort of more scientific
[00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:17.860]   to where there would be the rigor
[00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:20.860]   of saying how to do it effectively.
[00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:23.300]   You know, how to sort of understand,
[00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:26.920]   sort of not just almost,
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:34.220]   you know, to take the full journey of creative exploration
[00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:37.640]   and to do it for prolonged periods of time,
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:43.140]   for years, lifelong kind of part of your life
[00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:46.020]   of how it empowers creativity.
[00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:51.020]   I think, of course, you start with helping people,
[00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:55.900]   deal with trauma, and then the next step
[00:54:55.900 --> 00:55:00.620]   is people who have moved past their trauma
[00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:02.300]   and are trying to do something,
[00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:04.380]   create something special in their life.
[00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:07.220]   How can then psychedelics empower that?
[00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:08.700]   - Yeah, now that also,
[00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:11.940]   just to not shy away from anything controversial,
[00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:16.940]   that gets us to this idea of psychedelics for vision quest,
[00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:19.380]   particularly for younger people.
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:21.620]   You know, when you're sort of moving
[00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:23.420]   into this adulting kind of phase
[00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:24.460]   and you have to figure out
[00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:26.300]   what are you gonna do with your life,
[00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:29.460]   there's so many options.
[00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:31.820]   A lot of people, of course, feel constrained
[00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:33.240]   that they have very few options,
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:36.620]   but I think this idea of psychedelics
[00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:40.140]   as a way to help you find your calling
[00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:44.220]   or find your vision or find your unique leverage point,
[00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:45.580]   I think we'll see that more and more
[00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:48.420]   as our culture evolves and gets healthier
[00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:49.820]   around the use of psychedelics.
[00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:52.380]   - So it's both the science,
[00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:54.980]   having the rigor of understanding how to do it safely
[00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:56.740]   and the culture catching up
[00:55:56.740 --> 00:56:01.740]   to the fact that this is both safe and very useful.
[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:06.820]   - Yeah, although I would question this idea of safety.
[00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:11.340]   So we can understand physiological risks
[00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:13.100]   and we can minimize them,
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:16.180]   and I think there's very minimal physiological risks
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:18.460]   from the classic psychedelics, virtually none,
[00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:22.620]   or for even MDMA under safe conditions.
[00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:28.780]   Psychological risks are harder to address,
[00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:32.980]   but we can do that through the sense of safety and support.
[00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:37.520]   But I think there's a level of risk there
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:39.820]   that we shouldn't overlook.
[00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:42.700]   And so, you know, to make a drug into a medicine,
[00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:45.180]   what we have to do is prove to the satisfaction
[00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:47.740]   of the FDA and other regulatory agencies
[00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:50.380]   that things are safe and efficacious.
[00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:52.460]   But even though they use those words,
[00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:55.840]   proving safe and efficacious,
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:57.940]   it's in relationship to the disease
[00:56:57.940 --> 00:56:59.180]   that you're trying to treat
[00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:01.780]   and you accept a certain amount of risk.
[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:06.780]   So it's the risk-benefit ratio rather than pure safety.
[00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:08.520]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:13.580]   Let me ask you about Ken Kesey a little bit longer
[00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:15.540]   'cause he's a fascinating human being.
[00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:19.740]   He was also part of Project MKUltra.
[00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:21.320]   - Yeah, yes.
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:22.980]   - What was Project MKUltra
[00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:26.700]   and what lessons we should take away from it?
[00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:32.660]   - Well, MKUltra was a program by the CIA.
[00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:35.620]   You know, what they were looking at was
[00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:39.380]   can you take these drugs, these psychedelic drugs,
[00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:42.060]   and weaponize them in different ways
[00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:45.180]   for interrogation, for truth serums,
[00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:49.580]   for exposing somebody before they give a big talk
[00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:50.700]   to something like LSD,
[00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:53.620]   and then they can't talk or make a fool of themselves?
[00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:57.420]   Or can you spray LSD over the battlefield
[00:57:57.420 --> 00:57:59.540]   and have everybody tripping and drop their weapons,
[00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:02.040]   and then you just walk up and nobody dies
[00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:04.380]   and you've won the battle?
[00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:07.180]   - It's a fascinating concept.
[00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:09.780]   - Yeah, they call it non-lethal incapacitance.
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:11.780]   And I think that's how it's--
[00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:14.660]   - One way to win a war is to enforce peace.
[00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:18.980]   To get everybody not caring about the war, but yes.
[00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:21.100]   - Well, I think Gandhi said something even better,
[00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:22.820]   which is that the true way to win a war
[00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:24.460]   is to turn your enemy into your friend.
[00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:26.460]   - Yes, that's a beautiful way to put it.
[00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:29.860]   - But MKUltra was really nefarious,
[00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:31.140]   and it was part of our military,
[00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:32.180]   and it was done in secret,
[00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:36.580]   and they would dose people against their will.
[00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:38.540]   I mean, one of the most infamous things
[00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:44.500]   was that they had a house of prostitution in San Francisco,
[00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:47.740]   and they would have one-way mirrors, all this stuff,
[00:58:47.740 --> 00:58:50.820]   and then they would just dose people with LSD.
[00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:51.900]   You know, they would have the prostitutes
[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:55.100]   dose these guys with LSD and observe what they would do
[00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:56.100]   and how they would act.
[00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:58.780]   And the CIA actually, for a while,
[00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:01.540]   was dosing each other secretly.
[00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:03.940]   And there's a famous case of this fella Olson
[00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:08.620]   that either jumped out of a window or was pushed.
[00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:10.500]   He might've been killed.
[00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:13.820]   He was a CIA guy, and they gave him LSD.
[00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:16.180]   And then they're trying to see,
[00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:18.440]   can they break him down and get him to tell secrets?
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:20.940]   And I think he felt uncomfortable with what happened to him
[00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:22.500]   while he was under the influence of LSD,
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:26.540]   and whether he was pushed or not,
[00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:28.300]   I don't know if we'll ever know.
[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:33.300]   But MKUltra was violating people's human rights.
[00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:38.540]   It was done in secret.
[00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:43.540]   And the irony of it is that Ken Kesey
[00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:47.420]   is one of the people, one of the main early people
[00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:49.220]   that got LSD in this context,
[00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:51.460]   and then he was one of the main people
[00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:54.340]   that helped inspire the hippies to use psychedelics
[00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:56.900]   to oppose the Vietnam War.
[00:59:56.900 --> 01:00:01.500]   So I think the CIA kind of, in many cases,
[01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:03.420]   things get out of their control,
[01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:04.460]   what they think they can do,
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:08.540]   and it turned into be a disaster for them.
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:10.740]   I think there was some thought that some of the people
[01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:14.340]   at the CIA had is that if you can turn people inside,
[01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:16.620]   take drugs and they just focus on their internal experience,
[01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:18.640]   they're not gonna be involved politically.
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:21.700]   It's a way to sort of take people offline.
[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:23.300]   And what I don't think they counted on
[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:24.540]   is that when you're offline
[01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:27.700]   and you have these unit of spiritual experiences
[01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:29.500]   and you realize how we're all connected,
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:32.760]   then why do you wanna go out and kill these Vietnamese
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:37.760]   and put one dictator over another dictator,
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:40.860]   dictators on both sides in North Vietnam and South Vietnam?
[01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:42.740]   Why are we doing that?
[01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:47.740]   So MKUltra has, very disreputable,
[01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:51.100]   we're learning more and more about what they did.
[01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:53.940]   And one of the unintended consequences was Ken Kesey,
[01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:56.300]   and not only that, but then the Grateful Dead
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:01:01.220]   who began at the acid test that Kesey was helping to organize
[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:04.980]   and out of that emerged, you could say,
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:08.660]   just this incredible psychedelic culture.
[01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:12.720]   And you look at the bands that began in the '60s
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:17.140]   and which ones have really survived to this day.
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:20.140]   And the Grateful Dead has survived longer
[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:22.300]   than most any other band.
[01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:23.580]   I mean, some of them have died and all,
[01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:25.220]   but it was like the tightness,
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:27.600]   the sort of telepathy we talked about before,
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:31.260]   that they could just get so tuned in to each other
[01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:32.540]   and each other's energies,
[01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:34.100]   and they could do improvisations,
[01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:36.100]   and they could do this incredible work
[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:40.140]   that I think the sustainability of the Grateful Dead
[01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:43.860]   as a group was a testament
[01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:46.380]   to the power of the LSD experiences.
[01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:49.080]   And that might have never happened if not for MKUltra.
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:55.180]   - But can we talk about darkness a little bit?
[01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:58.780]   So Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber,
[01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:02.840]   was allegedly part of the MKUltra studies while at Harvard.
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:05.140]   Do you think this is true?
[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:07.580]   Do you think it had an impact on him psychologically,
[01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:09.540]   intellectually, and so on?
[01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:12.180]   - I do think it's true, and I do think it had an impact.
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:14.960]   So we talked before about,
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:16.780]   are these drugs somehow or other
[01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:20.180]   producing a certain kind of drug experience,
[01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:23.020]   or do they bring out what's within?
[01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:25.420]   So we have this experience, yeah,
[01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:26.700]   on the one hand, Ken Kesey,
[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:30.020]   and he sort of took positive things out of this.
[01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:30.980]   On the other hand,
[01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:37.460]   we can get this opposition to the modern world,
[01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:40.620]   to technology, and to the point of creating bombs
[01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:42.160]   to try to go after it,
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:45.340]   so that the experience is not in the drug.
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:48.280]   It's this interaction between the drug,
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.580]   the person, the context.
[01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:55.580]   And so we can heal people with psychedelics,
[01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:58.480]   or people can be driven crazy with psychedelics.
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:01.920]   It depends, again, on the context.
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:05.340]   And so I think both these things can be true.
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:06.540]   And I think it was really good
[01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:08.100]   that you kind of highlighted this,
[01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:11.300]   that there is this polarities,
[01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:13.020]   and that it's not in the drug.
[01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:15.420]   It's in the other factors,
[01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:17.180]   and it's who they were beforehand,
[01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:18.980]   and then how you use that experience.
[01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:22.240]   So all that's to say is if we put LSD in the water
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:23.820]   and everybody were gonna get it,
[01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:25.300]   it doesn't mean that all of a sudden
[01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:26.980]   everybody's gonna have a mystical experience,
[01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:29.320]   and then that's all we need to do,
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:31.020]   and humanity is spiritualized,
[01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:32.620]   and we're end war and all of this.
[01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:35.460]   It's not about the drug.
[01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:38.980]   And that actually is why, for me,
[01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:42.980]   we've also talked about engineering new psychedelics,
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:44.900]   and all the people that are gonna be trying
[01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:48.020]   for-profit companies to develop and patent new psychedelics.
[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:50.220]   For me, the most important challenge
[01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:52.540]   is new cultural contexts
[01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:57.740]   that can create legality, safety, support
[01:03:57.740 --> 01:04:00.940]   for the existing psychedelics that we already have.
[01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:04.500]   I mean, we have so much incredible tools
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:06.320]   in these existing psychedelics
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:09.860]   that it's more about creating contexts for them
[01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:12.700]   to be used in, say, medical or personal growth,
[01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:14.640]   or recreational even, with harm reduction,
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:15.480]   all these different ways.
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:18.540]   That's more important to me than finding some new molecule
[01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:20.540]   that's somewhat similar or somewhat different,
[01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:22.580]   but it can be patented.
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:24.420]   So it's the social context.
[01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:28.860]   So I do believe that Ted Kaczynski was part of NKUltra,
[01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:31.860]   and I think it affected him in a negative way,
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:34.340]   and that's a cautionary tale,
[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:37.500]   that it's not in the drug, it's in the context.
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:41.280]   - The context, the person, still, it feels like,
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:46.780]   if viewed from a therapy perspective,
[01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:49.020]   perhaps there was a way to use psychedelics
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:53.900]   to help Ted Kaczynski find a path out of the darkness.
[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:55.940]   - I think so, and I think that
[01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:59.520]   this is where I think MDMA comes in,
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:04.220]   in a way that MDMA is, you know, he felt very isolated
[01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:08.460]   and very much out of society in some ways.
[01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:12.220]   MDMA stimulates oxytocin, which we haven't mentioned,
[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:14.080]   which is the hormone of nursing mothers,
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:15.700]   of love and connection.
[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:18.820]   It provides a lot of this sense of self-acceptance
[01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:21.540]   and safety and wanting to be in relationship.
[01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:24.940]   There's Ghul Dolan is a neuroscientist at Hopkins.
[01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:27.860]   She's given octopuses MDMA.
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:31.140]   They're solitary creatures, except mating season,
[01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:33.980]   which is not very often, but you give them MDMA
[01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:35.220]   and they become more interested
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:37.460]   in hanging out with other octopuses.
[01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:40.400]   So I think this, for people that have had
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:43.260]   difficult psychedelic experiences,
[01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:45.180]   MDMA helps them integrate them.
[01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:48.620]   We've worked with people that had a difficult LSD experience
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:52.220]   40 years before and are still able to get back to that
[01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:54.620]   under the influence of MDMA and work out some of the
[01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:57.420]   conflicts that they weren't able to resolve
[01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:01.220]   all those decades before.
[01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:04.700]   So I think that psychedelics could have been helpful
[01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:07.740]   in a different context for Ted Kaczynski.
[01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:11.820]   But the other big part of it is that people have to be
[01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:14.220]   willing to cooperate with the experience.
[01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:16.120]   We talked about resistance.
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:18.000]   So people can resist these things.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.460]   It's the saying is you can bring a horse to water,
[01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:22.920]   but you can't make him drink.
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:25.380]   This is about how people have to be willing
[01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:26.900]   to go to these spaces.
[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:30.180]   So one of the essence of our therapeutic approach
[01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:33.660]   is that we help people to heal themselves,
[01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:36.580]   that we are not giving them the healing.
[01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:40.820]   It's a flip on the power dynamics that existed,
[01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:43.100]   you would say in the 50s and 60s,
[01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:45.500]   my dad was a doctor and the doctors were gods
[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:47.560]   and whatever they said was right.
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:50.160]   And we no longer, of course, believe that,
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:54.400]   but for a while psychoanalysis with Freud,
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.920]   that they gave the interpretation to the patient,
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:58.160]   the patient couldn't help themselves,
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:59.800]   but they would do the free associations
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:02.240]   and the psychoanalysts would see these conflicts
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:04.880]   and would be the one that does the healing,
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:06.520]   would give this interpretation
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:07.640]   and that would open things up.
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:10.920]   So I think it's this idea of empowering people
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:12.800]   to heal themselves.
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:16.580]   And so if Ted Kaczynski had been in a therapeutic setting
[01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:19.780]   with psychedelics and if they'd had something
[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:23.740]   like MDMA available or MDA,
[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:25.500]   which was popular during the 60s,
[01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:28.120]   which is a more like MDMA/LSD combination,
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:31.700]   the outcomes might've been different.
[01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:34.340]   - Let's take a step into the world of studies.
[01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:38.660]   Timothy Leary, who was he
[01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:41.500]   and what were the most important ideas
[01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:42.660]   you've learned from him?
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:47.080]   - Well, I did have the opportunity
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:48.320]   to get to know him personally
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:50.320]   and to spend some time with him.
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:55.320]   Timothy Leary, well, let's start with Nixon
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:58.640]   saying he's the most dangerous man in America.
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:01.720]   - That's a good place to start, yes.
[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:03.360]   - And why did Nixon say that?
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:04.720]   It's because of this,
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:09.960]   turn on, tune in, drop out.
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:14.340]   Timothy Leary was just an incredible advocate
[01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:18.820]   for think for yourself, question authority.
[01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:19.960]   Those were the things he said all the time,
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:21.460]   think for yourself, question authority.
[01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:23.060]   He was a rebel.
[01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:25.420]   He was kicked out of West Point.
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:30.420]   He was a psychologist who was at Harvard for three years
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:32.580]   from '60 to '63.
[01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:35.780]   Before he got to Harvard,
[01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:40.780]   he had an experience with mushrooms in Mexico.
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:44.840]   And he said he learned more in that experience
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:47.320]   than he'd had in his entire academic career before then
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:49.300]   about how the human mind works.
[01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:50.960]   And so he came to Harvard
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:54.580]   wanting to do research into psychedelics.
[01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:59.460]   And he did some very important studies,
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:01.440]   both of which, well,
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:03.480]   one was called the Good Friday experiment,
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:05.460]   which was whether psychedelics
[01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:08.880]   in religiously inclined people taking psilocybin
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:09.840]   in a religious setting,
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:12.040]   whether it could produce a mystical experience.
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:15.120]   That took place at Marsh Chapel at the Boston University.
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:17.960]   Because it's a little bit subjective,
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:19.580]   or you could say entirely subjective,
[01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:23.020]   what people describe happens to them,
[01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:24.800]   he wanted to do another study
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:26.640]   which would be a more objective measure,
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.640]   and that was called the Concord Prison experiment.
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:29.480]   And that was the thought,
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:33.500]   if you can give people psilocybin,
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.740]   mystical sense of connection type experiences
[01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:36.580]   while they're in prison,
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:39.580]   when they get out, they'll be more pro-social
[01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:41.940]   and they'll have reduced recidivism.
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:44.460]   So Tim did that.
[01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:46.560]   He also did the naturalistic studies
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:48.140]   of giving loads of people psilocybin
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:50.500]   and sort of writing down what their experiences were,
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:52.400]   the range of experiences.
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:56.700]   Later on in his time at Harvard,
[01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:58.900]   they started doing LSD.
[01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:02.260]   And LSD is more cerebral, longer lasting,
[01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:04.900]   not as reassuring in a way as psilocybin.
[01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:08.700]   Sometimes he used to say that if they never got into LSD,
[01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:12.500]   they'd still be at Harvard with the psilocybin.
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.820]   So he was a great American psychologist,
[01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:19.700]   but then he got tired of the psychology game,
[01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:22.060]   you could say, or he would say that.
[01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:27.060]   He got more and more interested in cultural change
[01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:30.620]   and various musicians and artists
[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:32.180]   and all sorts of people started coming to him
[01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:34.260]   for the psychedelic experience that they are,
[01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:36.220]   in a way, for creativity, for other things.
[01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:40.660]   So he started hanging out with all sorts of famous people
[01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:45.660]   or creative people, and he stopped going to classes a lot.
[01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:50.980]   And Ram Dass, Richard Alpert,
[01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:55.980]   had given LSD to a student that Ram Dass
[01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:59.640]   was courageous enough to admit
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:02.560]   that he had a sexual interest in.
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.440]   They weren't supposed to give it undergraduates.
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:06.340]   That was about the only time that they ever did it.
[01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:09.980]   And psychedelics just getting more and more controversial,
[01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:11.700]   even in the early '60s.
[01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:13.300]   Eventually got kicked out of Harvard,
[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:16.300]   and then he became kind of a cultural icon
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:21.300]   for the counterculture and was hounded by the police
[01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:24.900]   and Nixon and spent a lot of time in jail.
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:26.780]   I mean, he's an incredible person.
[01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:30.780]   One thing that Ram Dass said is that,
[01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:34.760]   Richard Albert Ram Dass said,
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:37.340]   "I'm a rascal, but Leary's a scoundrel."
[01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:39.880]   What's the distinction?
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:41.520]   Rascals like in good fun.
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:45.260]   A scoundrel is like, you can't quite trust them, I think.
[01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:48.200]   I think that-
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:50.040]   Yeah, it's a spectrum of sorts.
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.120]   Yeah, I think that Leary was someone
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:55.560]   who a little bit got addicted to media attention.
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:12:00.200]   But I think that overall,
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:04.020]   he gets blamed a lot for the backlash against the '60s,
[01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:05.700]   the shutdown of psychedelic research.
[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:08.740]   I think that he is unfairly blamed for a lot of that.
[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:12.420]   I think when you look back at the '60s,
[01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:15.220]   the common narrative is that
[01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:17.780]   it was because psychedelics going wrong.
[01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:19.580]   People took psychedelics, they weren't prepared,
[01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:21.780]   they had emotional breakdowns, they went psychotic,
[01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:24.300]   they killed themselves, they did this or that,
[01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:27.120]   different problems of people taking psychedelics
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:31.540]   in contexts that they didn't feel fairly safe in,
[01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:33.020]   or just they weren't prepared,
[01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:34.460]   or they didn't know how much they were taking,
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:35.300]   or all this.
[01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:39.420]   So the backlash was because psychedelics going wrong.
[01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:42.660]   But I think the real reason, while that did happen,
[01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:45.500]   I think the real reason is psychedelics going right,
[01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:48.140]   and people having this sense of connection,
[01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:50.900]   and then the opposite of what the CIA was hoping,
[01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:54.200]   that it would kind of turn people inward
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:56.300]   and take them away from political struggles.
[01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:58.920]   It actually motivated people.
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:02.180]   Once you actually have these psychedelic experiences,
[01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:05.020]   your attitude towards death changes also.
[01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:09.060]   This idea of death becoming an intrinsic part of life,
[01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:12.100]   it's a natural cycle, it's not so much.
[01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:15.520]   So I think people realize that,
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:18.780]   while there's this billions of years of evolution,
[01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:21.380]   infinity, whatever that means in terms of time,
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:22.880]   that we're here for a very limited time,
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:24.740]   and they end up wanting to use their time well,
[01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:26.700]   they have a lessened fear of death,
[01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:29.780]   and they wanna build this paradise on earth here now
[01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:31.180]   instead of later.
[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:35.180]   So a lot of people really did get motivated
[01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:36.860]   to challenge the Vietnam War,
[01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:38.420]   to work on the environmental movement,
[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:40.540]   civil rights movement, women's rights movement,
[01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:42.300]   anti-militarism.
[01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:44.620]   And it was that challenge to the status quo
[01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:46.340]   that caused the backlash.
[01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:50.500]   So Leary is someone who, in 1990,
[01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:52.940]   we had a, now MAPS, they started in '86.
[01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:56.020]   So in 1990, we had this conference
[01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:57.740]   to raise money out in California,
[01:13:57.740 --> 01:13:59.580]   and Leary was there, and Ram Dass was there,
[01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:01.780]   and Ralph Metzner was there, and Andy Weil was there,
[01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:02.860]   and Terence McKenna was there,
[01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:04.820]   and Dennis McKenna was there, and all these.
[01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:09.820]   But there was one point where Tim was speaking,
[01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:11.900]   and afterwards I was asking him some questions.
[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:15.220]   And I said, "Do you have any advice for us
[01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:17.140]   on how to work with the government,
[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:19.580]   and how to bring these psychedelics forward?
[01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:20.740]   That's what we're trying to do.
[01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:22.580]   I've got this nonprofit for it."
[01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:23.980]   You know, we're trying to do this research.
[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:27.100]   What is your advice on how to bring this forward,
[01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:29.280]   and how to work with the government?
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:31.900]   And he said, "Fuck the government."
[01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:36.420]   He said, "I am so far past asking for permission
[01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:40.700]   for anything, but I'm glad that you're doing it."
[01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:44.020]   And then he held up my hand, like passing the torch.
[01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:45.220]   - Wow.
[01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:47.380]   - So it was, and that's one of my favorite photographs
[01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:48.880]   of me and Tim, where he's sort of like,
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:50.660]   but it was after this, "Fuck the government.
[01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:53.140]   I'm so far past asking for permission for anything,
[01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:54.820]   but I'm glad that you are."
[01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:57.760]   Now, I did follow-ups to the Good Friday experiment,
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.900]   and I did follow-ups, 25-year follow-up
[01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:01.060]   to the Good Friday experiment,
[01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:02.420]   about a 34-year follow-up
[01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:04.240]   to the Concord Prison experiment.
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:08.180]   What I discovered, in some ways I would say,
[01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:10.380]   is the key to the '60s, what I just told you.
[01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:12.820]   But in the follow-up to the Good Friday experiment
[01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:16.100]   that I did in the '80s, for my undergraduate thesis
[01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:18.620]   at New College in Sarasota, Florida,
[01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:21.060]   I eventually found 19 out of the 20 people.
[01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:23.620]   It was just, that was an enormous challenge,
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:24.940]   'cause their names were all lost,
[01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:27.320]   and it just took forever, years and years and years,
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:28.160]   to find them all.
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:30.620]   But I discovered that those people
[01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:32.220]   that had the psilocybin experience,
[01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:35.020]   in the midst of, 25 years later,
[01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:36.780]   with Nancy Reagan and Ronald Reagan,
[01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:39.760]   and if there ever were there a social pressure
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:42.600]   to disavow the validity of the psychedelic experience,
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:47.140]   that was then, and instead they affirmed it,
[01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:51.120]   that they thought, with all of this years of hindsight,
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:51.960]   now looking back,
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:54.900]   they thought it was a valid mystical experience.
[01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:57.820]   But I discovered that one of the persons
[01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:00.780]   who had the psilocybin,
[01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:05.660]   had this experience during the Good Friday service,
[01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:09.100]   that Reverend Howard Thurman was the minister.
[01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:11.060]   He was Martin Luther King's mentor.
[01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:12.820]   And Reverend Howard Thurman was the minister
[01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:15.300]   at Boston, at Marsh Chapel.
[01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:20.460]   Martin Luther King got his PhD at Boston University.
[01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:24.280]   And Howard Thurman had spent time with Gandhi.
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:26.780]   And so he was really kind of this hidden person
[01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:28.220]   behind the civil rights movement
[01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:31.180]   about nonviolence as their strategy.
[01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:33.540]   But he was interested in the political implications
[01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:34.500]   of the mystical experience.
[01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:37.580]   So he permitted this experiment to take place.
[01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:39.500]   And there were 20 divinity students
[01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:41.140]   from Andover Newton in the basement,
[01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:44.020]   and 10 experimenters, all the people on religion
[01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:46.740]   and psychology, like Houston Smith,
[01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:49.100]   and Walter Eason Clark, and Leary and Ram Dass,
[01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:51.940]   others were there as a support part of it.
[01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:54.460]   And the sermon was like three hours later.
[01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:56.420]   We actually have, three hours long,
[01:16:56.420 --> 01:16:58.500]   we actually have the original sermon
[01:16:58.500 --> 01:16:59.840]   from the Good Friday experiment,
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:02.180]   from Howard Thurman up on our website.
[01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:03.260]   It's incredible.
[01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:06.220]   But part of it was tell people there's a man on the cross.
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:09.220]   And this one person sort of heard that,
[01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:11.100]   and he thought, okay, I gotta do that.
[01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:14.100]   I got it to, Howard Thurman was such a dynamic speaker.
[01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:16.740]   He said, I gotta tell people there's a man on the cross.
[01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:18.140]   And so he said, what am I doing here
[01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:20.700]   in this basement chapel, listening to the service?
[01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:22.140]   I gotta go tell people there's a man on the cross.
[01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:24.500]   So he went, he thought he was just going to the bathroom,
[01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:25.340]   but he ran out the door.
[01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:27.460]   He's running down Commonwealth Avenue,
[01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:31.400]   and Houston Smith and Tim Leary go after him.
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:34.540]   And he had thought that since he should tell somebody,
[01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:35.980]   he should tell the president.
[01:17:35.980 --> 01:17:38.300]   Like, why not?
[01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:40.340]   But then he realized, well, the president's in Washington.
[01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:42.380]   I'm here in Boston.
[01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:44.260]   I'll just tell the president of the university.
[01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:46.100]   So anyway, he's running down the street,
[01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:48.780]   and Leary and Houston Smith go after him.
[01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:50.120]   And he doesn't want to go back inside.
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:50.960]   They finally get him.
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:51.860]   He's not hit by a car.
[01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:55.900]   But they end up giving him a shot of Thorazine.
[01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:58.220]   - What's Thorazine?
[01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:02.220]   - Thorazine is like a major anti-psychotic drug.
[01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:07.020]   It's a horrible drug, but it knocks people out,
[01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:08.680]   tranquilizes them.
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:10.180]   We would never do that today.
[01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:14.260]   We don't abort a difficult experience like that.
[01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:15.620]   But in any case, they hid that.
[01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:20.020]   That was not part of the write-up of this experiment.
[01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:22.300]   So what they did is, in a sense,
[01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:24.620]   a little bit exaggerated the benefits.
[01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:27.340]   It later became, three years later after the experiment,
[01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:28.660]   or four years in Time magazine,
[01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:30.380]   it said everybody that got psilocybin
[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:32.380]   had a mystical experience like them.
[01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:33.340]   So it wasn't true.
[01:18:33.340 --> 01:18:34.180]   Not everybody.
[01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:36.300]   Eight out of the 10 did, but not all 10.
[01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:37.500]   Not this guy.
[01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:40.940]   And they minimized the risks.
[01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:41.940]   So there was a bit of that.
[01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:43.860]   I think Tim was reckless in that way.
[01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:48.420]   He underplayed the risks and over-promised the benefits.
[01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:51.220]   And then the Concord Prison experiment,
[01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:55.980]   it turned out that Tim had fudged the data completely,
[01:18:55.980 --> 01:18:57.900]   and it wasn't really successful.
[01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:00.340]   So I fault him for that.
[01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:02.300]   The outside world was doing the opposite.
[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:06.140]   It was exaggerating the risks and blocking research.
[01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:09.340]   - He felt justified to fudge the data
[01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:12.260]   because the outside world was fudging, in a sense,
[01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:13.900]   the response to the--
[01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:15.300]   - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:16.140]   - Yeah.
[01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:20.420]   So that presents a very nice context.
[01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:24.580]   Fuck the government, but I'm glad that somebody
[01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:28.500]   is fighting the good fight from within
[01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:32.940]   and doing it the right way, which is where you are.
[01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:37.940]   So the '80s, let me ask, what is MAPS,
[01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:42.000]   the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies,
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.260]   and what is its mission throughout the years,
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:46.340]   throughout the decades?
[01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:49.960]   - Yeah, so MAPS is a nonprofit organization.
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:52.940]   I created it as a nonprofit pharmaceutical company.
[01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:57.180]   I created it in '86 after DEA,
[01:19:57.180 --> 01:19:58.740]   the Drug Enforcement Administration,
[01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:01.580]   criminalized MDMA in 1985.
[01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:05.820]   And that was after they started trying to do that in 1984.
[01:20:05.820 --> 01:20:09.620]   And as I mentioned, this Terrence McKenna sponsoring,
[01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:11.980]   motivating us to do this safety study.
[01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:15.460]   So we did that in preparation for this eventual crackdown
[01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:18.980]   because MDMA was called ADAM, used as a therapy drug,
[01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:21.780]   but it was also beginning to be sold as ecstasy,
[01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:23.860]   as a party drug, and that was taking place
[01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:25.540]   in public settings and bars.
[01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:28.980]   And so it was inevitable that the crackdown would happen.
[01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:32.740]   And so I had a nonprofit connected to Buckminster Fuller,
[01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:35.060]   Earth Metabolic Design Lab,
[01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:38.660]   that we used to support this lawsuit against the DEA
[01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:41.100]   to block them from criminalizing MDMA.
[01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:43.480]   We were winning in the court of public opinion
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:45.080]   and winning in the court.
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:49.640]   The DEA freaked out and the emergency scheduled MDMA in '85.
[01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:51.000]   The handwriting was on the wall,
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.480]   that they were not gonna permit
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:54.260]   the therapeutic use to continue
[01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:56.460]   'cause it gets in the way of the narrative of the drug war
[01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:58.300]   and these are terrible drugs.
[01:20:58.300 --> 01:21:02.700]   So in '86 is when I started MAPS as a nonprofit pharma
[01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:04.980]   because the strategy that I realized
[01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:09.460]   is that Americans are open to medicines,
[01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:14.460]   that tools to ease suffering, that was the opening wedge,
[01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:17.220]   the opening door to changing attitudes.
[01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:18.660]   And it would be through science,
[01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:21.620]   I would say that my religion is more science
[01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:23.180]   than anything else.
[01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:28.180]   And culture and religion are metaphorical,
[01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:31.020]   but often too much they become literal.
[01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:34.380]   But I felt that through science, through medicine,
[01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:36.780]   there would be a way to bring these drugs
[01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:37.860]   back to the surface.
[01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:42.300]   And the mission was always this mass mental health,
[01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:46.620]   this idea that what we need is to spiritualize humanity.
[01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:49.100]   Einstein said, "The splitting of the atom
[01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:52.140]   "has changed everything except our mode of thinking.
[01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:56.120]   "And hence we drift towards unparalleled catastrophe,
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:59.200]   "which shall be required if mankind is to survive
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:01.240]   "is a whole new mode of thinking."
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:05.420]   So what is that new mode of thinking?
[01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:11.740]   My presumption is that it's more of this mystical sense
[01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:14.020]   of thinking that we're all connected.
[01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:15.860]   And then if we realize that we're all connected,
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:17.460]   we're not gonna blow up the world.
[01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:20.220]   So a lot of people say that,
[01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:22.380]   if we could just give LSD all to world leaders,
[01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:25.580]   that would be, then they'd have these spiritual experiences,
[01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:26.400]   the world would be better.
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:28.340]   But actually I had a ketamine experience
[01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:30.200]   the day after that DMT experience
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:32.100]   I described with the inner Hitler.
[01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:34.500]   This ketamine experience was,
[01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:37.300]   I was above and behind Hitler as he was giving a speech,
[01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:40.220]   like in the Nuremberg rallies kind of thing.
[01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:42.280]   And I was trying to think, how do I get into his head?
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:44.540]   How do I undo what he wants to do?
[01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:46.260]   How can we deal with him?
[01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:48.960]   And I realized this whole new thing
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:50.500]   about the Heil Hitler salute.
[01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:53.240]   And he would like push energy out
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:55.600]   and then everybody would do the salute back to him.
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:57.180]   And so it's like the one to the many
[01:22:57.180 --> 01:22:58.520]   and the many to the one,
[01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:00.140]   all these people giving away their power.
[01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:03.220]   And then how it would just sort of ratchet up in intensity,
[01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:04.940]   like these vibrations.
[01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:07.460]   And I realized there's no way to get into his head.
[01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:08.780]   This idea we've talked about before,
[01:23:08.780 --> 01:23:10.140]   about you have to be willing.
[01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:10.980]   - Yes.
[01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:13.660]   - So what that sort of helped me understand
[01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:16.780]   is that the strategy has to be mass mental health.
[01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:18.500]   It's not about changing a few leaders.
[01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:21.260]   We need to change the mass of humanity
[01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:22.940]   to this new mode of thinking,
[01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:24.220]   this new spiritual way.
[01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:28.640]   So MAPS was a non-profit pharmaceutical company
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:30.560]   focused on psychedelics.
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:32.080]   Big Pharma wasn't doing this work.
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:33.880]   Government wasn't funding it.
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:35.440]   So the only source of funds I thought
[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:37.160]   would be through non-profit donations.
[01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:39.140]   And that's been true up until just a couple of years ago,
[01:23:39.140 --> 01:23:41.400]   now that we have the rise of these for-profits.
[01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:42.520]   But that's 'cause we've cleared out
[01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:44.960]   the regulatory obstacles.
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:47.560]   We've got more scientific data about the benefits
[01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:49.280]   funded through philanthropy.
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:51.220]   We've changed public opinion.
[01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:53.800]   And there's a lot less zeal for the drug war.
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:55.240]   So all of those things have changed.
[01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:58.920]   But at the time, it was mass mental health was the goal.
[01:23:58.920 --> 01:23:59.840]   Two tracks.
[01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:01.580]   One was drug development.
[01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:03.760]   The other was drug policy reform.
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:05.920]   So that it's not just available to people
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:07.320]   that have a clinical diagnosis,
[01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:10.520]   but people who are personal growth,
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:13.920]   or they should have access to it as well.
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:16.520]   I did not know at the time that no drug
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:19.160]   had ever been made into a medicine by a non-profit.
[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:23.120]   That was really good I didn't know that.
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:26.000]   I might have been a little bit more daunted.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.400]   And actually that didn't happen for 13 more years.
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:30.580]   It happened in 1999.
[01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:34.180]   And that was the abortion pill, RU46,
[01:24:34.180 --> 01:24:36.720]   that was approved in Europe, but it controversial.
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:39.360]   Nobody, no pharmaceutical company would take it.
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:41.460]   And it was John D. Rockefeller III
[01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:42.720]   through the Population Council,
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:45.560]   with the major donor being Warren Buffett.
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:46.400]   - Oh wow.
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:47.640]   - And the Rockefellers.
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:49.600]   And the Buffetts and some of the Pritzkers
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:51.200]   were involved in funding this.
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:54.160]   So that was the first non-profit.
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:57.080]   But the MAPS was designed as,
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:00.600]   from the very beginning,
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:03.440]   not academic research into psychedelics,
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:04.640]   but drug development.
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:06.360]   And that's a fundamental distinction.
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:08.600]   And that's why I think we're years ahead now
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:11.120]   of everybody else in terms of making
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:13.800]   a psychedelic-assisted therapy into a medicine.
[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:15.680]   Because our goal from the very beginning
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:18.120]   was not knowledge, not academic research,
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:20.080]   it was practical, it was drug development.
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:22.460]   How do we create new social structures?
[01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:25.120]   How do we create legal access to these things?
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:28.400]   Now, in December of 2014,
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:31.860]   we created the MAPS Public Benefit Corporation.
[01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:36.660]   So MAPS is a non-profit, but in our 35 years,
[01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:39.720]   we've raised about $110 million in donations.
[01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:43.800]   What I didn't know when I started MAPS,
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:46.520]   and it took me quite a few years,
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:49.760]   I didn't even know this till about eight, nine years ago,
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:54.860]   was that in 1984, Ronald Reagan had signed a bill
[01:25:54.860 --> 01:25:57.160]   to create incentives for developing drugs
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:25:58.840]   that were off patent.
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:02.040]   So MDMA was invented by Merck in 1912.
[01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:03.720]   It's in the public domain.
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:06.320]   These incentives are called data exclusivity,
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:08.360]   which means that if you make a drug into a medicine
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.260]   that does no patent protection,
[01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:13.440]   nobody can use your data for a period of time
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:14.680]   to market a generic.
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:17.460]   And that will effectively be, well, it's five years.
[01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:20.520]   You do pediatric studies, you get six months extension,
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:24.100]   and we are being required, if we succeed in adults,
[01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:26.520]   to work with adolescents with PTSD.
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:28.960]   It blocks a generic competitor from applying
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:30.840]   for it till that five and a half years is over.
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:33.140]   It takes FDA at least six months to review.
[01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:35.940]   So more or less six years of data exclusivity.
[01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:38.800]   10 years in Europe is data exclusivity.
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:42.300]   So the story then became to the donors
[01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:45.240]   that you're not gonna have to give us money forever
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:48.320]   because we can make money selling MDMA,
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:51.700]   but we wanna do two revolutionary things, you could say.
[01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:53.820]   One is psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy,
[01:26:53.820 --> 01:26:56.440]   but the other is marketing drugs.
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:59.760]   When you market it with the profit maximization motive,
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:02.480]   we end up in the extreme getting the distortions
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:03.520]   that we have in America,
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:06.720]   where we have the most expensive healthcare system
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:07.840]   in the world per capita,
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:11.000]   but our outcomes are down like 40 or 50 among the countries,
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:11.880]   our average outcomes.
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:13.900]   We don't have, third of the people or so
[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:17.360]   don't have insurance and it's just very inequitable.
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:21.220]   So what we're trying to do is show a different way
[01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:24.560]   to market drugs and it's a modification of capitalism
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:26.640]   is called the benefit corporation,
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:29.560]   where you maximize public benefit, not profit.
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:31.320]   You still make a profit.
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:34.160]   So selling MDMA for a profit is not something
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:36.560]   we could keep inside the nonprofit
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:39.480]   because it's taxable, it's a business.
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:42.760]   So we've created the MAPS public benefit corporation,
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:45.120]   which is 100% owned by the nonprofit.
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:48.080]   So we have a nonprofit that owns a pharma company.
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:51.240]   - And the mission of that pharma company
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:55.640]   is to maximize not profit, but maximize benefit for society.
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:56.700]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:56.700 --> 01:27:58.720]   Although there still will be profits
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:00.760]   and the profits that we're gonna make
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:03.940]   are going to be used towards the mission of MAPS,
[01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:05.920]   which is again, is this mass mental health
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:07.200]   and ending the drug war.
[01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:10.600]   And in fact, we've hired the Boston Consulting Group
[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:15.360]   to help us plot our commercialization strategy.
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:18.040]   And so there is some suggestions based,
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:19.920]   there's so many different assumptions in this,
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:22.040]   the number of therapists that we train,
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:24.480]   the price that we set for the MDMA,
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:27.440]   whether insurance companies will cover it,
[01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:30.680]   but there's the possibility of somewhere in the range
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:33.760]   of three quarters of a billion dollars in profits
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:36.140]   during this period of data exclusivity.
[01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:38.540]   Just from the US.
[01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:41.780]   And we're talking about trying to do this research
[01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:42.920]   around the world as well.
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:45.100]   So that's what the Benefit Corporation is.
[01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:47.300]   The Benefit Corporation is our pharmaceutical arm.
[01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:51.660]   We're about 130 people now, somewhere in that fluctuates,
[01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:54.100]   but one third of them are in the nonprofit.
[01:28:54.100 --> 01:28:57.820]   We do harm reduction, psychedelic harm reduction.
[01:28:57.820 --> 01:29:01.980]   We help create programs for people
[01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:04.420]   with difficult psychedelic experiences
[01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:06.640]   at Burning Man, at festivals all over the world,
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:07.480]   even in cities.
[01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:12.260]   We're now negotiating with the police, the city of Denver,
[01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:14.180]   because Denver has made the mushrooms
[01:29:14.180 --> 01:29:16.300]   the lowest enforcement priority.
[01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:18.940]   You know, Oregon has passed the Oregon Psilocybin Initiative.
[01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:21.460]   So in those areas where maybe more people
[01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:23.020]   are gonna gravitate to do psychedelics,
[01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:24.620]   we want there to be harm reduction
[01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:27.560]   so that we don't have bad stories coming out
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:29.060]   that would change that.
[01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:31.020]   So MAPS does the psychedelic harm reduction.
[01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:32.540]   We do public education.
[01:29:32.540 --> 01:29:33.380]   We do a lot of it.
[01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:35.100]   That's what you and I are doing right now.
[01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:36.300]   - We're doing that now.
[01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:40.300]   But also research towards-
[01:29:40.300 --> 01:29:42.980]   - Well, the research now is done in the Benefit Corp.
[01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:43.820]   - In the Benefit Corp.
[01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:46.140]   - Yeah, so what happens is people donate to MAPS,
[01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:47.240]   get a tax deduction.
[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:48.480]   MAPS transfers the money,
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:51.260]   or you could say invests in the Benefit Corp.
[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:53.020]   The Benefit Corp will do the research,
[01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:55.660]   and then MAPS is the sponsor,
[01:29:55.660 --> 01:29:57.660]   but then we will license the sale of MDMA
[01:29:57.660 --> 01:29:58.500]   to the Benefit Corp.
[01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:00.660]   - Got it, but the research is done
[01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:02.540]   with an eye towards creating something
[01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:04.620]   that has a big impact versus just research
[01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:06.140]   for knowledge's sake.
[01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:11.140]   - Yeah, yeah, because I'm interested in political change.
[01:30:11.140 --> 01:30:16.680]   The other part of it, which is that the brain
[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:20.180]   is the most complex thing we know in the universe.
[01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:22.440]   It's endless.
[01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:23.860]   I mean, when are we gonna really,
[01:30:23.860 --> 01:30:26.040]   like this idea of will we figure out telepathy?
[01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:28.780]   Will we figure out tapping into the collective unconscious?
[01:30:28.780 --> 01:30:31.220]   What is the extents of our brain?
[01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:32.340]   How does the brain actually work?
[01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:33.900]   Do you ask chemistry questions?
[01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:36.540]   So if it's just the pursuit of knowledge,
[01:30:36.540 --> 01:30:37.960]   that is an endless thing,
[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:39.500]   and how does that end the drug war?
[01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:41.160]   How does that help people directly?
[01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:43.740]   So that's why we're focused on drug development
[01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:45.780]   more than mechanism of action.
[01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:48.580]   - Before I ask you about one,
[01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:50.980]   but several really exciting studies,
[01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:54.780]   let me ask sort of a personal question for me.
[01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:59.140]   So if I wanted to get psychedelics
[01:30:59.140 --> 01:31:04.140]   from the MAPS Public Benefit Corporation
[01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:06.540]   and explore my own mind,
[01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:10.820]   how do I get to do that, and when?
[01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:12.060]   - You won't be able to.
[01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:12.900]   You'll never be able to.
[01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:14.460]   - This is very unfortunate.
[01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:17.220]   - Because the reason is because the Benefit Corp
[01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:20.180]   is designed as a pharmaceutical company,
[01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:23.860]   so we can only work on clinical indications.
[01:31:23.860 --> 01:31:25.860]   So let's say you come to me and you just say,
[01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:27.100]   "Oh, I'm really depressed.
[01:31:27.100 --> 01:31:30.560]   "Can I get MDMA to overcome my depression
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:33.020]   "or overcome my PTSD?"
[01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:35.860]   We'll have to do research in those indications.
[01:31:35.860 --> 01:31:38.300]   - And by when you say me, you mean like a doctor.
[01:31:38.300 --> 01:31:40.660]   So this would be prescribed in theory by doctors,
[01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:43.660]   or this would go through a doctor and a prescription.
[01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:45.660]   Okay, let me ask another question.
[01:31:45.660 --> 01:31:47.700]   - Oh, well, to further answer,
[01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:49.900]   so that's where the drug policy arm comes in,
[01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:51.260]   the drug policy reform.
[01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:54.620]   So you should be able to get access to psychedelics
[01:31:54.620 --> 01:31:56.660]   for your own personal growth,
[01:31:56.660 --> 01:31:59.260]   but that's not medicine.
[01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:02.260]   So that's why we need to medicalize,
[01:32:02.260 --> 01:32:04.700]   to have things covered by insurance,
[01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:07.540]   to change people's attitudes, the public attitudes,
[01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:11.820]   and then we get this subsequent drug policy reform.
[01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:12.940]   And we're talking about it
[01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:14.820]   in terms of licensed legalization.
[01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:18.380]   So my view is you should get a license to do psychedelics,
[01:32:18.380 --> 01:32:19.980]   you get a little education stuff,
[01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:21.260]   and then you should be able to buy it
[01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:22.100]   and do it on your own.
[01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:24.260]   - So let me rephrase the question and more specifically.
[01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:29.180]   So when can I, if I happen to have ailments of some kind
[01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:31.980]   where the doctor decides that psychedelics could help,
[01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:35.260]   when would you be, a loose estimate for you,
[01:32:35.260 --> 01:32:37.820]   of when a doctor will be able to prescribe to me
[01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:41.580]   something from MAPS Public Benefit Co.,
[01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:45.060]   and then when, for my personal growth and creativity,
[01:32:45.060 --> 01:32:46.460]   would I be able to get something?
[01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:49.260]   So just looking out, this isn't guaranteed,
[01:32:49.260 --> 01:32:51.160]   but your vision, your hope,
[01:32:54.140 --> 01:32:56.060]   for psychedelics in society.
[01:32:56.060 --> 01:33:00.020]   - Well, the end of 2023, so two and a half years from now,
[01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:02.300]   we anticipate FDA approval
[01:33:02.300 --> 01:33:05.040]   for the prescription use of MDMA for PTSD.
[01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:10.920]   Because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine,
[01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:14.820]   there is what's called off-label prescription.
[01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:16.900]   What that means, the label is what it's approved for.
[01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:20.380]   So the label will say, oh, this is approved for PTSD,
[01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:22.340]   but let's say you come in, anything else,
[01:33:22.340 --> 01:33:23.900]   social anxiety or whatever,
[01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:26.380]   you can go to the doctor, they can give it to you.
[01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:27.940]   It might not be covered by insurance,
[01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:30.580]   they have to be a little bit careful about malpractice.
[01:33:30.580 --> 01:33:32.660]   But I think the end of 2023
[01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:34.900]   is when you will be able to do that.
[01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:38.820]   Now, there's actually another program, very limited,
[01:33:38.820 --> 01:33:42.660]   called Expanded Access, which is compassionate use.
[01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:45.660]   Which means that, and we have approval for 50 people
[01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:48.940]   for compassionate use right now, we think that'll grow.
[01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:51.360]   So that's gonna open up in about two months.
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:53.700]   And so those are people with PTSD,
[01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:55.100]   they have to be treatment resistant,
[01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:56.140]   nothing has worked for them,
[01:33:56.140 --> 01:33:58.500]   and they can access MDMA
[01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:00.700]   while we're doing the phase three studies.
[01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:01.940]   - Wow.
[01:34:01.940 --> 01:34:04.300]   - But they have to pay for it themselves.
[01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:06.340]   The sponsor has to pay for all the research,
[01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:09.780]   but Expanded Access, because there's no control group,
[01:34:09.780 --> 01:34:12.980]   everybody gets the MDMA, people can pay for it themselves.
[01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:15.380]   And we think that'll start in a couple months.
[01:34:15.380 --> 01:34:17.780]   But it's very limited, it's limited to certain cities.
[01:34:17.780 --> 01:34:20.560]   There's also a program called Right to Try,
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:23.020]   which is passed through Congress.
[01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:26.140]   It's similar to this idea of compassionate use,
[01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:28.300]   but it cuts the FDA out of it,
[01:34:28.300 --> 01:34:32.980]   and patients can negotiate directly with pharma companies
[01:34:32.980 --> 01:34:34.620]   to get access to their drugs.
[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:38.820]   That's starting to happen, I think, in Canada now,
[01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:41.220]   they're letting people have compassionate access
[01:34:41.220 --> 01:34:44.200]   to psilocybin for life-threatening illness,
[01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:46.600]   because there has been studies with psilocybin
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:47.900]   for cancer patients and others
[01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:49.740]   with life-threatening illness.
[01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:51.820]   As far as your question about when will you be able
[01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:56.000]   to access this for personal growth outside of medicine,
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:59.020]   I'll take that to mean fully legally,
[01:34:59.020 --> 01:35:01.000]   where you can just go buy pure drugs somewhere,
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.260]   when will that happen?
[01:35:02.260 --> 01:35:05.660]   We already are starting to see the decriminalization
[01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:08.420]   in certain areas of plant psychedelics.
[01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:13.480]   And we see overall drug decrim that passed in Oregon,
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:16.100]   so that any drug is now, it's not legal,
[01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:20.780]   you can't really fully set up clinics to offer it to people,
[01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:22.700]   or there's no legal supply like that,
[01:35:22.700 --> 01:35:24.300]   but it's decriminalized.
[01:35:24.300 --> 01:35:27.540]   So my sense of things is based a lot on watching
[01:35:27.540 --> 01:35:29.020]   what happened with medical marijuana
[01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:30.240]   and marijuana legalization.
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:31.860]   So we're sitting here in Massachusetts
[01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:33.680]   where marijuana is legal,
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:36.320]   but what happened first was medical marijuana.
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:40.080]   So what we see is that medicalization,
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:43.380]   by demonstrating that under certain contexts,
[01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:47.700]   the risks are much less than the benefits,
[01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:49.360]   and then there are benefits,
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:50.900]   and then people hear stories
[01:35:50.900 --> 01:35:53.060]   about people that had gotten better,
[01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:54.580]   and then that changes their minds,
[01:35:54.580 --> 01:35:56.140]   and then eventually that builds up to
[01:35:56.140 --> 01:35:57.980]   why are we throwing people in jail for this?
[01:35:57.980 --> 01:35:59.220]   - It's just the culture, yeah.
[01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:02.580]   - Yeah, so I think that what we're gonna have 2023
[01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:07.060]   is MDMA approved by the FDA, chances are.
[01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:09.820]   Psilocybin will be a year or two after that.
[01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:10.860]   Then what we're gonna need
[01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:13.100]   is a decade of psychedelic clinics
[01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:16.240]   that are gonna roll out across America,
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:17.980]   also other countries as well,
[01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:20.080]   thousands of these psychedelic clinics.
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:22.720]   We already have hundreds of ketamine clinics
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:26.160]   that are ketamine for depression.
[01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:28.280]   More and more people are realizing that ketamine,
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:31.580]   when it's used with therapy, it's better than when it's not.
[01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:34.180]   But the therapists wanna be psychedelic therapists,
[01:36:34.180 --> 01:36:35.760]   they don't wanna be a ketamine therapist
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:38.400]   or an MDMA therapist, so they'll be cross-trained.
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:40.520]   So we'll have a decade of these thousands
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:42.400]   of psychedelic clinics and all these stories
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:43.240]   of people getting better.
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:46.440]   In 2035 is when I think that we will move
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:49.840]   to licensed legalization, which is when you will
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:52.980]   have the option of just going somewhere,
[01:36:52.980 --> 01:36:55.460]   once you've done this educational stuff.
[01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:58.100]   Potentially, I also think it would be better
[01:36:58.100 --> 01:37:02.140]   to have the opportunity for people to go for free,
[01:37:02.140 --> 01:37:04.380]   paid for by tax money, to these clinics,
[01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:05.820]   and you have your first experience
[01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:08.140]   with psychedelics under supervision.
[01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:10.040]   And you know what you're getting into,
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:14.140]   to ask the questionnaire what the risks are with the drugs,
[01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:15.780]   then you get your license.
[01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:18.020]   So 2035 is when I think that'll happen,
[01:37:18.020 --> 01:37:20.900]   and the clinics will be sites of these initiations.
[01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:23.140]   - Yes, and so it'll be a safe environment,
[01:37:23.140 --> 01:37:26.060]   just like you said, all the things that are actually
[01:37:26.060 --> 01:37:28.460]   maximize the likelihood of a pleasant experience
[01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:30.140]   and all those kinds of things.
[01:37:30.140 --> 01:37:32.540]   It is a frustratingly slow process,
[01:37:32.540 --> 01:37:35.080]   and the FDA being part of that process
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:37.500]   is very frustrating.
[01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:41.900]   Of course, there's benefits, but boy,
[01:37:41.900 --> 01:37:44.000]   well, I wish it could move a lot faster.
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.820]   - Yeah, well, one thing that I've learned
[01:37:45.820 --> 01:37:50.820]   from being a parent is that when you have little kids,
[01:37:50.820 --> 01:37:55.340]   it seems like they'll be with you forever,
[01:37:55.340 --> 01:37:58.260]   but then when they grow up and they go to college
[01:37:58.260 --> 01:37:59.780]   and they leave, you look back and like,
[01:37:59.780 --> 01:38:02.500]   where did that 20 years go?
[01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:05.260]   So we're still dealing with the legacy
[01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:08.000]   of the Civil War and slavery in America.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:11.580]   So actually, a 20-year plan is not that long.
[01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:16.580]   So while we say it's frustratingly slow, and it is,
[01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:21.420]   I mean, it's 50 years since the psychedelic 60s,
[01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:26.420]   and right now it's 36 years since MDMA was criminalized,
[01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:30.580]   and you think about all those people
[01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:34.220]   that committed suicide from PTSD or from anything else,
[01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:36.860]   and all those people that could have been helped
[01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:39.300]   if the DEA had accepted
[01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:41.140]   the administrative law judge recommendation
[01:38:41.140 --> 01:38:43.380]   that MDMA stay in Schedule III.
[01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:45.320]   It's tremendously sad.
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:48.700]   At the same time, culture evolves slowly.
[01:38:48.700 --> 01:38:50.420]   You read the Bible or you read all this stuff,
[01:38:50.420 --> 01:38:53.260]   we're not that different from people thousands of years ago.
[01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:56.900]   So how are we gonna really evolve enough
[01:38:56.900 --> 01:38:58.460]   over the next couple decades
[01:38:58.460 --> 01:39:01.540]   so we don't destroy the planet and don't kill each other?
[01:39:01.540 --> 01:39:03.700]   That's why I think psychedelics
[01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:05.300]   have an important role to play.
[01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:07.780]   That's why I've devoted my life to psychedelics,
[01:39:07.780 --> 01:39:09.620]   and it is frustratingly slow,
[01:39:09.620 --> 01:39:12.140]   and what I said to myself is
[01:39:12.140 --> 01:39:15.340]   our whole effort has not been fast enough.
[01:39:15.340 --> 01:39:18.620]   - Can we talk a little bit about PTSD and MDMA?
[01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:21.940]   There's this fascinating paper,
[01:39:21.940 --> 01:39:25.020]   came out on a fascinating study
[01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:27.900]   that you're a part of, that's a phase three study.
[01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:29.580]   Can you describe what the study is?
[01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:31.780]   Can you describe what phase three means?
[01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:35.020]   Can you describe what the findings are
[01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:39.020]   and why it's in fact so important and impactful?
[01:39:39.020 --> 01:39:41.820]   - Yeah, this study came out May 10th in Nature Medicine.
[01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:45.180]   So one of the highest impact factors in medicine journals.
[01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:46.140]   It was tremendous.
[01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:48.780]   So to make a drug into a medicine,
[01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:50.260]   the first thing you need to do
[01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:54.260]   is what are called non-clinical or preclinical studies,
[01:39:54.260 --> 01:39:57.020]   meaning safety established in animals.
[01:39:57.020 --> 01:39:58.420]   What does the drug do?
[01:39:58.420 --> 01:40:00.100]   What are the side effects in animals?
[01:40:00.100 --> 01:40:01.240]   Where do you see the risks?
[01:40:01.580 --> 01:40:05.620]   Then you negotiate with FDA to do phase one studies.
[01:40:05.620 --> 01:40:07.440]   And phase one studies are where you move
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:09.300]   from animals to humans.
[01:40:09.300 --> 01:40:11.940]   And those are more safety studies
[01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:14.500]   and trying to describe what the drug does
[01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:16.180]   so that you can determine
[01:40:16.180 --> 01:40:19.100]   if there is potential medical value there.
[01:40:19.100 --> 01:40:24.100]   Certain drugs like cancer drugs are so toxic
[01:40:24.100 --> 01:40:30.720]   that you don't have phase one studies in healthy volunteers.
[01:40:30.740 --> 01:40:32.940]   It's like phase one slash two,
[01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:35.360]   where you bring in the patients,
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:38.800]   but you still are doing sort of dose response safety studies,
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:40.100]   but you use patients.
[01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:43.080]   But most phase one studies are healthy volunteers.
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:46.860]   Phase two are where you start bringing in the patients
[01:40:46.860 --> 01:40:49.860]   and you start experimenting with various different things.
[01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:53.620]   The purpose of phase two is really just to design phase three.
[01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:56.860]   Now, again, I'm sort of putting out of the picture
[01:40:56.860 --> 01:40:58.600]   in another area is mechanism of action.
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:00.060]   How do these drugs work?
[01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:02.660]   Phase two, you're trying to figure out what they do,
[01:41:02.660 --> 01:41:05.980]   who your patient population is,
[01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:07.780]   what are the risks, who do you include,
[01:41:07.780 --> 01:41:10.200]   who do you exclude, what are the doses,
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:13.320]   what is your treatment, what are your measures?
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:19.540]   In our case, it was, how do you do a double blind study?
[01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:21.620]   That was a big part of phase two.
[01:41:21.620 --> 01:41:24.100]   That's a big challenge for psychedelic drugs.
[01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:27.420]   Any kind of drugs that have a real strong effect,
[01:41:27.420 --> 01:41:28.820]   how do you do a double blind study?
[01:41:28.820 --> 01:41:30.340]   - A double blind, sorry to interrupt,
[01:41:30.340 --> 01:41:33.740]   would mean that the patient should know,
[01:41:33.740 --> 01:41:37.420]   should not be aware whether it's a placebo or not.
[01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:38.260]   - And the researcher.
[01:41:38.260 --> 01:41:40.500]   - And the researcher is not aware.
[01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:42.340]   And so for that lack of awareness,
[01:41:42.340 --> 01:41:43.620]   when the effect is really strong,
[01:41:43.620 --> 01:41:45.580]   it's very difficult to do on both the researcher
[01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:46.900]   and the patient side.
[01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:50.520]   - Yes, and sometimes they talk about triple blind.
[01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:52.620]   So the other part is the raters
[01:41:52.620 --> 01:41:55.380]   that evaluate the symptoms and before and after.
[01:41:55.380 --> 01:41:57.060]   So you ideally want triple blind.
[01:41:57.060 --> 01:42:00.140]   You want the patients, the researchers
[01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:03.460]   and the evaluators of the outcomes, all of them,
[01:42:03.460 --> 01:42:06.700]   not to know what the drug, whether it was drug or placebo,
[01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:09.460]   and that's to reduce experiment or bias.
[01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:13.300]   So, and then you move to phase three.
[01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:15.620]   Once you've figured out how to design
[01:42:15.620 --> 01:42:16.860]   the phase three studies,
[01:42:16.860 --> 01:42:19.860]   and phase three are the large-scale multi-site
[01:42:19.860 --> 01:42:23.220]   placebo-controlled double blind studies
[01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:25.740]   where you must prove safety and efficacy
[01:42:25.740 --> 01:42:28.740]   in order to get permission to market the drug.
[01:42:28.740 --> 01:42:33.340]   Now, for us, when we started MAPS in '86,
[01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:36.260]   as I said, it was one year after the criminalization
[01:42:36.260 --> 01:42:40.060]   of MDMA in '85, we had five different protocols
[01:42:40.060 --> 01:42:44.160]   that were rejected by the FDA for studying with MDMA.
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:47.020]   And these were all various phase one studies.
[01:42:47.020 --> 01:42:49.460]   They came from Harvard, from UC San Francisco,
[01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:51.540]   from the University of Arizona,
[01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:54.060]   and Albuquerque, New Mexico, all over,
[01:42:54.060 --> 01:42:55.840]   and they were all rejected.
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:59.260]   1992, six years after we started,
[01:42:59.260 --> 01:43:02.120]   we got the first permission for phase one.
[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:05.780]   And that took us through much of the '90s.
[01:43:05.780 --> 01:43:08.380]   Again, things are slow because we have to raise the money
[01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:12.540]   through donations, and then in 1999
[01:43:12.540 --> 01:43:15.340]   is when we started the work with PTSD.
[01:43:15.340 --> 01:43:21.260]   And that then took us till November 29th, 2016,
[01:43:22.020 --> 01:43:25.460]   which is when we had the end of phase two meeting with FDA.
[01:43:25.460 --> 01:43:28.660]   So it took 30 years from the start of MAPS
[01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:31.420]   to the end of phase two meeting with FDA.
[01:43:31.420 --> 01:43:35.060]   And what we had discovered during phase two
[01:43:35.060 --> 01:43:38.500]   was several different key points.
[01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:41.900]   The drugs that are available right now for PTSD,
[01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:45.060]   the SSRIs, Zoloft and Paxil,
[01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:47.700]   that have been approved by FDA and regulators in Europe
[01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:49.860]   as well, the European Medicines Agency,
[01:43:49.860 --> 01:43:53.740]   the European Medicines Agency, for PTSD,
[01:43:53.740 --> 01:43:56.060]   they work better in women than in men,
[01:43:56.060 --> 01:43:58.940]   and they failed in combat-related PTSD.
[01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:03.460]   All right, so what we learned is that MDMA-assisted therapy
[01:44:03.460 --> 01:44:05.340]   works just as well in men or women,
[01:44:05.340 --> 01:44:07.940]   and it works in combat-related PTSD.
[01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:10.760]   It works in regardless of the cause of PTSD.
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:14.460]   We also discovered that even though there are stories
[01:44:14.460 --> 01:44:17.580]   that people take MDMA at raves, and they dance all night,
[01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:19.580]   and they overheat, and they get hyperthermia,
[01:44:19.580 --> 01:44:21.740]   and they die from overheating, which is true,
[01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:23.560]   and can happen from pure MDMA,
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:26.340]   or that sometimes people have heard
[01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:30.420]   about needing to cool down, and so they drink water,
[01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:32.780]   and then while they're dancing all night,
[01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:34.280]   and then they drink too much water,
[01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:35.660]   and then they dilute their blood,
[01:44:35.660 --> 01:44:37.900]   and they die from hyponatremia.
[01:44:37.900 --> 01:44:39.820]   So there are risks of MDMA,
[01:44:39.820 --> 01:44:42.220]   but we discovered that in a therapeutic setting,
[01:44:42.220 --> 01:44:43.780]   we can control all those risks,
[01:44:43.780 --> 01:44:46.020]   those things don't happen at all.
[01:44:46.020 --> 01:44:47.700]   So we discovered safety.
[01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:49.740]   We could demonstrate safety.
[01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:53.980]   We also figured out that our measure,
[01:44:53.980 --> 01:44:57.140]   the CAHPS, the Clinician Administrated PTSD Scale,
[01:44:57.140 --> 01:44:59.540]   that it's the gold standard all over the world
[01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:01.060]   for measuring PTSD symptoms.
[01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:03.700]   It's what the FDA and the EMA require.
[01:45:03.700 --> 01:45:06.020]   We discovered that it was a good measure for us,
[01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:08.100]   and that we could show changes in that.
[01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:12.060]   The other big thing that we learned is that,
[01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:14.320]   and we haven't mentioned this yet,
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:17.340]   but the work in the '50s and '60s with LSD,
[01:45:17.340 --> 01:45:19.100]   and psilocybin, and the modern research
[01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:20.900]   over the last 20 years with psilocybin
[01:45:20.900 --> 01:45:23.400]   and classic psychedelics has demonstrated
[01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:26.100]   that there's a link between this mystical experience,
[01:45:26.100 --> 01:45:29.420]   this unit of mystical experience, and therapeutic outcomes,
[01:45:29.420 --> 01:45:30.700]   for the treatment of addiction,
[01:45:30.700 --> 01:45:33.460]   for working with people with life-threatening illnesses,
[01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:37.500]   for OCD, for obsessive compulsive disorder,
[01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:40.500]   that there's, with the classic psychedelics,
[01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:43.300]   both in the '50 years ago, and then the research now,
[01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:45.900]   has been that there's a link between the depth
[01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:49.340]   of the mystical experience and therapeutic outcome.
[01:45:49.340 --> 01:45:52.960]   What we discovered is that that's not the case for MDMA,
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:55.580]   that people do score fairly high
[01:45:55.580 --> 01:45:57.580]   on the scales of mystical experience,
[01:45:57.580 --> 01:45:59.860]   not as high as they do with the classic psychedelics,
[01:45:59.860 --> 01:46:02.540]   but they do score pretty high on average,
[01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:06.380]   and a significant number of them have over the cutoff
[01:46:06.380 --> 01:46:09.180]   for what would be considered a full mystical experience.
[01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:11.900]   So enough to say that we could look at a correlation,
[01:46:11.900 --> 01:46:13.660]   and we didn't find any.
[01:46:13.660 --> 01:46:15.180]   The other thing that we discovered,
[01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:20.060]   and this was more humbling, I would say, for me personally,
[01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:22.460]   is that my dissertation at the Kennedy School,
[01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:24.500]   a big part of it was on,
[01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:26.300]   it's about the regulation of the medical use
[01:46:26.300 --> 01:46:27.900]   of psychedelics and marijuana.
[01:46:27.900 --> 01:46:29.260]   Big part of my dissertation was
[01:46:29.260 --> 01:46:31.740]   how to do the double-blind study,
[01:46:31.740 --> 01:46:33.160]   and I thought I'd solved the problem,
[01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:35.540]   and I persuaded my dissertation committee
[01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:37.460]   that I'd solved the problem,
[01:46:37.460 --> 01:46:41.220]   and the solution was therapy with low-dose MDMA
[01:46:41.220 --> 01:46:43.940]   versus therapy with full-dose MDMA,
[01:46:43.940 --> 01:46:46.820]   and everybody knows that they're gonna get MDMA.
[01:46:46.820 --> 01:46:49.020]   Most of these people have never done it before.
[01:46:49.020 --> 01:46:52.620]   They'll be confused about is it full-dose or low-dose,
[01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:56.180]   and then the challenge is to pick a dose
[01:46:56.180 --> 01:47:00.040]   that's high enough so that there is this confusion,
[01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:02.100]   but not so high that it's so therapeutic
[01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:04.780]   that we can't tell the difference between the groups.
[01:47:04.780 --> 01:47:09.340]   So we studied zero, meaning inactive placebo,
[01:47:09.340 --> 01:47:12.060]   25 milligrams, 30 milligrams, 40 milligrams,
[01:47:12.060 --> 01:47:14.620]   50 milligrams, 75 milligrams, 100 milligrams,
[01:47:14.620 --> 01:47:16.260]   125, and 150.
[01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:21.900]   What we discovered is that my dissertation was wrong
[01:47:21.900 --> 01:47:24.260]   and that there is no good solution
[01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:25.740]   to the double-blind problem.
[01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:31.260]   What we found is that, to our surprise, actually,
[01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:34.780]   was that 75 milligrams was an effective dose.
[01:47:34.780 --> 01:47:35.740]   - Oh, wow.
[01:47:35.740 --> 01:47:36.840]   - We didn't think that.
[01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:39.080]   I mean, the normal dose is like,
[01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:42.660]   full-dose is like 125 milligrams, something like that.
[01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:45.540]   But 75 milligrams was an effective dose,
[01:47:45.540 --> 01:47:47.980]   and we discovered that the lower doses,
[01:47:47.980 --> 01:47:50.140]   so I was half right, you could say.
[01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:53.400]   The doses of 25, 30, 40, 50,
[01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:57.040]   they could produce enough confusion
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:47:59.420]   that you could say that they were successful at blinding.
[01:47:59.420 --> 01:48:02.100]   Not perfectly, but enough confusion
[01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:05.100]   so that people, therapists, couldn't know for sure,
[01:48:05.100 --> 01:48:08.740]   so that there was this reduction of bias, you could say.
[01:48:08.740 --> 01:48:14.100]   But what we discovered, again, to our surprise,
[01:48:14.100 --> 01:48:17.420]   was that the low doses made people uncomfortable.
[01:48:17.420 --> 01:48:22.420]   They stimulated them, but they didn't reduce the fear,
[01:48:22.420 --> 01:48:26.860]   and so people still got better with the therapy,
[01:48:26.860 --> 01:48:29.720]   with low-dose MDMA, but if we gave them therapy
[01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:33.860]   with inactive placebo, they did even better
[01:48:33.860 --> 01:48:37.420]   than if we gave them therapy with low-dose MDMA.
[01:48:37.420 --> 01:48:41.380]   So we call it an antitherapeutic effect.
[01:48:41.380 --> 01:48:43.540]   I don't mean to imply that they got worse,
[01:48:43.540 --> 01:48:45.480]   but it made people uncomfortable.
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:47.420]   People didn't like it,
[01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:49.860]   but we would still help them make some progress.
[01:48:49.860 --> 01:48:52.660]   So we had the blinding, but what it meant
[01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:56.020]   by reducing the effect of therapy with inactive placebo
[01:48:56.020 --> 01:48:57.900]   is that it would make it easier for us
[01:48:57.900 --> 01:49:00.100]   to find a difference between the two groups.
[01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:02.780]   And so the real question is,
[01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:07.280]   if you can do it with therapy, why bother add a drug?
[01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:09.220]   So we went to the FDA,
[01:49:09.220 --> 01:49:12.020]   and so this was what we discovered during phase two.
[01:49:12.020 --> 01:49:15.140]   We went to the FDA at this end of phase two meeting,
[01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:17.580]   and we said, "We can give you blinding,
[01:49:17.580 --> 01:49:20.260]   but it will make it easier for us
[01:49:20.260 --> 01:49:22.060]   to find a difference between the two groups."
[01:49:22.060 --> 01:49:26.340]   And so we suggest that we do therapy with inactive placebo
[01:49:26.340 --> 01:49:29.460]   versus therapy with full-dose MDMA.
[01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:30.940]   That will cause a problem,
[01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:34.380]   because most people will be able to tell what they've got.
[01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:37.480]   What Tom Laughrin, a doctor who used to be
[01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:41.700]   head of psychiatry products at FDA, is our main advisor.
[01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:44.180]   So the first thing he said is that the double-blind
[01:49:44.180 --> 01:49:47.400]   fails in practice a lot, even with SSRIs,
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:49.460]   because there are certain side effects
[01:49:49.460 --> 01:49:50.780]   that you have with these drugs,
[01:49:50.780 --> 01:49:52.660]   and the doctors who are doing these research,
[01:49:52.660 --> 01:49:55.300]   when you're reporting your side effects,
[01:49:55.300 --> 01:49:56.420]   they can say, "Oh, that's probably,
[01:49:56.420 --> 01:49:58.340]   you got the active drug instead of the placebo."
[01:49:58.340 --> 01:50:01.820]   So the double-blind is, in theory, is terrific,
[01:50:01.820 --> 01:50:05.800]   but in practice, it doesn't always work quite as well.
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:10.180]   And so what Tom said is that there are two main approaches
[01:50:10.180 --> 01:50:13.260]   that they think are important to reduce bias.
[01:50:13.260 --> 01:50:15.220]   The first one is easy to do.
[01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:17.840]   It's called random assignment.
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:20.260]   So sometimes there are studies where
[01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:24.240]   you'll treat a bunch of people with something,
[01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:26.740]   and some fraction of them will get better, and some won't,
[01:50:26.740 --> 01:50:29.220]   and then you say, "Okay, all those who didn't get better,
[01:50:29.220 --> 01:50:31.860]   who volunteers to get this new treatment?"
[01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:33.220]   And then you give them the new treatment,
[01:50:33.220 --> 01:50:34.380]   but the people that volunteer
[01:50:34.380 --> 01:50:36.020]   are more likely to want to get better.
[01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:39.700]   They're not representative sample of everybody that has.
[01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:41.700]   So when you have random assignment,
[01:50:41.700 --> 01:50:43.860]   everybody is similarly motivated,
[01:50:43.860 --> 01:50:47.260]   and meets the same inclusion-exclusion criteria.
[01:50:47.260 --> 01:50:48.660]   So that's what we're told.
[01:50:48.660 --> 01:50:50.420]   Of course, we need random assignment.
[01:50:50.420 --> 01:50:53.380]   The other part was when the bias,
[01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:55.780]   double-blind doesn't work as well,
[01:50:55.780 --> 01:50:59.820]   then the system of independent raters
[01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:02.980]   is especially important of how you do that.
[01:51:02.980 --> 01:51:07.980]   So we have over a pool of raters, over 20 of them,
[01:51:07.980 --> 01:51:11.900]   and we do this monthly inter-rater reliability tests
[01:51:11.900 --> 01:51:15.220]   to make sure that they evaluate this,
[01:51:15.220 --> 01:51:17.660]   so that they're given a videotape of a PTSD patient,
[01:51:17.660 --> 01:51:19.660]   and then they're supposed to rate them
[01:51:19.660 --> 01:51:20.800]   according to their symptoms.
[01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:22.760]   And then we sort of make sure
[01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:24.980]   that we've got this calibrated rater pool.
[01:51:25.860 --> 01:51:28.780]   And it's all done by Zoom, by telemedicine,
[01:51:28.780 --> 01:51:30.900]   and they're randomly assigned to the next person
[01:51:30.900 --> 01:51:32.620]   that needs a rating.
[01:51:32.620 --> 01:51:34.060]   - So you said 20 raters.
[01:51:34.060 --> 01:51:35.820]   - Yeah, so we've got like 20 raters.
[01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:39.580]   And what we want to do is make it so that
[01:51:39.580 --> 01:51:43.900]   each rater sees each patient only once, maybe twice,
[01:51:43.900 --> 01:51:47.140]   but not tracking them through the study.
[01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:49.460]   So that tries to reduce the bias in the raters,
[01:51:49.460 --> 01:51:52.180]   that they don't know where this person is in the study.
[01:51:54.780 --> 01:51:59.060]   - And so there's a fellow, Bob Temple,
[01:51:59.060 --> 01:52:01.300]   who's like the old wise man at the FDA.
[01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:03.700]   He's been there since 1972.
[01:52:03.700 --> 01:52:05.880]   He was in charge of the Office of Science Policy,
[01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:09.860]   and they brought him into the final meeting of this process
[01:52:09.860 --> 01:52:11.880]   where we are trying to design phase three.
[01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:14.660]   So once FDA said, "Yes, you can go to phase three,"
[01:52:14.660 --> 01:52:17.860]   that was November 29th, 2016,
[01:52:17.860 --> 01:52:20.320]   we then negotiated for eight months
[01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:21.740]   on the design of phase three,
[01:52:21.740 --> 01:52:23.420]   and all of the other information-
[01:52:23.420 --> 01:52:24.460]   - This is fascinating.
[01:52:24.460 --> 01:52:25.300]   - Is gonna need.
[01:52:25.300 --> 01:52:26.740]   - This process of design.
[01:52:26.740 --> 01:52:28.900]   - Oh, it was, you know,
[01:52:28.900 --> 01:52:31.900]   to the extent that I have any artistic creativity,
[01:52:31.900 --> 01:52:33.600]   it's in protocol design.
[01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:35.820]   I really love that.
[01:52:35.820 --> 01:52:36.940]   - So you enjoy this process.
[01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:37.960]   - I love it, I love it,
[01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:41.780]   because it's always trade-offs, and it's, you know,
[01:52:41.780 --> 01:52:44.860]   and I acknowledge, you know, that we are all biased.
[01:52:44.860 --> 01:52:47.140]   And so how do you, there's something beautiful
[01:52:47.140 --> 01:52:49.660]   about the scientific process
[01:52:49.660 --> 01:52:51.460]   designed to get you to the truth.
[01:52:52.740 --> 01:52:54.540]   Especially when that scientific process
[01:52:54.540 --> 01:52:57.060]   is trying to get to the truth of the human organism,
[01:52:57.060 --> 01:52:58.740]   which is so complicated.
[01:52:58.740 --> 01:53:01.660]   So it's very difficult to dissect,
[01:53:01.660 --> 01:53:04.340]   to get the strong effects.
[01:53:04.340 --> 01:53:07.660]   And when you're analyzing, when you have like raiders,
[01:53:07.660 --> 01:53:09.600]   they're watching a video,
[01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:13.780]   there's, removing subjectivity from that
[01:53:13.780 --> 01:53:15.460]   is very, very challenging.
[01:53:15.460 --> 01:53:17.160]   - Yeah, very much so.
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:21.640]   And so we came to this agreement with FDA, though,
[01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:25.940]   that we would use this independent raider pool.
[01:53:25.940 --> 01:53:30.860]   And so we learned in phase two, again,
[01:53:30.860 --> 01:53:31.860]   that the double-blind,
[01:53:31.860 --> 01:53:33.980]   there was no solution to the double-blind problem.
[01:53:33.980 --> 01:53:37.060]   And both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency
[01:53:37.060 --> 01:53:39.660]   in the end agreed that the best design
[01:53:39.660 --> 01:53:41.780]   was therapy with inactive placebo
[01:53:41.780 --> 01:53:43.780]   versus therapy with full-dose MDMA,
[01:53:43.780 --> 01:53:47.100]   accepting the fact that most people will be able to tell
[01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:50.240]   whether they got nothing or they got full-dose MDMA.
[01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:52.420]   Most therapists will be able to tell the difference,
[01:53:52.420 --> 01:53:55.900]   but that makes a harder test for us
[01:53:55.900 --> 01:53:57.740]   to show a difference between the two groups
[01:53:57.740 --> 01:54:00.100]   because we're giving them inactive placebo
[01:54:00.100 --> 01:54:03.960]   and not the antitherapeutic effect of low-dose MDMA.
[01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:06.080]   So once we started phase three,
[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:10.520]   so then we were able to start in 2018 phase three.
[01:54:10.520 --> 01:54:13.660]   And the paper in "Nature Medicine" that just came out
[01:54:13.660 --> 01:54:18.160]   was the results of our first phase three study.
[01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:20.220]   We came to agreement with FDA
[01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:22.660]   that we would do two phase three studies.
[01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:24.860]   Each would have 100 persons in them.
[01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:29.220]   And what the FDA said to us is that they thought
[01:54:29.220 --> 01:54:33.520]   that we could prove efficacy with smaller numbers
[01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:36.420]   than they wanted to see for safety.
[01:54:36.420 --> 01:54:38.860]   The reason they said that is that in phase two,
[01:54:38.860 --> 01:54:41.340]   we had a large effect size.
[01:54:41.340 --> 01:54:43.420]   So from a statistical point of view,
[01:54:43.420 --> 01:54:47.040]   the bigger of an effect that you're looking for,
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:49.080]   the fewer number of people you need
[01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:51.380]   to get statistical significance.
[01:54:51.380 --> 01:54:53.300]   When you're trying to find small differences,
[01:54:53.300 --> 01:54:54.800]   you need large numbers of people
[01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:57.900]   to sort of work out the noise.
[01:54:57.900 --> 01:55:04.240]   So we came to agreement on two 100-person phase three studies.
[01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:07.500]   - And the idea is that it's very possible
[01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:11.160]   that the first part, the first study would show the efficacy
[01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:13.140]   because the effect is so strong.
[01:55:13.140 --> 01:55:16.140]   - Yeah, yeah, and the second, but also safety as well.
[01:55:16.140 --> 01:55:19.620]   So one of the things we also realized
[01:55:19.620 --> 01:55:22.420]   when you work with a highly stigmatized drug
[01:55:22.420 --> 01:55:26.960]   in the midst of still the drug war and prohibition,
[01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:31.300]   that we need highly sympathetic subjects.
[01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:34.060]   And we need to make the best case we can,
[01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:37.060]   which means we need to work with the hardest cases
[01:55:37.060 --> 01:55:38.420]   so that this is really needed.
[01:55:38.420 --> 01:55:40.940]   And so we end up enrolling people.
[01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:45.060]   The first study was chronic severe PTSD.
[01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:47.300]   And unlike many studies of PTSD,
[01:55:47.300 --> 01:55:50.660]   we enroll people that have previously attempted suicide.
[01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:51.500]   - Wow.
[01:55:51.500 --> 01:55:53.060]   - So we have multiple people
[01:55:53.060 --> 01:55:54.580]   that have tried to kill themselves
[01:55:54.580 --> 01:55:57.540]   that we felt like if we were to exclude them,
[01:55:57.540 --> 01:55:58.460]   what are we doing?
[01:55:58.460 --> 01:56:00.560]   Those are the people that need it the most.
[01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:04.340]   So we came to this agreement with FDA.
[01:56:04.340 --> 01:56:09.140]   We're gonna work with chronic severe PTSD patients,
[01:56:09.140 --> 01:56:11.660]   including those that had attempted suicide.
[01:56:11.660 --> 01:56:14.860]   And we would do these two 100-person studies.
[01:56:14.860 --> 01:56:19.780]   And we also negotiated what's called an interim analysis.
[01:56:19.780 --> 01:56:24.460]   So what that means is that when the study is underway,
[01:56:24.460 --> 01:56:28.620]   and often big, big studies,
[01:56:28.620 --> 01:56:30.340]   they have this kind of interim analysis
[01:56:30.340 --> 01:56:31.580]   where what you do is,
[01:56:31.580 --> 01:56:35.140]   and for us, we negotiated when we had 60% or 60 people
[01:56:35.140 --> 01:56:37.420]   had reached the primary outcome measure
[01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:39.860]   and all 100 had been enrolled,
[01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:42.060]   then we would take a look at the data.
[01:56:42.060 --> 01:56:47.020]   And if the statistical analysis that we did
[01:56:47.020 --> 01:56:52.020]   was showing based on a certain effect size
[01:56:52.020 --> 01:56:55.100]   that we chose based on what we saw in phase two,
[01:56:55.100 --> 01:56:56.580]   the interim analysis is for
[01:56:56.580 --> 01:56:59.260]   what's called sample size re-estimation.
[01:56:59.260 --> 01:57:00.780]   So what it means is if the results
[01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:02.140]   aren't as good as you thought they would,
[01:57:02.140 --> 01:57:04.120]   you can add more people.
[01:57:04.120 --> 01:57:07.760]   And then you'll get statistical significance.
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:10.480]   It means that your effect isn't as strong as you thought.
[01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:12.380]   It'll be harder to get insurance to cover it,
[01:57:12.380 --> 01:57:14.420]   but FDA will still approve it
[01:57:14.420 --> 01:57:18.780]   because FDA also believes that these are group averages.
[01:57:18.780 --> 01:57:20.740]   There may be some people that will later figure out
[01:57:20.740 --> 01:57:22.480]   respond better than others.
[01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:25.060]   So they'll approve it if it's statistically significant,
[01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:27.260]   even if it has a low effect size.
[01:57:27.260 --> 01:57:30.100]   The SSRIs have low effect size.
[01:57:30.100 --> 01:57:35.100]   So we did the interim analysis in March of 2020.
[01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:38.060]   And what we discovered to our delight
[01:57:38.060 --> 01:57:41.740]   was that we did not need to add any subjects.
[01:57:41.740 --> 01:57:42.780]   That's all we were told.
[01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:45.820]   We weren't told like, what is the results?
[01:57:45.820 --> 01:57:48.100]   We were just told all we were gonna get is a number,
[01:57:48.100 --> 01:57:50.960]   zero, or you need to add X numbers of people to the study
[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:53.220]   to get statistical significance.
[01:57:53.220 --> 01:57:55.380]   That's right around the time that COVID hit
[01:57:55.380 --> 01:57:56.740]   and lockdowns happened.
[01:57:56.740 --> 01:57:59.260]   And we ended up negotiating with FDA
[01:57:59.260 --> 01:58:02.580]   that we would end the study with 90 people instead of 100.
[01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:06.660]   It took a while for us to end up doing that.
[01:58:06.660 --> 01:58:08.340]   So the paper that we just published
[01:58:08.340 --> 01:58:10.900]   is on the results of 90 people.
[01:58:10.900 --> 01:58:13.220]   I think it was 46 in the MDMA group,
[01:58:13.220 --> 01:58:15.400]   44 in the placebo group.
[01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:21.340]   And what we discovered was that the study worked better
[01:58:21.340 --> 01:58:23.260]   than we had even hoped.
[01:58:23.260 --> 01:58:25.460]   So the first thing is that
[01:58:25.460 --> 01:58:27.180]   you look at statistical significance.
[01:58:27.180 --> 01:58:28.540]   You have to get 0.05,
[01:58:28.540 --> 01:58:30.820]   which basically means a nickel out of a dollar,
[01:58:30.820 --> 01:58:34.820]   one in 20 chance that the difference between the two groups
[01:58:34.820 --> 01:58:36.300]   is due to some random factor
[01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:38.180]   rather than to your intervention.
[01:58:38.180 --> 01:58:42.020]   And in this case, the placebo group gets therapy
[01:58:42.020 --> 01:58:44.800]   and then with inactive placebo,
[01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:49.180]   and then the group gets MDMA with active placebo.
[01:58:49.180 --> 01:58:52.180]   So you have to get 0.05.
[01:58:52.180 --> 01:58:53.780]   There's another measure
[01:58:53.780 --> 01:58:56.840]   that the FDA uses sometimes called robust,
[01:58:56.840 --> 01:58:59.500]   which means one in a thousand
[01:58:59.500 --> 01:59:01.580]   instead of one in 20, one in a thousand.
[01:59:01.580 --> 01:59:04.940]   And if you get a robust results, 0.001,
[01:59:05.780 --> 01:59:08.380]   and you meet some other criteria,
[01:59:08.380 --> 01:59:11.540]   they might agree to approve the drug
[01:59:11.540 --> 01:59:15.100]   on the basis of just one phase three study instead of two.
[01:59:15.100 --> 01:59:16.580]   Because when you think about it,
[01:59:16.580 --> 01:59:20.180]   a one in 20 chance for your first phase three study,
[01:59:20.180 --> 01:59:23.180]   a one in 20 chance for your second phase three study,
[01:59:23.180 --> 01:59:28.180]   you multiply that together, it's one in 400, 0.025.
[01:59:28.180 --> 01:59:32.660]   That's pretty good.
[01:59:32.660 --> 01:59:35.780]   So robust, 0.001 is even better
[01:59:35.780 --> 01:59:40.060]   than two independent phase three studies each at 0.05.
[01:59:40.060 --> 01:59:46.180]   What we ended up getting was one in 10,000, 0.0001.
[01:59:46.180 --> 01:59:48.180]   Outrageous.
[01:59:48.180 --> 01:59:50.660]   Incredibly, so that's a measure
[01:59:50.660 --> 01:59:52.360]   of both the difference between the two groups
[01:59:52.360 --> 01:59:53.520]   and the variability.
[01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:58.700]   And so what it meant is that we had minimal variability
[01:59:58.700 --> 02:00:00.380]   that most people who got the MDMA
[02:00:00.380 --> 02:00:03.460]   got quite a large amount of benefit from it.
[02:00:03.460 --> 02:00:05.140]   And most people who got the placebo
[02:00:05.140 --> 02:00:07.300]   were more or less in the same range as well.
[02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:08.780]   - That's really exciting, by the way.
[02:00:08.780 --> 02:00:13.500]   I mean, I suppose it's exciting
[02:00:13.500 --> 02:00:16.420]   from a perspective of approval by the FDA.
[02:00:16.420 --> 02:00:18.260]   Maybe perhaps that's the way you're seeing it,
[02:00:18.260 --> 02:00:22.940]   but it's also exciting because it has a chance
[02:00:22.940 --> 02:00:25.960]   to help people that are truly suffering, yeah.
[02:00:25.960 --> 02:00:29.000]   - Well, if we can get one in 10,000
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.320]   in the first phase three study,
[02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:34.420]   chances are we can get one in 20 in the second.
[02:00:34.420 --> 02:00:36.520]   So it's really gonna be about safety
[02:00:36.520 --> 02:00:38.420]   for us in the second phase three study.
[02:00:38.420 --> 02:00:44.760]   Now, you can have a large P value, a large significance,
[02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:49.680]   but you could have an effect that's not very significant.
[02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:51.120]   It's not clinically significant.
[02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:52.800]   You can have statistical significance
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:55.380]   without clinical significance.
[02:00:55.380 --> 02:00:58.020]   And as I said, the more people you get in the study,
[02:00:58.020 --> 02:00:59.940]   you can find smaller and smaller differences
[02:00:59.940 --> 02:01:01.080]   between two groups.
[02:01:01.080 --> 02:01:07.000]   Now, we showed that we had a very large effect size.
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:10.240]   So effect size is based on-
[02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:11.480]   - That scale you mentioned?
[02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:13.520]   - Well, the scale of the effect size
[02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:17.280]   is based on standard deviations.
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:20.380]   So an effect size of one means that your results
[02:01:20.380 --> 02:01:23.320]   are one standard deviation away from the norm.
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:24.980]   That's considered very large.
[02:01:24.980 --> 02:01:30.980]   The SSRIs, because they were like 0.3, 0.4 effect size,
[02:01:30.980 --> 02:01:34.140]   that's considered small effect size.
[02:01:34.140 --> 02:01:36.920]   Medium is starting to be around 0.6,
[02:01:36.920 --> 02:01:40.040]   and 0.8 and above are large effect sizes.
[02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:45.660]   We had what's called placebo-subtracted effect size.
[02:01:45.660 --> 02:01:46.860]   There's two different ways to look at it.
[02:01:46.860 --> 02:01:49.420]   Placebo-subtracted means you kind of look at the difference
[02:01:49.420 --> 02:01:50.700]   between your two groups.
[02:01:51.580 --> 02:01:54.480]   And what that is for us, since one group had therapy
[02:01:54.480 --> 02:01:56.240]   and one had therapy plus MDMA,
[02:01:56.240 --> 02:01:58.880]   the placebo-subtracted effect size
[02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:01.980]   is basically the effect of just the MDMA,
[02:02:01.980 --> 02:02:03.600]   'cause you've kind of washed out the therapy.
[02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:05.240]   That was 0.91.
[02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:08.440]   So we had a large effect size, which was different.
[02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:11.840]   - Wow, over, so 0.91 over just the therapy,
[02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:13.020]   so over the placebo.
[02:02:13.020 --> 02:02:13.920]   - Yeah. - Wow.
[02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:17.440]   - Now, when we do the within group,
[02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:21.580]   meaning the group that just got the MDMA plus therapy,
[02:02:21.580 --> 02:02:23.940]   look at their baseline and their outcomes.
[02:02:23.940 --> 02:02:25.340]   That's another way to look at it.
[02:02:25.340 --> 02:02:27.460]   And that's what's gonna actually happen in practice,
[02:02:27.460 --> 02:02:30.900]   'cause people are gonna get MDMA plus therapy.
[02:02:30.900 --> 02:02:32.660]   That's 2.1 effect size,
[02:02:32.660 --> 02:02:35.000]   two standard deviations away from the norm.
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:36.580]   It's enormous effect size.
[02:02:36.580 --> 02:02:38.200]   - Yeah.
[02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:43.200]   - The other part is that we had no effect by site,
[02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:44.940]   which is very important.
[02:02:44.940 --> 02:02:47.700]   So we had 15 sites, two in Israel, two in Canada,
[02:02:47.700 --> 02:02:49.500]   11 throughout the United States.
[02:02:49.500 --> 02:02:53.300]   The FDA looks at, is there a site effect?
[02:02:53.300 --> 02:02:54.580]   Because what that might mean is
[02:02:54.580 --> 02:02:56.260]   maybe you've got all your patients,
[02:02:56.260 --> 02:02:58.220]   or most of your patients going to this one site,
[02:02:58.220 --> 02:03:00.960]   which is these highly experienced therapists,
[02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:03.140]   and they're like hippies from way back,
[02:03:03.140 --> 02:03:05.100]   and they're super experienced with psychedelics,
[02:03:05.100 --> 02:03:07.320]   and they're getting great results,
[02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:09.220]   but nobody else gets good results.
[02:03:09.220 --> 02:03:11.500]   So we had no effect by site, which means-
[02:03:11.500 --> 02:03:12.340]   - That's incredible.
[02:03:12.340 --> 02:03:14.900]   - That we've been able to train all these new therapists.
[02:03:14.900 --> 02:03:19.900]   We had about 80 therapists working at all these 15 sites.
[02:03:19.900 --> 02:03:23.540]   We also discovered that there's a group
[02:03:23.540 --> 02:03:26.920]   that's considered to be very difficult to treat,
[02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:29.900]   which is called the dissociative subtype.
[02:03:29.900 --> 02:03:32.920]   So when people are traumatized,
[02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:37.700]   one of the ways to psychologically survive that
[02:03:37.700 --> 02:03:38.900]   is you dissociate.
[02:03:38.900 --> 02:03:41.000]   It's like you're not there.
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.460]   When you do that, though, it's hard to come back,
[02:03:43.460 --> 02:03:44.980]   because when you come back,
[02:03:44.980 --> 02:03:47.500]   then you get all these painful memories and fearful.
[02:03:47.500 --> 02:03:50.300]   And so the extreme of that
[02:03:50.300 --> 02:03:53.100]   is called dissociative identity disorder,
[02:03:53.100 --> 02:03:56.420]   kind of like schizophrenia almost, dissociative identity.
[02:03:56.420 --> 02:04:01.060]   So we let people in who are on the dissociative subtype,
[02:04:01.060 --> 02:04:03.140]   and those are considered to be the hardest to treat,
[02:04:03.140 --> 02:04:07.740]   because the theory is that you need to be ego intact.
[02:04:07.740 --> 02:04:10.180]   As I said, the mystical experience is not correlated
[02:04:10.180 --> 02:04:11.260]   with therapeutic outcomes,
[02:04:11.260 --> 02:04:13.860]   and you need to be talking about what traumatized you
[02:04:13.860 --> 02:04:15.820]   and working through that and expressing it,
[02:04:15.820 --> 02:04:18.020]   letting it out, not keeping it in.
[02:04:18.020 --> 02:04:22.540]   So the dissociative subtype seems like it's harder
[02:04:22.540 --> 02:04:24.500]   for them to get back into the event,
[02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:26.260]   'cause they're so dissociated.
[02:04:26.260 --> 02:04:29.060]   What we showed is that those people did even better
[02:04:29.060 --> 02:04:31.420]   on average than everybody else.
[02:04:31.420 --> 02:04:33.220]   So that MDMA is integrative.
[02:04:33.220 --> 02:04:36.940]   It helps people who are so separate
[02:04:36.940 --> 02:04:39.100]   that they make even more rapid progress.
[02:04:39.100 --> 02:04:41.980]   - So it's almost like the MDMA made it more difficult
[02:04:41.980 --> 02:04:43.460]   for them to dissociate.
[02:04:43.460 --> 02:04:45.780]   - Yes, yeah, or you could say it made it easier
[02:04:45.780 --> 02:04:47.220]   for them to remember.
[02:04:47.220 --> 02:04:49.540]   - Yes, exactly, to reverse the dissociation.
[02:04:49.540 --> 02:04:53.620]   - Yeah, and we find that MDMA enhances memory for the trauma
[02:04:53.620 --> 02:04:57.620]   so that you can have these unconscious memories
[02:04:57.620 --> 02:04:59.500]   or memories that you cannot remember
[02:04:59.500 --> 02:05:00.940]   or that you've suppressed so much,
[02:05:00.940 --> 02:05:02.580]   but they distort your view.
[02:05:02.580 --> 02:05:04.760]   Your filter of the world is distorted
[02:05:04.760 --> 02:05:07.420]   by these fearful memories that the world can't be trusted,
[02:05:07.420 --> 02:05:08.420]   people can't be trusted.
[02:05:08.420 --> 02:05:10.020]   It's always about to happen.
[02:05:10.020 --> 02:05:13.660]   So we find that MDMA increases memory for the trauma,
[02:05:13.660 --> 02:05:15.260]   but by reducing the fear,
[02:05:15.260 --> 02:05:16.880]   then the memories can come to the surface.
[02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:18.980]   Then you can process them, let out the emotions,
[02:05:18.980 --> 02:05:21.460]   cry, scream, shake, whatever.
[02:05:21.460 --> 02:05:24.500]   And then through this MDMA effect
[02:05:24.500 --> 02:05:26.060]   on the amygdala and the hippocampus,
[02:05:26.060 --> 02:05:29.400]   it helps you store these memories into long-term storage
[02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:31.340]   so that they're not always about to happen.
[02:05:31.340 --> 02:05:32.600]   They're in the past.
[02:05:32.600 --> 02:05:33.660]   They're part of your story,
[02:05:33.660 --> 02:05:35.320]   but they're not the whole story.
[02:05:35.320 --> 02:05:38.640]   So we discovered that the dissociative subtype works better.
[02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:42.800]   Now, none of this would be enough unless safety.
[02:05:42.800 --> 02:05:45.000]   So from a safety perspective,
[02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:48.040]   what we discovered is that there was one woman in the study
[02:05:48.040 --> 02:05:52.040]   that attempted to kill herself twice during the study.
[02:05:52.040 --> 02:05:57.040]   There was another woman that was so worried
[02:05:57.040 --> 02:05:58.400]   that she might kill herself,
[02:05:58.400 --> 02:06:00.460]   that the therapy brought these things to the surface
[02:06:00.460 --> 02:06:01.600]   that she's been pushing away,
[02:06:01.600 --> 02:06:03.920]   that she checked herself into a hospital
[02:06:03.920 --> 02:06:05.700]   in order to avoid self-harm.
[02:06:05.700 --> 02:06:08.160]   At the end of the study,
[02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:11.840]   what we learned is both of them were in the placebo group.
[02:06:11.840 --> 02:06:14.240]   We didn't have anybody in the MDMA group
[02:06:14.240 --> 02:06:15.660]   attempt to kill themselves.
[02:06:15.660 --> 02:06:21.060]   So the MDMA is really helpful
[02:06:21.060 --> 02:06:23.160]   for giving people a sense of hope
[02:06:23.160 --> 02:06:27.200]   and that they can somehow process this.
[02:06:27.200 --> 02:06:30.760]   Now, it's not to say that nobody will ever commit suicide.
[02:06:30.760 --> 02:06:34.200]   That's our big concern in the second phase three study.
[02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:36.000]   As I said, it's more gonna be about safety
[02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:36.980]   than about efficacy.
[02:06:36.980 --> 02:06:38.320]   We think we'll get the efficacy,
[02:06:38.320 --> 02:06:42.200]   but we're very concerned about safety.
[02:06:42.200 --> 02:06:46.320]   Because we had problems in the first phase three study
[02:06:46.320 --> 02:06:47.760]   of somebody trying to kill herself twice
[02:06:47.760 --> 02:06:48.760]   in the placebo group,
[02:06:48.760 --> 02:06:52.880]   it's the background for having PTSD.
[02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:55.480]   So there'd have to be a disproportionate number of people
[02:06:55.480 --> 02:06:57.400]   in the MDMA group try to kill themselves
[02:06:57.400 --> 02:06:58.800]   or succeed in killing themselves
[02:06:58.800 --> 02:07:01.360]   than in the placebo group for the FDA to say,
[02:07:01.360 --> 02:07:04.240]   "Oh, this MDMA, it's too dangerous.
[02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:06.040]   "We don't think that's gonna happen."
[02:07:06.040 --> 02:07:11.040]   So the other findings are from safety
[02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:13.220]   is that the side effects are transitory.
[02:07:13.220 --> 02:07:14.060]   They're minor.
[02:07:14.060 --> 02:07:17.720]   They're sweating or jaw clenching
[02:07:17.720 --> 02:07:19.720]   or slight temperature increase.
[02:07:19.720 --> 02:07:23.040]   And everybody that's been to a rave knows about it.
[02:07:23.040 --> 02:07:24.080]   Take an ecstasy.
[02:07:24.080 --> 02:07:26.160]   There are some side effects.
[02:07:26.160 --> 02:07:27.600]   But they're minor, they're transitory,
[02:07:27.600 --> 02:07:30.920]   and there has been this massive problem
[02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:33.440]   of during the '80s, the '90s,
[02:07:33.440 --> 02:07:34.920]   NIDA, the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
[02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:37.720]   was trying to say that MDMA was neurotoxic
[02:07:37.720 --> 02:07:38.840]   and that you take it
[02:07:38.840 --> 02:07:41.180]   and it's gonna cause nerve terminal degeneration,
[02:07:41.180 --> 02:07:42.940]   it's gonna be major brain damage,
[02:07:42.940 --> 02:07:45.400]   it's gonna be significant functional consequences.
[02:07:45.400 --> 02:07:48.520]   And back then they were saying that MDMA is too dangerous,
[02:07:48.520 --> 02:07:49.940]   it should never even be researched.
[02:07:49.940 --> 02:07:51.380]   Nobody should even get it once
[02:07:51.380 --> 02:07:54.080]   because it's poison and brain damage.
[02:07:54.080 --> 02:07:56.520]   Well, we no longer believe that.
[02:07:56.520 --> 02:07:57.540]   That was exaggerated.
[02:07:57.540 --> 02:08:00.800]   That was in service of the drug war.
[02:08:00.800 --> 02:08:04.480]   But we've done in phase two neurocognitive tests
[02:08:04.480 --> 02:08:07.280]   before and after in two of our different sites
[02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:09.840]   and showed no decline in cognitive functioning.
[02:08:09.840 --> 02:08:14.640]   So we don't think that there's any neurotoxicity happening
[02:08:14.640 --> 02:08:16.720]   and the doses that we use.
[02:08:16.720 --> 02:08:18.780]   There's no obvious functional consequences.
[02:08:18.780 --> 02:08:20.240]   People are getting better.
[02:08:20.240 --> 02:08:24.120]   And the other thing that we've learned in phase two
[02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:25.680]   and that we still have to learn from this study.
[02:08:25.680 --> 02:08:29.400]   So what we showed is the durability of the effect.
[02:08:29.400 --> 02:08:32.140]   We showed that 32% of the people
[02:08:32.140 --> 02:08:34.420]   that got the therapy without MDMA
[02:08:34.420 --> 02:08:36.860]   at two months after the last experimental session
[02:08:36.860 --> 02:08:40.080]   no longer had PTSD, just with the therapy,
[02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:44.160]   which is phenomenal 'cause these are on average 14 years PTSD
[02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:46.280]   one third had PTSD over 20 years.
[02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:51.060]   And just with the therapy,
[02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:54.600]   32% no longer had PTSD at the two months.
[02:08:54.600 --> 02:08:58.440]   However, those people that got MDMA was 67%.
[02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:02.320]   No longer had PTSD, more than twice as good.
[02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:04.820]   In phase two and in phase three,
[02:09:04.820 --> 02:09:07.580]   we're also gonna do the 12 month follow-up.
[02:09:07.580 --> 02:09:09.300]   That's not for the FDA.
[02:09:09.300 --> 02:09:10.740]   That's not for approvability.
[02:09:10.740 --> 02:09:12.420]   That's more for insurance companies
[02:09:12.420 --> 02:09:15.340]   'cause this is expensive, a lot of therapy time.
[02:09:15.340 --> 02:09:18.060]   If it fades, if it's great results initially,
[02:09:18.060 --> 02:09:20.860]   but then it fades after six months, what's the point?
[02:09:22.060 --> 02:09:24.880]   And what we showed in phase two
[02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:28.960]   is that people keep getting better
[02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:31.960]   at the two month follow-up, they're doing pretty well,
[02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:34.960]   but at the 12 month follow-up, they're even better.
[02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:35.960]   So it's durable.
[02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:38.440]   People have learned how to process trauma.
[02:09:38.440 --> 02:09:39.260]   They keep getting better.
[02:09:39.260 --> 02:09:41.660]   So we've not reached that point in this phase three study
[02:09:41.660 --> 02:09:43.440]   where everybody's got their one year follow-up,
[02:09:43.440 --> 02:09:46.320]   but we have also done three and a half year follow-ups
[02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:48.840]   to some of the groups that were in phase two
[02:09:48.840 --> 02:09:50.620]   and showed that it was durable.
[02:09:50.620 --> 02:09:53.080]   And we're doing a long-term follow-up now
[02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:55.320]   to many of the people in phase two,
[02:09:55.320 --> 02:09:57.680]   some of them treated 15 years ago.
[02:09:57.680 --> 02:10:00.000]   So that's all more for the insurance companies.
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.860]   So basically what we found in the paper
[02:10:02.860 --> 02:10:05.400]   that we just published is that it was highly efficacious,
[02:10:05.400 --> 02:10:07.960]   highly significant, no effect by sight,
[02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:09.480]   works in the hardest cases,
[02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:13.160]   and the safety record was great.
[02:10:13.160 --> 02:10:14.660]   - That's an incredible success.
[02:10:14.660 --> 02:10:16.720]   And that's really exciting,
[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:20.400]   especially given that the people who've committed,
[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:23.920]   who attempted to commit suicide were let into the study.
[02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:26.820]   And so these are people who are truly suffering.
[02:10:26.820 --> 02:10:35.120]   I mean, that's incredibly exciting.
[02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:38.380]   And I mean, just to speak to the frustration
[02:10:38.380 --> 02:10:39.920]   why things can't move faster,
[02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:44.920]   but for what it is, it's incredibly exciting.
[02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:48.160]   Is there other studies of this nature
[02:10:48.160 --> 02:10:52.020]   that you foresee enabling that same kind of positive impact,
[02:10:52.020 --> 02:10:55.360]   whether it's MDMA for other things like treating addiction,
[02:10:55.360 --> 02:10:59.400]   or maybe it's psilocybin for other conditions?
[02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:01.160]   Is there something else that's promising?
[02:11:01.160 --> 02:11:05.800]   - Yeah, I think that what we've discovered
[02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:08.920]   I don't think is unique to MDMA.
[02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:12.360]   So it's MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.
[02:11:12.360 --> 02:11:14.500]   MDMA is ideal for PTSD.
[02:11:15.840 --> 02:11:18.960]   Maybe it won't work as well for OCD or other things.
[02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:21.040]   It was very strategic why we chose MDMA
[02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:22.740]   and why we chose PTSD.
[02:11:22.740 --> 02:11:26.400]   But I don't think that the results that we've got
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:29.160]   are so unique to MDMA-assisted therapy.
[02:11:29.160 --> 02:11:31.320]   I think that psilocybin-assisted therapy
[02:11:31.320 --> 02:11:33.720]   is gonna be great for people
[02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:35.560]   with life-threatening illnesses,
[02:11:35.560 --> 02:11:37.920]   cancer, who are anxious about dying.
[02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:39.480]   It looks like it's really good
[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:40.960]   in the treatment of addiction.
[02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:44.480]   Again, these are in combination
[02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:47.120]   with sort of the psilocybin tobacco
[02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:49.940]   is cognitive behavioral therapy with psilocybin.
[02:11:49.940 --> 02:11:54.000]   I think that it's gonna be a little bit more difficult,
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:55.640]   psilocybin for depression.
[02:11:55.640 --> 02:11:58.400]   I don't know if it'll be quite as good.
[02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:01.900]   There are some biological aspects sometimes to depression,
[02:12:01.900 --> 02:12:03.480]   but I think that there'll be really good results
[02:12:03.480 --> 02:12:04.880]   for psilocybin for depression.
[02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:05.940]   I think it'll be approved.
[02:12:05.940 --> 02:12:09.080]   It's considered a breakthrough therapy by the FDA.
[02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:12.320]   Ibogaine is phenomenal for opiate addiction,
[02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:14.000]   helping people go through the withdrawal,
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:17.240]   and then giving them this chance to deal with the material
[02:12:17.240 --> 02:12:21.000]   that drives them for addiction.
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.600]   There was Ben Sessa, Dr. Ben Sessa in England
[02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:26.440]   did MDMA for alcohol use disorder.
[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:28.640]   And that was really great, the results he got.
[02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:31.760]   And it's the case that he ended up
[02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:33.440]   basically treating people for trauma.
[02:12:33.440 --> 02:12:35.280]   It's the trauma that people run,
[02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:37.680]   the emotional challenges that people run from
[02:12:37.680 --> 02:12:42.680]   into quieting that pain through drug addiction or alcoholism.
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:44.960]   So trauma is behind a lot of addiction.
[02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:49.960]   I think that we are going to see a revolution in psychiatry
[02:12:49.960 --> 02:12:54.760]   and that there will be a lot of conditions
[02:12:54.760 --> 02:12:59.320]   that have left a lot of people still suffering,
[02:12:59.320 --> 02:13:01.240]   that psychedelic-assisted therapy,
[02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:03.060]   different psychedelics, different approaches,
[02:13:03.060 --> 02:13:06.360]   but I think that we will see a lot of hope
[02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:08.040]   for psychiatry and psychotherapy,
[02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:09.720]   and that psychedelics will be a big part
[02:13:09.720 --> 02:13:13.680]   of changing the practice of psychiatry and psychotherapy.
[02:13:13.680 --> 02:13:15.800]   - Yeah, this is really, to me, fascinating.
[02:13:15.800 --> 02:13:19.160]   So I actually, when I was younger,
[02:13:19.160 --> 02:13:21.920]   for the longest time, wanted to be a psychiatrist.
[02:13:21.920 --> 02:13:24.720]   So I was excited by psychotherapy,
[02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:28.160]   but then I, perhaps incorrectly, maybe you can correct me,
[02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:30.600]   but became more and more cynical
[02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:33.520]   because it felt like it was more about prescribing drugs
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:34.560]   than psychotherapy.
[02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:36.320]   - I'm not gonna correct you.
[02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:39.720]   I mean, right now, there is a crisis in psychiatry,
[02:13:39.720 --> 02:13:42.400]   that there are so many psychiatrists that are so fed up
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:45.700]   because they have been pharmaceuticalized,
[02:13:45.700 --> 02:13:47.360]   they meet people for 15 minutes,
[02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:49.160]   they adjust their medications.
[02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:51.320]   This is the way they make the most money,
[02:13:51.320 --> 02:13:53.640]   but they've lost the art of talking to people.
[02:13:53.640 --> 02:13:57.980]   And that's why we see that so many young
[02:13:57.980 --> 02:14:02.880]   psychiatric residents are so thrilled by psychedelics,
[02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:05.640]   that they really want to get back to treating people
[02:14:05.640 --> 02:14:08.320]   as individuals, not just a bunch of chemicals.
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:09.600]   - Yeah, that's truly fascinating.
[02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:11.680]   'Cause the reason it was appealing to me
[02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:14.760]   was a way to study the human mind
[02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:18.400]   and to see ways through talking
[02:14:18.400 --> 02:14:22.720]   that you can make people feel better,
[02:14:22.720 --> 02:14:28.000]   make people better, make people suffer less.
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.920]   And that was really exciting at the time.
[02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:32.560]   I ended up then going to AI
[02:14:32.560 --> 02:14:35.680]   because then I can understand the mind from that angle.
[02:14:35.680 --> 02:14:40.000]   But it's exciting that that could be also,
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:43.900]   revolutionize the field of psychotherapy,
[02:14:43.900 --> 02:14:47.040]   take it from its, back to its origins,
[02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:51.160]   to where a psychiatrist would be a scholar of the mind.
[02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:53.880]   - Yeah, well, you know, Freud talked about dreams
[02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:56.440]   as the Royal Road to the unconscious.
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:14:58.280]   And there was a lot of,
[02:14:58.280 --> 02:15:00.920]   you really spent a lot of time with people.
[02:15:00.920 --> 02:15:05.800]   Now, right before he died, in his last book,
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:06.840]   Freud wrote something,
[02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:09.400]   and again, this will be a rough paraphrase,
[02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:11.520]   but he said that in the future,
[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:15.680]   we may learn about the energies of the brain
[02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:18.480]   and there'll be ways with chemicals to influence that,
[02:15:18.480 --> 02:15:21.880]   that will help the therapeutic process.
[02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:22.720]   - Yeah.
[02:15:22.720 --> 02:15:28.360]   So you could say he was ahead of his time.
[02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:32.520]   This study paints a fascinating picture of a future,
[02:15:32.520 --> 02:15:35.760]   where first for medical applications,
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:37.880]   but then also in general,
[02:15:37.880 --> 02:15:39.920]   psychedelics of various forms could be used
[02:15:39.920 --> 02:15:42.280]   by the broader society.
[02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:44.520]   Forgive the perhaps ridiculous question,
[02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:49.520]   but if much of society, including our politicians,
[02:15:49.520 --> 02:15:54.880]   are taking psychedelics and dissolving their ego
[02:15:56.520 --> 02:15:58.440]   and going through this whole process,
[02:15:58.440 --> 02:16:01.920]   how do you think the world may look different
[02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:05.040]   in 20, 30, 50 years?
[02:16:05.040 --> 02:16:09.320]   - Okay, so I said that I think licensed legalization
[02:16:09.320 --> 02:16:11.040]   happens in 2035.
[02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:11.880]   - Yes.
[02:16:11.880 --> 02:16:14.640]   - So, and I think by 2050,
[02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:20.480]   we will have enough people hopefully spiritualized.
[02:16:20.480 --> 02:16:23.600]   We're also talking about,
[02:16:24.680 --> 02:16:27.280]   we hear so much in terms of climate change
[02:16:27.280 --> 02:16:30.000]   about net zero carbon.
[02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.800]   So our goal is net zero trauma.
[02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:35.680]   When do we have a world with net zero trauma?
[02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:39.580]   I mean, right now, we have two sites in Israel.
[02:16:39.580 --> 02:16:41.240]   So we help a few people,
[02:16:41.240 --> 02:16:44.840]   but the recent war with Gaza has traumatized
[02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:46.800]   millions of people on both sides.
[02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:50.860]   So we are a long way away from net zero trauma,
[02:16:50.860 --> 02:16:53.160]   but that's the hope.
[02:16:53.160 --> 02:16:56.360]   And that's, I think, possible.
[02:16:56.360 --> 02:16:58.640]   I think humanity as a whole
[02:16:58.640 --> 02:17:04.640]   is like lemmings heading over a cliff
[02:17:04.640 --> 02:17:09.640]   with climate change and with the nuclear proliferation
[02:17:09.640 --> 02:17:11.760]   and just the religious hatreds
[02:17:11.760 --> 02:17:13.920]   and more of the retreat to authoritarianism
[02:17:13.920 --> 02:17:16.580]   and fundamentalism and tribalism.
[02:17:16.580 --> 02:17:19.980]   So I think that there's a very good chance, though,
[02:17:19.980 --> 02:17:22.640]   that psychedelics used wisely.
[02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:25.000]   So it's not just make psychedelics legal
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:25.880]   and everybody takes them.
[02:17:25.880 --> 02:17:28.360]   And as you talked about Ted Kaczynski,
[02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:31.200]   it's the context that people take it in.
[02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:35.280]   But I think that there's a reasonable chance
[02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:37.300]   that enough people can,
[02:17:37.300 --> 02:17:39.440]   so you could say,
[02:17:39.440 --> 02:17:45.280]   clean their filters to see people as
[02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:48.560]   more similar to them than different,
[02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:50.480]   not to label them as the enemy.
[02:17:50.480 --> 02:17:52.400]   Stan Grof, again, had this beautiful phrase
[02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:56.360]   about transparent to the transcendent.
[02:17:56.360 --> 02:17:59.040]   (laughing)
[02:17:59.040 --> 02:18:02.520]   So for our ego, can we be transparent to the transcendent?
[02:18:02.520 --> 02:18:05.760]   'Cause can the filter that we look through the world at
[02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:08.400]   be cleaned to, you could say,
[02:18:08.400 --> 02:18:10.400]   cleansing the doors of perception?
[02:18:10.400 --> 02:18:11.680]   Can it be cleaned to the point
[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:14.420]   where we can see the humanity in everybody
[02:18:14.420 --> 02:18:15.840]   and see that,
[02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:19.560]   one way to say this is that,
[02:18:19.560 --> 02:18:21.120]   can we get to the point where religions
[02:18:21.120 --> 02:18:23.240]   are seen as like languages?
[02:18:23.240 --> 02:18:25.840]   Where we all have this need to communicate,
[02:18:25.840 --> 02:18:28.480]   there's thousands of different languages.
[02:18:28.480 --> 02:18:30.240]   We don't say that this language is
[02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:32.200]   fundamentally better than this language.
[02:18:32.200 --> 02:18:33.600]   This language is the only right language.
[02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:34.920]   Everybody must speak English
[02:18:34.920 --> 02:18:37.120]   and Russian is bad or German is bad.
[02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:39.280]   Maybe we'll get to that point
[02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:41.040]   that religions are like that.
[02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:42.680]   That there are different cultural backgrounds,
[02:18:42.680 --> 02:18:44.000]   different symbol systems,
[02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:47.080]   different saints and heroes and messiahs and all this.
[02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:50.040]   But that, yeah, Jesus is the son of God,
[02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:51.520]   but so is everybody.
[02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:52.360]   (Luke laughs)
[02:18:52.360 --> 02:18:54.400]   Or the Jews are the chosen people,
[02:18:54.400 --> 02:18:55.880]   but so is everybody.
[02:18:55.880 --> 02:18:57.560]   So can we get there?
[02:18:57.560 --> 02:18:59.380]   I think that we can.
[02:18:59.380 --> 02:19:01.000]   And I think that we need to,
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.900]   to survive the challenges that we're facing.
[02:19:03.900 --> 02:19:08.080]   And the hope is that by bringing psychedelics
[02:19:08.080 --> 02:19:13.080]   as tools forward and trying to bring the context around them
[02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:15.720]   to be one of responsibility
[02:19:15.720 --> 02:19:18.560]   rather than just profit maximization
[02:19:18.560 --> 02:19:20.680]   and just get as many people to do them
[02:19:20.680 --> 02:19:22.480]   from all these for-profit companies.
[02:19:22.480 --> 02:19:26.600]   Can we, and then also drug policy reform
[02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:28.440]   and embed knowledge in the society,
[02:19:28.440 --> 02:19:31.040]   can we get to honest drug education?
[02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:36.040]   DARE, the Drug Awareness Resistance Education,
[02:19:36.040 --> 02:19:39.100]   is fundamentally twisted.
[02:19:39.100 --> 02:19:42.760]   But it's the program that's used in a lot of schools now.
[02:19:42.760 --> 02:19:45.280]   So can we get honest drug education, pure drugs,
[02:19:45.280 --> 02:19:49.320]   harm reduction, and knowledge about therapeutic uses,
[02:19:49.320 --> 02:19:51.560]   and on the one hand,
[02:19:51.560 --> 02:19:54.160]   and more of these thousands of psychedelic clinics?
[02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:59.000]   I'm hopeful, and that's our goal.
[02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:04.000]   - But in this landscape of pharma companies,
[02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:05.800]   they make a lot of money.
[02:20:05.800 --> 02:20:08.360]   Some people are worried about the impact of those,
[02:20:08.360 --> 02:20:13.000]   of big pharma on the landscape of human trauma.
[02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:14.080]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:20:14.080 --> 02:20:17.520]   So there's, of course, some companies could do good,
[02:20:17.520 --> 02:20:19.560]   but that's not inherent.
[02:20:19.560 --> 02:20:24.780]   Many of these companies are not optimizing for good,
[02:20:24.780 --> 02:20:26.360]   they're optimizing for profit.
[02:20:26.360 --> 02:20:27.440]   - Exactly, exactly.
[02:20:27.440 --> 02:20:31.880]   - Does this rise of for-profit pharma companies worry you?
[02:20:31.880 --> 02:20:33.680]   How do you navigate it?
[02:20:33.680 --> 02:20:35.560]   Do we still have for-profit companies
[02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:39.440]   that basically do what MAPS does,
[02:20:39.440 --> 02:20:42.920]   which is fight the good fight for the benefit of humanity?
[02:20:43.440 --> 02:20:46.120]   Like how do we proceed in this landscape
[02:20:46.120 --> 02:20:49.600]   where drugs can make a lot of money?
[02:20:49.600 --> 02:20:52.120]   - Well, I am concerned.
[02:20:52.120 --> 02:20:55.680]   Overall, I think the rise of the for-profit companies
[02:20:55.680 --> 02:20:58.520]   we have to realize is a sign of success,
[02:20:58.520 --> 02:21:03.520]   that we have overcome the regulatory prohibitions,
[02:21:03.520 --> 02:21:06.680]   we've overcome a lot of the public attitudes
[02:21:06.680 --> 02:21:08.120]   that are against it,
[02:21:08.120 --> 02:21:09.840]   we've demonstrated some success.
[02:21:09.840 --> 02:21:12.180]   So the rise of the for-profit companies
[02:21:12.180 --> 02:21:14.000]   are a sign of the progress that we've made.
[02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:15.040]   On the other hand,
[02:21:15.040 --> 02:21:17.800]   turning things over to profit-maximizing companies,
[02:21:17.800 --> 02:21:21.040]   the big concern is that they're gonna try
[02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:24.920]   to minimize the amount of therapy
[02:21:24.920 --> 02:21:26.720]   and make it so the cost is less,
[02:21:26.720 --> 02:21:28.940]   so insurance companies are more likely to cover it,
[02:21:28.940 --> 02:21:31.140]   and then that they just sell the most drugs.
[02:21:31.140 --> 02:21:34.480]   The other thing we've seen as an example of this
[02:21:34.480 --> 02:21:37.760]   is ascetamine by Johnson & Johnson for depression,
[02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:40.720]   and it's done by a profit-maximizing company.
[02:21:40.720 --> 02:21:43.180]   They don't know anything about psychedelic psychotherapy
[02:21:43.180 --> 02:21:44.900]   or psychotherapy at all,
[02:21:44.900 --> 02:21:48.460]   and so they've gotten approval for ascetamine
[02:21:48.460 --> 02:21:51.980]   on the basis of it's just a pharmacological treatment,
[02:21:51.980 --> 02:21:54.980]   and it's not delivered with therapy,
[02:21:54.980 --> 02:21:57.100]   the results fade pretty quickly,
[02:21:57.100 --> 02:21:59.840]   so you need to get more ketamine.
[02:21:59.840 --> 02:22:02.820]   And so it's designed in a way to maximize the profits
[02:22:02.820 --> 02:22:05.000]   for the pharmaceutical company,
[02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.780]   but it doesn't maximize patient outcomes.
[02:22:07.780 --> 02:22:10.420]   What we're seeing though in these various clinics
[02:22:10.420 --> 02:22:12.460]   that are being set up is that a lot of people
[02:22:12.460 --> 02:22:17.460]   are realizing that it works better with therapy,
[02:22:17.460 --> 02:22:20.680]   and so the clinics are run by people that are therapists
[02:22:20.680 --> 02:22:24.060]   so that when they provide therapy, they're making more money
[02:22:24.060 --> 02:22:26.500]   and then you need less ketamine.
[02:22:26.500 --> 02:22:31.500]   Also, ketamine itself, S-ketamine is a isomer of ketamine
[02:22:31.500 --> 02:22:33.540]   that's been patented for depression,
[02:22:33.540 --> 02:22:35.020]   and they sell it for hundreds of dollars,
[02:22:35.020 --> 02:22:38.260]   but ketamine itself is one of the world's
[02:22:38.260 --> 02:22:39.300]   essential medicines.
[02:22:39.300 --> 02:22:41.580]   It's off patent, it's been around for a long time,
[02:22:41.580 --> 02:22:44.580]   it was the main battlefield anesthetic in Vietnam,
[02:22:44.580 --> 02:22:47.380]   and it's only a few bucks because it's generic.
[02:22:47.380 --> 02:22:49.660]   So a lot of the ketamine clinics are saying,
[02:22:49.660 --> 02:22:51.820]   "Great, thank you, Johnson and Johnson,
[02:22:51.820 --> 02:22:53.580]   you've helped demonstrate that ketamine
[02:22:53.580 --> 02:22:54.660]   is good for depression,
[02:22:54.660 --> 02:22:56.300]   but we're not gonna buy it from you,
[02:22:56.300 --> 02:22:58.060]   we're gonna buy it for a few bucks,
[02:22:58.060 --> 02:23:00.660]   and we're gonna add therapy to it."
[02:23:00.660 --> 02:23:02.700]   Now, there's a bunch of ketamine mills, you could say,
[02:23:02.700 --> 02:23:05.180]   that are just prescribing the ketamine,
[02:23:05.180 --> 02:23:07.140]   and people are making a lot of money there.
[02:23:07.140 --> 02:23:09.380]   So I am worried about that.
[02:23:09.380 --> 02:23:11.300]   I think the best thing that we can do
[02:23:11.300 --> 02:23:15.620]   is create an alternative narrative,
[02:23:15.620 --> 02:23:16.940]   a different kind of example.
[02:23:16.940 --> 02:23:18.060]   We can lead by example,
[02:23:18.060 --> 02:23:22.440]   we can't make for-profit companies into benefit corporations
[02:23:22.440 --> 02:23:23.620]   unless they wanna do that.
[02:23:23.620 --> 02:23:28.400]   We can't make them to really maximize patient outcomes.
[02:23:28.400 --> 02:23:32.500]   But if we create an example of something that's different,
[02:23:32.500 --> 02:23:36.080]   the hope is that people will gravitate towards that,
[02:23:36.080 --> 02:23:37.860]   and some of the other companies.
[02:23:37.860 --> 02:23:41.220]   Like even now we have Exxon and other of these companies,
[02:23:41.220 --> 02:23:42.660]   oil companies, saying, "Oh, we're big
[02:23:42.660 --> 02:23:45.860]   into alternative energy, and we're..."
[02:23:45.860 --> 02:23:48.900]   - And that starts with companies that show an example
[02:23:48.900 --> 02:23:51.060]   that then communicates to the public
[02:23:51.060 --> 02:23:53.140]   that this is something exciting,
[02:23:53.140 --> 02:23:56.220]   and then they demand the same of Exxon and so on.
[02:23:56.220 --> 02:23:58.820]   The public demands, and you could say the same thing
[02:23:58.820 --> 02:24:02.940]   for the public demanding the big pharma
[02:24:04.700 --> 02:24:08.360]   to optimize for benefit versus optimize for profit,
[02:24:08.360 --> 02:24:11.080]   and maybe giving power to the therapists,
[02:24:11.080 --> 02:24:12.480]   more power to the therapists,
[02:24:12.480 --> 02:24:16.440]   more power to the doctors that ultimately want,
[02:24:16.440 --> 02:24:21.040]   I think, incentives are interesting,
[02:24:21.040 --> 02:24:25.240]   but I think doctors ultimately care more
[02:24:25.240 --> 02:24:27.400]   because they're in direct contact with humans.
[02:24:27.400 --> 02:24:29.040]   They want to make people better.
[02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:31.360]   It's not, sure, they wanna make money,
[02:24:31.360 --> 02:24:33.840]   but they ultimately want to make people feel better
[02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:35.420]   because they get to look at people,
[02:24:35.420 --> 02:24:38.460]   and it's so joyful to make people feel better
[02:24:38.460 --> 02:24:39.300]   at the end of the day.
[02:24:39.300 --> 02:24:42.620]   So giving more power to them is also,
[02:24:42.620 --> 02:24:45.940]   perhaps, one of the ways that you then incentivize
[02:24:45.940 --> 02:24:50.780]   the pharma companies that are trying to do good
[02:24:50.780 --> 02:24:53.820]   because the doctors will choose those companies.
[02:24:53.820 --> 02:24:57.300]   - Yeah, now the other part of this is drug policy reform.
[02:24:57.300 --> 02:25:00.020]   So that if we make it so that you can buy MDMA
[02:25:00.020 --> 02:25:03.140]   for 10 or 20 bucks on your own,
[02:25:03.140 --> 02:25:06.540]   and we've trained people on here's our therapeutic method,
[02:25:06.540 --> 02:25:09.500]   here is our ways for peer support,
[02:25:09.500 --> 02:25:12.000]   then people have an alternative
[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:15.100]   from buying it from the pharma companies.
[02:25:15.100 --> 02:25:18.420]   So most of the for-profit companies
[02:25:18.420 --> 02:25:20.380]   have come to this conclusion
[02:25:20.380 --> 02:25:24.840]   that drug policy reform is bad for their business model.
[02:25:24.840 --> 02:25:28.400]   I think they're making a fundamental mistake,
[02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:30.480]   and I think the reason is that
[02:25:30.480 --> 02:25:32.380]   the more that we destigmatize this,
[02:25:32.380 --> 02:25:35.780]   the more that we sensitize people to this is an approach.
[02:25:35.780 --> 02:25:37.900]   Even when people can get it on their own
[02:25:37.900 --> 02:25:40.740]   and do it with their friends or do it with themselves,
[02:25:40.740 --> 02:25:42.700]   there's gonna be even more people that say,
[02:25:42.700 --> 02:25:44.860]   "Oh my God, I've got real serious issues.
[02:25:44.860 --> 02:25:47.780]   I would rather go to trained professionals
[02:25:47.780 --> 02:25:49.760]   covered by insurance,
[02:25:49.760 --> 02:25:52.620]   and I think it'll increase the business."
[02:25:52.620 --> 02:25:56.180]   But most of the for-profit companies don't see it that way.
[02:25:56.180 --> 02:26:00.820]   And so as a nonprofit that owns a benefit corp,
[02:26:00.820 --> 02:26:03.740]   we're not trying to maximize sales or profits.
[02:26:03.740 --> 02:26:06.780]   But I do believe that drug policy reform
[02:26:06.780 --> 02:26:10.220]   creates this alternative access point for people,
[02:26:10.220 --> 02:26:12.820]   and that will help keep the for-profits in check
[02:26:12.820 --> 02:26:15.860]   to some extent as well.
[02:26:15.860 --> 02:26:16.700]   - I love it.
[02:26:16.700 --> 02:26:23.200]   Let's put on your wise visionary hat and ask,
[02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:26.020]   when you look to young folks,
[02:26:26.020 --> 02:26:28.940]   is there advice you can give to young people today,
[02:26:28.940 --> 02:26:31.500]   whether in high school or college,
[02:26:31.500 --> 02:26:34.380]   about career, about life?
[02:26:34.380 --> 02:26:36.780]   You've lived quite a nonlinear
[02:26:36.780 --> 02:26:39.020]   and fascinating life yourself.
[02:26:39.020 --> 02:26:41.140]   Is there advice you can give either on career
[02:26:41.140 --> 02:26:42.680]   or more generally on life?
[02:26:42.680 --> 02:26:47.860]   - Well, I would say what people often hear
[02:26:47.860 --> 02:26:52.520]   is that we're not actually here
[02:26:52.520 --> 02:26:54.420]   for that long a period of time.
[02:26:55.980 --> 02:26:59.660]   And so, and the world is on fire.
[02:26:59.660 --> 02:27:03.020]   And whether humanity survives is not clear.
[02:27:03.020 --> 02:27:05.740]   And how many species are we gonna kill
[02:27:05.740 --> 02:27:08.440]   before we figure out not to do that anymore?
[02:27:08.440 --> 02:27:12.740]   So I would advise you to really try to
[02:27:12.740 --> 02:27:17.740]   develop a combination of what do you need
[02:27:17.740 --> 02:27:20.380]   in terms of income for your own survival,
[02:27:20.380 --> 02:27:22.820]   but what does the world need in terms of
[02:27:25.680 --> 02:27:27.560]   help to make the world better?
[02:27:27.560 --> 02:27:30.880]   And Howard Thurman, who we talked about,
[02:27:30.880 --> 02:27:33.740]   who ran the Good Friday experiment, the minister there,
[02:27:33.740 --> 02:27:36.300]   he's got a famous quote attributed to him.
[02:27:36.300 --> 02:27:40.140]   He says, and this is exactly it to young people.
[02:27:40.140 --> 02:27:43.820]   He said, "There's nothing particular that you should do,
[02:27:43.820 --> 02:27:46.200]   "but find what makes you come alive,
[02:27:46.200 --> 02:27:48.080]   "because what the world needs is people
[02:27:48.080 --> 02:27:50.800]   "that have come alive and are passionate."
[02:27:52.300 --> 02:27:57.300]   So I would say that beware of this trap
[02:27:57.300 --> 02:28:05.440]   that you need vast resources, that you need all this stuff.
[02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:10.460]   I keep thinking of the super wealthy people
[02:28:10.460 --> 02:28:15.460]   in first class on the Titanic, as the Titanic is sinking.
[02:28:15.460 --> 02:28:16.980]   Their money's not gonna help them.
[02:28:16.980 --> 02:28:19.140]   The Earth is like Titanic.
[02:28:19.140 --> 02:28:21.220]   We're sinking, we're destroying the planet,
[02:28:21.220 --> 02:28:23.060]   destroying the environment.
[02:28:23.060 --> 02:28:27.180]   So you need a certain amount of money to be comfortable,
[02:28:27.180 --> 02:28:29.420]   to not be at that edge of survival,
[02:28:29.420 --> 02:28:31.020]   because once you're at that edge of survival,
[02:28:31.020 --> 02:28:32.380]   it's hard to think about anything else.
[02:28:32.380 --> 02:28:34.200]   But I'd say to young people,
[02:28:34.200 --> 02:28:39.000]   to the extent that you're able to do this,
[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.260]   and again, student debt and all this kind of stuff
[02:28:41.260 --> 02:28:42.700]   is a big problem there too,
[02:28:42.700 --> 02:28:47.700]   but really just try to find this combination
[02:28:47.700 --> 02:28:50.180]   of what the world needs and what you need.
[02:28:50.180 --> 02:28:52.700]   The other thing to say to young people is,
[02:28:52.700 --> 02:28:55.820]   life is a lot shorter than you think,
[02:28:55.820 --> 02:29:00.340]   and a 20-year plan is not really that long.
[02:29:00.340 --> 02:29:03.100]   So if it takes you 20 years to get in a position
[02:29:03.100 --> 02:29:07.020]   to do what you wanna do, go for it.
[02:29:07.020 --> 02:29:08.780]   Have long-term plans.
[02:29:08.780 --> 02:29:11.380]   The other part that was so important for me
[02:29:11.380 --> 02:29:14.340]   to keep doing what I've been doing,
[02:29:14.340 --> 02:29:17.300]   basically now it's 49 years
[02:29:17.300 --> 02:29:19.500]   that I've sort of been devoting my life on psychedelics
[02:29:19.500 --> 02:29:20.400]   since I was 18.
[02:29:20.400 --> 02:29:23.620]   When I started, I didn't think it would ever work.
[02:29:23.620 --> 02:29:25.500]   I just thought this is the only idea I have
[02:29:25.500 --> 02:29:26.620]   in this crazy world.
[02:29:26.620 --> 02:29:29.220]   This is what I wanna work on.
[02:29:29.220 --> 02:29:30.980]   Luckily, I had support from my family
[02:29:30.980 --> 02:29:34.660]   that took care of my survival needs, so I could do that.
[02:29:34.660 --> 02:29:37.860]   But I realized that if my happiness
[02:29:37.860 --> 02:29:40.940]   was dependent upon accomplishments,
[02:29:40.940 --> 02:29:42.780]   that I might never be happy,
[02:29:42.780 --> 02:29:47.780]   that I was able to reframe happiness in terms of effort.
[02:29:49.420 --> 02:29:54.140]   So if I'm trying hard to get stuff to be better,
[02:29:54.140 --> 02:29:55.500]   whether it's better or not,
[02:29:55.500 --> 02:29:57.420]   I can be happy at the end of each day.
[02:29:57.420 --> 02:29:58.660]   I tried.
[02:29:58.660 --> 02:30:01.620]   And so I think you try to separate out
[02:30:01.620 --> 02:30:03.740]   the goals that you have and your happiness
[02:30:03.740 --> 02:30:05.380]   to whether you're trying hard.
[02:30:05.380 --> 02:30:08.700]   The other thing I would say is that
[02:30:08.700 --> 02:30:13.020]   everybody has this humanity within them.
[02:30:13.020 --> 02:30:14.940]   So be very careful about dividing the world
[02:30:14.940 --> 02:30:15.920]   into us and them.
[02:30:16.920 --> 02:30:20.600]   And try to...
[02:30:20.600 --> 02:30:22.360]   So one of the things that I've done
[02:30:22.360 --> 02:30:27.720]   that has taken a long time,
[02:30:27.720 --> 02:30:31.040]   because I feel like drugs are illegal.
[02:30:31.040 --> 02:30:33.560]   I always felt like the police were the predator
[02:30:33.560 --> 02:30:35.040]   and I'm the prey.
[02:30:35.040 --> 02:30:36.480]   - Yes.
[02:30:36.480 --> 02:30:38.080]   - But now we're working with the police,
[02:30:38.080 --> 02:30:40.000]   and the police have tremendous trauma
[02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:41.080]   from the work that they do.
[02:30:41.080 --> 02:30:43.400]   We have one police officer who is now going,
[02:30:43.400 --> 02:30:45.240]   he's a full-time police officer.
[02:30:45.240 --> 02:30:47.640]   He's also a psychotherapist.
[02:30:47.640 --> 02:30:50.120]   And he's going through our training program
[02:30:50.120 --> 02:30:53.880]   to learn how to give MDMA therapy to other police officers.
[02:30:53.880 --> 02:30:56.680]   And I met his police chief a couple of times.
[02:30:56.680 --> 02:30:58.760]   He got permission from his police chief
[02:30:58.760 --> 02:31:01.080]   to go to the second part of our training program,
[02:31:01.080 --> 02:31:03.720]   which is where we give MDMA to therapists
[02:31:03.720 --> 02:31:06.320]   who volunteer as a patient.
[02:31:06.320 --> 02:31:08.360]   So we have just a couple of weeks ago
[02:31:08.360 --> 02:31:10.480]   dosed the police with MDMA.
[02:31:10.480 --> 02:31:11.380]   - Yeah.
[02:31:11.380 --> 02:31:13.760]   - And so I think this idea of those people
[02:31:13.760 --> 02:31:16.080]   that are on the quote, other side,
[02:31:16.080 --> 02:31:19.760]   try to see through that to their humanity,
[02:31:19.760 --> 02:31:21.320]   to what their pains and suffering,
[02:31:21.320 --> 02:31:24.920]   what their struggles are, to the extent that you can.
[02:31:24.920 --> 02:31:28.480]   And that I think, and build long-term relationships.
[02:31:28.480 --> 02:31:32.640]   You never know what's gonna come around 20 years from now.
[02:31:32.640 --> 02:31:35.320]   So you help some people try to keep these relationships
[02:31:35.320 --> 02:31:38.160]   going 20 years from now, something could come.
[02:31:38.160 --> 02:31:43.160]   And also be persistent.
[02:31:43.160 --> 02:31:44.000]   - Yeah.
[02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:49.000]   - I think that's been the key to success.
[02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:52.720]   I mean, once the FDA or DEA figured out
[02:31:52.720 --> 02:31:53.800]   we're not going anywhere,
[02:31:53.800 --> 02:31:55.760]   they're gonna have to deal with us.
[02:31:55.760 --> 02:31:57.840]   Then we started getting some progress.
[02:31:57.840 --> 02:32:00.520]   - So a mix of patience and stubbornness
[02:32:00.520 --> 02:32:02.320]   that gets things done.
[02:32:02.320 --> 02:32:05.440]   Is there something you've figured out
[02:32:05.440 --> 02:32:08.400]   through your journey with psychedelics
[02:32:08.400 --> 02:32:11.920]   about some of the big why questions about life?
[02:32:11.920 --> 02:32:15.800]   Like, what the heck's the value of love?
[02:32:15.800 --> 02:32:20.760]   Why does it suck so much that we die?
[02:32:20.760 --> 02:32:25.440]   And for some of us, maybe it's the Russian in me,
[02:32:25.440 --> 02:32:28.080]   but it's quite terrifying, the notion of it.
[02:32:28.080 --> 02:32:30.080]   Or the biggest why question of them all,
[02:32:30.080 --> 02:32:33.040]   which is what's the meaning of it all?
[02:32:33.040 --> 02:32:36.040]   - Well, yeah, what I've discovered is that
[02:32:36.040 --> 02:32:40.120]   we don't need answers to those questions.
[02:32:40.120 --> 02:32:45.120]   You know, the fact that we can feel happy,
[02:32:45.120 --> 02:32:47.400]   you know, that we can love,
[02:32:47.400 --> 02:32:51.800]   that we can have moments of happiness, that's enough.
[02:32:51.800 --> 02:32:54.400]   You know, figuring out these big questions,
[02:32:54.400 --> 02:32:56.120]   you can get lost in that.
[02:32:56.120 --> 02:32:58.800]   And we all can come up with our answers.
[02:32:58.800 --> 02:33:00.560]   What's the meaning of life?
[02:33:00.560 --> 02:33:01.840]   Why is there life?
[02:33:01.840 --> 02:33:02.880]   Why is there consciousness?
[02:33:02.880 --> 02:33:06.000]   But I don't know that we need those answers.
[02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:10.120]   What we know is that we're social creatures,
[02:33:10.120 --> 02:33:14.720]   that other people can make us happy by certain things,
[02:33:14.720 --> 02:33:17.800]   we can make other people happy, that one life is enough.
[02:33:17.800 --> 02:33:22.800]   So this other part about why is it so tragic that we die?
[02:33:22.800 --> 02:33:25.320]   I don't think it's tragic that we die.
[02:33:25.320 --> 02:33:27.800]   So first off, if you believe in this collective unconscious,
[02:33:27.800 --> 02:33:32.480]   but we have an impact that lasts.
[02:33:32.480 --> 02:33:35.160]   But I think that for me at least,
[02:33:35.160 --> 02:33:40.160]   I've been of the view that we should be grateful for death,
[02:33:40.160 --> 02:33:42.600]   that death makes life precious,
[02:33:42.600 --> 02:33:45.920]   that if we had an infinite amount of time,
[02:33:45.920 --> 02:33:49.200]   you know, I mean, I'm a bit of a procrastinator about stuff,
[02:33:49.200 --> 02:33:52.240]   particularly things that are really, you know, hard to do.
[02:33:52.240 --> 02:33:54.200]   And you just, you know, you just don't do it.
[02:33:54.200 --> 02:33:55.400]   And then like, where'd the day go?
[02:33:55.400 --> 02:33:56.240]   I was gonna do this.
[02:33:56.240 --> 02:33:59.320]   So if we had infinite life, we never died,
[02:33:59.320 --> 02:34:03.400]   you know, would life be precious?
[02:34:03.400 --> 02:34:04.360]   Would we do anything?
[02:34:04.360 --> 02:34:05.240]   I don't think so.
[02:34:05.240 --> 02:34:10.240]   So my parents gave, you know, every Jewish new year,
[02:34:10.240 --> 02:34:13.960]   they would make their New Year's card.
[02:34:13.960 --> 02:34:16.320]   And one of the quotes was fantastic.
[02:34:16.320 --> 02:34:20.200]   It was just, "We have to make up for the brevity of life
[02:34:20.200 --> 02:34:22.400]   "with the intensity of life."
[02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:24.480]   Oh man, that is good.
[02:34:24.480 --> 02:34:29.100]   Well, the end makes things precious.
[02:34:29.100 --> 02:34:30.600]   Death makes life precious.
[02:34:30.600 --> 02:34:34.520]   The end of this conversation makes it precious,
[02:34:34.520 --> 02:34:37.200]   and which is a great way to end.
[02:34:37.200 --> 02:34:40.760]   Rick, I wanted to talk to you for a long time.
[02:34:40.760 --> 02:34:43.280]   I share, you were very excited about the study.
[02:34:43.280 --> 02:34:45.700]   I can now understand exactly why.
[02:34:45.700 --> 02:34:46.920]   This is really promising.
[02:34:46.920 --> 02:34:50.240]   This is really exciting, gives me hope about the future,
[02:34:50.240 --> 02:34:53.720]   even if it doesn't come fast enough.
[02:34:53.720 --> 02:34:56.560]   But like you said, you have to be patient and stubborn.
[02:34:56.560 --> 02:34:59.360]   Thank you so much for wasting all your valuable time
[02:34:59.360 --> 02:35:01.720]   with me today, it's truly an honor to meet you.
[02:35:01.720 --> 02:35:02.800]   - Not a waste at all.
[02:35:02.800 --> 02:35:05.760]   I really appreciated this time together.
[02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:08.360]   - Thank you for listening to this conversation
[02:35:08.360 --> 02:35:12.440]   with Rick Doblin, and thank you to Theragun, ExpressVPN,
[02:35:12.440 --> 02:35:14.620]   Blinkist, and Asleep.
[02:35:14.620 --> 02:35:17.900]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[02:35:17.900 --> 02:35:19.600]   And now let me leave you with some words
[02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:21.480]   from Terrence McKenna.
[02:35:21.480 --> 02:35:23.080]   Nature loves courage.
[02:35:23.080 --> 02:35:25.720]   You make the commitment, and nature will respond
[02:35:25.720 --> 02:35:29.260]   to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles.
[02:35:29.260 --> 02:35:30.800]   Dream the impossible dream,
[02:35:30.800 --> 02:35:33.120]   and the world will not grind you under.
[02:35:33.120 --> 02:35:34.640]   It will lift you up.
[02:35:34.640 --> 02:35:36.000]   This is the trick.
[02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.680]   This is what all the teachers and philosophers
[02:35:38.680 --> 02:35:42.840]   who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold,
[02:35:42.840 --> 02:35:44.600]   this is what they understood.
[02:35:44.600 --> 02:35:47.440]   This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall.
[02:35:47.440 --> 02:35:49.280]   This is how magic is done,
[02:35:49.280 --> 02:35:51.400]   by hurling yourself into the abyss
[02:35:51.400 --> 02:35:54.600]   and discovering that it's a feather bed.
[02:35:54.600 --> 02:35:57.360]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[02:35:57.360 --> 02:35:59.940]   (upbeat music)
[02:35:59.940 --> 02:36:02.520]   (upbeat music)
