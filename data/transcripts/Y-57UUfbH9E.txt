[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.120]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:14.240]   the portion of scripture that we read at the beginning and in the 24th chapter of the Gospel
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:23.600]   according to St. Matthew in verses 1 and 2, the first two verses in the 24th chapter of
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:33.960]   the Gospel according to St. Matthew. And Jesus went out and departed from the temple. And
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:43.560]   his disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple. And Jesus said
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:55.320]   unto them, "See ye not all these things? Verily I say unto you, there shall not be left here
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:11.480]   one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down." While fundamentally, of course, it
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:23.120]   is true to say that the state of the world and of mankind in sin is always the same,
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:31.720]   it is nevertheless equally true to say that history shows very plainly and clearly that
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:41.760]   the different eras and epochs, different periods in the long history of the human race accentuate
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:53.040]   and emphasize certain different aspects of this one great common and universal problem.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.240]   Now that is something I say that surely must be abundantly plain and clear to all of us
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:09.680]   from a mere superficial reading of history. The great common universal constant need,
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:18.760]   and yet the obvious variations. Now there can be no question, I think, at all that at
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:26.920]   the present moment the outstanding question, the question which is forcing itself upon
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.800]   our attention, upon the attention of all people who think at all whether they are Christians
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:44.200]   specifically or not, is this whole question of history. The question of the story of the
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:53.920]   human race, the question, if you like, of what exactly is happening in this process
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:04.280]   of history in which we are all involved, and what exactly is its meaning. This, I think,
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.920]   above all the other problems, and there are many others as we all know, but this I think
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:17.240]   you will all agree is the outstanding problem.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.160]   Now let me illustrate what I mean by putting it to you like this. This is an age, surely,
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:35.200]   above everything else, of a transition, an age of change, an age of mighty convulsions
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:46.000]   and violent movements. It is an age which is characterised by the changing of orders,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.960]   ages which affect the nations politically, economically, industrially, and in every other
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:02.560]   respect. Compare, for instance, or contrast, rather, this time in which we live, this present
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:12.400]   age, this present moment, with what obtains a hundred years ago. Think of those "Helsian
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:19.120]   days," as they are generally called, and rightly called, of that mid-period in the
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.400]   reign, that long reign, of Queen Victoria. How settled everything seemed to be, how safe
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.800]   there had been, it's true, the Napoleonic Wars, but they had ended in 1815, and having
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.800]   got rid of that particular problem, it did indeed look as if the world was going to settle
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.760]   down into a condition of settled peace. And as far as people could make out, there was
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:49.640]   nothing that could possibly disturb this. The orders seemed to be settled, and the whole
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:58.040]   world seemed to be in a kind of peace. Well, now compare and contrast all that with the
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:04.560]   days in which you and I live, and you see the contrast immediately. Everything today
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.640]   seems to be in the melting pot. The whole world seems to be upside down. Things that
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:16.400]   were unthinkable a hundred years ago have literally happened in our day and in our own
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.360]   generation. There is no doubt at all about this. Everybody's agreed about this. We are
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:30.080]   living in one of the great climactic periods of history, where everything, as it were,
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.440]   is, as I say, thrown into the melting pot again. And men and women are beginning to
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:44.800]   ask and to wonder, "What is coming out of it all? What is the meaning of it all? What
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.720]   is this process in which we seem to be involved?" And I put it like that deliberately for this
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:58.920]   reason. It is so evident and clear that we as human beings are involved in the process.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.200]   Everybody claims that what is happening is being directed by men. Men are used, of course,
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.880]   as instruments. But what is happening today is not the result of some human planning.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:16.040]   We are all conscious of some power behind men, something at the back of it all, that
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:22.040]   is manipulating us and all our movements and our activities, whether we are individuals
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:29.640]   or whether we are as nations. And the result is, I say, that the supreme question at the
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:37.920]   moment is this whole question of history, its meaning and its purpose. What is the future
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.920]   going to be? That's the question, isn't it? What lies ahead of us? What's the meaning
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:51.040]   of it all? What's the meaning of life itself, therefore? That becomes our ultimate question.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:58.360]   And now then, there I think we'll all agree, is the urgent matter that is facing the whole
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:07.280]   of mankind just at this very moment. And as life becomes more and more uncertain, scarcely
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:13.880]   a week passes now, but that something new is put before us in the newspapers, some means
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:19.000]   of death, some way of destroying half the world or the whole world with just a little
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:27.160]   test tube and its contents. Now, the whole of our life is thus, as it were, utterly uncertain.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:33.800]   So that all thinking people are contemplating this question and doing so very rightly. What
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:40.120]   is it? What's happening? What's it all going to lead to? What's the ultimate of
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:46.760]   all this? Is there any rhyme or reason in life? Are we just the subject of some mad,
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:54.680]   wild forces over whom and over which nobody at all has any control? Or is it possible
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:08:02.000]   to say that amidst all the confusion and the alarms and excitement of the present times,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:10.680]   there is nevertheless a clear line to be seen and a view of history that is adequate to
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:17.280]   explain the present and the past and to give us some insight into the future?
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:24.720]   Well now, that is precisely the subject which is dealt with in this 24th chapter of the
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:30.960]   Gospel according to St. Matthew, which I am proposing to consider with you for two or
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:37.360]   three Sunday evenings. Because, I say, it is the most urgent question, the most relevant
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:43.080]   question. I am particularly anxious to be addressing and talking to men and women who
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:48.520]   say that they don't want a Gospel which, as they put it, is just some pie in the sky.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:53.120]   They want something to help them to understand life and to live very well, my dear friend.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.120]   I am here to show you that there is nothing that really does that but this New Testament
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:02.880]   Gospel. And that is why I am calling your attention to this particular section. For
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:11.520]   here, our Lord himself deals with this most modern of themes, this most urgent of problems.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:16.600]   Now, you remember the way in which he did it. It is most extraordinary. It is really
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:24.600]   fascinating. The story begins at the end of chapter 23. There was our Lord in the temple
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:31.360]   and he was speaking to the people. And he ends, you remember, with these words, "O
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:38.720]   Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent thee,
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:44.800]   how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:56.360]   together under her wings, and ye would not. Behold, your house is left unto you desert,
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:06.320]   for I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:15.920]   in the name of the Lord." And then chapter 24 begins, "And Jesus went out and departed
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:23.920]   from the temple, and he never went into it again." It was his last visit. He never
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:30.280]   entered it again. He was saying farewell to it, and he was pronouncing his judgment upon
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:42.000]   it. He says, "Behold, your house is left unto you desolate." And then, as he walks
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.440]   out of the temple and walks away from it, we are told that his disciples, who had been
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.760]   with him, of course, but were walking behind him, they rushed on to him and said, "Wait
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:11:02.640]   a moment, Master. His disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple,
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:08.080]   and they were magnificent buildings, as I am going to indicate to you." They pointed,
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:12.320]   they said, "Look here, look at the buildings. What are you saying?" They said, "Did we
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:17.440]   understand you correctly when you said that this building is going to be a desert? It's
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:22.400]   going to be made desolate, but Master, just look at them." And they indicated the greatness
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:30.960]   and the grandeur and the magnificence of the buildings. And then our Lord said unto them,
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:37.760]   "See ye not all these things?" The very things that they were indicating to him. "Verily
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:43.680]   I say unto you, there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:55.600]   down." And then they went on walking, and they began climbing up the Mount of Olives,
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.040]   which was opposite the temple. The temple was on a hill, and the Mount of Olives was
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:07.200]   opposite. And there we understand they had another magnificent view of the temple, because
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:14.080]   the sun was setting, and it was shining on the temples, a sort of spotlight upon the
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:22.840]   temples. The setting sun illuminating it with its red blazing glory, bringing out the colors
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:30.480]   and the magnificent spectacle. And as they were there, the disciples again came to him
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:40.840]   privately and said, "Tell us, when shall these things be? And what shall be the sign
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:47.760]   of thy coming, and of the end of the world, or the end of the age?" And then our Lord
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:53.840]   proceeds to address them, and to explain something of what he means.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:13:01.120]   Now this is the question that is before us. And you see, in dealing with these questions
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:09.800]   of these disciples, our Lord proceeds to do two things. He tells them about the future
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:18.960]   of the temple and of the city of Jerusalem, and the destruction of both. And then he goes
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:28.320]   on to say that that is but a kind of small picture of what is going to happen eventually
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:40.800]   to the whole world, when he comes back again into the world at the end of the age.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:46.280]   In other words, what we've got here is this. We've got our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:55.120]   looking into the future, making a prophecy, indicating the course of history, and especially
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:04.720]   dealing with the end of history. Now, surely there was never a statement in the Scripture
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:11.960]   that was more directly opposite to our present condition than just this very matter that
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:21.400]   we are looking at. In this age of bewilderment and confusion, here is a statement that surely
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:28.680]   demands our most urgent attention. And as I have been saying already, I would say again,
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:36.360]   surely my dear friends, as we feel increasingly the uncertainty of our life in this world,
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:44.120]   the precariousness of our whole hold upon life, and the dread possibilities that are
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:49.680]   confronting us, which make us say we are here today and gone tomorrow, and when men who
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:56.240]   are far removed from Christianity are talking about the end of the world, the final explosion
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:02.320]   that is going to destroy everything, and mankind committing mass suicide as we are in such
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:10.400]   a situation, what can be of greater value to us or more urgently important for us than
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:14.000]   to consider this tremendous statement?
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.120]   Now this statement that is recorded in this twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew's Gospel
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:26.760]   is notoriously an extremely difficult one, because in this one statement our Lord deals
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:33.160]   with the two subjects. He deals with the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple. He also deals
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:38.560]   with the end of the age, and that there are times when it is almost impossible to tell
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:45.440]   which of the two things he has most prominently in his mind. Fortunately for us, that rarely
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:53.360]   does not matter, because what he certainly is teaching is this, that it is the same principle
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:16:00.000]   that works in the one as in the other. The destruction of Jerusalem and the temple is,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:09.880]   as I say, a pale adumbration, a foretelling of this final cataclysm and destruction which
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:13.080]   is to come with respect to the whole world.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:17.080]   Very well, there are certain things in this chapter which are not plain and clear. I am
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:21.320]   not going to direct your attention to them. This is no time for theorizing. There are
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:25.440]   people who understand it all. They can explain everything. Well, I do not envy them because
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:31.080]   I know they are wrong, and we are told not to do the very thing they do. I am not going
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:37.000]   to deal with these things. This is no time, I say, for speculation. I am concerned about
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:45.960]   what our Lord himself was so clearly emphasizing, namely the big principles that govern both
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:53.400]   events and that really indicate to us the way to live in such a period of transition
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:17:00.920]   and uncertainty, with judgment in the very air and the whole of life so precarious.
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:06.280]   Very well. Now then, this evening I want to look at what we may call the introduction
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:15.560]   to all this, and it is to me a most fascinating thing. The very introduction to this incident
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:22.640]   which we have in these two verses, the first two verses, it seems to me is a very perfect
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:28.680]   portrayal of the gospel of Jesus Christ coming to the world, coming, if you like, to the
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:36.920]   modern man. I see the modern world represented very perfectly by these disciples. How often
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:42.160]   did they take up that role? They did it quite unconsciously. Thank God for the gospels with
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:47.960]   their details. How frequently did these disciples make fools of themselves by asking ridiculous
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:53.120]   questions? Thank God they did, and that we know they did because we are equally foolish
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:58.520]   and we ask exactly the same questions today. Here they are then, and they represent, I
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:06.360]   say, the modern man, if you like, the world, listening to the gospel. The gospel is spoken
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:12.560]   by the Lord Jesus Christ himself. And what is the effect of the gospel upon them? There
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:18.640]   is no difficulty about answering that question, is there? The effect of the gospel upon them
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:27.880]   is to surprise them, is to amaze them, is to astonish them. He seems to be saying things
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:34.880]   that are incredible, things that are impossible, things that surely are beyond the very bounds
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:40.160]   of the remotest possibility. Here he is in the temple, you see, and he looks at it and
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:47.640]   he says, "Behold, your house is left unto you, desert, desolate." Desert, they say?
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:52.120]   These buildings, the temple, the thing is impossible. "Master," he said, "have another
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:56.800]   look at them. Realize what you are saying." And on he speaks, and the more he says, "the
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:03.840]   more amazed and astonished they are." Oh, I am stopping with this just for a moment
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:10.600]   in order, you know, just to say this very simply. If the gospel of Jesus Christ has
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:17.640]   not come to you as a surprise, you have never heard it, you do not know it. It is the most
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:23.200]   astonishing thing in the world. It is unlike everything we have ever heard or anything
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:31.720]   we ever shall hear. This gospel is so essentially different from everything we have ever thought
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:37.640]   or expected or imagined or anticipated that when we first hear it we say, "This is impossible,
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:48.920]   it cannot be." But such it is. And the surprise and the astonishment of these disciples which
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:56.760]   led them to put their questions is the surprise of every human being that realizes for the
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:04.200]   first time exactly what the gospel is saying. Very well, what does it say? What is the cause
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:11.000]   of the surprise? What is there about this that is so amazing? I think I can put it to
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:19.560]   you in the form of three principles. The first principle is this. The gospel amazes us and
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:30.920]   astounds us because in the first place it pronounces the doom and the destruction of
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:46.120]   all that man regards as great. That is its first pronouncing, the doom and the destruction
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:55.400]   of everything that man regards as great. Now of course that is what our Lord had been doing
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:01.640]   here with regard to these temple buildings. The disciples are listening to it. "Behold,
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:07.880]   your house is left unto you desolate." And they say to one another, "What is he talking
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:13.080]   about? What is this? His teaching used to be so wonderful, Sermon on the Mount, ethics
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:19.640]   excellent and all his miracles, but now he is talking about the destruction of this."
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:23.160]   Let's go and point it out to him. Let's go and tell him. So they went to him and they
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:28.520]   said, "See, look at the buildings of the temple." And you know they were very wonderful.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:34.080]   Mark in his account of this incident describes the buildings like this. He says they were
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:47.560]   great buildings. And they were. They had been built out of wonderful white strong stones.
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:54.160]   The measurement of some of these stones was something like this. They were forty feet
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:22:05.160]   by twelve feet by twenty feet. Huge slabs, masses of white stone, a kind of limestone.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:11.280]   And they had been carved and cut to perfection and there were large numbers of them. Then
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:18.200]   there were some of them that were even, we understand, eighty-five feet long. One man
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:25.480]   once said that any man who had never seen this Herod's Temple had never seen a great
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:31.880]   and a magnificent building. It was one of the greatest buildings in the whole world.
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:37.640]   And in addition to all this solidity and this massive character, it was built, you remember,
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:43.200]   upon a rock. And not only that, there were other beautiful stones that had been added
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:49.480]   as a kind of ornamentation and various other offerings had also been added. The temple,
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:54.040]   in other words, was one of the great spectacles of the world. There was nothing that these
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:59.320]   people were more proud of than the temple buildings. And so the disciples, they came
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:04.260]   to him for to show him the buildings of the temple. Of course, he'd been in there many
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:08.360]   a time and had seen them as often as they'd seen them. But why do they want to show him?
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:12.080]   Well, they want to show him the temple and the buildings and their character because
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:19.240]   of what he's just said. Well, what are they emphasizing? Oh, how typical they are of men
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:24.520]   as he is in this world. You know, those old disciples were doing the very thing that men
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:31.080]   have been doing, especially during this present twentieth century. What were they doing? Well,
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:37.120]   they were pointing to the things of which they made their boast and of which they rejoiced.
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:44.080]   Look at them, they said. Look at the temple. Look at the buildings. And what do they want
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:53.520]   him to see? Well, they want him to see man's achievement. Look at the temple. There's nothing
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:24:00.200]   like this temple. Think of the men who built this temple. Think of the ingenuity. Think
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:07.000]   of the ability. Think of the skill that has gone to the building of such a building. That's
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.520]   what they were saying. They, as Jews, were very proud of the temple. They made their
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:17.160]   boast in the temple. And, you see, they call attention. Just stand back and look at it
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:23.520]   as if and admire it. How marvelous men is that he can erect such a building. You see,
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:29.440]   mankind has been doing that all through its long history, hasn't it? You remember how
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.680]   they built a tower of Babel at the very beginning? They said the same thing about that. It was
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:38.920]   a tower that was to go up into heaven. At last, man was so wonderful, you see, he'd
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:45.120]   so perfected his skills and his crafts that at last he can build a building that goes
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:51.560]   from earth to heaven, and standing on the top, man will be able to see into heaven.
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:56.600]   Man's achievement, the tower of Babel. Do you remember reading about a great king called
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:03.660]   Nebuchadnezzar, a great king in Babylon? And he one day stood back and did the same thing.
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:13.880]   "This great Babylon which I have built, well, I mustn't keep you." Hasn't this been rather
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:20.720]   a favorite occupation with mankind during this present century? Oh, it still is, of
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:27.600]   course. Man's achievement. Wonderful. Look what he's made, look what he's done, look
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:34.320]   what he's discovered, look what he's invented. Look at the bridges he's built. Look at the
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:39.400]   use he's made of science. Look at the way he can fly. Look at him breaking the sound
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:49.080]   barrier. Man, man's achievement. How magnificent, how truly wonderful. There's no limit to it.
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:53.760]   Stand back, says mankind, and look at it. Go and spend your time in a miserable chapel.
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:59.880]   Go and look at what man is capable of. Look at man's ability, his subtlety, his ingenuity.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:05.240]   What a piece of work is man. How infinite in faculty. There's nothing he can't do. So
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:12.560]   look around, they say, and see what man has produced and what man has achieved. Study
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:19.720]   medicine. Look at the discoveries. Look at physics. Go to art, literature, drama, everything.
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:26.440]   Man, what a wonderful creature he is. How magnificent are his efforts and his productions.
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:36.520]   And then, as I say, in addition to thus admiring and looking at man's ability and man's achievement,
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:45.320]   they admire also in it its sheer beauty and its greatness and its glory. It isn't merely
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:51.320]   human ability that's being worshipped and admired. It's the result of this ability.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:59.840]   To sum it up, I can put it very simply. This is what's called civilization. Civilization.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:05.680]   As the temple was the result of the achievement of men in that respect at that time, so we
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:13.920]   stand back and we look at civilization. My word, we say, how we've advanced, how we've
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:19.040]   grown, how we've gone forward, how we can look back on our forefathers and feel sorry
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:24.700]   for them in their backwoods. What wonderful things men have done. And here is his achievement
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:30.920]   up to date in the 20th century. And we look at the wealth and the largeness and the glory
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:38.040]   and the bigness and the magnificence of it all, our cities, our trade, our communications,
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:45.320]   and all that we've done, I say, in the arts and the sciences, how wonderful it all is.
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:50.600]   And as these disciples asked our Lord to stand and look at it, you and I are being invited
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:55.360]   constantly to look at it today. The newspapers are asking us to look at it. The books are
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:01.240]   asking us. It's a self-admiration society, mutual admiration society. What glory we've
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:09.680]   achieved, how magnificent has been the result of our endeavor. And then, of course, and
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:17.440]   this is perhaps the most material point of all, they were asking him to look not only
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:24.640]   at its magnificence and its beauty and the perfection of its construction, but they were
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:35.520]   asking him especially to look at its durability. Durability, founded upon a rock. These enormous
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:44.080]   foundation stones, these terrific slabs, these corner stones, all these, look at it, they
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:49.960]   said. Durability is the characteristic of this temple. Did we hear you saying your house
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:56.000]   is left into desert? Look again, they said. Can't you see how solid it is? Can't you see
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.760]   how immovable it is? This isn't a tent that can be knocked down by a hurricane. This is
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:06.520]   a temple. Look at the stone's men. Look at their color. Look at their shape. Look at
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:13.920]   their positions. Look at everything. Durability, this is everlasting. Nothing can upset this.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:24.320]   Oh, I mustn't keep you this evening, but I think you realize what I'm talking about, don't
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:33.640]   you? If there was one thing the Victorians, especially the late Victorians and the Edwardians,
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:40.920]   were particularly proud of, it was this element of durability. Oh, I could illustrate it in
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:50.840]   many ways, couldn't I? The empire on which the sun never sets. This is men's achievement.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:59.040]   These solid achievements, life fixed, settled. Man developing in his mind and understanding
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:06.240]   and his intellect to wise ever again to fight. Never be another war, of course not. The thing's
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:13.840]   lost. All that's finished with. We've got a durable, safe, solid society. The world
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:22.640]   at last has come to its own. That was the thought. That was the philosophy. What was
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:28.520]   thought to be completely impossible was the kind of hurricane that would shake the very
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:35.720]   foundations and throw everything, as it were, into the melting pot. Look at the temple.
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:42.720]   Its chief characteristic is its solidity, its durability, its massive character. It's
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:50.080]   something that you can rely upon. And you see there have been large numbers of people
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:56.240]   in this present century in the world who have looked like that upon life itself. They say
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:01.520]   we don't need religion any longer, because we can understand our fathers when they lived
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:07.520]   a sort of nomadic life, moving about from one place to another, hunters, farmers. And
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:11.240]   of course, they hadn't got even houses. They pitched their tents, but it was always
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:15.760]   moving. And then, you know, in that kind of condition with possibility of pestilences
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:21.840]   and storms and showers, well, life was rather uncertain and diseases, and you hadn't got
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:27.280]   public health and things like that to put an end to germs and infections. Well, of course,
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:32.040]   it's very natural that people in that kind of primitive life felt the need of somebody
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:36.680]   behind them, so they believed in gods and they asked their gods to bless them and to
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:43.400]   help them. And of course, it was very understandable. But now, we got rid of all that, and we've
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:48.320]   settled down in life, and the whole thing is solid and durable. And we don't need God,
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:53.480]   and they turn their backs upon God. Why, acts of Parliament could do what God used to do,
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:58.720]   guarantee us a wage, guarantee us a house, guarantee us a hospital and treatment, guarantee
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:04.760]   us a burial, anything you like. Life's fixed, settled, solid, durable. Everything's all
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:09.880]   right. We've got nothing to do but to enjoy it, the solidity and the durability of the
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:20.880]   temple. And yet, here is one who says, "Yes, I am looking at them, and I ask you to look
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:30.640]   at them again. See ye not all these things? Verily I say unto you, there shall not be
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:39.720]   left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down." He said that, you know,
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:45.520]   about the actual temple itself. He was speaking primarily of the temple, but he didn't stop
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:50.480]   at that. He goes on to say, "That's going to happen to the temple, and you know," he
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:56.320]   said, "that's going to happen to the whole world. Everything that man worships as being
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:04.360]   durable and lasting and safe, it's going to be smashed. The world passeth away with the
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:11.520]   lust thereof. The kingdoms of the world and all their glory are passing away," he says.
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:16.600]   He puts it in great detail. You'll find it running as a theme right through the Bible.
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:23.360]   I simply give you one other quotation. Read your book of Revelation, and there you will
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:29.120]   find a word like this towards the very end of all. We are told there will be a great
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:44.160]   cry heard, and what will it be? It will be this, "Babylon! Great Babylon is fallen! Babylon!
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:52.800]   Great Babylon, the pride of the nations, the mistress of the kings! Babylon that's conquered
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:34:04.880]   everybody and seems to have mastered the whole universe! Babylon! Great Babylon is fallen
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:13.720]   and has become the dens of animals of various kinds and of descriptions."
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:21.560]   That is what our Lord is saying at this point, that all that man has put such confidence
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:30.360]   in, everything to which he has trusted apart from God, is going to be destroyed. It's doom,
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:36.600]   and its destruction shall be absolute and final. One stone shall not be left upon another.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:46.760]   It will be utter desolation and final desert.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:53.760]   It's not surprising that these disciples were astonished. We are no longer surprised that
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:59.120]   they were amazed. But my dear friend, have you realized that that is what this gospel
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:04.480]   tells you about this world in which you live? Have you realized that that is what it tells
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:10.560]   you about the most durable, solid, lasting things in life? It tells you they are all
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:14.920]   going to be destroyed, and we have seen a good number of them destroyed, haven't we,
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:23.120]   in our own time and generation? Crowns have fallen, kings have gone, empires have fallen,
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:28.840]   empires are falling. Things which were to last forever are disappearing before our very
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:37.280]   eyes. Oh, anything in which man reposes a final confidence and which he makes the special
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:45.880]   object of his pride and his glorying apart from God is doomed to final destruction. That
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:47.960]   is what he tells them.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:54.040]   Well now, that is what he tells us, I say. But wait a minute, sir, someone. Do you expect
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:36:02.200]   me to believe that sort of thing? I am ready to answer your question. I think it is a fair
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:09.760]   question. A man says to me, "Why should I believe that?" I know that that is the sort
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:13.720]   of apocalyptic that you have in your Bible. You have got it in your Old Testament, in
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:17.600]   the book of Ezekiel, and other places. You have got it here. You have got it, of course,
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:21.360]   in that book of Revelation. But my dear sir, I am no longer interested in that sort of
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:27.040]   apocalyptic. I can explain all that away. We no longer believe in that kind of thing.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:32.200]   Why should I believe this? I say it is a very good and a very fair question, and I want
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.000]   to give you the answer.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.560]   The second thing, in other words, that the Gospel does is this. Having made its pronouncement
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:49.680]   upon all that we regard as so solid and durable, it then calls attention to him, to the speaker.
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:57.000]   Ah, before you accept in court the evidence of a witness, you first of all establish the
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.800]   credentials of the witness, do you not? And rightly so. The opposing counsel has a right
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:05.720]   to get up and to cross-examine. He tries to trip him and to catch him. If he knows anything
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:13.920]   about him, he brings it in. The credentials of the witness, of course. And never were
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:18.240]   they more important than just at this point. We are dealing, I say, with the most solemn
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:23.480]   thing that can ever engage our attention. So therefore I ask, who is this speaker? And
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:31.000]   this is what I find. I find he makes astonishing claims. Listen, here is a man, Jesus of Nazareth,
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.280]   who had worked as a carpenter until the age of thirty. Listen to him as he speaks and
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:43.440]   says, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets and stonest them which
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:53.280]   are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thee, even as a hen gathereth her
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:38:03.840]   chickens together under her wing, and ye would not." I! Here is one who says that he could
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:10.200]   have gathered Jerusalem and all her people together as children, as a hen gathers her
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:14.600]   chickens under her wing and protects them and shields them against that threatening
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:23.680]   coming storm. He does not hesitate to speak of himself like that. And then he goes on
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:29.760]   to say further things about himself in this twenty-fourth chapter. He says he is going
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:33.800]   to come back again into the world, that he is going out of it just then, but that he
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:37.560]   is going to come back and he will ride the clouds of heaven, he will be surrounded by
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:43.720]   holy angels and he will come in judgment. He, this speaker, this carpenter of Nazareth,
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:53.280]   this Jesus. But this evening I want to concentrate attention on one statement only that he makes.
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:58.840]   Have you noticed the confidence with which he speaks? Though he makes his preliminary
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:03.400]   statement and is challenged as it were by the disciples about what he said about that
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:06.640]   temple, they query it, they challenge it, they say, "Have another look at it, look
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:10.840]   at it, it is too durable, what you are talking about desert and desolation. Are you asking
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:16.520]   us to believe," they say, "that this magnificent pile of buildings is going to be reduced to
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:24.560]   rubble and that it is going to be plowed?" "Look again," they said, and still he not
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:30.840]   only makes his statement but he repeats it with much greater force and certainty. "There
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:41.160]   shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down."
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:47.000]   Why should I listen to this speaker? Well, I have got one reason that is more than enough
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:40:01.760]   for me forever. It is this. What he said on that occasion, which was probably about A.D.32,
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:18.320]   literally happened in A.D.70. That very temple by the Roman legionaries was razed to the
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:27.960]   very ground. It was utterly and entirely demolished. Not a stone was left upon a stone. It was
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:35.920]   reduced to rubble. The temple and Jerusalem were destroyed actually as a sheer fact of
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:47.200]   history, some thirty-eight years after our Lord had made this statement and this prophecy.
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:53.480]   Now this is history, you see. We are dealing here with facts. This is not a bit of fantasy.
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:58.840]   This is not general teaching. Here is this speaker committing himself to an absolute
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:06.000]   statement. Even challenged, he repeats it. "This massive, apparently eternal, everlasting,
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.720]   durable building is going to be so smashed that there will not be a stone upon a stone.
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:25.200]   It will all be leveled to the ground, a ruination, desolation." And what he said, though so utterly
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:32.120]   incredible to the disciples and to everybody else, though apparently so completely beyond
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:43.800]   the bounds of the wildest imagination and possibility, literally and actually happened.
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:52.920]   And therefore I say to you that if he is right about this, why shouldn't he be right about
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:42:02.760]   the other? The impossible happened here. Why shouldn't the impossible happen again? Don't
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:08.320]   you see indications and adumbrations of it at this present time? My dear friend, the
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:14.280]   thing to do is to look at this speaker, to see his word verified literally, and then
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:18.680]   to draw the inevitable deduction. What he says about this, he says, is going to happen
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:26.880]   to the whole world. He is right here. What if he is right there?
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:34.480]   So that brings me to my last point on which I say but a word, which is this. What then
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:39.040]   is the real inner meaning and significance of what he did say, and what he goes on to
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:46.240]   say in the whole chapter? I just give you headings. Here it is. What matters here, he
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:52.800]   tells us, is principles, not times and dates and seasons. The disciples did what so many
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:58.080]   of us are anxious to do, and they said, "Tell us, when shall these things be, and what shall
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:02.600]   be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world?" He didn't give them an answer
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:06.840]   such as they wanted. They wanted a fixed date on a calendar. He didn't give it to them.
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:15.440]   He tells us in Mark's Gospel, chapter 13, verse 32, that he didn't know, that only God
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:21.200]   knows. But you see, that isn't the important thing. The important thing is the principles
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:26.360]   that he lays down in his teaching. What are they? Well, here they are, and let me put
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:37.920]   them very simply. One, anything that becomes the object of our faith and of our worship
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:49.360]   and of our final allegiance will be destroyed, even though it should happen to be the temple
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:56.080]   of God himself. You see, that was the whole tragedy of these Jews. That was the temple
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:44:02.880]   built for God. It was God who told them to build a temple where they might worship him,
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:07.980]   where they might take their offerings and sacrifices and worship him. It was God who
[00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:15.400]   commanded them to do that. And yet he is going to destroy the temple. Why? Because they had
[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:22.040]   built the temple instead of God, worshipping the magnificent buildings, worshipping the
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:27.640]   stones, worshipping its position, worshipping Jerusalem, worshipping themselves as a nation
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:32.400]   and as God's people. And the principle, therefore, is this. Anything that becomes
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:44.440]   the object of our worship, our faith, our adoration will be destroyed, even though it
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:50.000]   should happen to be the temple of God. What are you worshipping? What are you trusting
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.440]   to? What are you living for? There are men and women, you know, who live for this country
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:45:00.520]   and for this empire. There are men and women who live for themselves and their own names.
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:05.000]   There are those who live for their children, for their brilliance, for their understanding.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.600]   There are men who worship their own wealth and possessions. There are men who worship
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:15.360]   a thousand and one things. I don't care what it is. It is going to be destroyed completely.
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:26.860]   Not a stone will be left upon a stone. Anything in which men repose a final faith will be
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:34.880]   destroyed before their eyes, and it will be a complete and a desolating destruction. That
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:43.400]   is His first principle. The second is this. It is failure to believe in Him that finally
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:50.680]   leads to this destruction. You see, it isn't that the things are wrung in and of themselves,
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:57.000]   but that they are put into the place of God. That is why He says, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.960]   which art on the point of being destroyed, thou that killest the prophets and stonest
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:07.880]   them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:15.000]   as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wing?" How often would I have done it? But
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:22.400]   you would not, and it is because you wouldn't that the destruction is going to come upon
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:27.840]   you. And you know the destruction, the final judgment and destruction of this world is
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:33.720]   going to take place because men and women don't believe in Him and put their final
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:39.440]   faith and confidence in Him.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:48.200]   And His third principle is this one. There is only one way to save yourself from that
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:57.880]   destruction and to escape it. It is to believe in Him. Had Jerusalem believed in Him, she
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:07.880]   would never have been destroyed. How often there was the opportunity, "He can save
[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:20.720]   from the destruction that is coming, and He alone can do so." How often would I? But
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:30.360]   He would not. O men, O women, living in this uncertain, desperate age, with death round
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:35.040]   the corner, we know not when it may come, not only to us individually, but to masses
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:44.280]   of us and perhaps the whole world itself. Are you going to be involved in that final
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:51.920]   destruction, which is everlasting, remember, without intermission, without relief, without
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:57.720]   end? Are you going to be involved in that outside the face of the glory and the enjoyment
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:04.920]   of God? Are you? There is only one way to escape that. And that is to be unlike these
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:13.000]   people in Jerusalem. It is to believe in Him and to put your faith and trust and confidence
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.800]   in Him who says, as we shall see later on in this very chapter, "Heaven and earth
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:31.240]   shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away." And the last thing I see here is
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:37.480]   this, and it is a wonderful lesson. The temple is going to be destroyed, but he does not
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:41.480]   seem to be very concerned about that. He does not break his heart that the temple is going
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:47.520]   to be destroyed. The Jews could not understand this. They were furious at this. The disciples
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:51.360]   could not understand. The temple destroyed? They say, "What can we do? It is in the
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:56.360]   temple we meet with God. It is in the temple we take our burnt offerings and sacrifices
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:49:01.280]   and make our peace with God. If our temple is destroyed, what can we do? We are undone."
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:14.080]   No, no, he seems to say, the temple has served its purpose. The temple is to be destroyed.
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:23.120]   The temple will be destroyed. The temple can be destroyed. Why? "I am the temple."
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:35.720]   The temple is no longer necessary. There is a way to God without the temple. "I am the
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:46.920]   way to God." He is announcing in a magnificent manner that he himself is all the burnt offering
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:55.840]   and all the sacrifice and all that is necessary to appease the wrath of God. He is the high
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:50:04.360]   priest. He is the beast, the Lamb of God, that is offered. His blood has made the atonement.
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:14.160]   The old temple is no longer necessary. It can go because the way from men to God is
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:23.360]   in him. He is all the temple was and infinitely more. He is in the heavenly temple there representing
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:27.320]   us once and forever.
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:36.280]   As his servant Stephen later said when he was on trial, "How be it the Most High dwelleth
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:45.040]   not in temples made with hens?" As the prophet says, "Heaven is my throne and earth is my
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:52.600]   footstool. What house will ye build me, says the Lord, or what is the place of my rest?"
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:58.520]   "Don't worship the temple," he says to these people. "Don't think that that is essential.
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:14.160]   It's all going to be smashed." But it's all right. "I am the living temple. Come to me
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:23.120]   and you'll be in the holiest of all, and you'll be in the presence of the living God."
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:33.760]   Oh, even a temple built and made with hens is destroyed. But there is a temple not made
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:43.520]   with hens. Eternal in the heavens, come to this in Jesus Christ. And when the whole universe
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:49.440]   is destroyed, the cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces, yea, all which this globe
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:57.800]   shall inherit shall be dissolved and pass like the baseless fabric of our vision. When
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:07.240]   the elements will have melted with fervent heat and the whole cosmos is renovated and
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:17.720]   evil destroyed out of it, this temple will remain and abide. Heaven and earth shall pass
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:28.000]   away, but my words shall not pass away. Beloved friend, in the awful utter insecurity of these
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:35.520]   present days, have you looked at him? I am not asking you to look at a building. I am
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:40.720]   not asking you to look at a temple. I am asking you to look at him, the Son of God, who tabernacled
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:46.080]   here on earth for a while and has taken human nature back with him and is there in glory.
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:58.040]   Look at him and have security. Realize that the final cause of all our ills is our failure
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:06.520]   to believe in him and to believe in God through him. But realize that you can escape the punishment
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:14.680]   and the disaster and the doom that are coming if you but see and believe that he came into
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:22.280]   the world to save you from it, and he saved you from it by taking even your sin upon himself
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:30.240]   and bearing its punishment. And he has gone back to represent you in the presence of God.
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:42.280]   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and be eternally safe. Amen.
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:46.360]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
