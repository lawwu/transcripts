[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.480]   Well, last week I introduced a brief series – at least I thought it would be brief;
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.360]   may get extended a bit – on the subject of heaven on earth.
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:21.360]   And I want to return to that this morning, and probably next Sunday I'll be able to
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.380]   wrap it up.
[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.780]   This is an important series for me and for all of us so that we understand really the
[00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.880]   foundational nature of the church.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.320]   Let's begin this morning with a familiar verse.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:52.080]   Everybody knows Matthew 6:10: "Your kingdom come, Your will be done on earth as it is
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.080]   in heaven."
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.060]   That is really the mandate of the church.
[00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:07.760]   That is the only place where the righteous will of God will be manifest on earth.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:15.200]   That's the church's identification and its calling to be the heavenly kingdom on
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.900]   earth.
[00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.780]   Scripture identifies believers as children of God.
[00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.020]   The family, the household of God through salvation in Jesus Christ.
[00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:39.660]   And then it identifies us as citizens of heaven, as the assembly enrolled in heaven.
[00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.720]   Why?
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.260]   Because if you're a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, you have become a part of the kingdom
[00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260]   of God, the kingdom of heaven.
[00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.480]   Your home is in heaven.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.740]   Your family is in heaven.
[00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.300]   The spirits of just men made perfect the glorified saints.
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.160]   Your king is in heaven.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.240]   Your inheritance is in heaven.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:14.040]   Your heart, therefore, should be in heaven, and your treasures as well.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:22.180]   Our Lord said in Matthew 6, "Don't lay up treasure on earth, where moth and rust corrupt,
[00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.180]   and thieves break through and steal.
[00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.180]   But lay up treasure in heaven, where that does not happen, because where your heart
[00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.180]   is, that's where your treasure will be."
[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.180]   Everything that matters to us on an eternal level is part of the heavenly kingdom.
[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.180]   And I know that sometimes that's hard to grasp because we are so captive to the world
[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:41.120]   in which we live and so
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:51.880]   we're so trapped in the world of the world.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:03:03.980]   But in 1 Peter 2, we who are a part of the heavenly kingdom are called aliens and strangers
[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.280]   in this world.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:13.220]   This is not our country, not our nation, not our home.
[00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:20.820]   One way to understand it, I think, maybe this will help, is to view the church as a colony
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.580]   of heaven.
[00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.080]   We all know what a colony is.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:32.220]   You have a nation, a ruler, who decides that he wants to plant his power and plant his
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:39.640]   influence and plant his blessings in a place far away.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.680]   There were 13 such colonies that started the United States of America.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.380]   There was a great era in the Western world of colonization.
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.380]   We understand that.
[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.280]   And I think you can...
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.480]   Look at the church as a colony of heaven.
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.620]   Our king is in heaven.
[00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.160]   He rules from there.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.040]   His law is there.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.100]   But his law has been transferred to a colony on earth.
[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:20.420]   His power and his presence are there in heaven, but they too have been transferred to a colony
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.980]   on earth.
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:21.980]   Where his people embody his presence and his power through the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:22.980]   We are to be the culture of heaven on earth.
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.980]   We are to reflect our King, King Jesus, and the law of His kingdom, as well as the benefits
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:28.980]   and blessings of His kingdom.
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:29.980]   That's what the church should be.
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:30.980]   It should be a place of worship, a place of worship, a place of worship that is the place
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:31.980]   of worship, a place of worship, a place of worship that is the place of worship.
[00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:32.980]   It should be a place of worship, a place of worship, a place of worship that is the place
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:33.980]   of worship, a place of worship, a place of worship that is the place of worship.
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:34.980]   And that's where this church is.
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:35.980]   It should be a place of worship.
[00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:36.980]   It should be a place of worship.
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:37.980]   It should be a place of worship.

[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:25.980]   It should be a place of worship.
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:33.020]   And what that says is that the church is being built by the Lord Himself.
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.420]   It is His church.
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:45.020]   It is composed of His chosen people, chosen before the foundation of the world, names
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:54.580]   written in the Lamb's Book of Life, called in time to repentance and faith, regenerated,
[00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:55.580]   justified.
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:59.380]   and becoming part of his church.
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.680]   This is all a work of God.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:08.860]   Let me give you kind of a review briefly by having you turn to Romans 8.
[00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:12.320]   This is so important.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:21.260]   Romans 8, we looked at it briefly, but there's more to say.
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:30.120]   If you look at verse 28 in Romans 8, a very familiar verse: "And we know that God causes
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:39.000]   all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.980]   to His purpose."
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:50.900]   God had a purpose, and that purpose was to redeem men and women.
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:50.900]   And God had a purpose, and that purpose was to redeem men and women.
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:50.900]   And God had a purpose, and that purpose was to redeem men and women.
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:50.900]   And God had a purpose, and that purpose was to redeem men and women.
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:50.940]   And God had a purpose, and that purpose was to redeem men and women.
[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:50.980]   And God had a purpose, and that purpose was to redeem men and women.
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:51.020]   And God had a purpose, and that purpose was to redeem men and women.
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:51.060]   And God had a purpose, and that purpose was to redeem men and women.
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:51.100]   And God had a purpose, and that purpose was to redeem men and women.
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:58.600]   and bring them to eternal glory." He called those people and is calling them even now,
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:04.720]   and that's a call that is irresistible and efficacious. It's a real call,
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.880]   and as a result, they are the ones who love God.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:14.420]   For those whom God has purposed to save, for those whom God has called,
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:23.720]   for those who by regeneration now love God, the promise is God causes all things to work
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:31.760]   together for good. Not all things are good, but nothing, nothing, no matter how evil,
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:42.680]   no matter how bad, can ever alter the end. There are plenty of evil things in and around us;
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.360]   none of them,
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:54.740]   none of them can alter salvation, because God is causing all things to work together for good in
[00:11:54.740 --> 00:12:06.860]   order to fulfill His purpose. And further, notice verse 29 as he unfolds the details of this: "Whom
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:13.580]   He foreknew," it doesn't mean He knew about something in advance. It means He predetermined
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:22.880]   for those He predetermined, He predestined, He predestined to become conformed to the image of
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:27.620]   His Son. That is to say, He predestined them all the way to eternal glory and Christlikeness.
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:32.420]   God didn't predestine people to be saved and then lost;
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:42.320]   He predestined them to Christlikeness and eternal glory. And nothing can alter that,
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:48.260]   no matter what it is. And that, again, is the reason that all things, no matter what they are,
[00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:59.540]   work to good, because God's purpose was to bring the elect to glory. And he says that in verse 30:
[00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:09.800]   "Whom He predestined, He called to Himself; and whom He called, He justified; and these whom He
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.600]   justified, He also glorified."
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:20.720]   Those that He predestined, He called, He justified, and will glorify. And again,
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:28.700]   there's no one lost in the process. And all those things that threaten our salvation,
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:41.060]   God works to good because His saving purpose will stand. A few rhetorical questions follow.
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:45.320]   Notice what Paul says in verse 31: "What shall we say then to these things?
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:52.160]   If God is for us, who is against us?" What he is saying there, who's more powerful than God?
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:59.000]   If God has determined that all the predestined will be glorified, and if God is working everything
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:07.640]   out for our eternal good, who is more powerful than God? Who can alter that?
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.520]   Yeah, the answer is, "I don't know." But if you're going to be able to do that, then you've got to be able to do it.
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:18.200]   The answer is obvious: "He who didn't spare His own Son, but delivered Him over for us all,
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:24.440]   how will He not also with Him freely give us all things?" He wouldn't give His Son to die for us,
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:34.100]   and then lose us, but He will give us all things as He promised.
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:39.980]   "Who will bring a charge?" Another rhetorical question against God's elect. No one can overpower
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:47.840]   God, and there is no higher court than God, and God is the one who justifies,
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:54.140]   and He has declared us righteous in Christ. There is no higher judge.
[00:14:54.140 --> 00:15:03.440]   Verse 34: "Who is the one who condemns?" Christ Jesus is He who died. Yes, rather,
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:09.200]   who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who also interceded for us. Christ won't condemn us,
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:16.280]   because He took our condemnation. He paid it in full, and God validated that by raising Him and
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:25.160]   setting Him at His right hand to intercede for us. This is the security of God's divine elective
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:31.460]   purpose. Verse 35 poses another question: "Who will separate us from the love of Christ?"
[00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:38.660]   Will tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril,
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:45.980]   or sword? Just as it is written, "For your sake we are being put to death all day long. We were
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:53.360]   considered as sheep to be slaughtered." Will hardship separate us from the love of Christ? No.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:16:00.740]   Verse 37: "In all these things we overwhelmingly conquer through Him who loved us." So, I am
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:05.960]   convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:12.560]   to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing will be able to separate us
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:22.040]   from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. God the Father predestined us. God the Son
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:32.120]   paid the price for our sin. God the Holy Spirit gave us life. That will never change.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.000]   This is the glory
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:45.560]   of the church at its most foundational level. We are God's people by His choice.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:52.700]   And you have to view the church that way. You have to understand that the church is the possession
[00:16:52.700 --> 00:17:03.620]   of God forever, forever. And consequently, we triumph. We look at that in 2 Corinthians 2. We
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:11.000]   always triumph in Christ, which is another way of summing up what we just read in Romans 8.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:20.300]   Secondly, last time we looked at the foundational doctrine, the church and identification. We talked
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:30.680]   about the fact that the church is in union with Christ. There is common eternal life
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:39.620]   between Christ and His church. He that is joined to the Lord is one spirit, one spirit.
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:49.880]   It's a marvelous truth. It's all throughout the New Testament. Just a reminder, 1 Corinthians 1:30:
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:58.580]   "By His doing" - that again refers to God's sovereignty - "by His doing, you are in Christ Jesus.
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:07.160]   You not only believe in Him and receive Him, you are in Christ. You are inseparable from Christ,
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:15.140]   who became to us wisdom from God and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:26.480]   You are in Christ, and in that union is heavenly wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.080]   redemption."
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:36.980]   I love the way the apostle Paul lays this out in Romans 6. Look at Romans 6 just briefly,
[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:45.560]   and verse 3 is a good place to start. "Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:52.640]   Christ" - immersed into Christ, not talking about water, it's using it as a way to express being
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:58.640]   immersed into Christ - "if you have been immersed into Christ, you have been immersed into His death?"
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:04.760]   This is a staggering reality, that when Christ died, we died in Christ.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:13.220]   Verse 4 says, "We have been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:20.660]   from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life. For if we become
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:29.300]   united with Him in the likeness of His death, certainly we shall also be in the likeness of His
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:36.260]   resurrection." We are in union with Christ in His death and resurrection.
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:43.820]   As a result of that, verse 6 says, "Our old self was crucified with Him in order that our body of
[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:49.820]   sin might be done away with, and we would no longer be slaves to sin. For he who has died is freed from
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:50.180]   sin."
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:54.680]   Now, if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him.
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:20:05.120]   So verse 11: "Consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus."
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:15.200]   In Christ, it's an amazing reality. He is in us, we are in Him. This is the great doctrine of
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.580]   identification or substitution or imputation.
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:19.580]   Now, if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him. So verse 11: "Consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus." In Christ Jesus is an amazing reality. He is in us, we are in Him. This is the great doctrine of identification or substitution or imputation.
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:29.780]   And since this is true, every believer has Christ dwelling in him and in her.
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:33.460]   We talked about the practical implications of that last time.
[00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:39.340]   Whenever you meet a Christian, you're meeting someone in whom Christ lives.
[00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:45.120]   How you treat each other is critical because how you treat each other is how you treat
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.580]   Christ.
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:50.100]   And we looked at Matthew 18 to see the practical implications of that.
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:56.300]   You don't ever want to despise one of Christ's.
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.580]   You don't want to cause one of Christ's to stumble into sin.
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:05.380]   "You'd be better off drowned," Jesus said.
[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:13.260]   You want to do everything you can to avoid an offense to one in whom Christ lives.
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:16.080]   So the church can only be understood foundationally.
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:27.320]   "As the elect of God who are in living union with Christ, we live, yet not I," says Paul,
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:31.160]   "but Christ lives in me."
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.640]   We are in Christ and He is in us.
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:38.300]   This is the true church.
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:45.580]   Now let's come to the third foundation pillar, if you will.
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:49.200]   The church and purification.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:55.000]   The church and purification, or the kingdom and sanctification.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.280]   The church is being built by the Lord Himself; that's foundational.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:04.860]   The church is united to the Lord Himself; that's foundational.
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.860]   And the church is called to be like Christ.
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:11.080]   You heard that in the song just a moment ago.
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:15.080]   Pressing toward the mark of the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus is to
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:18.980]   be pressed toward Christlikeness.
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:22.640]   The church pursues holiness.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:30.260]   Go back to Matthew 18, and we looked at that last week.
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:40.380]   But in Matthew, chapter 18 and verse 15, really this is the first instruction in a corporate
[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:44.580]   sense to the church.
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:48.580]   And it's this, Matthew 18:15, "If your brother sins, go and show him his fault in private.
[00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:49.320]   If he listens to you, you have won your brother.
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:49.820]   But if he does not listen to you, take one or two more with you, so that by the mouth of two or three witnesses, every fact may be confirmed.
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:50.420]   If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church, and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a witness."
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:50.960]   It's this.
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:51.460]   Matthew 18:15.
[00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:52.880]   If your brother sins, go and show him his fault in private.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:57.240]   If he listens to you, you have won your brother.
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:06.080]   But if he does not listen to you, take one or two more with you, so that by the mouth of two or three witnesses, every fact may be confirmed.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:10.680]   If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:21.380]   And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector, an outsider.
[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:28.880]   Now, this has to be balanced with the reality that you recognize that fellow believers are the elect of God.
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.300]   They're on their way to eternal glory.
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:37.980]   That you recognize that fellow believers are also temples of the Spirit of Christ.
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.180]   Christ lives in them.
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:41.480]   They are in them.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.480]   And they in him.
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:45.180]   And so you must be careful how you treat them.
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:24:00.840]   But at the same time, fulfilling that treatment of fellow believers in a way that honors Christ calls for confronting their sin.
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.940]   Confronting their sin.
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:08.760]   If your brother sins, go and show him his fault in private.
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.680]   That's a command.
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.680]   That's a command.
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:21.680]   Even though they are the elect of God, even though they are one with Christ, we are still in our fallen flesh.
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:31.680]   And if we are to be the church, then we are to be pursuing Christ's likeness, which is pursuing holiness.
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:37.680]   So when you know another believer is in sin, you go to him in private.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.180]   If he does not respond or she does not respond, you go to him in private.
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:44.000]   respond or she does not respond, you get a couple of other folks to go with you to confirm
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:52.800]   the sin. If they still don't respond, you tell the church, the whole church. That's
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:58.580]   how important holiness is to the Lord. Tell the whole church. Tell the whole church to
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:07.340]   go pursue that sinning believer because the Lord wants purity in His church.
[00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:13.640]   I remember when I first came to Grace and I told an older pastor that I felt I had never
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:18.280]   seen a church that did that, but it was so explicit we had to do that, and his speech
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:24.260]   to me was a long one about, "You'll destroy the church. People won't allow that." And
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:30.820]   my response to that is this: People who want to be like Christ will allow it. People who
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:36.080]   want to be like Christ want all the help they can find, all the encouragement they can find,
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.340]   and even the confrontation.
[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:45.060]   "The confrontation is welcome to those who are Christ." He wants a pure church. Just
[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:53.160]   so we don't get overly obsessed with this confrontation, verse 21, Peter poses a question.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:58.780]   If we're going to be pointing out everybody's sin, confronting everyone's sin, "How often
[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:05.340]   shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him?" Up to seven times? The rabbi said three
[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.340]   times. Peter thought he'd double it and add one.
[00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:19.220]   One, just to be magnanimous, and Jesus said, "No, seven times seventy times." So again,
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:26.420]   the balance of this confrontation is in this endless willingness to forgive.
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:32.040]   So we understand that we are the elect of God, we are the possession of God. We understand
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:37.340]   that we are the dwelling place of Christ as individuals. Yet we understand that our
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:46.640]   sin has to be confronted, but we also understand that it has to be forgiven, mercifully and
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:53.140]   endlessly. The Lord wants His church pure.
[00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:59.100]   There's an illustration in the fifth chapter of Acts, you can look at it just briefly,
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:07.340]   where Ananias and Sapphira famously lied to the Holy Spirit. We won't go through the whole
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:13.040]   chapter, but we'll probably remember it. But Peter says to Ananias in Acts 5:3, "Why
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:21.340]   has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit?" The open public claim of something
[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:29.960]   he did that he really didn't do. He overstated the generosity of his gift, and it was a lie.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:37.340]   And what happened? Well, what happened is in verse 5. "And the Lord said to him, 'You
[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:38.340]   will not be forgiven, for you have sinned, for you have sinned, for you have sinned,
[00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:39.340]   for you have sinned, and you have sinned, and you have sinned, and you have sinned,
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.340]   and you have sinned, and you have sinned, and you have sinned."
[00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:41.340]   And the Lord said, "You will not be forgiven, for you have sinned, and you have sinned,
[00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:42.340]   and you have sinned, and you have sinned, and you have sinned, and you have sinned.
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:43.340]   You will not be forgiven, for you have sinned, and you have sinned, and you have sinned."
[00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:47.340]   Ananias fell down and breathed his last, and great fear came over all who heard of it.
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:28:00.200]   It wasn't adultery, it wasn't homosexuality, it wasn't robbery. It was he lied about his
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:07.340]   giving. And in that early church, God sent a lesson never
[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:17.060]   to be forgotten, and killed Ananias right in the middle of the service. His wife showed
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:25.800]   up later. Down in verse 10, "She fell at his feet, breathed her last feet of Peter,
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:30.800]   and the young man came in and found her dead, carried her out, and buried her beside her
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:37.340]   husband." And verse 11 says, "Great fear came over the whole church."
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:44.280]   They got a lesson in the fact that the Lord wants His church purified. He wants a pure
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:51.620]   church. Another very important illustration of this,
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:59.400]   turn to Revelation, chapter 1. Revelation, chapter 1, is the first vision of John, which
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:07.340]   is an image of Christ. And looking at that image, he sees Christ in the midst of lamp
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:15.340]   stands, which shows Him moving in His church. That's the significance of it. Verse 14 says,
[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:21.720]   "His head and hair were white like white wool, like snow. His eyes were like a flame of fire.
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:26.540]   His feet were like burnished bronze, which has been made to glow in a furnace." This
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:37.340]   is Christ moving in His church. And moving in His church, His penetrating laser eyes
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:46.020]   are like fire, finding sin, and His feet like burnished bronze, glowing in a furnace, are
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:52.040]   an expression of judgment to stamp it out. Even in that magnificent vision of Christ
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:30:01.220]   in His church, there is the threat of judgment. Judgment must begin at the house of God. The
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:07.340]   vision was so frightening. Verse 18, John said, "I will not be able to see the light
[00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:16.280]   of the Lord." Verse 17, John said, "I fell at His feet like a dead man." Christ wants
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:26.500]   a pure church, a holy church. This shows up in the seven letters to the churches. Chapter
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:37.320]   2, verse 16, to the church at Pergamum, "Therefore repent, or else I'm coming to you quickly,
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:44.980]   with the sword of My mouth." Church at Thyatira, verse 21, "I gave her time to repent, and she
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:50.460]   doesn't want to repent of her immorality. Behold, I'll throw her on a bed of sickness,
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:57.320]   those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of their deeds.
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:01.640]   And I will kill her children with pestilence, and all the churches will know that I am He
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:06.320]   who searches the minds and hearts, and I will give to each one of you according to your
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.320]   deeds."
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:14.440]   Our Lord is saying, "I'll judge your church according to its deeds." Deeds of sin will
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:22.980]   bring down judgment from Christ, the head of the church. To the church at Sardis, in
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:29.660]   chapter 3, verse 3, He writes, "Therefore if you do not wake up, I'll come like a thief,
[00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:37.320]   and you will not know at what hour I will come to you." And to the church at Laodicea,
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:43.640]   chapter 3, verse 3, He says, "Those whom I love I reprove in discipline; therefore be
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:57.180]   zealous and repent." Purification is at the very heart of the life of the church.
[00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:07.320]   What is the practical implication of that? I think a good illustration is found in 2
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:18.480]   verses. Verse 20, Paul writing back to this church which gave him so much trouble, and
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:26.160]   he said, "I'm afraid that perhaps when I come I may find you to be not what I wish,
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:31.240]   and may be found by you to be not what you wish. I'm not going to like what I find, and
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:37.320]   you're not going to like me, because I'm fearful that there
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:47.440]   will be strife, jealousy, angry tempers, disputes, slanders, gossip, arrogance, disturbances."
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:53.860]   Verse 21, "I'm afraid that when I come again, my God may humiliate me before you, and I
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:59.820]   may mourn over many of those who have sinned in the past, and not repent of the impurity,
[00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:07.320]   immorality, and sensuality which they have practiced."
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:15.040]   And what would he do if he found that? Chapter 13, this is the third time I'm coming to you.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:20.420]   Every fact is to be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses right out of Matthew
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:26.880]   18. "I have previously said when present the second time, and though now absent, I
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:31.460]   say in advance to those who have sinned in the past, and to all the rest as well, that
[00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:37.320]   if I come, I will not spare anyone."
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:52.360]   That's a loving pastor. If the church is heaven on earth, the church is elect in union
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:34:01.640]   with Christ and marked by purity. Back in chapter 11 of 2 Corinthians, verse 2, Paul
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:07.320]   said, "I'm jealous for you with a godly jealousy. I betrothed you to one husband so that the
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:17.080]   Christ I might present you as a pure virgin." One other text comes to mind, Ephesians 5,
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:20.380]   the marriage passage. But notice its reference to the church.
[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:25.720]   "Husbands, love your wives," Ephesians 5, "as Christ loved the church and gave himself
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:30.640]   up for her, so that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:37.320]   with the word, that he might present to himself the church in all her glory, and that he might
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:42.320]   bless her with the word of the Lord, that he might bless her with the word of the Lord,
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.320]   that she might bless her with the word of the Lord, that she might bless her with the
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:48.320]   word of the Lord, that she might bless her with the word of the Lord, that she might
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:51.320]   bless her with the word of the Lord, that she might bless her with the word of the Lord,
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:52.320]   that she might bless her with the word of the Lord, that she might bless her with the
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.320]   word of the Lord, that she might bless her with the word of the Lord, that she might
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.320]   bless her with the word of the Lord, that she might bless her with the word of the Lord,
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.320]   that she might bless her with the word of the Lord, that she might bless her with the word
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:56.320]   of the Lord, that she might bless her with the word of the Lord, that she might bless her
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:04.020]   If the church is holy, it is heaven on earth; it is heaven on earth.
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:16.020]   If the church is dealing with sin, it is heaven on earth; it is heaven on earth.
[00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:26.120]   Thinking about that, I couldn't help but be drawn to a book written by a Puritan named
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:32.420]   Thomas Brooks, who lived from 1608 to 1680.
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:42.500]   I admit that Thomas Brooks was on my mind because my latest great-grandson is Thomas
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:44.880]   Brooks MacArthur.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:52.000]   He's two months old, and that's a wonderful label to carry.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.920]   Thomas Brooks wrote a book called Heaven on Earth.
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:03.460]   And thinking about his book and its purpose moves us from understanding that the church
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:09.480]   is heaven on earth to the individual.
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:19.260]   Thomas Brooks was writing to believers, helping them to understand how it could be that they
[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:25.720]   not only were part of the church, which is heaven on earth, but that they were experiencing
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:30.620]   heaven on earth in their own lives.
[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:36.620]   He looked at the personal aspect of heaven on earth.
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:45.860]   Listen to the things that he said: "To be in a state of true grace, to be miserable
[00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:55.520]   no more, to be happy forever, a soul in this state is a soul near and dear to God.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:02.480]   It is a soul much blessed and very highly valued by God.
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:05.960]   It is a soul housed in God.
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:10.560]   It is a soul safe in God's everlasting arms.
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:17.220]   It is a soul fully and eminently interested in all the highest and noblest privileges."
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:25.320]   "The being in such a state of grace makes a man's condition happy and safe.
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.320]   It is a soul safe and sure."
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:37.280]   And then he said this: "But the knowing of himself to be in such a state is that which
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:42.960]   renders his life sweet and comfortable."
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:53.300]   What heaven on earth is it if you don't know you're in a state of grace?
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.120]   Thomas Brooks was writing about assurance of self.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:56.120]   He was writing about assurance of self.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.120]   He was writing about assurance of self.
