[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.820]   Well, on social media, why is it that John Piper mostly avoids talking about politics
[00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.000]   and breaking news and hot trends?
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.320]   It's a great question today from an alert podcast listener named Blake.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.760]   Hello Pastor John and thank you for the podcast and for all the many answers you have provided
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.840]   over the years.
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.820]   As I look back through all those episodes, they seem to be primarily life application
[00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.640]   and theology and clarity on Bible passages.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.880]   For the most part, you seem to avoid addressing current events and political hot button issues
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.620]   here on the podcast.
[00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.280]   And I think this is true of most of your ministry in general.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.140]   I'm just curious why not?
[00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.920]   Why do you avoid saying much about current events and politics?
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.800]   Yeah, I've given a lot of thought to that, not just when I heard this question, but other
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.200]   people have made that observation and I make that observation and wonder why it is.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.680]   Why am I the way I am?
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.120]   It is a generalization, let's be clear.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.640]   It's a generalization because I wrote a whole book on racism for goodness sakes and it has
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.160]   political ramifications everywhere and lots of storms and articles on abortion, marriage,
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.160]   homosexuality.
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:21.080]   You know, I've looked Obama right in the face and spoken stuff on YouTube.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.080]   But Blake is right.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.200]   And in general, that is the impression you would get, I think, of my life's work of sermons
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.680]   and messages and articles and APJs and look at the books.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.080]   Piper doesn't come at current events very often.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.600]   In other words, when the Twitter is ablaze with some new controversy, where is Piper?
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.600]   Where's Piper?
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:55.160]   He's over there quoting Bible verses like he doesn't even know what's going on.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.760]   Don't you know we're about to lose the Supreme Court nominee?
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.760]   Come on, do something.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.600]   Okay, here's my six observations about why this is the case.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:16.880]   I was raised in an atmosphere where the spiritual condition of a person's soul, soul, or a people's
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:25.720]   soul is infinitely, get this, infinitely more important than any political transaction on
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.800]   the face of the earth.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:35.440]   Like C.S. Lewis saying, "The salvation of a single soul is worth more than the preservation
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.880]   of all the literary masterpieces in the world."
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.280]   That is an amazing and true sentence.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.880]   It's not clear what the implications of it are for people who make their lives writing
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.240]   and studying masterpieces like Lewis himself, but it's true.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.680]   So I still live in that atmosphere.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.960]   That's who I am.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.120]   I believe that is the atmosphere of the New Testament.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.380]   Okay, that's number one.
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:11.880]   Number two, I feel today that most of the macro in international political economic
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:22.000]   issues are too complicated for me to figure out, and that therefore I don't have anything
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:31.600]   authoritative to say from the Bible about particular strategies for how to solve various
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.120]   political or economic issues.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.320]   I just can't get to the level of expertise that makes me feel warranted to get up and
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.280]   say, "Listen to me, folks.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.840]   I feel that way about the Bible.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.360]   I want people to listen to me.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:52.880]   I want them to hear my perspective on the Bible, but seldom do I come to the point where
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.080]   I feel like some complex issue out there.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:05.920]   I have risen to the level of knowledge that would warrant my voice to be authoritative."
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:12.720]   And besides that, I have a deep skepticism in our day about whether we can know the facts
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:19.680]   of most situations well enough to make pronouncements about them, especially from a distance.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.960]   Good night.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.720]   Here's an immediate example of the kind of thing I feel.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.080]   So just last night, or I guess maybe now it's the night before last, so just night before
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:38.760]   last, I watched an interview with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who won the Democratic primary
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.640]   in New York's 14th Congressional District.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:47.040]   She is to the left of Bernie Sanders on socialism.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.560]   She's a Democratic socialist, explicitly so.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:59.160]   Now you might say this is a kind of test case of the sort of thing, should I write an article
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:07.440]   about, preach about, let's ask Pastor John about, what about the rising tide of socialism
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.740]   in America?
[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.040]   Will I write and speak about this?
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:19.460]   Probably not, though I will be very, very glad that some do, and I'll probably read
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.060]   some of what they say.
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.060]   But here's the reasons.
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:30.320]   Number one, the time and focus it would take for me to do the research about Ms. Ocasio-Cortez
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:37.680]   and Bernie Sanders and the socialist experiments in Venezuela or Sweden and the historical
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.480]   examples of its failures or successes and the reasons a minimum wage law works or doesn't
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.120]   work or the pros and cons of rent control, whether they work or don't work to accomplish
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.760]   anything good long term for the poor, or the probabilities of corruption in a socialist
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.640]   government versus a capitalist government, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, would lead
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:10.100]   me into a wholly different life than the one that I am presently called to do, namely the
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:17.920]   enormous task of understanding the scriptures and preaching what they mean in their original
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:24.360]   context and insofar as I'm able to apply them to people's real lives.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:34.760]   In other words, I deal with the Bible pretty far upstream from the flow down into the nitty-gritties
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.700]   of political realization.
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.700]   That's number one.
[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:48.500]   Number two, I probably will not make myself a teacher about socialism or capitalism because
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.860]   I am a hundred â€“ that's a generalization.
[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.940]   It might be 200 or 190.
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:04.380]   I'm a hundred times more passionate about creating the kind of Christians and the kind
[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:12.460]   of churches that stand unshaken, faithful, biblical, countercultural, spiritually minded
[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:19.820]   in a socialist America than I am in preventing a socialist America.
[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:25.460]   I am a hundred times more passionate about creating Christians and churches that will
[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:31.940]   be faithful, biblical, countercultural, spiritually minded in a socialist America, in a Muslim
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:39.140]   America, in a communist America than I am in preventing a Muslim America, a communist
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.340]   America.
[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:45.940]   That puts me in a very different ballpark than many public voices.
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:56.340]   My main calling is not to help America be anything but to help the church be the church,
[00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:02.820]   the radical outpost of the kingdom of Christ, no matter what kind of America it happens
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:07.060]   to be in or any other people, group, or country in the world.
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:15.580]   And I say that, again, glad, glad, glad, glad that there are Christians who are politically
[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:22.900]   more active than I am in trying to shape laws that are just and wise.
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:27.420]   Third observation for why I am oriented this way.
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:33.460]   I've already hinted at it, simple limitations, not just that many issues are too complicated
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:40.680]   for me to be a teacher about them, but that my capacities for doing the necessary investigation
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:48.960]   and reflection are limited by how slowly I read and what my emotional and relational
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:54.820]   bandwidth is given the other commitments in my life.
[00:08:54.820 --> 00:09:02.220]   I operate with very significant limitations that anybody who knows me knows what they
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.220]   are.
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:10.140]   And I have to steward the little strengths inside these massive limitations so as to
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.980]   be as useful as I can be.
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:13.980]   That's the third observation.
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.740]   Here's number four.
[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:22.500]   We're all wired differently by God, and that includes the kind of things we naturally incline
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.460]   to think about and find interesting and provocative.
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:32.140]   And my own bent is not towards social, cultural, political, macro issues.
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:39.900]   My bent, for whatever reason, it's just a personal bent, my bent is toward the way the
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:46.740]   individual soul works in relation to God and Christ and the Holy Spirit and faith and holiness
[00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.980]   and human relationships.
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.500]   Why do individual people love or hate?
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.060]   Why are they afraid or have confidence?
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.640]   Why are they lazy or active?
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.020]   Why are they foolish?
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:06.740]   Why are they craving security or making sacrifices and taking risks?
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:07.880]   Why do they have joy?
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:13.060]   Why do some people have joy in pain and others get angry at God?
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:21.580]   These are the kinds of questions that stir my emotional engagement way more than whether
[00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:27.180]   rent controls are effective or not in helping people.
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.180]   Number five.
[00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:35.020]   I do feel that the greater long-term impact for the glory of Christ and for the good of
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:43.660]   the nations, for the purity and strengthening of the church will come not through the politicizing
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:52.100]   of my voice, but through a more penetrating, personal, eternal focus on the human soul
[00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:57.180]   and how it can be most effectively conformed to Christ.
[00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:05.540]   Proverbs 4.23 says, "Keep your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs
[00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.580]   of life."
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:13.780]   Everything flows downstream from this spring.
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:21.820]   So my bent is to focus there, on the spring, up in the mountain, on the heart, and then
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:29.980]   trust God that there will be this ongoing, widening, spreading, leavening effect for
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:34.100]   good in churches and families and cities.
[00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.340]   And last observation.
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:44.980]   The stream that flows from the spring of biblical faith will inevitably touch all the issues
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:49.180]   of life, including social, political issues.
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:57.340]   The people that live close to those issues, social, political realities, and who are Christian
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:05.500]   should, should speak and act in relation to those issues in ways that are distinctly Christian.
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:11.180]   But what those Christians, those public and more engaged Christians than I am, what those
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:20.180]   Christians need from their pastors week in and week out is probably not that those pastors
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:27.900]   become experts in every issue that faces the local, state, national legislature, but rather
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:37.940]   that these public Christians be fed, steadily, steadily fed on a stream of exposition of
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:45.020]   what biblical texts actually mean with whatever measure of application the pastors can bring.
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:52.380]   If a pastor is faithful to do consistent, rich, serious, careful, unflinching expositions
[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:58.940]   of the whole counsel of God in Scripture, his messages will certainly touch on the ethical
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:04.340]   dimensions of social, political realities of the world where people live.
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:13.460]   And he will see when a biblical moral issue in Scripture has a clear and unavoidable connection
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:20.540]   to a current issue or prominent sin in the culture, and he'll draw that out and call
[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:25.060]   for courage and righteousness and holiness in his people.
[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:36.340]   But, last comment, he will never lose sight that the greatest issues are not temporal,
[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:37.680]   but eternal.
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:46.100]   For what does it profit a man if he gained the whole world and forfeit his soul?
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.100]   Amen.
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:52.420]   As a sobering end to the matter, thank you, Pastor John, for pointing us to those eternal
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:57.820]   truths once again, and thanks for listening to the podcast over at our online home.

[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:17.260]   Well on Wednesday and Friday, we finish the week out with two questions from two couples
[00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:23.580]   facing premarital pregnancies, one involving a believer and an unbeliever, and another
[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:27.460]   scenario involving two professing believers.
[00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:32.640]   First up on Wednesday, Pastor John will answer whether or not a premarital pregnancy between
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:39.380]   a believer and an unbeliever, does that scenario nullify the unequally yoked principle?
[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:44.540]   It's a really good question sent in from a pastor who's helping a couple walk through
[00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.380]   the decisions ahead.
[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:49.500]   I'm your host Tony Renke, we'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:50.020]   Thanks for listening.
