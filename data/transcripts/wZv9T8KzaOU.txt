[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Brandon writes in with a very common question.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   "What do we do when God has seemed silent for a really long time?
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   I feel almost no joy.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   I go repeatedly to the Scriptures and most often walk away still discouraged and unhelped.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   I pray continuously and feel like I get no response.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   I am so cast down, Pastor John. What do I do?"
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Brandon, I am sorry for the darkness and the distance that you feel.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Your situation is so common to God's people that many, many books have been written
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   about this kind of experience of darkness and distance.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   I know that doesn't make it easier that books have been written about your experience,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   but it might help you not doubt your standing with God just to realize that I and others,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   thousands of others, have shared seasons like that.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   I wish I knew you better, Brandon, so that I could be sure you really do grasp the gospel of Jesus,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   that he died for sinners like us, he absorbed the wrath of God against his people,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   he covered our sins by paying the price of the suffering and death we deserved,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   he rose from the dead to give invincible hope, he purchased a new covenant promise
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   never to let his people fall away into destruction, and he makes all of this available to us by faith alone,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   by seeing ourselves as helpless and receiving, receiving like a little child,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   all that God is for us in Christ and embracing him as our supreme treasure.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   That's the gospel, so I want to make sure that you are resting there, embracing that,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   even though you may be experiencing some feelings of distance from God right now.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   I hope you're casting yourself wholly on that.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Even so, I know there are seasons of darkness, so I want to try to answer your question.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   You say, "What do I do?" Let me point you to the biblical pattern in answer to that question.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   It's as if the Bible hears you, asks the question, and answers it,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   and some of the answer is, "Seek him continually and wait for him."
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Seek him and wait for him. So here's the seek part.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Psalm 27, "You have said, 'Seek my face, Lord.' My heart says to you, 'Your face, O Lord, do I seek.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Hide not your face from me." So what does that seeking look like?
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   The Psalms are so helpful here. They're just full of examples.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Psalm 6, "Be gracious to me, O Lord, for I am languishing.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Heal me, O Lord, for my bones are troubled. My soul is greatly troubled.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   But you, O Lord, how long?" Or Psalm 13, "How long, O Lord? Will you forget me forever?
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   How long will you hide your face from me?
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   How long must I take counsel in my soul and have sorrow in my heart all the day?"
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Or Psalm 90, "Return, O Lord, how long? Have pity on your servants.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love."
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   So there's a picture of people who, they don't know how long this is going to last.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   God has seemingly gone away. They don't presently experience much satisfaction in him.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   That's why they're crying out for it.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   So we are to seek the Lord by crying out to him continually like that to show up in power and reveal himself.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   So don't stop seeking because it's been a long time.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   And then comes that "wait" part. Oh, how many places and parts of the Bible are "wait, wait."
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Dozens of passages. Psalm 37, "Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Fret not yourself over the one who prospers in his way."
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   There are people who are just going on just fine and leaving you behind.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Don't fret over that. Wait.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Psalm 27, "Wait for the Lord. Be strong. Let your heart take courage. Wait for the Lord."
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   And perhaps most encouraging of all for me is Psalm 40.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   I remember when I first came to Bethlehem, I wanted people to know how I felt about these seasons of distance and darkness.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   That summer, I think it was the summer of '80 or '81, I preached summer psalms, I think I called them.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   And one of them was called "In the Pits with the King."
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Psalm 40, "I waited patiently for the Lord."
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   No indication of how long. Just, "I waited. He inclined to me and heard my cry.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   He drew me up out of the pit of destruction, out of the miry bog."
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   So there's David for a season, we don't know how long, in a pit and in a miry bog.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   And then he finally experiences God come and it says, "He set my feet upon a rock, making my steps secure.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord."
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   And in those last words, you hear one of the purposes of God.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   If you wonder, "Why would he do this to David and to me?
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Why would he leave us languishing in such a pit as this?"
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   And his answer is, "Many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord."
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   It's a strange kind of evangelism, it really is.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   But take heart, that may be what he's doing in your life.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   I mean, the world doesn't just need chipper, successful people.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   The world needs people who have walked through darkness and come out at the other end in some measure
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   and can empathize with what they're going through.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   So my own experience is that my sorrows and my struggles and my sense of God's distance
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   have made me a better pastor, a more effective pastor, not a less effective pastor.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   So I would encourage folks who think this is just all pointless.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   If you ask, "How long?" I don't know. I just know you mustn't let go. Don't let go.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   I had a friend who was seriously depressed for eight years, almost to the point of immobilization.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   If I described it, it would be way beyond what you're experiencing, I think.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   And then one day, after years of memorizing Scripture and holding on and waiting and seeking,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   something happened. God broke in and he broke out of his depression.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   I knew him until the day he died, and he never went back into it.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   And he always chalked it up to the fact that he continued in the Word,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   even when he didn't feel much and could barely function,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   he continued in the Word and sought the Lord.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   So a book may not be helpful right now.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Sometimes being told there's a book about your situation when you're dark doesn't help.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   But if it does, if that sounds hopeful, I wrote a book because I have been asked,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Brandon, I have been asked this question so many times about what if I don't have joy?
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   What if God feels distant?
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   So I wrote a book called "When I Don't Desire God,"
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   and I would send you there when you feel able.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   But let me pray for you that God would take this and help.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Father, I just want to close with a quick prayer for Brandon that you would work,
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   that you would return to him, open his eyes, grant him to see you,
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   grant him to feel your preciousness and the love that you have for him.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   I pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Yes, amen. Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   And that sermon mentioned earlier is titled "In the Pits with a King."
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   And if a book is of interest to you, see "When I Don't Desire God,"
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   and see also a little book that John Piper wrote titled "When the Darkness Will Not Lift."
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Go to DesiringGod.org, and there you can find the sermon and the books
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   and thousands of other free resources from John Piper, all free of charge
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   and all intended to help explain why God is most glorified in us
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   and why we are most satisfied in Him and to get help when you find this is difficult.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We'll be back on Monday.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   [Silence]
