[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580]   So we talk a lot here about the mechanics of how to organize and execute your work in
[00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.940]   a world that is full of digital distractions.
[00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.720]   Today I want to change course a little bit and talk instead about where you do your work.
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:20.220]   We've made cognitive jobs, grinding and exhausting, almost like we're toiling in a mental factory.
[00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.660]   We come to our nondescript desks and open up our screen and just it goes until we can't
[00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.660]   take any more.
[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.340]   But it doesn't have to be this way.
[00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.860]   By getting more radical about where you do the most important of your work, you can actually
[00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.940]   change the entire character of your professional life.
[00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.940]   That's what I want to talk about in this deep dive.
[00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.540]   I'll give you some examples of people who have done radical things with where they work.
[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.540]   I'll show you some of the interesting places I work.
[00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.180]   I'll get into the theory about why that works and some ideas for how you can put these ideas
[00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.180]   into play yourself.
[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.700]   But where I want to start is actually from somewhere deeper in my past.
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.580]   I want to roll all the way back to 2008.
[00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:07.540]   This is when my newsletter, Study Hacks, was focused exclusively on students and in particular
[00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.660]   college and university life and how to be successful as a student.
[00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.100]   Way back then I introduced a concept that's going to be relevant to our discussion today.
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.440]   I'm going to bring this up on the screen for people who are watching.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.960]   This is an article from 2008 titled "Adventure Studying - An Unconventional New Approach
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.700]   to Exam Preparation."
[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.540]   At the very top of this post I actually say, "Exam Advice Week here at Study Hacks is winding
[00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.540]   down.
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.540]   So sad.
[00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.540]   Next week it's back to the normal mix."
[00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.300]   I used to do interesting things on here, Jesse.
[00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.260]   I forgot about this.
[00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.900]   Back in the day of blogs and newsletters, it was like a TV channel.
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.700]   You would have different days, you would have different content, you'd have theme weeks.
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.500]   Anyways, I kind of missed that.
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.980]   All right, so I want to read a little bit from this article because we're going to connect
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.980]   these ideas to the world of work here in a second.
[00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.940]   All right, I'm reading from my own 2008 article here.
[00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.540]   For many students, this thought reeks of heresy.
[00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.940]   The thought here is like working somewhere unusual.
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.940]   Conventional wisdom says studying happens on campus, or if you're feeling particularly
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.740]   crazy, maybe in a Starbucks near campus, and that's it.
[00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.540]   It's supposed to be a grind that takes place in the same old boring library surrounded
[00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.140]   by the same old boring people, and by the end with your eyes rimmed red with exhaustion,
[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.460]   your skin sallow and whitened from fluorescent saturation, you can grin feebly and announce,
[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.540]   "I survive."
[00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.540]   Here's my question.
[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.540]   Does it have to be like this?
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.860]   At Dartmouth, I frequently sought ways to challenge this conventional wisdom.
[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.340]   When I would see the hooded sweatshirted masses trudging towards the library at the beginning
[00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.860]   of the finals period, I would turn and run in the opposite direction.
[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.700]   I was known to drive 20 minutes away from campus to study at a bookstore where no one
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.820]   knew or cared that my school had exams.
[00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.220]   I would sometimes tackle authority take-home exam questions while walking the banks of
[00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.220]   the Connecticut River, anything to avoid the cinderblock study lounges that most students
[00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.380]   believed bafflingly that they were contractually bound to inhabit during this period.
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.380]   I call this tactic adventure studying.
[00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.400]   The basic idea is simple.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.500]   Our minds crave novelty.
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.300]   If you work on exam preparation and paper writing in novel environments, it becomes
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.420]   easier to engage the material, be more creative, form stronger comprehension, and overall,
[00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.180]   dare I say it, perhaps even enjoy the process.
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.660]   So I had this idea of adventure studying.
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.000]   Here's a photo.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.580]   People sent in their examples of it.
[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.260]   Here's a photo I want to load up on the screen here.
[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.740]   See that really nice waterfall, Jesse?
[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.740]   Someone sent in back in 2008, like this is where they did their exam studying.
[00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.700]   They would hike to this waterfall and sit by it to do their work.
[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.580]   I mean, that just sounds nice as compared to a study room.
[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:47.580]   All right.
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.060]   So here's my idea today.
[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.700]   Why can't we apply the same idea originally developed in the context of university life
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.580]   to knowledge work?
[00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.820]   The stuff we do in our cognitive jobs.
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:06.540]   Why don't we go to inspiring and unusual places in our jobs to do the most demanding or interesting
[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.380]   work that we have to tackle?
[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.740]   Let's call this adventure working, and I think it's something that we should give more of
[00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:16.740]   a thought to.
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:21.900]   Now, in my new book, Slow Productivity, I do talk about this.
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.340]   In the principle on working at a natural place, I talk about environments conducive to brilliance,
[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.660]   that if we look at people who build things with their mind historically, before our current
[00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.260]   moment of sort of email-driven knowledge work, they would often, we would see many examples
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.620]   of them leveraging really interesting and novel environments to do their most important
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.620]   work.
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.400]   I have a few pictures I want to show here, examples of this.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:52.500]   So right here, this picture on the screen, this is the Isle of Skye off the coast of
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.500]   Scotland.
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:00.940]   So if you're listening instead of watching, it looks like it's green moors with rocky
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.220]   cliffs.
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.580]   This picture was posted on Instagram by Neil Gaiman.
[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:13.140]   So Neil Gaiman, of course, the writer, bought a house on the Isle of Skye just for inspiration.
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.140]   Here's what he wrote.
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.540]   Here's his caption for this picture of the Isle of Skye.
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.240]   "I spent some time over the last few weeks in my favorite place in the world, the Isle
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.400]   of Skye.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.400]   This is a photo I took of the," I'm going to say this wrong, "Quarry, which is a lot
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:33.400]   like being in Faerie, the land of the sort of the British mythology, like the land of
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.800]   mythical, like fairies and elves, et cetera.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.960]   Go to Skye, but off season when the weather is blustery and the queues are gone and the
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.280]   restaurants will be happy to feed you."
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.960]   So he ended up buying a house here in part for the inspiration, just for the inspiration
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.960]   of it.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:48.960]   Okay.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.040]   Here's another picture.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.620]   This is Blackwater Pond in Cape Cod.
[00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.400]   There's a picture of someone by the water.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.600]   There's a picture of the water.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:04.840]   Here's a nice pine needle draped path by the pond.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:10.640]   Mary Oliver wrote a famous poem about Blackwater Pond because in general, the poet, the late
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.320]   poet Mary Oliver, did her best writing walking in nature.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.320]   I write about in detail about this in Slow Productivity, but wandering through nature
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.800]   is where she felt like she could get the inspiration to do her acclaimed nature-themed writing.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.040]   And this is a picture of one of these very specific places she walked and wrote a poem
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.040]   about.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.840]   This is so different than looking at a laptop screen, you know, at your kitchen table or
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.840]   home office.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.840]   All right.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:36.840]   One more.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:42.540]   This is the Scottish novelist, crime novelist, Ian Rankin.
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:49.320]   Here he is on Black Isle, which is not an island.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.440]   We had a listener write in about this.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.560]   But off the coast of Scotland as well, a peninsula, not an island.
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.880]   But anyways, he ended up, there's some pictures of him, it's on the water.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.440]   They bought a little cottage and he goes there to do his writing.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:07.800]   And he's this little cottage by the water in the Scottish highlands here in this quaint
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.800]   town.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.120]   And because he couldn't get inspired about his writing, right?
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:17.280]   So we see this in sort of famous or traditional knowledge workers that they do adventure working.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.640]   They care about where it is that they actually do their work.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.180]   Well, the rest of us can do this as well, especially those of us who have at least some
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.640]   days per week that we don't work at the office.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.020]   Remote work is so much more common now.
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.840]   No one really knows exactly where you are.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:37.640]   We've never had more capability to do adventure work than we have right now.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.960]   Now for most of us, this might not mean an island off of the coast of Scotland.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.520]   But think about the opportunities we do have.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.680]   Hiking to a quiet place, like that waterfall I showed earlier.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.160]   Thinking about what you need to work on, the memo you need to write.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.920]   And then when you get to the quiet place, you actually write your first draft of it.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.920]   Museums.
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.320]   You know, that's a big one.
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.900]   That original post on adventure studying, at the top of the post I had a picture of
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:07.480]   a modern art museum in Boston where I went to the scenic room they had overlooking the
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.200]   Charles and I actually did some exam work there.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:15.240]   Here in DC, I often go to the museums because they're free and you can find like an interesting
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:20.240]   atrium or place to sit to work, surrounded by these cultural artifacts that really gets
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.440]   your creative juices going.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.720]   It might cost admission to go to these museums, great.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:30.480]   Maybe for the cost of like your latte, you can now spend a few hours, you know, wandering
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:35.040]   and being inspired, working in a really unusual situation.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:41.560]   Another idea I had back in that adventure studying period was, you know, pubs and bars.
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:42.680]   Speaking of Britain, right?
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:48.920]   There's a big British tradition of you have your sort of pint of cask pulled, low alcoholic
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.920]   beer near the fireplace that you're reading the complicated thing.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.600]   There's a reason why the famous British poets and thinkers and philosophers would sit and
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.040]   do that, because it's kind of, it's conducive.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:06.480]   You're having ideas, there's conviviality of the room and it's different than just your
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.480]   office.
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.960]   Parks are fantastic as well.
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.400]   Finding that scenic part of a park that you like to work.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.480]   I used to do a ton of this, especially when my kids were young.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.480]   We had a nanny at home with the kids and the days I didn't want to go into the office at
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.200]   Georgetown, I didn't want to be at home either because I don't want the kids to see me.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.200]   It was too confusing.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:29.600]   So I would often go and spend hours, various parks in the Montgomery County, Maryland,
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.600]   these various parks.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:35.280]   I would just wander all seasons and didn't sit and write down and write out my ideas.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.000]   And I felt like I got a lot done back in those days.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Hey, it's Cal.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.720]   I wanted to interrupt briefly to say that if you're enjoying this video, then you need
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:51.180]   to check out my new book, Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:56.600]   This is like the Bible for most of the ideas we talk about here in these videos.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:01.980]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.780]   I know you're going to like it.
[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:04.780]   Check it out.
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:05.780]   Now let's get back to the video.
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:10.720]   I actually have a few pictures here of some places I've been doing adventure working in
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.320]   my past.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.200]   These were all in my newsletter, calnewport.com.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.200]   All right.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.200]   So here's a picture here.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:21.120]   It's from a 2015 article titled The Power of the Outdoor Office.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.680]   This is me with the key components.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.680]   All right.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.680]   A coffee.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.000]   I have a composition notebook.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.160]   I was working on a math proof.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.440]   And I'm by a stream.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.720]   Now at height to the stream, I know exactly by the way where this is, it's on Sligo Creek.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:42.320]   You know, for those who are wondering, between Piney Branch and Wayne Avenue, I think.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.320]   Here's another picture.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:48.800]   Here's me working on a math proof, sitting on a rock by a trail.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.160]   I love this stuff.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:56.120]   I got so much of the academic papers, the math proofs I published in the 2010s, you
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.120]   know, came from working outside.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.840]   Here's another picture.
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.320]   This is a picnic table under some trees.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:07.880]   That's actually on the Georgetown campus near the trails.
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.600]   There's these trails that run from the river across this Reservoir Roads.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.920]   It's called the Glover Archibald Park.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.600]   Over by Reservoir Road, there was a table that was shaded and I would wander over there
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.920]   and do some work just because it was different.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:19.960]   I was on campus.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.480]   I wanted to be out of my, wanted to be out of just my regular office.
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.920]   So there's examples of this, right?
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:31.000]   So we can do adventure work without having to have a unusually adventurous locale that
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.520]   we have to travel great distances to go there.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.040]   So how do we make adventure work actually work?
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.480]   A couple tactics.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.560]   One, you want to have a clear singular objective of what you're trying to accomplish in the
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.800]   section.
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.140]   To wander someplace beautiful and then just answer emails on your phone sort of defeats
[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.280]   the purpose.
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.440]   But also you don't want to just take it as I'm just going for a walk to clear my head.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.120]   That's fine, but that's not adventure work.
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.600]   Adventure work, you're like, I'm working on this proof.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.600]   I'm working on this memo.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.960]   I'm trying to figure out this business strategy.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.960]   What's not working?
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:00.960]   What should we do instead?
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.200]   I'm trying to figure out how we change the objectives for the upcoming quarter.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.920]   I'm stuck on this programming challenge.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.920]   How do I more efficiently get this part of the program to work?
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.920]   Whatever it is, you have a clear objective that you're working on.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.620]   Have a way of ending your session with an artifact of this cognition.
[00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:17.960]   Do not just keep it in your head.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:23.320]   You want to be writing down in the notebook or dictating even into a audio notes app on
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.360]   your phone, or you can bring a laptop with you.
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.960]   You need to capture your thinking as part of this.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.920]   You're thinking and you're capturing.
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.520]   You want to come away with an artifact of your cognition.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.980]   You also want an iterative process here.
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.680]   I used to like the move through the scenic location and think, then sit down somewhere
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:45.440]   and write, then move to the scenic location and think some more, then sit down again and
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.440]   write.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.280]   I particularly like trails at parks that have benches because you can kind of walk to the
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.180]   next bench and sit down and take your notes on what you just thought about, get up and
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:54.660]   move to the next one.
[00:12:54.660 --> 00:13:00.960]   This is a fantastic exercise in extracting cogent thoughts from your brain.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:05.920]   You're going to do much better with this than if you just sit still in an office.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:11.400]   If possible, do your adventure work as the final thing in your day.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.120]   Get the small stuff done, clean your inbox, maybe even do a shutdown routine before you
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:20.000]   do the adventure work so you don't have the small hanging over your head.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.080]   Sometimes I have vivid memories of this, of where I was waiting for some sort of information
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.600]   that was timely.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:31.720]   So I would have to check my email throughout an adventure work session on my phone and
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:36.880]   it really would really degrade the quality of those sessions.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.320]   Interestingly, around the time one of those pictures was taken is when I was waiting to
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.920]   hear back on tenure, whether or not I got tenure.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.760]   And I just wanted to check because it comes in like a letter in your email and I remember
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:52.520]   that period thinking, man, the quality of my work is going down because my mind can't
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.400]   just stay focused on my single clear objective.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.100]   I keep seeing all these other emails and it would take me out of it.
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:02.520]   So you want to really not have other things on your mind if possible while doing adventure
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:03.520]   work.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.520]   All right.
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:09.280]   So why does this work other than it just looks cool and you can take cool pictures?
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.240]   There's a few things that goes on when you work in interesting locations.
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.360]   One, the lack of familiar cues helps your focus.
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:20.680]   You aren't seeing cues that you're used to that have associations with other distracting
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.920]   thoughts unrelated to what it is that you're actually trying to work on.
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:28.180]   When you're in the woods, it's much more easy to stay focused on just this one problem.
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:32.400]   When you're in your home office or you're at your office at work, many other unrelated
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.320]   things are going to more easily intrude.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:40.600]   Location novelty can spark more creative insights.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:45.160]   When you're in a location that's visually novel, your brain, for whatever reason, I
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.280]   can't tell you the neuroscience here, but it's just true, is more open to original or
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.520]   interesting thoughts.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:55.740]   The breakthrough that eluded you when you sat there on the Zoom meeting in your office
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:01.880]   might come much more quickly when you're looking at the awe-inspiring waterfall.
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:06.160]   The work itself becomes more interesting.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.680]   Just the process of working is more interesting because you're somewhere interesting.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.640]   It's less draining, and it's more sustainable.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:17.920]   It's more enjoyable to be working someplace interesting on one thing than it is just to
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:22.280]   be in your same old office, so your work itself becomes less draining and more sustainable.
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.080]   Finally, it gives you a nice separation.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:30.000]   When you're thinking about work, it gives you a nice separation between what I'm doing
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.420]   in my office at my big monitor where I'm wrangling with emails and to-dos and going back and
[00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:40.360]   forth to Google Docs versus, oh, when I'm in cool locations and I'm thinking deeply
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.520]   about big, important things relevant to the jobs.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:47.040]   You've separated those two things, physically and psychologically.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.760]   I think that's really important.
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:54.120]   The more that all the different aspects that goes in the modern knowledge work jumble together,
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:58.720]   the more modern knowledge works becomes this sort of jumbled mass of generic activity that
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.360]   itself is philosophically drainy.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.120]   I like this idea of having more of a clear separation between the different types of
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.600]   things you do.
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:11.760]   In general, I'm going to say adventure studying is something that makes a lot of sense if,
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:16.640]   like we are in the show and I am in my work, you are worried about the impact of the technological
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.920]   on the rest of your life.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.520]   The way in which the technological, especially in the world of knowledge work, attempts to
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:27.080]   transmute you into an information processor, into a network router, into something that's
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:32.000]   just bombarded by information that you rocket through your exhausted circuits and then generate
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.400]   bits that go out the other end, the dehumanizing push towards digital freneticism.
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.320]   This is a bulwark against that.
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:46.600]   It is giving primacy to analog cognition in analog environments.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.840]   It's sort of not anti-technology but un-technological.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:56.000]   I think it's really important in an increasingly technological knowledge work setting to have
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   this defiantly un-technological engagement with ideas to resist becoming that sort of
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.520]   in-box cyborg.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:04.520]   So it fits, right?
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.760]   I mean, the adventure work fits right into our central program here of understanding
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:13.400]   technology and the way it affects us and what we should do about it, a way to maintain and
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:18.480]   promote your humanity in a world of increasing digital dehumanization.
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:26.200]   So there's a sort of techno-response core in there to adventure working as well.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.480]   Now here's the thing.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:32.480]   Once you're studying, I know this from experience, in the moment is scary because it feels like
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.180]   you're slowing down too much.
[00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:35.360]   This is slow.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.840]   I'm driving 20 minutes to go to this park.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:43.160]   I'm only working on this one thought and I only got a few notes out of the two hours
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.160]   I spent at the park.
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:49.640]   I could have spent that whole time sending and replying to email messages.
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.680]   I could have had like three Zoom calls and a bunch of slacks and moved a lot of information
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.680]   around.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.680]   This is so slow.
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.680]   Oh my God, how long can I get away with this?
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:01.120]   So here's the thing about adventure work and this is a core idea from my book, Slow Productivity.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:07.580]   So obviously read that book, calnewport.com/slow if you want to have like a more wider discussion
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:08.580]   of this.
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.340]   It's a key idea from that book.
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:14.600]   Give this some time and the slowness begins to reap rewards.
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:18.160]   It's worrisome in the moment, but over time you're saying, man, I'm really shipping.
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:22.080]   I mean, it would always feel slow to me when I would go off to a park and lose a half day
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.080]   to it.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:27.600]   So if I did that for a semester, I would say I wrote some killer papers that semester because
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:32.320]   the core ideas, the high value cognitive output that was at the core of those peer review
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:36.880]   papers was generated over these sessions of going to this interesting place and giving
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:40.520]   the ideas the time required to actually unfold.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.660]   So I'm telling you it feels slow in the moment, but over time, you're going to wonder how
[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:49.320]   you ever accomplished anything big without these more analog movements.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:53.160]   So yeah, it's slow, but it's slow in a good way.
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.320]   This is sort of, this is the heart of the paradox of slow productivity.
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:02.080]   Sometimes you have to slow down to actually produce more of what actually matters.
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.600]   So there we go.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.280]   I did some good adventure work, Jesse, when I was in London on my trip recently, when
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:13.040]   I had some downtime, there's no shortage of really cool places to walk to that are historical
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.360]   and you could really, you know, think interestingly.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.280]   I spent some good time at St. James park.
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:21.320]   It turned out to be, that was like, I found that to be a really useful place for getting
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:26.080]   some thoughts out, spent some time sort of along the river there, got some really good
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.240]   thoughts done there as well.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:31.640]   Victoria Embankment, I was doing some reading there, but there was some sort of plant that
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.920]   like just pollen attacked my head.
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:34.920]   Really?
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:35.920]   So I had to leave there.
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:40.040]   I don't know what was, what was, uh, uh, blooming there, but it was pretty bad.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:44.280]   But anyways, I, I, this was on my mind because in that trip there was a lot of novel, interesting,
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:48.640]   aesthetically interesting locations and I really leveraged that to try to shake loose
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.720]   some interesting thoughts.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.360]   So sometimes you'll adventure work and other times you'll venture read, I guess.
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.360]   Yeah.
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:57.120]   And if the reading is relevant to my work, then I kind of see it as similar things.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:59.120]   Yeah.
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.120]   But anyways, uh, we should do more of it.
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.120]   We make our work too boring.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.120]   Uh, why?
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.720]   Might as well make it more interesting.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:09.800]   When you're in your normal routine at home, do you plan that out like your weekly plan?
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:13.280]   Yeah, but I haven't been doing enough of it recently, so this is partially a pep talk
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.280]   to myself.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.680]   I missed how frequently I was doing this, right?
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.120]   Because I used to do this all the time.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.280]   Um, and now, you know, I don't have a cool home office.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:27.360]   I have the HQ, I have the coffee, like I, I don't find as much need to like, I have
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.080]   to go find a place to work.
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:33.840]   So I'm trying to re-engineer and do more of this this summer, um, re-engineer explicitly
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.200]   on my weekly plan this half day, go to this park this half day.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.280]   I want to go back to my, my, my haunts.
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.320]   There's a bunch of places I like.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:46.720]   All right, for people who are in this Northern DC, Southern Montgomery County area, Wheaton
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:51.760]   Regional Park, I did a lot of work, uh, all up and down Sligo Creek Park, which is right
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.760]   near where I live.
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.000]   Um, did a lot of interesting work.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.840]   There's a federal wildlife refuge at Patuxet, so you have to go around the beltway.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.160]   It's a bit of a hike, but not a crazy hike for me.
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:08.360]   Um, it's a huge sort of federal wildlife refuge, like right on the beltway.
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.360]   It's really cool.
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.400]   You don't really get lost in there and off season, it's completely empty.
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.200]   Uh, that's a place I like to do adventure work.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:21.060]   And then the mall in DC, various, uh, museums down there, I would go and work in various
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:22.240]   places and wander the halls.
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.240]   I used to do all of that.
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.520]   So I want to do more of that again.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.720]   Um, I'm going to make a point of doing that.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.480]   I'm not teaching this fall.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.060]   So I think I'm going to work it regularly in my schedule, at least one day a week where
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:38.000]   there's a four, four hour expedition and I can choose where I want to go, but it's got
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.200]   to be somewhere novel just to do this type of work, because I think I'm, I'm happier
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.440]   when I do it.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.960]   And when I fall out of the routine, I'm less happier.
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.960]   I also just think I produce better stuff.
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.960]   So that's what we should do.
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:48.960]   All right.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:49.960]   So we've got some good questions.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.920]   Um, we found a bunch of questions that were vaguely about maybe not specifically adventure
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.940]   works as that's very specific, but rituals in general, like things, rituals or habits
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:58.940]   people do.
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:04.860]   Um, but before we get there, let's hear briefly from one of our sponsors, I want to talk in
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:09.480]   particular about our friends at element L M N T.
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.240]   Now I talk about the element drink mix.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.960]   I've been talking about that for years.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.880]   We have a whole box full of this in our kitchen.
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.200]   Um, I use it every day.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:23.480]   It's a no sugar, no dodgy ingredients drink mix that gives you all of that sort of salty
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:28.600]   electrolytes you need, especially after you've been exercising in the DC heat and sweating
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:33.920]   or like me having a long day of giving lectures and appearances where I lose a lot of, uh,
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.040]   salt to get the hydrated.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:40.040]   I always element in my ice waters, what I do, but they have a new offering, which I'm
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:43.560]   excited about element sparkling.
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:48.160]   It's the same zero sugar electrolyte formulation you already know and trust from those mixes,
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:55.440]   but now in a bold 16 ounce can of sparkling water, no sugar, no caffeine, all the electrolytes
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:01.000]   you need, but, uh, comes already in that can and grab it from the fridge and just get that
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.200]   hydration right away.
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:08.320]   You can take a sip with your element sparkling against sugar and stimulant loaded drinks
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.240]   and turn your head tight back towards health.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.800]   So I'm excited about element sparkling.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:17.920]   Um, the good news is this is beginning to become available.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:22.360]   Um, right now it's available to those who are element insiders.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:27.040]   If you want to find out if you're an element insider, not go to drink element.com, uh,
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:29.040]   and it'll soon be more widely available.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:34.760]   Um, so look, you can get your free sample pack with any drink mix purchase that you
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:42.160]   make at drink element.com/deep that's drink L M N T.com/deep.
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:46.740]   And if you're on the element insider, or if you're an element insider, you will also get
[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:52.440]   first access to element sparkling, a bold 16 ounce can of sparkling electrolyte water.
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:56.840]   So find out about the drink mix, uh, get your free sample pack.
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:01.560]   Perhaps if you're an insider, uh, get your early access to element sparkling all at drink
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:02.560]   element.com/deep.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:10.200]   I also want to talk about our friends at Shopify.
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:16.040]   Whether you're selling a little or a lot, Shopify helps you do your thing.
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:20.600]   However, you cha-ching, Shopify is what you should be using.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:28.960]   If you are trying to sell things regardless of the size or nature of your business, uh,
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.440]   they have point of service tools.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:35.420]   If you have a physical store, they have the best e-commerce tools on the internet.
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:40.960]   In my opinion, uh, it works whether you've just launched your online shop or have your
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:45.560]   first real life store, or on the other side, you've just hit your millionth order of your,
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:48.040]   your massive, uh, concern.
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:50.640]   Shopify is what you need.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:55.120]   A huge amount of online shopping goes through Shopify.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:25:02.200]   I have a number here, 10% of all e-commerce in the U S goes through Shopify.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.760]   It's also the global force behind big brands like Allbirds, Rothy's, and Brooklinens and
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:10.400]   millions of entrepreneurs over 175 different countries, right?
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.600]   So it's just what you do.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.240]   But when Jesse and I opened our long awaited online store, I mean, all we're missing is
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:20.280]   knowing what we're going to sell detail, but once we figure it out, what it is we are going
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:24.800]   to sell, uh, how we're going to sell it as a no brainer, it's going to be Shopify.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:28.280]   Shopify, uh, it's going to build us a fan, you know, fantastic store.
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:32.520]   Everyone I know who sells things online, um, who I've asked about this seems to use Shopify.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.040]   So that's what you should have in mind.
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:37.800]   If you're trying to sell basically anything to anybody.
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:44.320]   So you can sign up for a $1 per month trial period@shopify.com/deep, but make sure you
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:51.360]   write that all lowercase, go to shopify.com/deep now to grow your business no matter what stage
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.360]   you're in.
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.360]   That's shopify.com/deep.
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:26:00.320]   All right, Jesse, let's get to our questions.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:04.840]   First questions from Tyler, what are the health habits and rituals you have installed?
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:08.720]   I've heard bits and pieces through the shows, but it'd be good to hear about your full list
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.840]   of habits in your constitution bucket.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:16.640]   Uh, it's a good question, Tyler, that changes over time, you know, especially as I get older.
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:21.400]   Um, I mean, I would say the, the big change the last couple of years versus the type of
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:27.720]   habits I talked about before is, um, I exercise longer and more frequently.
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:34.440]   I mean, I, I basically probably five or six days a week have a good 40 minute plus exercise
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.440]   session.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:40.200]   Um, weights are like heavyweights exercise section, just a lot more time than I used
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:44.480]   to spend just because, you know, I'm not the young spring chicken I, I used to be.
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:48.960]   So I exercise, um, almost every day for 40 plus minutes.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:54.880]   I like to do this right before dinner as a sort of transition from, uh, work is done
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:58.160]   and then we're going to like make dinner and do that sort of, and have the evening.
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.760]   And this is like a nice transition between those two things.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.320]   Um, and so that's when I, that's when I tend to do it.
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.200]   I walk a lot because of adventure work is just part of my cognitive process.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:11.720]   I walk to think, so I try to walk quite a bit and then I try to make any, what I call
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.720]   automatic eating healthy.
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:19.440]   So I'm busy and scheduled during the day, I don't think a lot or care a lot about breakfast
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.440]   or lunch.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.440]   I just need the food to get rolling.
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:26.480]   So I try to make that sort of just by default, automatically healthy, uh, that works as well.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:30.720]   Um, and I drink a lot of coffee, so it prevents me from eating too much during the day.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.400]   I suppose I drink a ton of coffee.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:37.880]   Um, so that's where I am, I don't know, used to in more time than I do or not really.
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:38.880]   Right.
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:39.880]   What would you say?
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:44.120]   Like your major thing right now is you're at the CrossFit box pretty frequently, right?
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:47.600]   Yeah, no, I, I, I work out a decent amount.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.320]   I changed a few habits cause I had a physical recently and my blood pressure was a little
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:52.320]   bit higher.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.760]   So then I started getting more sleep after that and a little bit, cause some days like
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:00.280]   if I'd work late at night, I would still get up early, but now I might adjust that and
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.280]   sleep.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.480]   So sleep can impact blood pressure.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.480]   And then he like told me to get a thing.
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.480]   So then I just tracked it.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:10.440]   And sometimes if I sleep longer, like if I sleep too little, then it gets higher.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.640]   Oh, so you noticed it.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.640]   Oh, interesting.
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.640]   Okay.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:18.400]   So I factored in more sleep and then, but in general I work out quite a bit.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:24.560]   How long does, uh, in CrossFit, how long on average is a workout of the day take to complete?
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:29.560]   Um, if you do the accessory stuff, probably like 70 minutes, but a lot of people walk
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:31.400]   out after 60 minutes.
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.400]   Okay.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.400]   So serious.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.400]   Okay.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.760]   I mean, basically I feel like as we get older, we have to exercise more just to get the same
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:42.000]   benefits of like a little bit of exercise when we're younger.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   I don't know.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   It helps.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   It really helps my energy.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.200]   And then, you know, stretching and stuff too is important for me.
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:54.600]   So basically like, uh, more time than I would like to spend doing this stuff.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.600]   All right.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.600]   What do we got next?
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.120]   Next question is from Jamie.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:02.380]   How can I distinguish between disciplines and rituals as part of the deep life stack?
[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:05.760]   For example, I meditate daily, even when it's hard or I don't feel like it.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:09.280]   So this feels like a discipline, but from a contemplation standpoint, it feels like
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.280]   a ritual.
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.280]   Is there a distinction?
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:14.920]   Well, all right, we're getting into the weeds a little bit here, Jamie.
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:20.080]   And one of the things I'm noticing as I work on my book on the deep life is that, uh, I'm
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.720]   trying to trim these weeds a little bit.
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.160]   Like I don't want to get too far into the weeds.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:29.720]   I'd love, I want to be technical because again, we underappreciate the technical aspect of
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.320]   crafting a deep life.
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:35.280]   We focus too much on just like the, what is going to be in the life, but we don't want
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.280]   to get too technical.
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:40.460]   So like what's going on here is there's two different things we've talked about before.
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:45.000]   There is daily disciplines and there's rituals and they seem similar and they are, but they're
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.720]   not exactly the same.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:47.720]   Daily disciplines.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:51.720]   It was a very specific thing you would do to help transform your self perception as
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:56.160]   someone who could take non-obligatory action towards things that are important to you.
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:00.480]   So it's something you do every day and each of the main areas of your life, something
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.700]   that's non-trivial, but still tractable.
[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.880]   And that's more about just changing your identity, right?
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.520]   If I have something I do every day for my health, if I have something I do every day
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:12.760]   for community, something I do every day for like my soul, something I do every day for
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:16.840]   my, my moving my career in an interesting direction, I tell myself I'm someone who can
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.840]   shape my life.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.840]   That's what daily disciplines were.
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:23.840]   Rituals came up when we were talking about really making sure you had a foundation of
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:30.140]   values and they were again, disciplines and habits, but the goal of them in this case
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:33.680]   was to help reinforce like things you think are valuable, right?
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:40.920]   So my value system, a ritual is something that would help underscore parts of that value
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:41.920]   system.
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.960]   If you're religious, it could be prayer, for example.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:50.080]   These are just both examples of sort of disciplined behavior writ large, right?
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:53.680]   So I don't think we have to get too much in the weeds of these different types of disciplined
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.520]   behaviors because, uh, you know, if that's helpful, it's helpful.
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:31:01.240]   It might not be, but the bigger point here, and this is one of the big ideas that I'm,
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:06.560]   I'm developing for, I'm thinking about developing for the book is, uh, comfort with disciplined
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:11.240]   activity is like a prerequisite if you're going to transform your life.
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.240]   And yet we often skip that.
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:16.520]   I mean, so much of what our thinking about how to take control of your life, whether
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:21.160]   we call it a deep life or not, so much of this thinking ignores all of the preparations
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:25.600]   that go into making you someone who is going to be able to actually take the reins of life
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.080]   and direct it somewhere.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:30.840]   We just jump right ahead to what it directed towards.
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:34.500]   We've seen these books and they're important, but we've seen the same book a bunch of time.
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:35.500]   Community is important.
[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:36.600]   Your health is important.
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.920]   Your work is important.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.440]   Your connection to this is in gratitude.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:44.480]   It's like the stuff that's important that you do.
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:48.720]   But how do you become someone who can take these things that are important and actually
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:52.040]   inflate them in your life and take the obstacles to these things that are important and reduce
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.040]   those obstacles?
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:57.360]   Well, it's probably going to require quite a bit of disciplined action, things you do,
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:00.840]   even though you don't want to, or don't aren't obligated to do it, but you do it for a long
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.640]   term benefit.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.800]   And so like in general, getting comfortable with disciplined action, I think is a big
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.160]   part of preparing for, for cultivating your life.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:14.400]   So daily disciplines, value rituals, all of these are all in that same general category
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:21.120]   of things you do to help rewire your sense of identity, to be someone who is disciplined.
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.160]   And from that comes really cool, deep things.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:26.280]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:30.520]   Next question's from Max, I always look forward to your review of five books you read each
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:31.520]   month.
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.520]   I find it very impressive.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:35.640]   Do you have rituals before you read or do you just read at free times?
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:39.320]   So do you have a lot of like 10 minute reading sessions or are they usually 30 minutes or
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.320]   longer?
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:45.800]   10 minutes is, 10 minutes is not super long.
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.340]   Usually like 20 to 40 minutes would be more regular.
[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:52.800]   But I have to say Max, I don't think, five books I don't think is a lot.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.760]   Like I don't have to do a lot special to read five books.
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:00.320]   I think if I wanted to read 10 books a month, I would need a lot of much more careful scheduling
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.560]   and ritual around it.
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:04.320]   Like to really make sure I had a lot of time.
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:08.960]   I get the five books a month basically by making reading a default habit, something
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.000]   I like to do when I have free time.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   And it sort of gets there.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.520]   I sort of get there, right?
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.520]   It's like, "Oh, I got some free time.
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.520]   I want to read."
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:17.520]   I think it was like a good thing.
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.160]   Like, "Oh, this thing got canceled tonight.
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.560]   We're going to have some free time.
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.160]   I'm going to go read for a little bit."
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:23.160]   Right?
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:28.040]   It's something I don't have to force myself, "Hey, make sure we put aside time for reading."
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:31.080]   I get excited when I find time for reading.
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:35.600]   I mean, the only regular reading time in my schedule that's, I know for sure this is when
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:39.160]   I'm always going to read is in bed.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.360]   Everything else, it's sort of opportunistic.
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.360]   "Oh, I want to read."
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:46.800]   Like this morning, I was up a little early because I'm still on London time or I'm halfway
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:47.800]   transitioned.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.920]   And there's this book on AI theory I'm reading.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:55.440]   I just read a chapter of it because whatever, I had a little bit of free time.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.320]   I was just talking to my wife earlier today, I was like, "Oh, we kind of have some time
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.920]   free because my son's baseball practice got canceled.
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.440]   We should sit outside and read a little bit tonight.
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.760]   It's going to be good weather for it.
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:05.760]   We like sitting outside."
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.600]   So that just adds up.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:14.480]   The only thing I couple that with, which really helps is a completionist attitude.
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:19.200]   You cultivate this idea of, "I'm getting kind of close to finishing this book."
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:21.760]   You're like, "Oh, now I want to finish it."
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:27.080]   And you get really, "I'm going to put aside time and pretty aggressively close out this
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.080]   book."
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:32.320]   So what my reading life becomes like is a lot of just serendipitous reading here, there,
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.800]   I'm working on a lot of books at a time.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.960]   And then when I realize at some point, "Oh, I'm kind of close to finishing this book,"
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.480]   then I'll get aggressive for a day or two.
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:42.360]   And I really want to finish this and put a few hours into it and push it.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:46.640]   Those two things, those two mindsets approaches together makes five books a month, I don't
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:47.640]   even think about it.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:52.160]   Now, again, I think seven to 10 books a month, I'd have to start thinking about it.
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:55.400]   Five books is right on that boundary of, it doesn't matter much.
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:59.840]   So if you want to read more, probably the most important thing you can do is make reading
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.520]   more appealing to you.
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:06.400]   Choose stuff that you are really excited to read.
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:10.640]   What that is will broaden over time, doesn't matter at first.
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:13.440]   What matters at first is like, "I'm excited about this book.
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.840]   This book is inspiring me.
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:16.880]   I like this type of genre book.
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.440]   This book is really fun."
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:23.000]   Don't care what it is, but make it something you're really excited to read and sort of
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.640]   wire yourself to think about reading as something that you really look forward to doing.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:32.120]   All right, let's keep rolling.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.120]   Yep.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:36.520]   Next question's from Allie and she's talking about your non-teaching days, which you've
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.160]   talked a lot about in the show.
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:42.480]   So on those days when you write and work on other projects, do you have separate rituals
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:43.480]   for each?
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:47.600]   Do you do the same writing ritual each day when you write?
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:52.760]   I have a, I don't know, a category of writing rituals.
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:55.800]   A collection of writing rituals and I sort of pick and choose from it.
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:00.120]   Some things that are pretty common is when I'm writing, I like to write for the most
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.700]   part and there's one exception, which I'll talk about in a second, but I like to try
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.600]   to write first thing.
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:08.680]   In particular, no email or other types of admin distractions before.
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:11.440]   That makes the writing go a lot better.
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:13.720]   I almost always start my writing with a walk.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.120]   That's how I get my mind going best.
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:18.680]   I like to think while I move about what I'm going to write.
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:21.200]   Usually this will just be through my neighborhood.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:26.240]   I often will then break, not always, but we'll often break the seal on my writing in a novel
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.240]   location.
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:31.160]   So like I'll go for a walk and then maybe get breakfast at the coffee shop and start
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:35.680]   my writing there just because it's a different location before I come back to, let's say
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:41.600]   my desk at my home office or here at the Deep Work HQ.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:45.520]   The exception to this is I sometimes add afternoon, early evening writing sessions.
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:50.080]   Like if I'm trying to close out a New Yorker article or finish a chapter of a book, I just
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.200]   need that extra time.
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:57.760]   The hard part for me is getting my energy and attention back into that writing mode
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:58.760]   in the afternoon or evening.
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:01.160]   So there I will almost always go to a different location.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:06.960]   I'll either come here or a real favorite of mine is like late afternoon, go to the coffee
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:13.960]   shop and get a beer or something and sit there and work.
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:14.960]   It's different.
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:20.400]   It has to be different because I can't at 4.30 or 5 just go back to my desk at home
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.080]   because I've already done a lot of administrative work there.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.080]   Other stuff's going on.
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.080]   It's hard for me to get it back.
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:26.640]   So I'll create special writing sessions.
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:29.840]   And sometimes I'll do like Sunday morning special writing sessions early where I'll
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:33.760]   go get like the right cup of coffee and I'll come over here.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:38.640]   But changing up the location for those special sessions helps.
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.640]   Helps me.
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:40.640]   I'm like, oh, this will be fun.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:41.640]   I'd like to go to the coffee shop.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:42.640]   This will be interesting.
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.720]   And I get that motivation to get going again.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:48.800]   When I travel, so we typically spend about a month each summer sort of getting out of
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:52.960]   Dodge, leaving DC, going into nature, usually going up to New England.
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.800]   And I usually do a lot of writing there.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.200]   There I build my own habits.
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:00.960]   So like we're going up to upstate New York this summer and the property we're renting
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:06.020]   has trails at 75 acres and it has its own trails and a little writing shack.
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:09.600]   So I'm going to invent a really cool writing ritual up there that's going to involve hiking
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.640]   through these trails and then going to the writing shack.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:15.600]   And I'll probably do this all real early in the morning before my kids are up and rolling.
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:20.520]   So I write really cool rituals, create really cool rituals when I'm in unusual places as
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.720]   well.
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:26.080]   So it's not one ritual I do the same way, but I, I have a ton of rituals surrounding
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:31.040]   writing because it's not easy coaxing ideas from one's head.
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.160]   And so I have a lot of things I surround it with.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:36.160]   So with the non-teaching days, if you write in the morning and then say you have something
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.240]   else to do later that day, they just do it later.
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:44.640]   So what's the ritual before that, like different, then it doesn't matter if it's non deep stuff.
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:45.640]   I don't care as much.
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:46.640]   Yeah.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:47.640]   I just really, I get the work done.
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:49.480]   Um, do a shutdown routine when I'm done.
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.480]   So I don't ritualize.
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.800]   I ritualize the hard cognitive stuff, but not the other types of work.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:57.240]   And most of the days on the non-teaching days is just one hard cognitive thing.
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.240]   I try to just work on one.
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.920]   I mean, sometimes I'll do the afternoon session if I have an unrelated thing.
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:06.640]   It's like if I'm writing like a newsletter essay, those are often happening in afternoon
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:11.880]   sessions because I'm using the morning session for academic paper, like a book chapter, and
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:14.120]   I can write a newsletter essay in an hour.
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.600]   So I'm like, okay, a lot, that's a lot of the ways I get that done.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.920]   I'm going to go over to the coffee shop this afternoon to close out my day.
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.880]   And that's what I'm going to write my newsletter essay.
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:22.880]   Yeah.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:23.880]   All right.
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:27.480]   What do we got next?
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.360]   Next question is our corner.
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.760]   Slow productivity corner.
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:31.760]   Yep.
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:32.760]   Fantastic.
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.080]   So I'll play the music now.
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.080]   Let's get the music.
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:44.600]   Before you read that question for people who don't know, who are new to the show, we have
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:50.400]   one question per episode that is related to my book, Slow Productivity, and we call it
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:51.880]   the Slow Productivity Corner.
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.120]   It's our excuse to play that music.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:57.560]   All right, Jesse, what's our slow productivity question of the week?
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:58.640]   It's from Carmen.
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:01.920]   I have a question about slow productivity and job hunting.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:05.920]   Should I follow my own pace and develop stellar skills that will lead to a great job?
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:10.920]   Or should I respond to job postings from my firms, which means rushing to get good enough,
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:14.760]   and then send my application within one week of the job posting?
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:18.580]   Well, Carmen, you refer to this as a slow productivity question.
[00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:22.560]   It's also really a deep life question as well.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:30.360]   My main concern here is these activities that you're discussing seem ungrounded, but you're
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.220]   talking about jobs abstractly.
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:34.920]   Like I want a great job.
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:36.200]   This is a great company.
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:39.920]   Should I apply to this great company because they have a job listing?
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:44.480]   I don't want you thinking about jobs and the greatness of the job or the company so abstractly.
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:49.000]   I want you thinking about your ideal lifestyle.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.480]   What is the day-to-day of your ideal lifestyle?
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:52.720]   What type of place do you live?
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:53.840]   What's the rhythm of your day?
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:54.920]   What's the nature of your work?
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:56.940]   Not the specifics, but the general nature of your work.
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:58.140]   How are you spending your time?
[00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:59.140]   What does it look like?
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:00.400]   What does it smell like?
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.160]   Who's around you?
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:05.600]   What is that rhythm when someone makes a TV show about your day?
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:06.600]   Where is it set?
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.920]   And what are the recurring sets and scenes?
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:13.520]   You really want to build up this image of what a really meaningful lifestyle would look
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:14.640]   like for you.
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:18.240]   And then you can figure out the role of your work in this vision.
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:21.680]   So now when you're thinking about jobs, you're thinking not just, is this a great job or
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:22.680]   a non-great job?
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.740]   Is this a stellar company or not a stellar company?
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:28.760]   You're thinking, what are my obstacles and opportunities for getting closer to my ideal
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:31.520]   lifestyle, right?
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:36.360]   And OK, now if you're doing this type of thinking, you might say, OK, I have this major obstacle
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.160]   to my ideal lifestyle.
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:42.080]   And my current job is a big intractable source of this obstacle.
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:45.800]   But if I could get a job that had this feature instead of that, it's going to unlock these
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:49.080]   three or four things, which really helps me move much closer to what I'm looking for in
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.080]   my lifestyle.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:53.180]   And now when I see a job that allows me to do those things, that's why I'm going after
[00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:54.280]   those jobs.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:56.920]   That's how you should be thinking about this.
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:58.600]   Not that company is better than this company.
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.520]   Maybe I should change.
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:05.320]   Because your job alone is not going to make your life better or worse.
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:09.280]   What's going to make the character of your life depends on the day-to-day realities of
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:13.240]   your life, your lifestyle, the day-to-day realities of your lifestyle.
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:15.200]   That's what you should be working directly towards.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:20.320]   OK, so then once you have that in mind, yeah, this could be a slow process here.
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.940]   This is sort of a slowly productive process.
[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:25.920]   You're building up skills to open up opportunities.
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:29.900]   When you know what you're looking for and you're building up your value, interesting
[00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:32.040]   opportunities have a way of arising.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:33.580]   But it does take some patience.
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:35.180]   You can't force it.
[00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:40.800]   You can't say, you know, here's the problem with what I'm currently doing is really gives
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.960]   me these obstacles to what I'm looking for.
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.840]   Hair's going crazy today, Jesse.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:52.840]   For those who are listening instead of watching, hair's falling in my eyes a lot.
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:58.040]   But instead of saying, right, so when you know what you're looking for and you're systematically
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:00.520]   trying to move towards this, opportunities arise.
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.720]   And it's not so random and abstract like, oh, this is a better company.
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.420]   It's like, ooh, you know it when you see it.
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:10.320]   This is going to make such a difference because it's going to get me out of this type of work
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:13.600]   and towards this type of work, and the location here is going to be much better, which allows
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:19.200]   us to make the plan of moving here but doing this work, but doing it on this schedule instead,
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.200]   and we can afford.
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:21.440]   And all these pieces come together, right?
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:24.100]   So when you're being systematic, what I'm saying here is when you're working backwards
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:27.920]   from your ideal lifestyle, you know what you want, you know what the obstacles are, you
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:31.640]   know what your opportunities, and you're working systematically to open up more options for
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:37.400]   moving towards it, really cool bespoke opportunities will arise, and your life will become deeper
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:39.160]   and become better.
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:41.080]   But it could be a process that requires patience.
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:43.580]   It's not something you can just force overnight.
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:47.420]   How can I transform my life tomorrow by changing my job in some dramatic way?
[00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:52.740]   So there is certainly a slow aspect to this, but it's an informed slowness.
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:55.340]   You need to know what you're slowly working towards.
[00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:57.400]   You need to know what you're looking for.
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:01.580]   You need to be slowly setting yourself up to have more and more opportunities, more
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:06.260]   swings so that you're much more likely to find an actual sort of connection at some
[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.180]   point with that proverbial ball.
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:13.540]   So there's kind of a mix here between slow productivity and the idea surrounding the
[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:14.540]   deep life.
[00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:25.320]   All right, let's get some more, let's get that music one more time.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:26.320]   All right.
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:28.580]   Well, you know, let's have some, we do a lot of written questions, but we're trying to
[00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:30.080]   do more calls on the show.
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:33.140]   So Jesse, let's, let's listen to one of these calls that we have queued up.
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:34.140]   Yep.
[00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:41.720]   Hi Gal, I recently read and I love your book, Slow Productivity.
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:45.180]   My wife's been a teacher for about 10 years now.
[00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:50.460]   I wanted to get your thoughts on teaching as it relates to the principle, work at a
[00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:57.140]   natural pace, something that goes beyond the summer break that they get.
[00:44:57.140 --> 00:44:59.560]   All right.
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:00.560]   Good question.
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:01.560]   Right.
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:02.560]   Okay.
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:08.500]   So, so what he's referring to here in this question about working at a natural pace,
[00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:14.740]   that principle in the book, Slow Productivity, one of the ideas under that principle was
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:16.460]   seasonality.
[00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:20.700]   So having variation of intensity over time, don't just work all out all day, all week
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:22.260]   long, all year long.
[00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:25.900]   So as he mentioned, the caller mentioned, teachers have some very natural seasonality
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:28.180]   in that summer is very different than the rest of the school year.
[00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:30.740]   And you really want to lean into that seasonality as a teacher.
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:35.900]   So it's a fantastic benefit of that type of job that more jobs should have something similar.
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:41.220]   So you really want to make the character of your life different in the summer versus the
[00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:42.860]   non-summer.
[00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:49.980]   But to answer the question, you can have variation in intensity at different timescales as well.
[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:56.460]   So for example, you could have variation in intensity at the scale of the week.
[00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:02.120]   Choose one week when you're thinking about how you distribute your work throughout the
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:03.380]   week as a teacher.
[00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:06.900]   Choose one day of that week to be much easier.
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:11.480]   So you kind of have a lighter day compared to some heavier days, right?
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:15.260]   And it might be a day that you work longer another day to have another day that you can
[00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:17.460]   basically have, you can leave right after school ends.
[00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:24.180]   Like Friday I'm making really easy, but I work longer on like Thursday and Monday and
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:25.180]   the kind of catch up on things.
[00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:29.300]   But like Friday is a much more relaxing, like I teach when it's over, I like I go home and
[00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:30.540]   start my weekend early.
[00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:35.620]   So variations in intensity at that scale can make a difference.
[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:39.860]   You could also have very, when it comes to working at a natural pace as a teacher, another
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:44.100]   thing you can think about is slowing down the pace at which you work on new ideas.
[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:49.380]   Like you have classroom pedagogical ideas, things you want to do, new units you want
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:51.980]   to develop, better assignments you want to put together.
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:52.980]   All of that is great.
[00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:56.180]   You don't want to stop doing that work, but spread it out more.
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:59.620]   All right, I'm just this marking period I'm just working on.
[00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:01.300]   Here's my one thing.
[00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:02.460]   When I have time, I work on it.
[00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:03.460]   And now this is good.
[00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:04.460]   I improved this thing.
[00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:05.460]   Okay.
[00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:06.460]   This marking period I'm working on this other thing.
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:09.080]   Like you're slowing down, right?
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:10.440]   You're not running around frantically.
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:13.620]   Like I want to do all these things for all the kids, make everything better and burning
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:14.620]   yourself out.
[00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:18.780]   You slow down one thing at a time, take your time working on these things.
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:22.580]   Not only has your work become more sustainable, but when you look back after a few years,
[00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:27.820]   you say, actually, a lot of innovations I've slowly built up in the classroom, the way
[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:31.460]   I teach this, what I do here, the mentoring I've done over here.
[00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:37.140]   And it adds up over time to be potentially much more impactful than if you try to just
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:40.940]   do everything all at once, you burn yourself out after a year or two.
[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:47.620]   So it's sort of like slowing down, trusting the aggregation of quality effort over time
[00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:49.160]   will lead to something really big.
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:51.940]   You don't have to do all that effort all at once.
[00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:58.140]   There's a real energy or pressure in teaching the hustle, hustle, hustle.
[00:47:58.140 --> 00:47:59.140]   Do more, do more.
[00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:00.140]   It's for the kids.
[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:01.140]   Don't you care?
[00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:02.140]   Do more, do more, do more.
[00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:03.380]   But the long game here matters.
[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:08.540]   Like I'm going to do great stuff for these kids, but I got to do it at a natural pace.
[00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:09.820]   Busy periods, less busy periods.
[00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:13.940]   I'm working on cool stuff, but reasonable amounts drawn out over time.
[00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:15.900]   I'm not volunteering for as much.
[00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:21.420]   If I'm taking on a non-curricular project for the school, then that's going to be my
[00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:22.500]   thing this marking period.
[00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:25.060]   I'm going to put everything else on hold.
[00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:31.680]   Just making sure that the proverbial sort of engine heat meter on your work life gets
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:32.680]   out of the red.
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:34.860]   It doesn't go in the red or is rarely in the red.
[00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:37.740]   That's what's going to keep in this metaphor that engine running much longer.
[00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:41.500]   And if it runs for a really long time, this metaphorical boat is going to cover a lot
[00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:45.260]   of distance where if you run it in the red, it goes really fast and then it hits the iceberg
[00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:46.260]   and sinks.
[00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:48.380]   So this is a super drawn out metaphor.
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:52.500]   So I think slow productivity, in some sense, if you're a teacher, it's frustrating because
[00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:55.340]   so much of your life is structured and you have so little control.
[00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:56.820]   But on the other hand, there's a lot of room.
[00:48:56.820 --> 00:49:01.820]   Once you understand the benefits of slowness, you realize there's still a lot of room for
[00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:04.820]   me to inject some of these ideas even into this highly structured job.
[00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:07.660]   And you have to, otherwise you're going to burn out.
[00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:08.740]   And teaching is so important.
[00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:11.540]   I think teaching plus slowness is a fantastic combination.
[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:14.100]   All right, let's do another call.
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:18.860]   Let's do a two call episode, which I'm excited about.
[00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:19.860]   Yep.
[00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:20.940]   Hi, Cal.
[00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:25.420]   It's Lawrence here, originally from the UK, living in Galway in Ireland.
[00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:28.300]   And my question is about projects.
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:33.460]   You talked before in your slow productivity philosophy in your book about the pool system
[00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:36.100]   having just one project at a time.
[00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:41.140]   I don't know whether this is a really silly question, but what about if you put a project
[00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:47.980]   in and that project, you've done everything you can to that project and it doesn't complete
[00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:53.020]   for maybe another week because maybe part of that project is you're delivering something
[00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:54.020]   in a few days.
[00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:57.500]   And then that's like the final piece.
[00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:58.940]   What do you do then in the interim?
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:06.940]   Do you start working on another project, which then, I guess, potentially risks overhead
[00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:12.740]   increase and overwhelm, or do you work on other things like lower impact, admin, stuff
[00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:16.780]   like that until you've actually completed that project?
[00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:21.660]   I'm just conscious that sometimes there's not much you can do until a certain date because
[00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:26.020]   there's something scheduled or maybe you're waiting on something from someone so you can't
[00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:27.020]   move it forward.
[00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:32.300]   How do you think about this and how do you use that time while you're sort of waiting
[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:35.500]   idle for you to be able to resume that project?
[00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:36.500]   Thanks, Cal.
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:37.500]   I love your podcast.
[00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:41.100]   It's amazing and really appreciate everything you do.
[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:42.100]   Great.
[00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:43.100]   That's a good question.
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:44.100]   All right.
[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:48.500]   So for people who haven't read Slow Productivity, what he's talking about is I recommend when
[00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:53.180]   you take the various things you've agreed to work on, instead of just working on all
[00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:59.460]   of them concurrently, you instead divide this list between here's the small number of things
[00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:03.380]   I'm actively working on and here's the things I'm waiting to work on, and you only actively
[00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:05.260]   work on the things that are in that active list.
[00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:08.940]   And as you finish one of these things, you pull something new into the active list from
[00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:11.060]   your big collection of things you're waiting on.
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:15.220]   Now, I've talked about this on the show, but just as a quick reminder, the reason why this
[00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:19.540]   is effective is that things you're actively working on generate administrative overhead,
[00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:21.780]   emails, meetings, et cetera.
[00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:25.460]   So the more things you're actively working on, the more administrative overhead you have
[00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:29.340]   in your life, which clogs your time and schedule and leaves less time and energy to actually
[00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:31.520]   make progress on the stuff you're working on.
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:37.300]   So if you restrict what is active, you limit administrative overhead, and you can actually
[00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:39.500]   make much better, faster progress on these things.
[00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:40.500]   All right.
[00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:45.740]   So the question here is, what if you are stuck on one of these things that you're actively
[00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:46.740]   working on?
[00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:47.740]   What should you do?
[00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:50.420]   Well, I have a couple of things I want to say about this.
[00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:54.860]   First, make sure that the scale of these projects is tractable.
[00:51:54.860 --> 00:52:00.320]   This came up in a couple of interviews, actually, in my recent UK trip, so this is sort of fresh
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:02.580]   on my head here.
[00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:06.020]   You want them to be not too big, not too small, right?
[00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:11.180]   So like if I'm writing a book, I'm not going to have one of my active projects be write
[00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:12.180]   the book.
[00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:14.620]   Way too big, right?
[00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:17.820]   But I could have an active project be write chapter four of the book.
[00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:23.040]   Like, okay, that's something I get my arms around in a relatively continuous application
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:27.860]   effort over less than a month, I could finish this thing, like that might make more sense
[00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:28.860]   as an active project.
[00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:32.820]   So you want the active projects not to be too big, so you have less of these chances
[00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:34.520]   for just like long delays.
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:38.220]   All right, so that's important.
[00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:41.980]   To have more than one, I usually recommend like two or three things you're actively working
[00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:42.980]   on.
[00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:45.220]   So if one thing is getting stuck for a couple of days, shouldn't it be a problem?
[00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:48.860]   I have like a few things I'm working on, that thing I'm waiting to hear back on, but I have
[00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:51.620]   these other things I can work on as well.
[00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:56.700]   I don't think that's a problem if you have a few things to have to wait a few days.
[00:52:56.700 --> 00:53:03.300]   If something gets long-term stuck, like, okay, now I have to wait to hear back from this
[00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:06.300]   other department in my massive organization.
[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:09.720]   And God knows this could be who knows how long until they find this is not a priority
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:10.720]   for them.
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:12.420]   Who knows how long till we hear back?
[00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:13.560]   Could be weeks, right?
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:17.740]   More than a couple of days, let's say as our threshold, then it's fine to just swap out
[00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:20.960]   an active thing and bring in something else, right?
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:22.980]   Just move it off of your active list.
[00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:23.980]   You know what?
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:24.980]   This is stuck.
[00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:25.980]   I'm waiting to hear back.
[00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.740]   I have an active list on the waiting, and I'm moving something else to take its place.
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:30.060]   And that's completely fine as well.
[00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:35.040]   So when you keep this sort of dual mode list active and waiting, you have a very clear
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:36.940]   way of moving things between these statuses.
[00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:39.500]   So like, okay, I was actively working on this.
[00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:43.500]   Now I'm moving it back over the waiting and pulled something else in.
[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:46.060]   And so now I'm not going to generate administrative overhead from this.
[00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:49.100]   If people are bothering me about this thing I've moved back to waiting, I can say, you
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:50.100]   know what?
[00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:54.140]   I've had to temporarily put this back on my back burner because I'm waiting for approval
[00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:56.980]   from the Department of Mysteries and it could take a month.
[00:53:56.980 --> 00:54:02.460]   And so I put on my back burner, but once I get that, I'll bring it back to my active
[00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:03.460]   list and I'll let you know.
[00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:04.460]   And then we can start working on it again.
[00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:08.740]   So you can just inform the people, the relevant people who are generating the admin overhead.
[00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:13.260]   Oh, this has gone back to my back burner, but I'll let you know once it becomes active.
[00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:17.780]   And in doing so, you prevent it from eating up a space for a month at a time.
[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:18.780]   All right.
[00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:19.780]   So that's what I would say.
[00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:20.780]   So I'll just summarize.
[00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:26.400]   Projects at a tractable size should be days or weeks, not months.
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:28.900]   Have a few things going on at the same time.
[00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:32.840]   Delays on the scale of some two or three days, it's fine.
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:34.500]   Give yourself some breathing room.
[00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:36.580]   Delays that are like a week or greater.
[00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:39.980]   Consider formally putting that thing on the back burner, moving it to your waiting list
[00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:41.800]   and moving something else in to take its place.
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:42.800]   That's how I would handle it.
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:48.420]   But that general idea of the pull-based work, what software developers do with their Kanban
[00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:51.640]   or Agile systems, and what I'm suggesting is a much more simple version of that.
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:54.140]   It is really critical to slow productivity.
[00:54:54.140 --> 00:55:00.480]   I mean, it is the source, the major source of burnout in knowledge work is overload.
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:04.820]   Too many active things generating too much concurrent administrative overhead, choking
[00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:09.620]   like productivity kudzu, any sort of like energy or will to do original creative work
[00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:11.220]   out of your daily professional life.
[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:17.180]   If you can minimize concurrent administrative overhead, all these other things become possible.
[00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:22.140]   And make it a differentiation between actively working on and waiting to work on and only
[00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:24.780]   generating or accepting admin overhead for the active.
[00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:27.540]   I mean, this is a silver bullet that's going to make a huge difference.
[00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:29.580]   So I'm glad we got a chance.
[00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:32.300]   That's in the principle, do fewer things and slow productivity.
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:35.500]   If you read one chapter from the book, read that chapter.
[00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:39.900]   That's probably where you're going to get the biggest major bang for your buck right
[00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:43.460]   away benefit of almost anything else I talk about.
[00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:45.900]   All right.
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:47.380]   Looks like we have a case study.
[00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:48.380]   All right.
[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:51.980]   So a case study is where people send in an account of them applying the type of things
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:53.660]   we talk about this show in their own life.
[00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:56.380]   So we can see what this advice looks like in action.
[00:55:56.380 --> 00:56:01.420]   Today's case study comes from Matt, and it's about how he applies some of the ideas we
[00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:07.740]   talk about for organizing your life to his life as their family life, not just his professional
[00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:12.660]   life, but his family life, him and his wife, see what he has to say here.
[00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:18.020]   Matt says, I appreciate the simplicity of needing only three tools, calendar, file storage
[00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:19.660]   and inbox.
[00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:22.840]   My wife and I have been sharing calendars for years now, and I'm not sure how we would
[00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:25.180]   organize ourselves without it.
[00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:29.700]   All our family events, days we are working in the office versus working from home, etc.
[00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:30.700]   are marked.
[00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:34.100]   We started reviewing the first three weeks events on a weekly basis to ensure we are
[00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:35.320]   aligned.
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:40.160]   This practice has become essential as our kids schedules are dynamic.
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:43.380]   So I'll interject there, Matt is so right.
[00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:47.720]   If you have a family, you have to be using a shared calendar with your partner.
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:48.720]   You have to be.
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:53.700]   I mean, this is absolutely critical because you have these complicated, you have multiple,
[00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:58.020]   potentially multiple professional schedules, multiple child schedules, multiple sort of
[00:56:58.020 --> 00:56:59.180]   social schedules.
[00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:03.140]   You have to be able to see the whole ballgame all at once and review these together.
[00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:05.740]   My wife and I have, I don't know what it's called.
[00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:11.040]   It's like a terrible ad if you're this company, but we have like this frame, like a digital
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:15.120]   picture frame in our kitchen that has loaded in it.
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:18.520]   It's like a tablet, our shared calendar.
[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:21.320]   So we can just, without having to load up a phone or a computer, it's just right there,
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:24.640]   like in the kitchen while you're working on things, you see the shared calendar and you
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:28.120]   can scroll and see what's going on in the day and scroll ahead of what's going on.
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:33.320]   It is so central to how we run our lives and the lives of three elementary school kids.
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:37.140]   Our calendars are so central that we just like have a permanent calendar device right
[00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:38.140]   there in our kitchen.
[00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:41.020]   All right, let me go back to Matt's case study here.
[00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:48.300]   He says, I appreciate how you suggested having both a digital and physical file storage solution.
[00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:52.140]   We do, but we try to minimize the amount of physical paper we keep in the house.
[00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:57.620]   We found Microsoft's OneDrive a great solution because it allows you to scan paper to PDFs.
[00:57:57.620 --> 00:58:01.820]   We could then shred the original unless a physical copy is required.
[00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:08.500]   Using an inbox, we have had good success using both the iOS Reminders app for tracking tasks
[00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:13.020]   and a shared Trello board for tracking projects, which he defines as outcomes that require
[00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:16.020]   two or more tasks to complete.
[00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:20.220]   Examples of projects are home renovation, vacation planning, etc.
[00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:23.180]   Per your recommendation, it sounds like we have an opportunity to improve our physical
[00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:24.180]   inbox.
[00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:27.740]   I also realized we can be more intentional about giving each other time away from the
[00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:32.460]   kids to accomplish non-work administrative tasks and inbox clearing around the house.
[00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:35.900]   All right, Matt, what I like about this is you're being intentional.
[00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:38.660]   You and your wife are being intentional.
[00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:44.060]   You know, an organized life is the prerequisite for an interesting, deep, or remarkable life.
[00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:49.500]   Like if you don't have control over what is actually happening in your life, you don't
[00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:52.940]   have a lot of control over what that life is going to be like, what direction it's going,
[00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:54.620]   how it unfolds.
[00:58:54.620 --> 00:59:01.180]   I really don't buy these critiques that somehow say the push to become more organized in your
[00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:05.320]   life is somehow diminishing the spontaneity of life.
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:10.460]   That is an obsession with optimization, that it's like an internalist capitalist narrative.
[00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:12.060]   It's like, no, I mean, what do you do in your life?
[00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:18.660]   You have a complicated stream of obligations that need to be executed.
[00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:23.060]   You could either control those or you can wander through them haphazardly and be surprised
[00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:24.060]   by them.
[00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:25.700]   Or you could do a lot more cool stuff.
[00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:27.060]   If you can't, you can't.
[00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:32.940]   The organized life is what unlocks the remarkable or interesting life, at least it's one of
[00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:33.940]   the ways to do that.
[00:59:33.940 --> 00:59:38.660]   Now, of course, you can go too far and yes, you can become like obsessed with optimization.
[00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:40.460]   We're playing with human instincts here.
[00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:44.460]   We like to sort of have control and plan and see our plans executed so you can get sort
[00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:46.340]   of addicted to organization.
[00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:51.380]   But the response to that reality is not to be disorganized, it's just to be reasonably
[00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:52.380]   organized.
[00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:58.100]   And I think it's very evident of this that, you know, any book about the big deep life
[00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:02.660]   transforming your life, how to live the happy life, all these big books, they should have
[01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:07.220]   like a really big chapter on time management, like family time management, you know, but
[01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:08.940]   they don't because it's not sexy, but they should.
[01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:12.860]   So Matt, I appreciate just hearing what it sounds like when a family has been very intentional
[01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:16.100]   about trying to figure out how do we wrangle all this stuff so the stuff doesn't drown
[01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:17.100]   us.
[01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:18.500]   And there's some good ideas there.
[01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:21.940]   All right, well, we got a cool case study coming up.
[01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:24.900]   But first I want to talk about another one of our sponsors.
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:30.420]   In particular, I want to talk about listening.
[01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:36.400]   This is a service that we've talked about in some recent episodes, and I think it is
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.400]   really cool.
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.740]   All right, so here's the idea.
[01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:45.380]   Think about the various things that you need to read or consume in your life, like articles
[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:49.500]   or books or PDFs or email newsletters, websites, etc.
[01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:53.820]   The things you read that have important information that you need for your job or you just find
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:58.860]   it really interesting, where you said, you know what, it would be nice if I didn't have
[01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:02.860]   to sit down and look at a screen to consume all this information because I have all this
[01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:08.140]   other time when I'm doing dishes, when I'm commuting, when I'm doing yard work or doing
[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:09.140]   my laundry.
[01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:13.220]   I have all this other time where like maybe I listen to podcasts or audiobooks where I
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:17.780]   could be using it to consume this information, these articles, these books, these PDFs.
[01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:23.300]   Wouldn't it be cool if that stuff that you read, you could also listen to?
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:27.580]   Well, that's where the Listening app enters the scene.
[01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:32.660]   It allows you to take that content and transform it into audio content so that you can listen
[01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:37.740]   to it while you're cooking, while you're walking, while you're exercising, whatever it is that
[01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:39.580]   you are doing.
[01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:41.540]   I've messed around with the Listening app.
[01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:46.140]   You can use academic papers is like a cool one because I read a lot of papers as part
[01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:48.380]   of my work as a writer and thinker.
[01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:51.580]   So I like this idea that like when I'm commuting to work, I can hear from it.
[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:55.500]   I also like the email newsletter is a good use for this as well.
[01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:58.980]   You know, if you subscribe to these newsletters because you love the ideas, but you don't
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:02.500]   ever feel like you have time to read them all because when you're in your email inbox,
[01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:05.940]   you have to answer a thousand emails to be able to grab a few, throw it to the Listening
[01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:10.620]   app and listen to it when you're going to grab lunch.
[01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:13.300]   I found that to be really useful as well.
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:17.420]   It has fantastic voices that uses, you know, we've had these breakthroughs in AI recently.
[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:19.600]   So the voices are very lifelike.
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.280]   We're talking like emotion intonation.
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:26.460]   So it sounds like they hired a narrator to read this is not, you know, your favorite
[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:28.580]   academic article is read by Stephen Hawking.
[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:36.200]   It's going to sound, you know, like you had a live reader doing this.
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:40.900]   The app, technical terms, I have found that it pronounces those really well.
[01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:45.900]   The feature I really like in the Listening app is the one-touch note-taking function.
[01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:51.080]   Oh, this is a place I want to mark this place because this was interesting and I'm listening
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:52.480]   to it.
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:53.480]   Mark this place.
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:54.600]   I can go back later and add a note about this.
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:57.700]   We can collect all the notes about what I'm listening to.
[01:02:57.700 --> 01:03:00.900]   So anyways, I think this is just a cool idea.
[01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:03.140]   We already love listening to podcasts like this.
[01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:04.980]   We like listening to audio books.
[01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:08.280]   Why not throw into the mix the other sort of really interesting information that we
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:10.820]   otherwise would just read?
[01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:13.900]   So your life just got a lot easier.
[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:18.300]   Normally, Listening would offer a two-week free trial.
[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:23.260]   But as my listeners, you can get a month free of the Listening app.
[01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:29.780]   Go to listening.com/deep or use the code DEEP at checkout to get a whole month free to try
[01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:30.780]   the Listening app.
[01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:36.180]   That's listening.com/deep and use that code DEEP at checkout.
[01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:40.100]   Continuing the theme of listening to really good information, I also want to mention our
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:43.980]   longtime friends at Blinkist.
[01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:53.220]   The Blinkist app gives you summaries of over 6,500 bestselling nonfiction books.
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:58.060]   Each of these summaries which you can read or listen to, depending what you prefer, takes
[01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:02.420]   just 15 minutes to consume.
[01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:07.080]   The way that I use Blinkist, the way that Jesse uses Blinkist is that as a triage service
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:08.080]   for books.
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:11.440]   I'm thinking about reading this book, let me just listen to the Blink or read the Blink
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.140]   real quick, get the main ideas.
[01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:16.980]   It's a fantastic way of telling, "Oh, is this something I want to buy the full book for?
[01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:18.500]   Or is this not quite what I think?
[01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:20.900]   Or it is what I thought, but I got all the information I need from the Blink, I don't
[01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:21.900]   want to buy the whole book."
[01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:23.260]   It's a fantastic way.
[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:26.940]   Throw books you're interested in to your Blinkist queue and then read the Blinks, listen to
[01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:27.940]   the Blinks.
[01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:29.260]   You can triage books.
[01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:33.540]   Other people use Blinkist that I know, they get the lay of the land quickly on a topic.
[01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:37.580]   "Oh, I really care, I should know more about crypto or Gen AI."
[01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:38.580]   Great.
[01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:42.240]   Let me listen to the Blinks of five books, one, two, three, four, five in a row.
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:46.780]   You have just picked up from those summaries, all of the key vocabulary and ideas you need
[01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:49.460]   to at least think about these things in a reasonable way.
[01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:54.280]   And then later on when you select a more in-depth book to read, you really know the landscape.
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:59.780]   So I think of Blinkist as a critical tool for anyone who embraces the reading life.
[01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:07.420]   A life in which a lot of reading happens, Blinkist is a great assistant to have in navigating
[01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:10.300]   this particular life.
[01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:14.540]   They also have a cool new feature right now called Blinkist Connect, in which when you
[01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:17.460]   subscribe you give another person unlimited access for free.
[01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:20.340]   So it's basically a two for one deal.
[01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:22.500]   So keep that in mind.
[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:26.200]   Right now Blinkist has a particular special offer just for our audience.
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:33.060]   If you go to Blinkist.com/deep to start your seven day free trial, you will get 40% off.
[01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:37.700]   That's almost half off, 40% off a Blinkist premium membership.
[01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:47.660]   That's Blinkist spelled B-L-I-N-K-I-S-T, Blinkist.com/deep to get 40% off any seven day free trial, Blinkist.com/deep.
[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:51.540]   And remember now for a limited time, you can use Blinkist Connect to share your premium
[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:52.580]   account.
[01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:56.540]   You will get two premium subscriptions for the price of one at Blinkist.com/deep.
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:06:00.340]   All right, Jesse, let's get to our final segment.
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:05.720]   All right, so one of the things I like to do in the final segment is react to something
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:10.240]   interesting that I read about in the news.
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:14.900]   So in particular, I want to talk about in honor of my trip to England that I just got
[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:22.340]   back from, I want to talk about a article from the Guardian about the football club,
[01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:23.340]   Manchester United.
[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:28.940]   All right, so I'm loading this on the screen here for people who are watching instead of
[01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:30.260]   just listening.
[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:36.320]   So I guess Manchester United is owned by someone named Jim Ratcliffe.
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:42.060]   So Jim Ratcliffe just announced that the employees of Manchester United, the sort of the office,
[01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:47.920]   the front office employees, back office employees, need to work from the office.
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:55.580]   And in doing so, he cited email traffic statistics as his motivation for making this claim.
[01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:58.700]   So let me read you a little bit from this article.
[01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:02.860]   United have had a flexible work from home policy since COVID.
[01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:07.220]   But Ratcliffe signaled an end to this during his all-staff meeting held in person via video
[01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:12.540]   call last week as part of his tour of Old Trafford and the Carrington training base.
[01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:20.460]   He informed the club's approximately 1,000 employees that email traffic dropped by 20%
[01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:25.700]   when one of his companies experimented with work from home Fridays, which he cited as
[01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:29.380]   the reason for his dictate.
[01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:32.460]   Ratcliffe believes having all staff on site will allow greater productivity and strengthen
[01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:34.940]   unity and collaboration.
[01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:40.260]   To emphasize his message, United's minority owner, who uses these methods at INEOS, told
[01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:44.620]   the meeting, "If you don't like it, please seek alternative employment."
[01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:49.260]   All right, there's some interesting things going on here.
[01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:58.060]   Now first of all, let me be clear, I'm not of that camp that has emerged that has somehow
[01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:05.740]   cited working from home as both the cure for everything that ails knowledge work and a
[01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:08.260]   fundamental human right.
[01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:12.900]   I'm not one of these like, of course we need to be working from home, and anyone who doesn't
[01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:20.860]   want their company working from home is essentially like an exploitative capitalist that just
[01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:23.020]   like hates people.
[01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:29.020]   I think a lot, and I wrote about this in The New Yorker, I think a lot of this like working
[01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:35.660]   from home is vital is more of a reflection of a deeper unrest about the unsustainability
[01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:40.380]   and deranging exhaustion of pseudo productivity that the pandemic pushed us over the edge
[01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:44.100]   about all of these things about knowledge work that I talk about in my books, Slow Productivity,
[01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:47.720]   that have become sort of unlivable.
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:51.780]   We began to push back about this, we grabbed at anything we had, and like working from
[01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:56.380]   home was something we could grab because when bosses said, "Let's come back to the office,"
[01:08:56.380 --> 01:08:59.860]   that felt like we were conceding something, we were just upset about work, we wanted to
[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:00.860]   fix something.
[01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:03.940]   I don't think just saying let's work from home is going to fix these big problems, right?
[01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:08.940]   So I am not an absolutist about working from home.
[01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:16.100]   That being said, I think Jim Ratcliffe's response here gets things absolutely backwards.
[01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:20.700]   He said, "Look, at one of my companies, we did work from home Fridays and the email traffic
[01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:22.980]   went down by 20%.
[01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:25.940]   His takeaway from that is that working from home doesn't work.
[01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:29.980]   My takeaway from that statistic is the exact opposite."
[01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:36.040]   He should have said, "Wow, work from home Friday was a huge success because email traffic
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:40.100]   dropped by 20% when we did that."
[01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:47.140]   This equation of visible performative activity with useful effort, what I call pseudo-productivity
[01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:51.300]   in my book, Slow Productivity, is the core engine driving much of the exhaustion and
[01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:53.840]   burnout in this current economic sector.
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:57.780]   This idea that email is being sent back and forth, that that's what work is, and if that
[01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:02.540]   goes down, work is going down, is one of the most purified examples of the inanity of pseudo-productivity
[01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:06.520]   that I have recently uncovered.
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:09.260]   His company does not make money by sending and receiving emails.
[01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:12.300]   It makes money by producing whatever it is these various companies actually produce that's
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:13.980]   valuable in the marketplace.
[01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:17.880]   The constant sending and receiving of emails actually probably slows the pace at which
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.340]   this is produced.
[01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:24.180]   Writing The Atlantic back in March, when my book first came out, I wrote an op-ed for
[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:25.180]   The Atlantic.
[01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:27.100]   They got a little bit of traction.
[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:32.300]   And I actually suggested in that, your days that you work from home, so like what Ratcliffe
[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:35.500]   calls work-from-home Fridays, if you have a hybrid schedule where some days people are
[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:39.820]   at home and some days they're in the office, the days you work from home should have zero
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:42.940]   email and zero meetings.
[01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:47.500]   I call this hybrid attention, and I said this is the right way to take advantage of hybrid
[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:48.500]   work schedules.
[01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:52.660]   Why not say, "When I'm at home on Fridays, don't touch your email inbox.
[01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:54.700]   Don't get on any sort of meetings.
[01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:55.700]   Just produce things."
[01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:58.980]   Now, if you're like, "How do I know if my employee's working?"
[01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:01.660]   Well, that's a bigger problem you have, right?
[01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:06.780]   You need a better way of actually saying, "What did you do for us in the last six months?"
[01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:10.220]   And if people can't clearly answer that question, then your whole company is just a mess of
[01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:14.780]   sort of incestuous pseudo-productivity, and that's a big problem, right?
[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:18.900]   But that's an easily solved problem if you can just ask people, "What do you do?
[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:19.900]   What did you do?
[01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:20.900]   What do you produce?
[01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:21.900]   You made this project.
[01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:22.900]   Did this project work?
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:23.900]   Where's your value?"
[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:26.540]   Once you have that, you don't have to care anymore about, "At this particular hour on
[01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:29.260]   this particular day, are you actively at your keyboard?"
[01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:31.060]   Who cares?
[01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:32.060]   Produce stuff that matters.
[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:35.580]   And once you care about people producing stuff that matters, you don't have to use these
[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:39.580]   pseudo-productivity metrics to try to figure out who's useful and who's not.
[01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:45.860]   So your email traffic dropping by 20% on work-from-home Fridays is not only not a problem, but it's
[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:47.140]   not going far enough.
[01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:52.060]   That number should be, you know, 100% would be optimal.
[01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:55.100]   So again, working from home is a complicated thing.
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:58.300]   Just simply saying, "Do your job, but do it from home," and doing Zoom doesn't solve a
[01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:01.860]   lot of problems, can make some things worse.
[01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:03.940]   But you cannot use email traffic.
[01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:08.700]   Email traffic as a measure of productivity means you don't have a sensical measure of
[01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:12.700]   productivity, which means you're probably getting a fraction of the possible actual
[01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:18.380]   useful effort that's latent in your employees, you're probably just extracting a fraction
[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:19.700]   of what's possible there.
[01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:22.980]   If what you care about is this sort of just surface performative activity.
[01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:29.280]   So anyways, I had the exact opposite response to the statistic that scared Ratcliffe.
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:32.380]   This is not the only example of this, by the way.
[01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:38.420]   It happened back in the original experiments with remote work, it's 2011.
[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:41.860]   I wrote a big New Yorker piece about this in May of 2020, about the history of remote
[01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:43.460]   work.
[01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:49.180]   You get May of, you get a 2011, I don't know when it was, but roughly 2011, all the technology
[01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:53.220]   had finally come to place for remote work to make sense because we needed ubiquitous
[01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:58.340]   broadband internet at home, we need low cost video conferencing, and we needed like the
[01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:00.860]   right infrastructure for shared documents, right?
[01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:05.900]   We had all of that in place by the end of the first decade of the 2000s.
[01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:07.620]   Companies start really experimenting with this.
[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:12.320]   Anyways, one of the big experiments was Yahoo, they hire Marissa Meyers, her CEO.
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:16.100]   She said, "I don't like this, no more remote work, everyone has to come back."
[01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:19.340]   And she said, "I don't like this, no more remote work, everyone has to come back."
[01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:22.060]   And she was like, "I don't like this, no more remote work, everyone has to come back."
[01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:24.540]   And she was like, "I don't like this, no more remote work, everyone has to come back."
[01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:26.580]   And she was like, "I don't like this, no more remote work, everyone has to come back."
[01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:29.580]   And she was like, "I don't like this, no more remote work, everyone has to come back."
[01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:32.580]   And she was like, "I don't like this, no more remote work, everyone has to come back."
[01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:35.540]   And she was like, "I don't like this, no more remote work, everyone has to come back."
[01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:38.540]   And she was like, "I don't like this, no more remote work, everyone has to come back."
[01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:43.540]   And she was like, "I don't like this, no more remote work, everyone has to come back."
[01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:46.540]   And she was like, "I don't like this, no more remote work, everyone has to come back."
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:49.540]   And she was like, "I don't like this, no more remote work, everyone has to come back."
[01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:52.540]   And she was like, "I don't like this, no more remote work, everyone has to come back."
[01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:55.540]   And she was like, "I don't like this, no more remote work, everyone has to come back."
[01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:58.540]   And she was like, "I don't like this, no more remote work, everyone has to come back."
[01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:01.540]   And she was like, "I don't like this, no more remote work, everyone has to come back."
[01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:04.540]   And she was like, "I don't like this, no more remote work, everyone has to come back."
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:09.540]   In fact, again, I push even farther, if you're going to have a hybrid schedule, make the days really different.
[01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:12.540]   At home days are for thinking, at work days are for talking.
[01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:19.540]   And I bet you'll see over the next few months the needle really move on the stuff that you really care about being produced.
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:21.540]   So there you go.
[01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:24.540]   Manchester United, that's a very British reference.
[01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:26.540]   They play soccer.
[01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:28.540]   I figure that out as much.
[01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:30.540]   Ted Lasso.
[01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:32.540]   I've taught, yeah, interesting.
[01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:34.540]   Deep work.
[01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:36.540]   Ryan does more of this, Ryan Holiday does more of this than I do.
[01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:41.540]   But there's been a lot of interest in some of these ideas from professional sports teams here in the US.
[01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:45.540]   And I've talked to GMs from various sports or whatever.
[01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:47.540]   Maybe we should just lean more into that.
[01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:49.540]   Sports are fun.
[01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:50.540]   Get some good tickets.
[01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:51.540]   Get some good tickets, that's the key.
[01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:53.540]   That's what this is all about, folks, is the good tickets.
[01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:57.540]   All right, speaking of good tickets, that's all the time we have for today.
[01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:58.540]   Does that make sense, Jesse?
[01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:00.540]   Speaking of good tickets, that's all the time we have for today.
[01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:05.540]   That would only make sense if I said, "And I have to get to a game."
[01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:08.540]   I'm not going to a Nationals game right now because they just--
[01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:14.540]   they have a switch that says, like, on one side of the switch, like, "Let's play baseball."
[01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:17.540]   And then below it, it's like, you know, "Give up."
[01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:20.540]   And someone accidentally knocked into that switch last week.
[01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:24.540]   So I'm not really interested in watching them right now.
[01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:29.540]   That shouldn't stop Mike Rizzo from bringing me in to talk about D4.
[01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:30.540]   But anyways, enough time, enough of this.
[01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:31.540]   Thanks for listening.
[01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:34.540]   We'll be back next week as usual.
[01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:37.540]   Until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:39.540]   Hey, so if you noticed earlier in this episode,
[01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:45.540]   I mentioned my use of a single-purpose notebook during my recent trip to London.
[01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:50.540]   You might enjoy checking out episode 292 where I go into detail
[01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:54.540]   about how single-purpose notebooks help you think more deeply.
[01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:55.540]   Check it out.
[01:15:55.540 --> 01:16:01.540]   So this idea of a small notebook dedicated to a single creative idea,
[01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:04.540]   what I'm calling a single-purpose notebook,
[01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:06.540]   is something that's now starting to fascinate me.
[01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:08.540]   So I want to explore it in today's deep dive.
