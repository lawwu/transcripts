[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.500]   - Thank you all for being here tonight.
[00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.600]   It's lovely to see this group.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.760]   Of course, I've seen this video on several occasions,
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.440]   but it never ceases to move me.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.760]   So tonight I'm thinking about the people
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.760]   who aren't here with us, Jack Bogle, of course,
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.760]   but also some of our former leaders,
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.080]   some of our real thought leaders still,
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.660]   Taylor Larimore, who is still with us,
[00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.260]   but just not with us tonight, and Mel Lindauer.
[00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.200]   Those are our two Hall of Fame inductees so far,
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.680]   and we plan to induct some additional individuals tonight.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.280]   I have been thinking about this group
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.700]   and how our focus is on community and education,
[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.360]   financial education, and how well this conference,
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.240]   I think, embodies those two things.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.600]   So it's lovely to see the new people
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.360]   who have joined, so many people with the tags
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.240]   that say they're first-time attendees.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.920]   It makes me so happy to see that,
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.920]   and we hope to just continue on with this conference,
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.040]   and the Bogle Center will hope to continue
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.140]   furthering people's financial education.
[00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.440]   If you wish to support our mission,
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.440]   which involves the conference and we support the forum
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.360]   and the local chapters, please,
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.280]   you can make a tax-deductible contribution
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.420]   to the organization, and you can also volunteer.
[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.800]   I think I've heard from several people already
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.660]   that they would like to be more involved,
[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.900]   and we would love to have you more involved,
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.120]   so please check in with me or check in with someone else
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.960]   who is wearing a board tag, and we can help connect you
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.400]   with things that you can help us with.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.860]   We would absolutely love that.
[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.520]   So thanks to all of you for being here.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.520]   Right now, I want to invite Andrew Bogle up to the podium.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.640]   Andrew is Jack's son, Jack's youngest son,
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.800]   and he is a member of our board and a really valued member.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.480]   All of our board members are valuable,
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.280]   but Andrew really helps us think about
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.200]   what are the best ways to honor Jack's legacy,
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.560]   so he helps us stay connected with what Jack would want
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.400]   and what the family would want.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.760]   So I'll ask Andrew to come up here now,
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.360]   and he is going to induct our new members
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.520]   into the Hall of Fame.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.660]   Andrew, thank you.
[00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.820]   (audience applauding)
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.040]   - Good evening.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.640]   Thank you for making the time, effort, and expense
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.480]   to come to BogleHuts 2024.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.600]   I am honored and thrilled to serve on the board
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.320]   of the John C. Bogle Center for Financial Literacy,
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.920]   and it's my distinct pleasure to be with all of you tonight.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.760]   Thank you.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.360]   As Christine mentioned, I'm the youngest child of Jack.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.000]   He loved being in the spotlight,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.480]   in case you didn't know that.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.420]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.000]   As a child, I couldn't comprehend it,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.120]   and candidly, it brought out a feeling in me
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.040]   of not wanting to be in the spotlight, ever.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.920]   But at some point on my journey to some level of maturity,
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.320]   relatively speaking, it occurred to me
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.160]   that a possible driver of his enjoyment of the spotlight
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.480]   wasn't actually his craving of publicity,
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.880]   though it could have been a little bit,
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.080]   but rather, he saw it as serving as a conduit
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.360]   to bring the spotlight on a new way for everyday investors
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.760]   to learn that there was a better way for them to invest.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.080]   So it wasn't necessarily about the spotlight.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.080]   Rather, it was a continuation of my father's frugal ways
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.580]   since it was free advertising.
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.580]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.180]   Being the youngest of six kids,
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.520]   I was always behind my brothers and sisters
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.000]   with my knowledge, and relatively speaking,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.300]   a tiny little kid even compared to my peers.
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.920]   So I wanted to explore what I might be able to do
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.480]   to possibly decrease that gap.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.660]   So whether by nurture, nature,
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.540]   or just plain stubbornness like my father,
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.340]   I am or became very curious.
[00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.360]   I asked a lot of questions.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.460]   I talked to a lot of people,
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.880]   and they were very kind and generous
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.880]   with sharing their knowledge and time with me.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:36.720]   Similar.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.760]   (audience laughing)
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.200]   Unexpected.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.240]   Similar to what all of you do both here
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.160]   and on the forum of sharing your knowledge
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.120]   and time with everyone else.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.300]   For that, I'm gratefully grateful.
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.600]   So in some ways, I was an early Boglehead.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.400]   I wanna express my gratitude to all of you.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.140]   You all spent an inordinate amount of time and expertise
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.520]   to not only assist other people,
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.840]   but also, and I would argue just as importantly,
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.580]   to make everyone feel welcomed, looked after,
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.200]   and to make them feel good
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.640]   about having a shot at the financial future.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:29.380]   Tonight, I'm here to thank and honor two men
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.720]   who have done so much for the Bogleheads Forum.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.420]   Unlike my father, they did not seek the spotlight.
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:40.880]   Larry and Alex are instrumental for all of us Bogleheads
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.780]   to share knowledge and ask questions on the forum.
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:49.720]   Through their time, effort, expertise, and thoughtfulness,
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.200]   they truly keep the forum up and running.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.400]   Larry was an early volunteer,
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.120]   initially offering both his services and expertise
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.560]   and setting up and hosting a Bogleheads website
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.360]   back in the 1990s when it was called
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.040]   the Vanguard Diehard on Morningstar.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.560]   It took some time, but finally in 2007,
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.520]   Larry stepped up and used his own funds
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.340]   to host the website.
[00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.240]   Since then, he's kept both the server
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.920]   and the forum software up to date on bogleheads.org.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.440]   Alex has been an administrator of the forum
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.560]   since its inception.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.240]   He sets forum policy, and in coordination
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.400]   with other forum administrators and moderators,
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.520]   helps with the interpretation and enforcement
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.720]   of those policies.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.720]   Alex is a final arbiter when there are issues
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.120]   from the forum moderators that they feel
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.360]   they need further clarification or final resolution.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.280]   As Lady Geek told me, Larry is patient
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.360]   and exemplifies someone who is a true expert,
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.360]   since, like my father, he's able to distill complex systems
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.660]   in simple terms and concepts that everyone can understand.
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.600]   And his primary motivation is to help others.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.340]   She went on to describe Alex in the following way,
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.380]   quote, "If I had to describe Alex in one word,
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.380]   "it's purpose.
[00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.900]   "What no one but the moderators can see
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.860]   "is his persistent determination
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.660]   "to keep the Bogleheads forum aligned
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.440]   "with its core principles, to have civil discussions,
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.140]   "and to treat its members fairly.
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.840]   "It is my honor and pleasure to induct and welcome
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.780]   "Larry and Alex to the Bogleheads Hall of Fame.
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.980]   "Please help me in congratulating them."
[00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.980]   (audience applauds)
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:08:08.380]   - All right, I don't have a speech,
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:13.020]   and Larry, who I always like to be behind the scenes,
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.400]   has bowed out, so.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.460]   (audience laughs)
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:21.000]   I'm going to take credit for the whole site.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.820]   (audience laughs)
[00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:26.420]   So the quick history, which I'll do real quick,
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.180]   and also, I think if anybody has questions,
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.780]   they said they were gonna do the note card things,
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.880]   'cause I'm gonna not talk very long,
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.740]   so if you have questions about anything to do
[00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.820]   with the forum or the site, and it's running,
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.040]   yeah, I'd rather answer questions than just talk, but.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.980]   So for anyone who, I mean, the history of it is,
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.220]   it was a forum that got started by Mel and Taylor
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:55.580]   on Morningstar's forums, or Morningstar's site,
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.600]   they had a little forum section,
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.540]   and they wanted to carve out a place,
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.460]   this was during the dot-com boom,
[00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.160]   between Janus Junction and Fidelity, whatever,
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.280]   and just to talk about index investing,
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.400]   passive investing strategies, and so they did,
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.400]   and it became, quickly, the most popular forum
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.380]   on Morningstar's site, and I was one of those people
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:21.000]   in 1998, '99, who just asked a question, Taylor answered,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.820]   and I just, I really enjoyed the,
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.880]   just how friendly it was, and how civil it was,
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.720]   compared to most internet forums then, and now,
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.480]   and so I hung around, and I started answering questions,
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.480]   and within about a year or so, Morningstar,
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.780]   there was a problem where there was so much activity
[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.260]   on the forum that it was very difficult
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.840]   for the people trying to answer the questions
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:54.840]   to keep track of what was being asked,
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.380]   they just had a really horrible user interface,
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.500]   and I complained about it to them,
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.600]   and then I said, look, I'm gonna show you how easy this is,
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.880]   and I wrote a little program that scraped off
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.280]   the 50 most recently updated conversations,
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:15.200]   which, at the time, was three or four days' worth of threads,
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.320]   and I just, I managed my wife's immigration law firm,
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.520]   it was just like four people, five people,
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.840]   and I just stuck it on a page on our site,
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.240]   and I just, every, well, if somebody would check it,
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.200]   or every 15 minutes, whichever came first,
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.720]   I would go see if there was anything new on Morningstar,
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.120]   and I just had a program that listed
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.200]   50 most recently updated threads,
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.920]   and it was just a tool for folks like Taylor
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.960]   to be able to find out what was going on.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.520]   This was running for a couple of weeks, maybe a month,
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.920]   and so all the regulars, the regular,
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:53.840]   were using my site, and then I got it here,
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.680]   on June 23rd, 2001, I got an email that says,
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.480]   hi, Lowall, that was my username back then,
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.600]   perhaps I could contribute to your little project.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.440]   I've been working on a back burner project
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.960]   that would provide a searchable text index
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.880]   of the Diehards Forum.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.760]   I have a robot that pulls the conversations,
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.080]   and I'm working on building a searchable text index.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.720]   I plan to build a page that, like yours,
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.320]   points back to the original post on the Morningstar site.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.120]   Let's see, would you be interested
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.920]   in some kind of collaboration?
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.700]   And it was signed LDA.
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:32.160]   And it was from lda@winix.com,
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.120]   and I said, okay, who is this guy, right?
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.400]   So I go Googling around,
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.040]   and I find that this is Larry Autin.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.120]   And who's Larry Autin?
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.840]   He was one of the pioneers of the internet.
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:49.120]   He was one of, when the internet was a dozen computers,
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.200]   he was the administrator of one of them at Bell Labs,
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.800]   where he was a researcher, he worked at Bell Labs.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.640]   And he wrote, this will be important later,
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:03.680]   he actually wrote the original software, the Usenet,
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.240]   which was these newsgroups,
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.260]   or sort of the precursors of forums,
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:12.260]   used to build, used to allow moderation of the forums,
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.480]   'cause the original Usenet, it's just everybody posted,
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.880]   and there was no moderation.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:22.240]   So I wrote back to him, sure, let's do something.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:26.440]   And within a couple of weeks, we had a site,
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:30.800]   and it was an index, and a list, my list of 50,
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.600]   and then I wrote a short little thing
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.160]   with five sites of interest,
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:40.160]   and who are the diehards, and what is index,
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.700]   and it just had a couple column, one column of links.
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:47.440]   By the way, Scott Burns, I had a link to your site,
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.180]   wherever you are, it's one of my five original.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.480]   (laughs)
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:57.480]   And that just ran, I mean, for the next six years,
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.300]   it just ran, 'cause we were just indexing stuff
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:02.840]   on the Morningstar site.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:07.720]   And then things started to fall apart on Morningstar,
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.720]   because there was a troll,
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.720]   they wouldn't do anything about it,
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.760]   and some other guy who, like me, said,
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.760]   you've gotta fix this, and he started something,
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:20.620]   he started his own forum, it went by the name of Phoenix,
[00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.660]   but he just said, this is a proof of concept,
[00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.740]   I wanna show that it's not necessary
[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.300]   to have to put up with what we're putting up with
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.340]   on Morningstar.
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:33.660]   And a whole bunch of people moved over
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.460]   within three or four days, and he contacted me,
[00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:41.260]   and he said, this is great, but I can't actually run this.
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260]   (laughs)
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.980]   It's like, I'm doing this on a free server,
[00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.240]   I have no, you know, I don't know, I can't handle this.
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.320]   He's like, would you guys like to take this over?
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.920]   And I talked to Larry, and we had been in discussions,
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.200]   like, maybe we should just shut this down,
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.880]   because it's harder, there was less and less activity
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.120]   on the Morningstar site as people were running away.
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.800]   So anyway, we said, okay, we'll try it.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.700]   And this was in 2000, let's see,
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:10.000]   2007, right?
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.020]   And so we quickly, within a week or so, we took it over.
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.080]   And then I'm faced with, okay, how am I gonna do this?
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.620]   All right, we have it, I have some ideas.
[00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.440]   So I had to write policies and figure out
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.680]   what kind of conversations we were gonna allow,
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.520]   and I'm thinking, I wanna build a community
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:33.520]   that reflects what I found attractive when I first posted.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:37.880]   So, and that's the basis for our policies,
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.200]   is sort of what would Taylor do,
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.600]   or how, you know, that's sort of how I thought about it.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:47.600]   So no religion, no politics, we keep the topics down.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:52.360]   The idea is to just make it a civil place,
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.840]   and that's, and you can see in,
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.240]   well, look at all these people, you know, it's worked.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:03.240]   So I guess that's, if there's any questions?
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.680]   All right, let's see if they're on crypto.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.680]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.840]   Can we get dark mode?
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.600]   Sue, is that a PHP?
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.080]   - It's a browser extension,
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.840]   no one can see anything in there.
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.200]   - I should talk about, so for the first few years of this,
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.820]   once the forum started, I was spending
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.200]   somewhere between five and 10 hours a day
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.600]   as moderating, and writing, and watching everything.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.400]   I have stepped way back, and when Sue came in,
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.840]   so the lady geek right here,
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:43.480]   as she was a part of Wiki, you know,
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.520]   putting together the Wiki,
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:48.000]   and then she sort of called Larry, or contacted Larry,
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.920]   and said, "Can I do some site admin stuff?"
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.160]   And he just sort of handed to her.
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.160]   He's like, "Yes, please do."
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.920]   And she's become our site, our backup site admin,
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:00.160]   and day-to-day, you know, sort of manager
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.560]   of the moderators and things.
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.080]   And now I just check in once in a while
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.000]   when there's issues.
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.160]   So it's Sue and the moderators.
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.440]   Oh, that's the other thing I should say.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.120]   A lot of the questions don't answer,
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.760]   but a lot of the policies also have to do
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.320]   with the one most finite resource we have
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:20.200]   is moderator time, so you try to do things
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.860]   that keep things from getting out of hand
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.300]   for the moderators.
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.000]   So, dark mode.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   One of the other things we do is keep the costs down,
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.320]   'cause it's coming out of our pockets,
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:34.120]   is we use, everything's open source software,
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:37.000]   and we try to keep things, you know,
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.360]   pretty close to the, without a lot of customization,
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.240]   and keep it simple for us to manage.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.240]   So, if there's a PHP BB dark mode?
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.720]   - The browser extensions.
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.540]   - Okay.
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:50.380]   - They have dark mode, like Chrome.
[00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:51.560]   I'm gonna try it, but--
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.140]   - Okay, so maybe see if there's a Chrome--
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.280]   - There's a Chrome thread on it.
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.080]   Is it on the administration area?
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.600]   - There's a thread on it, of course there is.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.440]   Okay.
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.160]   (audience laughs)
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.120]   And then the other one here.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.640]   What do you consider one of the highlights
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.800]   of your time with the Bogleheads?
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.340]   Well, maybe this?
[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.040]   (audience laughs)
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:09.880]   I mean, it--
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.880]   (audience applauds)
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:18.040]   I don't know, it was, I mean it's just great
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.000]   to meet the people, to meet, you know,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.720]   Bill Bernstein, and these people,
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:26.080]   I love their books, so it's, so that part's good.
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:30.280]   But it's always good just, just seeing
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:35.100]   that it has a positive impact on,
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.040]   you know, the larger community.
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.100]   Because this is, I do this as a volunteer.
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.240]   I have my, come from a family,
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.580]   my mother volunteered for everything,
[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:44.940]   my grandmother volunteered for everything.
[00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:47.540]   This is sort of my way of volunteering,
[00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.540]   'cause I don't have a lot of money to give to things,
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:54.540]   so I can give my time, and, you know,
[00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:58.700]   sort of built this thing that I, you know,
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:17:59.940]   that I had the ability to do.
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.540]   I had the background, whatever, to do it.
[00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:07.540]   So, well, I guess just seeing that it continues.
[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:11.040]   Lots of forums, as forums as a class
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.340]   are sort of disappearing.
[00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.000]   You know, Reddit took a lot of 'em down,
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.200]   Facebook took a lot of 'em down,
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.220]   so ours is really unusual to have a forum
[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:22.180]   that is not just continued, but actually continues
[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:25.080]   to grow at a slow rate over time.
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.160]   So, that's it, I guess.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.000]   All right, thank you.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   (audience applauds)
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.580]   (air whooshes)
[00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:44.580]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
