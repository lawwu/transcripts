[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500]   - On the human side, there's this incredible general
[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.860]   malleability plasticity of the human brain.
[00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.540]   The human brain adapts, adjusts, and so on.
[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.700]   - It's not that plastic, to be totally frank.
[00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.800]   - So there's a firm structure, but nevertheless,
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.580]   there is some plasticity, and the open question is,
[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.220]   so if I could ask a broad question,
[00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.220]   is how much of that plasticity can be utilized?
[00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.700]   So on the human side, there's some plasticity
[00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.620]   in the human brain, and on the machine side,
[00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.300]   we have neural networks, machine learning,
[00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.700]   artificial intelligence, it's able to adjust
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.860]   and figure out signals.
[00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.260]   So there's a mysterious language
[00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.800]   that we don't perfectly understand
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.700]   that's within the human brain,
[00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.980]   and then we're trying to understand that language
[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.820]   to communicate both directions.
[00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.700]   So the brain is adjusting a little bit,
[00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.820]   we don't know how much, and the machine is adjusting.
[00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.620]   Where do you see, as they try to sort of reach together,
[00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.340]   almost like with an alien species,
[00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.460]   try to find a protocol, communication protocol,
[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.060]   that works, where do you see the biggest benefit
[00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.340]   arriving from, on the machine side or the human side?
[00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.660]   Do you see both of them working together?
[00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.580]   - I think the machine side is far more malleable
[00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.580]   than the biological side, by a huge amount.
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.220]   So it'll be the machine that adapts to the brain.
[00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.260]   That's the only thing that's possible,
[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.780]   the brain can't adapt that well to the machine.
[00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.140]   You can have neurons start to regard
[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.820]   an electrode as another neuron,
[00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.220]   'cause a neuron just, it's like the pulse,
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.140]   and so something else is pulsing.
[00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.140]   So there is that elasticity in the interface,
[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.820]   which we believe is something that can happen,
[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.020]   but the vast majority of the malleability
[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.660]   will have to be on the machine side.
[00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.060]   - But it's interesting, when you look
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.180]   at that synaptic plasticity at the interface side,
[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.260]   there might be an emergent plasticity,
[00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.340]   'cause it's a whole nother, it's not in the brain,
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.540]   it's a whole nother extension of the brain.
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.740]   You know, we might have to redefine
[00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.620]   what it means to be malleable for the brain.
[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.860]   So maybe the brain is able to adjust to external interfaces.
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.340]   - There will be some adjustment to the brain,
[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.100]   'cause there's gonna be something reading
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.100]   and simulating the brain,
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.820]   and so it will adjust to that thing.
[00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.900]   But the vast majority of the adjustment
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.300]   will be on the machine side.
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.620]   This is just, it has to be that,
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.020]   otherwise it will not work.
