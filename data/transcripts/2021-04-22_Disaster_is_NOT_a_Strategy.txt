[00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.940]   Today I have one very simple,
[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.980]   but important topic to discuss with you.
[00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.080]   Disaster is not a strategy.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.720]   One of the things that I have found shocking
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.920]   over the past year or so,
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.980]   is how many people find themselves
[00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.820]   looking at the future with a sense of bleakness
[00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.800]   and blackness because, well, it's just all bad
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.360]   and it's just gonna get worse.
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.660]   Friend, disaster is not a strategy.
[00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.400]   If you find yourself looking at the world
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.540]   and looking at something that you believe is catastrophic,
[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.680]   something that you believe is an impending disaster,
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.680]   and you find yourself just sitting and saying,
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.580]   "Well, this is certain," do not stay there.
[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.920]   Make a plan and take action on it.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.420]   There is not a single bad thing
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.960]   that you can tell me today that you're worried about,
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.600]   that I cannot help you make a plan for.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.340]   There is nothing that you are concerned about
[00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.300]   that cannot be planned for.
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.580]   And as human beings, we are endowed
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.980]   with the power of creativity.
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.580]   We are endowed with the power of creativity.
[00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.760]   Hopefully you understand the double meaning.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.100]   We can think creatively
[00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.060]   and we can create what we think about.
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.100]   And so you must always train your thoughts
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.740]   to go from problem to solution.
[00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.940]   Do not dwell on the problem.
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.280]   Simply look around and say,
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.480]   "Hey, look, here's a problem.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.580]   Here's something I'm concerned about.
[00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.780]   Here is something that I think
[00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.780]   is going to be difficult in the future."
[00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.260]   And then pull out a piece of paper,
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.360]   grab a pen and make a list of things
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.000]   that you can do about it.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.120]   In theory, there might be something
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.500]   that you cannot actually do anything about.
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.600]   There might be something
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.600]   that is outside of your control, in theory.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.740]   I have a hard time coming up with anything
[00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.680]   that I can't do anything about.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.400]   But we all acknowledge that you and I
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.980]   are not sovereign over the affairs of this world.
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.740]   You and I are not sovereign over what happens to us.
[00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.320]   But if you will stop and think about
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.080]   even the worst case scenario
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.720]   that you're concerned about,
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.760]   and then simply say,
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.760]   "Well, if this did happen, what would I need to do?"
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.060]   And start taking action on it,
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.460]   you will feel a lot better
[00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.660]   than if you sit and mope and stew
[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.800]   and grumble and complain and whine online
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.100]   about this thing that you're concerned about.
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.940]   Friend, things are not as bad as you think they are,
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.040]   and you have so many options in front of you.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.140]   Disaster is not a strategy,
[00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.420]   but you can build a strategy for any disaster
[00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.120]   that you are concerned about.
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.320]   Disaster is not a strategy,
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.920]   but you can build a strategy for any disaster
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.560]   that you are concerned about.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.360]   And I want to challenge you.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.200]   It is unhealthy.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.240]   It's stupid to live in a sense of blackness
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.200]   where you just think everything is bad.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.080]   Everything is gonna get worse.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.520]   This is crazy.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.940]   You will find yourself feeling far better
[00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.380]   if you will get up and start doing something
[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.360]   about whatever it is that you are concerned about.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.700]   Struggling with whether I should give you
[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.700]   example after example after example.
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.440]   Let's do a few, okay?
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.100]   Let's say that you say, "Joshua, listen,
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.740]   "I can't control everything that happens to me."
[00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:39.580]   Let's start at the worst,
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.940]   like weakest, impotent thing you can do.
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.880]   I can't control what happens to me.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.280]   And so because I can't control what happens to me,
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.080]   after all, what if I'm driving to work today
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.360]   and a car jumps the curve,
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.220]   or a truck jumps the curve, smashes me,
[00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.500]   and I'm dead, sitting right in my seat?
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.560]   All right, let's start there.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.000]   That's pretty bad, right?
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.100]   You're dead.
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.000]   So what do you do?
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.200]   Well, you begin by assessing your spiritual condition
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.240]   and make sure that when your body is dead,
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.000]   your spirit is not dead.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.160]   There's no reason whatsoever for your physical death
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.700]   to be the end of your life,
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.800]   except you don't choose to partake of the gift of life
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.800]   that has been offered to you
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.980]   by the creator of this universe.
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.680]   So first, assess your spiritual state,
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.680]   repent of your sins, believe in the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.380]   be baptized for the forgiveness of your sins,
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.520]   and receive the Holy Spirit, be born again.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.420]   Then at your death, your family can come together
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.360]   and can rejoice about your life,
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.320]   knowing that for you to die is gain
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.120]   because you're with the Lord.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.300]   Pardon the moment of preaching, but I can't resist.
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.840]   What else can you do?
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.900]   Well, you could think about how your death
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.200]   would impact the world around you.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.680]   I'd say the first question is,
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.580]   would anybody care about your death?
[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.380]   If nobody would care about your death,
[00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.920]   then why does it matter?
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.620]   You're dead, they're not, your life didn't matter.
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.980]   Go on with things, they're not gonna go on.
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.180]   So build a life where they're actually gonna care
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.720]   and they're actually gonna care.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.560]   Think about how short life is
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.720]   and make sure that you're living today
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.100]   as if you knew that two years from now
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.300]   that truck was gonna hit you.
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.100]   Make today count, don't waste today,
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.240]   don't waste this week, don't waste this month.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.800]   Make today count.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.840]   Then as you're living today and making today count,
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.880]   then systematically move yourself in the direction
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.280]   where you take action to protect those things
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.080]   that would be harmed by your death.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.880]   Make sure that your loved ones have your passwords
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.720]   to all of your online accounts
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.520]   so that they can close out your affairs
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.920]   with a minimum amount of problems,
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.160]   so they can turn your Facebook profile into a memorial.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.660]   Make sure that you have money to care for your family.
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.340]   Make sure you leave them in a good situation,
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.860]   buy life insurance, so that if you're dead and gone,
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.440]   all of your dreams can still come true.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.740]   Just go down the list
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.300]   and start solving the problems one by one.
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.040]   What else is out of your control?
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.100]   Global warming, okay?
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.520]   The world is headed for a climate catastrophe.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.860]   It's a climate emergency.
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.240]   We're all gonna die, all right?
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.640]   Well, start working on it, right?
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.360]   Start planting trees, start planting green stuff
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.480]   to take some carbon out of the atmosphere.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.560]   If you think the sea levels are gonna rise,
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.160]   move from Florida to Colorado
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.080]   because I can promise you that Colorado
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.600]   is not going to be inundated with rising sea levels.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.640]   If you think temperatures are gonna rise,
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.300]   move from Mexico to Canada.
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.280]   Canada could be quite lovely if temperatures rise.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.920]   If you are concerned that agricultural production
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:56.440]   is going to cease, then stockpile food,
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.540]   stockpile seeds, build a resilient property, right?
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:03.220]   I always think back to Ben Falk, the permaculture designer,
[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.000]   who always, in his permaculture designs,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   always plants crops for a couple of different climate zones.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.680]   Let's say you're in a climate zone seven.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.960]   He'll plant crops for a six and a five
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.960]   and an eight and a nine.
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.880]   That way, if the earth warms,
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.800]   his zones eight and nine crops will flourish,
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.080]   and if the earth cools, his zones six and five will flourish.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.960]   So, start, do something, right?
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.840]   If you're concerned about global food supplies,
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.200]   then start growing food.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.760]   What else can you do?
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.240]   Let's say you say, well, my school is going down.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.960]   They're making my kids wear masks.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.200]   They won't open schools.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.740]   They're teaching my children a bunch of crazy stuff
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.080]   that I don't believe in.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.180]   Well, pull 'em out.
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.860]   Pull 'em out and go find a better school.
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.560]   You say, I don't have money for a better school.
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.300]   All right, well, go make more money.
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.400]   Don't sit around and reflect on the fact that you're broke.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.240]   Say, I'm broke.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.060]   This sucks.
[00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.120]   I'm gonna go make more money,
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.640]   and sit down and start brainstorming every single day
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.440]   plans as to how you can make enough money
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.480]   to get your kids into a decent school
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.000]   where they're not gonna be indoctrinated
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.480]   with stuff that you don't believe in.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.000]   You say, well, my country is just headed down the tubes.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.360]   My country is in a bad shape.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.760]   Everything is just getting worse,
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.360]   and can you believe these politicians?
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.120]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.020]   Well, get out.
[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.480]   Leave.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.920]   You're not stuck.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.280]   You're not a slave.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.480]   Pick up and go.
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.300]   Go find somewhere better.
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.320]   Maybe it takes you five years to find somewhere better.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.880]   Okay.
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.800]   Better than sitting around whining for five years
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.120]   realizing disaster is certain.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.980]   It's nonsense.
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:49.100]   I could go on and on with example after example.
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:53.000]   If you ever find yourself just reflecting
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.560]   on how disaster is certain, everything is bad,
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.040]   immediately catch yourself and stop,
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.020]   and say, what can I do about this?
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:09.480]   If you're convinced that hyperinflation is inevitable,
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.320]   then get rid of all your assets that are denominated
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.640]   in the currency that you're worried about.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.820]   Go buy farmland.
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:21.600]   Go build a business that sees to someone's needs,
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.720]   whatever it is.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:28.640]   But don't fall victim to thinking that disaster is certain.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:33.720]   There's a sense in which disaster is certain.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.200]   You and I will undergo many disasters,
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.760]   but so many people spend years of their lives
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.080]   thinking about disaster, and they lose those years
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.520]   of their life that they'll never get back.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.160]   And as far as I'm concerned, that's a disaster.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:52.760]   I am more, I talk more about disaster
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.240]   than virtually anyone I know, at least in the finance space.
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.800]   I do it so that I can plan for it and move on with life.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.200]   But I've studied it enough to know
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.560]   that the majority of the disasters
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.760]   that you and I are concerned with simply won't happen.
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.460]   And it's not that hard to prepare for them if they did.
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:14.220]   So I wanna close this out with a very simple charge.
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:21.120]   Disaster is not a strategy, but you can build a strategy
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.920]   for almost any disaster that you're concerned about.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.920]   Even if it's only in your head.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.200]   All right, what is your worst fear?
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.520]   Maybe your worst fear is falling off your motorcycle
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.440]   and being paralyzed.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.280]   All right, well, let's tackle that.
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.400]   First, maybe you can adjust it.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.000]   Maybe you stop riding motorcycles.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.280]   Maybe when you ride a motorcycle,
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.560]   you wear all the safety gear.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.040]   Maybe you ride more carefully, whatever, right?
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.160]   But let's assume it did happen.
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.360]   There are lots of people in the world
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.320]   who live happy, fulfilled lives, totally paralyzed.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.360]   So face it.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:03.000]   Maybe your biggest fear is getting Alzheimer's disease.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.560]   Okay, well, let's make a strategy.
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.880]   Do everything you can not to get Alzheimer's disease.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.560]   Study all the latest science,
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.760]   but then put in place the legal system,
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.000]   the financial preparation
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.600]   so that if you did get Alzheimer's disease,
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.160]   you would be transformed.
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.280]   And then fix your worldview
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.080]   so that you actually can trust
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:24.120]   that if I get Alzheimer's disease,
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.680]   I can still trust a God who does all things well.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.920]   And if you get Alzheimer's disease,
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.640]   maybe you can take joy in the fact
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.920]   that you forget the bad stuff and the good stuff.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.520]   And you can live a happier life.
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.880]   I mean, I don't wanna go on and on
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.640]   with disaster after disaster.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.880]   I just wanna say that disaster is not a strategy,
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.320]   but you can build a strategy for any disaster.
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.560]   So if there's something that you're worrying about,
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:51.040]   articulate it to yourself, write it down.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.880]   Start thinking about how could I plan for this?
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.720]   I guarantee that somebody else has put together
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.320]   a pretty good plan for that particular disaster.
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.560]   If you're that concerned about it,
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.560]   implement the plan and move on.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:06.560]   And don't spend days, weeks, months, years
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.640]   wallowing around in your black despair
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.240]   over a disaster that probably won't happen.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.160]   Move on and build a better life.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.320]   I promise you, it's a better path.
