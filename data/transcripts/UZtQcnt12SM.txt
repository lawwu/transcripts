[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   How was your colonoscopy? Oh, well, that was a talk about
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.400]   Uranus. Talk about my anus. Have you guys had yours recently?
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.600]   Who's had a colonoscopy? I have mine in December. My first one.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.520]   Yeah, my first one. Yeah, I was delinquent on mine, too. They
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.720]   used to be 50. And they moved the age down to 45. Yeah, they
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.560]   didn't move the age down. Freeberg. Have you had one yet?
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.720]   That's a yes. We got a yes. Do you have you had yours? I'm due
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.120]   by the way, I got a report because actually, sacks, you did
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.720]   have one. And they found a bunch of DeSantis merchandise up
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.400]   there. DeSantis had a DeSantis pin, tons of DeSantis stuff
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.680]   right up your ass. At our age, we should be four for four on
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.360]   the colonoscopies. We're one for four. They got to get that stat
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.080]   up every week. I want to check in here. Propofol, shout out
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.440]   Michael Jackson is the greatest drug ever. I counted 15 seconds.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.000]   I was knocked out. I woke up. And the next thing I know I was
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.200]   in the recovery area. Were you groggy? I was not groggy. No, I
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.840]   was fine. You literally don't remember anything. No pain, no
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.600]   suffering. I did. How were you able to have a regular schedule
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.040]   the rest of the day? Not really. So I don't want to dissuade
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.800]   anybody from having this. But you do have to take a drink
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.360]   called prep, which clears you out. And when I say clears you
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.800]   out, I love that. Oh, I love it. Yeah, I hit a record low weight.
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.800]   I'm 168. Now. So that was the one benefit. How much weight did
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.000]   you lose? three pounds? Maybe? Come on. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.120]   Were you working when you were prepping? No, I was working when
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.040]   I was prepping. So Monday when I was prepping, but then
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.000]   literally, you take this prep stuff an hour later, you're you
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.120]   need to be ready to evacuate at any time. Normally, the diarrhea
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.840]   is coming out of your mouth. Absolutely. Absolutely.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.640]   Well, there's your call.
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:02:00.280]   All right, everybody, welcome to another amazing sort of the
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.080]   all in podcast episode 148. The docket is absurd. The number of
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.960]   lawsuits and the amount of news that has happened in just the
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.840]   last week has been insane. But we want to at the top of the
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.800]   show, do a quick correction, right? It's an all in
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.480]   correction. If we make a mistake here, we don't hide it in the
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.960]   show notes. We just talk about it right up front. Saks, you
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.040]   were in touch with the air table CEO, Howie Lou, who's been a
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.920]   guest on this week in startups, I'm gonna have him on again,
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.080]   actually soon. Maybe you could just discuss what we got wrong,
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.640]   and how we got it wrong. And then what the correct facts are
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.600]   about air table just quickly here at the top of the show.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.800]   Yeah, well, we had a segment a couple weeks ago, we were
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.720]   talking about these high price late stage unicorn rounds
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.360]   needing to get revalued. And the IPO of Instacart was a good
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.720]   example of this where yes, an IPO did about 10 billion, but
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.360]   the last private round was at 39 billion. So there is a big wave
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.560]   of revaluations or down rounds coming. And we cited some
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.240]   numbers off the internet regarding air table. As it
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.480]   turns out, not everything on the internet is true.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.800]   You're talking about specific journalists might have gotten it
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.240]   wrong.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.560]   We would say this is actually a tweet storm on x that from a
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.400]   financial account that, you know, appeared on the surface
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.200]   to be correct. And in fact, it did have some correct
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.920]   information, but it was outdated. It was stale. So just
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.840]   the quick correction here is that the the amount of ARR that
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.240]   we cited, which I think was around 150 million was accurate
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.160]   as of the time they did the last round, but that was like three
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.000]   years ago. Furthermore, the growth rate that was cited,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.080]   which I think was around 15% that was off that was off by
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.000]   about a three x multiple. So when you put all these things
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.400]   together, I wasn't able to get the exact numbers. But if you
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.600]   just do a little bit of napkin math here, my guess is that air
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:00.200]   table is somewhere in the half a billion of ARR club with pretty
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.640]   decent growth. And if you look at the public comps for that, I
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.520]   think the public comes to be something like a Monday, you
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:14.200]   know, which is doing five to 600 million of ARR coming off a 50%
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.360]   growth rate, maybe forecasting 30% for the next year, that
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.680]   company has been hovering around the seven or $8 billion valuation
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.760]   range. 12x. Yeah, the claim that was made on x was that air table
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.440]   wasn't even worth 1.4 billion that is raised in VC money. I
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.680]   think that's way off. I mean, yeah. And furthermore, you know,
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.240]   what we heard is that air table still has something like two
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.600]   thirds of the money that is raised in the bank. So look, is
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.800]   air table worth the 11 billion that it was valued at at the
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.600]   peak? Probably that's not what the public comps indicate. When
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.480]   I be a buyer, personally at roughly half that price, for
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.360]   sure, for sure. And I think it'll have a nice IPO at some
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.920]   point when they decide they want to do it. So just an important
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.280]   reminder for everybody is, you know, listen, if information is
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.640]   on the interwebs, it may not be correct. But the top news story
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.680]   in the country is unequivocally, Kevin McCarthy being ousted as
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.720]   Speaker of the House on Tuesday, he was voted out in a 216 to 210
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.960]   vote, with eight far right Republicans joining all of the
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:25.040]   Democrats. So those eight GOP members include or led by Matt
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.760]   Gates, obviously a group of I guess what would be best
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:34.560]   described sacks as tea party s members of the GOP contingent,
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.640]   they care mostly about spending and curtailing spending. Am I
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.880]   correct? Don't forget all the Democrats. Well, yeah, I'm
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.840]   putting the Democrats on already counting them. I'm just talking
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.080]   about the eight who made this tip over the media is trying to
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.600]   portray them as these far right, you know, wingers. And I don't
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.760]   think you can actually say that because I don't think Nancy Mace
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.320]   fits in that group. I think she does care about spending, but
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.640]   she's not just like,
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.880]   right to care about spending. I mean, far right to me would be
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.840]   well, that's exactly right. I mean, anything that the media
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.680]   doesn't like they label far right. But I think you know,
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.680]   Nancy Mace is a good example of somebody who is very concerned
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.920]   about spending discipline, but is not like a MAGA type
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:10.600]   Republican.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.520]   But what is the and just to just refine this one more time before
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.640]   I keep going, those eight would the common thread would be
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.240]   control spending we're at we have out of control spending is
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.040]   is the reason we're voting a no vote for Kevin McCarthy.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.200]   I think there were a couple other pieces of this. If you
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.720]   listen to Nancy Mace, some of the other people that were
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.560]   involved here, a lot of the issue comes down to trust. They
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.280]   felt like they could no longer trust Kevin McCarthy, they felt
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.280]   like the things that he had told them in private were not
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.400]   matching up with the things that he would then later do, or that
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.440]   he would say, in public or that he would tell the Biden
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.040]   administration. So I think that main issues were, well, I think
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.320]   there's a couple. One was on spending, he had promised that
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.200]   he would stop doing these giant omnibus spending bills where
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.200]   everything would be lumped into one bill, you get like 24 hours
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.240]   to read it, and then you got to vote up or down on whether you
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.000]   pass this giant spending bill or shut down the government,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.600]   everyone feels forced to vote for it. He had promised to do
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.280]   single subject spending bills.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.200]   So military education, welfare, whatever.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.240]   Yeah, that goes through a regular budget process. So they
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.560]   felt like he had broke his promise on that. I think also
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.560]   on the issue of Ukraine, there were some trust issues there
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.360]   because what he was telling Republicans in private was not
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.280]   what he was telling the Biden administration in private where
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.080]   he was telling the Biden administration, don't worry,
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.480]   we're gonna get the Ukraine funding through. But then he was
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.880]   sounding different notes with various Republicans. And I think
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.720]   his true feelings on the matter came out in this press
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.640]   conference he did after he was ousted, in which he goes on this
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.560]   long rant about how Putin's the second coming of Adolf Hitler.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.080]   And if we don't stop him now, he's going to be you know,
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.280]   marching into Paris. And I mean, it was sort of this like
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:01.320]   unhinged second grade American history style, a view of the
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.560]   war, which regardless of what your view is on it, I think it
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:08.680]   expressed his true feelings on the matter, which is that when
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.440]   push came to shove, he's more hawkish than Joe Biden. On the
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.640]   issue of Ukraine, he feels that Biden has not done enough. It's
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.520]   safe to say that that position is now very out of step with the
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:24.360]   Republican caucus. So he is pushing a view on Ukraine that
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.960]   is now very out of step. Moreover, I think that if he had
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.720]   just acted as an honest broker on the issue, which is to say,
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.600]   Listen, I'm just going to represent the views my caucus,
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.240]   my caucus is divided on the issue, I'm just going to let
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.080]   them have an up or down vote on it, then I think he could have
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.400]   survived on that issue. But instead, again, I think he was
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.640]   trying to manipulate things in a direction of continuing Ukraine
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.760]   funding, regardless of the views of his caucus.
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.600]   Gates wants to end CRS continuing resolutions, those
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.640]   extend the funding deadline from October 1 of holidays, claiming
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.080]   this buys Congress time to lump all those individual promotion
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.240]   bills into the omnibus bill, as you correctly pointed out. Gates
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.480]   wants to end that practice and return to regular order passage
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.800]   of individual annual spending bills, not the omnibus.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.080]   The context that I think is important, that I think is that
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.960]   the American public should understand is, how is this
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.000]   actually supposed to work so that we don't normalize what
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.160]   these CRS are. So the way that it's supposed to work is that
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:27.720]   Congress is authorized by law to create 12 spending bills a year.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:32.200]   And each of those bills have to map to the large parts of the
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.440]   government. So there's a military bill, there's an
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:39.640]   education bill, there's a, you know, HHS bill, etc, etc. And
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.120]   those are supposed to be negotiated on the House floor
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.600]   and passed, the Senate is allowed to do a version of the
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.040]   same. If those two things are different, meaning the Senate
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.320]   doesn't take the house bill and creates their own, the law says
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.560]   that you have to create what's called a conference. And a group
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.120]   of people, half senators and half Congress people sit in a
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.720]   room, hash out and mediate a resolution. And that is what
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.440]   goes to the President's desk to be signed. That's how it used to
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:14.800]   be done. But about a decade ago, all of that broke down. And now
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.880]   what happens is you have this thing that Saks mentioned, which
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:22.200]   is called the CR, which is essentially a backdoor. It's
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.840]   this release valve that is supposed to be a in emergency
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.640]   break glass type measure that has become fundamentally
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:34.040]   normalized. And I think what's important to call out is what
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.600]   happened here isn't getting the just attention because it's
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.800]   being characterized on party lines, and not actually being
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.840]   characterized with how America is legally supposed to work as
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.520]   defined in the Constitution. So the Congress is supposed to pass
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.360]   12 spending bills a year, it's then supposed to get negotiated
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.160]   or approved by the Senate, and then it should go to the
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.080]   President. When you override that with these continuing
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.520]   resolutions. This is the issue that freeberg has been talking
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.280]   about you balloon, the deficit, you balloon the debt, you have
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.400]   all kinds of pork barrel spending, there's zero
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.400]   accountability, the bullets cost $6,000, the umbrella holders
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.080]   cost 15,000. All of this nonsense that just brings us
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.520]   closer and closer to some sort of default or economic
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:23.000]   contagion. So I actually look at this issue, not as Republican
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.920]   versus Democrat, the far right wing, I think that's misguided
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.360]   interpretation by the mainstream media. I think what this is, is
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.400]   the first chance in a while, where you're not allowed to pass
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.920]   a continuing resolution, where you will have to propose 12
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.440]   bills, the way the law says you're supposed to. And what
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.720]   that'll mean is that you'll have to negotiate a compromise to get
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:50.360]   those 12 bills passed. Now, what's crazy is, the Senate
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.840]   actually has six of those bills on their desk, and they haven't
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.680]   even negotiated it. And I think the reason is because they know
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:00.160]   that the CR is always in the offing. But if this continuing
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.440]   resolution is not allowed, because you fired the speaker,
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:08.040]   then they'll have to negotiate those bills. And part of what
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:12.400]   McCarthy did to get elected was say, we will return to the law
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.840]   and not use the in emergency break class. And I think that's
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.840]   what's not, it's not understood. Well, I think by Americans, as
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.040]   that is the actual process. We haven't been doing it for a
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.400]   decade. And I'm not a fan of gates. But I'm glad that
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.160]   somebody did this, because somebody has to draw a line in
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.400]   the sand, the Republicans and Democrats equally have been
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.400]   responsible for breaking the way the American government spends
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.680]   money. And so this is the best way to fix it.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.320]   Freiberg, you agree with what's gone down here and that this is
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:46.080]   worth shutting the government down, etc. Or do you think this
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.760]   is like, where to make the stand? Because you've been very
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:54.040]   pro controlling spending, as I and so do you think that this is
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.600]   the best way to do it? I guess
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.040]   it's more about the United States is facing a fiscal
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.360]   emergency. National debt reported by the Treasury
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.120]   Department increased by $275 billion in a one day report
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:12.360]   yesterday, $275 billion in a day, the entire TARP program
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.400]   during Oh, it was $400 billion. That's how out of control our
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.000]   fiscal condition is. And this is a function of rising rates, a
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.160]   function of spending. And, you know, as we talked about many
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.120]   times over, there's an arithmetic to this, that at
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:29.400]   some point, it becomes ever escalating, until you step in
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.040]   and do something dramatic about it. So I'm hopeful. And I mean,
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.480]   there's a lot of rhetoric, you can watch all the news channels
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.080]   and see a lot of these Congress people get on camera and talk
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:43.800]   about different things. I think we're seeing more frequently now
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.560]   people talking about the fiscal crisis that the US is facing.
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:53.440]   And that this action provides a mechanism, as Chamath points out
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.000]   for forcing everyone to the table to figure out how do we
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.720]   reduce the impact? How do we chart a path to a solution?
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.360]   Because right now, if you asked anyone in Congress, what's the
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.280]   strategic plan here, there is not going to be an answer from
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.720]   anyone. Everyone's got a different point of view. And
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:12.840]   everyone's fighting over the deck chairs on the Titanic. And
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.240]   we've got a more significant problem. We're hitting an
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:20.760]   iceberg. So yeah, I'm hopeful that this causes hopefully a
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:25.800]   turning point in the never ending spending spree, where
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.080]   everyone gets elected, and everyone promises to the folks
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.200]   that they're representing and the folks that funded their
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.160]   political campaigns, some amount of money back out from the
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.480]   government, and everyone gets that free money. And at some
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.160]   point, something's got to turn around, or the whole thing kind
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.040]   of goes down. So hopefully, this is that moment. I don't know
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.200]   sacks eating. By the way, if the government shut down for weeks
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.240]   and months, to try and figure this out, and for everyone to
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.760]   get aligned with here's the long range strategic plan presented
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:56.840]   to the American people on how we prevent the US from either
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:01.560]   inflation or bankruptcy, then I think everyone will feel like it
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.160]   was worth it.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.320]   sacks has been tons of speculation about what this is
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.720]   what's what this is actually about. Is it about Ukraine? Is
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.080]   it about out of control spending? Is it about Matt
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.360]   Gates, and Kevin McCarthy having some sort of personal grudge
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.000]   against each other? What do you what do you think is at the
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.440]   core of this sacks?
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.920]   Well, probably all the above, but I think it's fundamentally a
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.800]   rejection of the status quo. Kevin McCarthy, if nothing else
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.640]   is a figure of the status quo. I mean, he's worked for 20 years
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:30.120]   through the system. He's a great fundraiser. I actually attended
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.080]   an event for him down the street here. Of course, all the donors
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:37.280]   love him. And look, I like Kevin McCarthy, I've contributed to
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.760]   Kevin McCarthy. But at the end of the day, I'm not sure that
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.240]   Kevin McCarthy is a guy who's going to get us out of this
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:48.360]   mess. And the final problem is he's just too conciliatory. And
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:51.080]   the idea that you're going to impose spending discipline and
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.560]   get us out of the budgetary mess that we're in the idea that
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.560]   you're going to make that omelet without breaking a few eggs, I
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:00.720]   think is just kind of silly. So I think we need a tougher
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:04.080]   speaker who's going to actually live up to the promises of
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:07.640]   stopping these ominous bills going back to single subject
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:12.440]   bills, who is going to represent the views of the majority of the
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:16.120]   Republican caucus on, you know, indefinite, infinite Ukraine
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.880]   spending, because he's kind of off center of the Republican
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:19.800]   Party on that.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:24.840]   Why can't the Republican Party be in unison on this is explain
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:28.080]   what the what's the rift inside the the GOP right now?
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.320]   Well, the GOP actually has debates in this party. What you
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.600]   see is the Democrats are in total lockstep, and they just
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:37.120]   support whatever is the status quo. But the Republicans
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.400]   actually have debates inside their party. And there is a big
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:43.240]   debate right now on how we handle Ukraine. And I think
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:47.280]   there is growing opposition to a blank check, as long as it takes
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.280]   policy towards Ukraine, we've already appropriated over 100
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.040]   billion, what's the return on investment of that? The
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:53.560]   counterfeit?
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:57.160]   You think that's the key, not the, the CRS?
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.920]   I think it's both of those issues combined with the fact
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.960]   that increasingly McCarthy was not seen as an honest broker.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.080]   Listen, I think McCarthy could have had whatever views he
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:09.400]   wanted to, if he was perceived as somebody who actually
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:13.560]   represented a majority of the Republican Caucus. But what
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:17.040]   Nancy Mays, what Matt gates, what these others who rebelled
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.520]   were saying is, listen, what Kevin told us is not what he
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:24.440]   did. And I personally witnessed this aspect to McCarthy. Okay,
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.480]   so when I went to this event down the street here, I heard
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.320]   him gave this whole pootler rant. And then afterwards, I
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.040]   came up to him and said, Kevin, what are you talking about? Or
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.080]   do you really want to cause war three, and all of a sudden he
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.400]   backpedaled and he started saying these conciliatory
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.920]   things. And I was like, okay, maybe he just went on this like
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.480]   to where you know, it was kind of off topic.
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:48.240]   He tooted. Did you read to it?
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:53.840]   But after I kind of had this like sidebar with him, I'm like,
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.200]   okay, maybe it's not so bad. Maybe, you know, I think he
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.480]   promised that he would impose
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.920]   saying he's in the pocket of special interests. Let's be
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.560]   clear. Well, I think he
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.840]   well, no, not quite Jason, because he didn't quote to it.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.560]   He's just quoted and he just tweeted.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:12.680]   What I would say is that he was really good in any particular
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:17.640]   meeting at saying conciliatory things to get somebody to like
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:21.480]   him and to get his back is what you're saying. Well, I mean, I
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.560]   think a lot of politicians are. So he told me what I wanted to
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:25.880]   hear. I think he promised that he would
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:29.200]   would you have been with the eight or with the rest? Guys,
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:29.760]   the fundamental
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.680]   concerns with sacks, would you have voted with the eight? Or
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.120]   would you voted with the rest as if you
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.240]   I would have voted with the eight? I mean, even though I
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:40.320]   like, look, I like McCarthy. He's a likable guy. But again,
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.120]   I think that press conference he held revealed the truth of it,
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:47.160]   which is he was BSing me his real view is that we need to
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.280]   support Ukraine for as long as it takes. And he told me
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:50.880]   something different.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.840]   His grand bargain was that he would stop these continuing
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.720]   resolution pork barrel bills. That was the grand bargain. That
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.520]   was the thing that said, and if I don't do it, you guys can vote
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.760]   me out. Do you guys remember this? Yeah, you know, that was
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.720]   his negotiation. So it this really was kind of like a
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.640]   fait accompli the minute he decided to pass and yet another
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.480]   pork barrel bill.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.080]   He also seemed kind of frustrated that he just he seemed
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.280]   like he was spent in dealing with all this. So it's
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.760]   surprising to me is why the Republican Party allowed Matt
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.200]   Gates to get all of the attention and to be like the
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.320]   organizing principle because he's such a loathsome
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.960]   individual to so many people, both in the Republican Party and
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:29.280]   outside. The guy the guy broke a fundamental promise. And that
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.000]   promise wasn't that provocative. It's just like,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.360]   Yeah, we're gonna pass 12 bills, we're just gonna follow the law.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:39.280]   And he couldn't follow the law. And so why doesn't anybody else
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.120]   stand up? Why does it have to take these eight kind of
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.920]   coalescing with with the Dems? It's it's really nutty,
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:47.720]   actually. Yeah, it's a very strange series of events. And by
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.400]   the way, I think you make your last point there, this would
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.600]   not have happened if Hakeem Jeffries didn't send down word
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.040]   that all the Democrats were supposed to vote with Matt
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:01.240]   Gates. I think that this is a vote against their long term
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.160]   interests. Because the fact the matter is that Kevin McCarthy
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:08.080]   ultimately was a very pliant speaker. And he was giving the
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:11.640]   Democrats what they wanted on spending on keeping government
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.720]   funded and open forever at higher and higher rates of
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.480]   spending. And on Ukraine, they're never going to get
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.000]   somebody who is more compliant.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.320]   To your point, I think what what is really interesting and
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:26.000]   hopefully beneficial for America is we've broken the seal on
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.880]   unseating the speaker interterm if they kind of like violate a
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.840]   handful of these defined things. And I hope one of these things
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:39.280]   is the best thing we could do for America is just force all of
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.560]   these folks in Congress to negotiate 12 bills a year. Keep
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:47.120]   them busy, focus on those bills, get to like a compromise, get
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.120]   it to the Senate, get it voted, get it to the President's
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:53.080]   assignment. That's it. If they if they just did that, we would
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.720]   probably spend a third to half of less than we do now.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.360]   This is Gates, the winner in all this to see it look like
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.280]   by the way, just just so you guys know, like when you try to
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.520]   propose elements of a bill, right in one of those real
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:07.640]   bills, okay, it has to go to the CBO and it has to get scored.
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.520]   Right. So for example, we've tried to propose certain aspects
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:14.240]   of legislation. And no matter whatever we think about it,
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:18.680]   there at least is an independent body that scores it and says,
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.720]   here's the x your cost, the y your cost, here's the benefits.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.040]   And so you get a very clear sense and a transparent sense
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:27.480]   that's published everybody about what this is. In CR, you can
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:34.800]   avoid all of that stuff. There is no close study of any of this
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.960]   stuff. And you know, David is right, you get it on a Thursday
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:43.280]   night at like 8pm. And you vote Friday at six, you know, or like
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.160]   at midday. How is anybody supposed to approve a
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.840]   multitrillion dollar package? Logically, you know, it's
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:49.800]   riddled with nonsense.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.440]   And it makes no sense that you don't break up the work and do
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:56.800]   it thoughtfully each time. I guess, should they change this
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:00.320]   ability for one member to propose a resolution to remove
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.880]   the sitting speaker? Yeah,
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:05.040]   it's comically easy to vacate the speaker based on the rules
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.920]   they passed. However, I think it's important to understand why
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.240]   that rule happened. It happened because McCarthy was so
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:14.080]   desperate to become speaker. If you go back to the history of
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.440]   this thing. McCarthy was actually passed over for speaker
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:22.680]   back in 2015. When he made this gaffe on TV about the Benghazi
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.440]   select committee being set up to hurt Hillary's poll numbers.
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.960]   Obviously, that wasn't an admission that helped
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.800]   Republicans. And he only got the job this year, by making it so
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.400]   easy to take it away from him. And remember, they did like 15
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.840]   rounds of voting. So this is the problem. Frankly, one of the
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.240]   problems with McCarthy is he has a little bit too desperate to
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:44.200]   have the job. Sometimes when you get a guy who is so desperate
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.440]   for a job, they're not that effective in it, because they're
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:50.080]   too worried about it being taken away. What you want is a guy
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.600]   who's like, look, take it or leave it. I could do this job or
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.760]   not do this job. That's the only way you're gonna get somebody
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.960]   tough in the job. I think the guy they should look to right
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.400]   now would be Jim Jordan. I think Jim Jordan would be excellent.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:03.560]   Because at the end of the day, you want a speaker who's going
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:07.760]   to be fear not loved, like Nancy Pelosi, quite frankly, you need
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.520]   a Republican speaker who's going to be tough, who doesn't give a
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.280]   shit if you like him or not. I mean, this is I think Kevin's
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:16.600]   downfall is that he cared too much about people liking him. As
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:20.520]   a result, in the room, he would always tell you something that
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:23.440]   you liked. But the problem is that he can't deliver on that.
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.400]   Yeah, so let's get ready to move on to the topic. But just a
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.720]   final question here. Do you guys think a shutdown in a couple of
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.640]   weeks, because that's how long the extension is would be
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:35.200]   productive for the country if it if it becomes the backstop
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.200]   against out of control spending?
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.400]   If it stops the CR process, it'll be effective to the tune
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:44.080]   of above $500 billion. It'll be half a trillion dollars
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:49.080]   effective. So the a couple of weeks of the government not
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.040]   spending money, meaning if you if you kill the omnibus bill,
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:55.960]   yeah. And or you have like an extremely slimmed down version
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.760]   of that bill, and you revert back to this 12 bills a year
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.120]   process, that's supposed to be the law, it'll be more
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.200]   effective. You'd save half a trillion dollars.
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.640]   Yeah, just finish the point on that. I think we have to just
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.360]   look at this Wall Street Journal article that came out this
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.720]   morning, where it was called rising interest rates mean
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.160]   deficits finally matter. Finally, there's a recognition
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.000]   of it. We called it Yeah, finally, there's a recognition,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   both politically and economically that our deficits
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.400]   and debt are too big. And the key point of this article is
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:28.560]   says most of the increase, this is in long term rates, is due to
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.800]   the part of yields called the term premium, which has nothing
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:34.840]   to do with inflation, or short term rates. So until now, our
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.920]   interest rate problems have been about the Fed raising short term
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:41.080]   rates to combat inflation. Now we're seeing a separate problem,
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:44.120]   which is long rates are going up. And the long rates are going
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.640]   up because of this concern that the federal government has too
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:51.080]   much debt. And so bondholders are starting to demand a higher
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:54.840]   long term premium to hold that debt is what we've been warning
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.080]   about for a long time now for a year, and it's finally
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:00.440]   happening. So unless the political system gets serious
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:04.960]   about reducing deficits, even if inflation comes down, and even
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:08.520]   if the Fed cuts short term rates, you're going to have a
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.600]   problem with long term rates remaining high. And that is
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.600]   going to keep the cost of capital high. And that is going
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.480]   to reduce long term innovation in the economy. It's bad for us.
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.080]   It's horrible for us. Yeah, terrible for us.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.640]   Let's go to another troubling situation. What's happening at
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:27.360]   the southern border, obviously, videos of migrants crossing the
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.440]   southern border are all over x Reddit, YouTube, etc. One side
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:35.840]   saying it's chaos, the other side, arguably been ignoring it.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.640]   So let's start with the two numbers that we actually know,
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.800]   put a bunch of time into trying to figure out if there are any
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.400]   accurate numbers, talk to a bunch of people on Twitter and
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:49.240]   other places. There are only we have very, very flawed data on
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.840]   what's actually happening there. We do have anecdotal videos.
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.400]   Obviously, our friend Ilan went down to the border and did a
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:58.240]   video himself. The best data with the caveat that it's very
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:02.480]   flawed is the count of encounters. This is not folks
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:06.800]   who get through. This is folks who were encountered. So this is
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:10.720]   the official Sutherland border encounters from the US Customs
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:15.000]   and Border Protection Agency since 2022 2021. And 2021. There
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.120]   were obviously COVID issues on the border. So it was much more
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:24.000]   locked down half a million people in 2020 1.7 and 2021 2.4
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:29.560]   rounding up there and in 2023 supposedly rounding up 2 million
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.600]   through 10 months tracking our pace for 2.3 the exact same as
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:36.800]   last year. However, it certainly doesn't look like that. It's the
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:40.360]   exact same again, that's from the Border Patrol. And that is
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:45.160]   encounters not actually people who got through and then the
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:48.720]   border states are saying that those numbers are wrong. And
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.760]   there's a lot more people getting through and Eric Adams
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:55.440]   in New York, where a lot of these people are being sent. And
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.800]   this has obviously been the most politicized issue I think of the
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:04.840]   last decade. Governor Abbott, in August of 2022, quote, New York
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:07.400]   City is the ideal destination for these migrants who can
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.160]   receive the abundance of city services and housing that Mayor
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.920]   Adams has posted about within the sanctuary city. Here are the
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.160]   clips and then I'll get your responses from those when we get
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:16.520]   back.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:22.440]   This is horrific when you think about what the governor is doing
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.200]   the governor of Texas, but we are going to set the right
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.720]   message the right tone of being here for these families.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:34.240]   Before we began busing illegal immigrants up to New York, it
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:38.880]   was just Texas and Arizona that bore the brunt of all of the
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:42.320]   chaos and all the problems that come with it. Now the rest of
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:45.520]   America is understanding exactly what is going on.
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:50.240]   All right. So this is obviously something that New York City is
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.400]   unable to handle. Those are from August of last year when this
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.240]   was flaming up. According to Abbott, Texas has given bus
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:01.280]   tickets to 42,000 migrants. And as of late September 119
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.400]   migrants have arrived in New York City since the spring of
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:07.120]   22. About 30% of New York City migrants have been bused in from
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:12.240]   Texas. I'll stop there and just get your general reactions to
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:15.080]   what you all believe is happening at the border since
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.480]   we're getting a highly politicized take on each of
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:21.680]   these, it's become super polarized. And the numbers, any
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.800]   accurate numbers do not exist. Saks.
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.680]   I don't think it's hard to understand what's going on at
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.920]   the border. I think there are people who
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.960]   like that. It's hard to understand the numbers of what's
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.120]   going on. I don't even think the numbers are that hard. You have
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.600]   a better source. And I have some numbers that are similar to
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:42.120]   yours. But so statistic goes back to 2019. So the numbers I
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:46.600]   have are about in 2019, which is when remain in Mexico went into
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:52.200]   effect, the number was 851,000. Then it went down to 400,000
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:57.720]   because of COVID and title 42. Then in 2021, we had about 1.7
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:01.240]   million, which was a new record. Then in 2022, we were up to 2.7
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:04.400]   million, which was a new record. And the question is what is
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:08.320]   happening in 2023. Obviously, we don't have a full year of data.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:12.080]   But given that we've eliminated remain in Mexico, and title 42,
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.120]   I don't think anybody seriously doubts that we're headed for a
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.880]   new record. And in fact, the Washington Post had articles in
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.080]   August and September saying that those months were all time
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:26.080]   records. And now they're surpassing 11,000 daily migrant
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:30.560]   encounters the border just twice last week. So and you know what
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.280]   what Elon reported from the link, he sent that link. So we
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.880]   pull up and then also just news.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:40.000]   Testa is an aggregator. They don't do primary research. So
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.160]   you know, so which one are those numbers are pretty similar to
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:46.680]   to yours, maybe from the same source. We also have the video
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:49.400]   evidence, we have the fact that you know, Elon went down there
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.920]   and reported exactly what we're seeing in other contexts, which
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:55.920]   is new records virtually every day and every week and every
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:00.440]   month. The Border Patrol agents are basically being overrun. And
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:03.520]   so you made the correct point that this only measures
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.840]   encounters, it doesn't measure the actual number of people
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:11.080]   going through. Well, if Border Patrol is overrun, then the
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.920]   number of encounters relative to the real getting through is
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:17.400]   obviously going to be very understated. So I think we're on
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:21.280]   track for another huge record in 2023. And the point is that the
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.240]   pace is accelerating. Elon gave the simple math. There's 8
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.520]   billion people in the world, how many of them would want to be in
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:29.680]   the United States, if they could, probably billions, at
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.520]   least half of them, at least half of them, and I don't blame
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:36.480]   them. Okay, I want to be in this country. Okay, but obviously, we
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.760]   can't handle all the people who want to be here. And the word
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:43.280]   has gone out via social media via word of mouth that the
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:46.960]   border is effectively open. And we've seen numerous videos. It
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:50.640]   wasn't just Elon when RFK went down there to Yuma, Arizona,
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.640]   100 different countries, all in the wall, and people were just
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.160]   lining up and but it was 100 different countries, right? I
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.280]   mean, we have different countries and Elon broadcast the
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:02.400]   exact same thing coming from Eagle Pass. So the point is,
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.440]   you've got all of these different points where there is
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:09.360]   no wall, and people are just lining up and being let through.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:13.000]   And in some cases, they're just running through because the
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.760]   border patrols is overrun. So we effectively have no border. I
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.480]   mean, let's admit the truth now. Yeah. And I think that the
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:23.560]   mainstream media and the Biden administration, their policy was
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:26.680]   basically see no evil, hear no evil and to deny the reality of
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.960]   what was happening. Eric Adams was one of the first democrats
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:35.400]   to break rank saying, Listen, we can see the migrants lining up
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:38.800]   in tents going around the block. We are trying to put them up in
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:42.400]   hotels is costing us $12 billion. We can't afford it. But
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.600]   Eric Adams has always been a little bit of a maverick inside
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:47.640]   the Democratic Party. We talked about how he was tough on crime
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.740]   during the chase of Boudin era, which is why I supported as a
[00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:53.800]   moderate, but it was a moderate. But then you had Kathy Hockel,
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:57.680]   who's the governor of New York, who's nothing if not a machine
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:01.160]   politician, just in the last week saying we cannot handle
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:05.040]   this. So she broke ranks, which was I think, a big news story.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:09.240]   And now the latest is that the Biden administration itself
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:12.480]   might be breaking ranks. I think Chamath you posted a really
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:15.920]   interesting story that may orcas who's the Secretary of DHS
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:20.000]   just posted a notice in the Federal Register, which said
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.560]   there is presently an acute and immediate need to construct
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:26.400]   physical barriers and roads in the vicinity of the border.
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.560]   That was a wall.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.840]   I just wanted to prevent unlawful entries in the United
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.600]   States. Now there was no press conference on this. The way that
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.920]   this got reported is some reporter was doing their job
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:41.640]   keeping track of the Federal Register and saw that may orcas
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:46.800]   had posted a notice saying that they need to construct a wall.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.720]   Now Biden hasn't said this. No one in the administration said
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:50.120]   this, but
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.600]   obvious reasons. Yeah.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.960]   For obvious reasons. So
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.240]   Jason, what do you think the obvious reason is? Well, the
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:59.880]   obvious reason is Trump's entire presidency was predicated on
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.760]   Hey, we're going to build this wall. And but I'm saying go back
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.640]   and say that he was right is untenable to
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.920]   national security. It's like,
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:10.680]   yes. And so they're going to do the right thing, obviously, and
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.720]   build the wall, but they don't want to say it. So it's just
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.600]   ridiculous. But just one important point to what David
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.000]   said, New York City has the right to shelter. So that means
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.520]   every immigrant who comes there, they have to put them in a hotel
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:24.160]   and these are like, turns out four or $500 a night hotels. So
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.560]   this has become cataclysmic, there obviously needs to be a
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.760]   border. And it's ridiculous to say there shouldn't be a border.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.040]   Nobody believes that I don't know why this administration
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:34.920]   just can't admit that there needs to be a border of some
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.880]   kind. And we can talk about what the wall
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.920]   Well, no, actually, it's a better solution than a wall, but
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.480]   we'll get to that. What is it?
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:44.840]   Well, I don't want to jump to my he had something to say. So
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.760]   tomorrow, I'll explain in a second, if you want, or I can
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:50.040]   jump to it. No, jump to jump to it. Okay. So obviously, people
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.160]   are talking about a wall walls are a terrible solution. Because
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:56.000]   there are ladders that can go over them pretty easily. What
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.040]   you really need to have his eyes on it. And the two best
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:01.840]   solutions, you can see them here, Israel has had a really,
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:05.880]   they understand borders really well. And so what you're seeing,
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:10.080]   if you're watching are these towers, which do a great job of
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:13.280]   monitoring the border. And you could put about 2000 of these
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:17.280]   towers, they have a range of easily a mile. This is next gen
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:21.280]   border by EBIT systems is a rally based company. It's 160
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:24.600]   foot surveillance tower. Andrew actually has a century tower as
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:28.640]   well. Our friend, friend of the pod, Palmer Lucky's company,
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:32.960]   Andrew, and obviously, I would the the border patrol already
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.200]   has 10 of the towers.
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:38.040]   Why do you see as an either or I'm just curious, like, why
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:38.360]   would you?
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:42.920]   I think that these smart lampposts, as I call them, are
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:45.200]   the number one first thing to do, because you could deploy
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:49.000]   these in a fraction of the time, you could have 2000 of these in
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.440]   under a year for $4 billion. And so these only cost $2 million
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:57.240]   each. The 10 towers that were put in, we're putting a 26
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:00.760]   million in the pilot. So if you put 2000 of these towers in, you
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:02.840]   just picked four different vendors, so they do 500 each and
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.960]   you test them, that would be $4 billion. That would be nothing.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:09.880]   What do you do when you when the camera spots a person you send
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:12.440]   intercepts there, and then you build the walls where people are
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.040]   crossing most. So that would be my
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:16.560]   crossing most, they're crossing
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.480]   obviously, you build what you look for hotspots, David, so you
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.640]   would you but we don't there's hotspots that we don't know
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:24.000]   about. So I'd say you deploy these for 4 billion very
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   quickly. And then where there are hotspots, you obviously
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.440]   build walls, but you're still gonna be frank about this. Sure.
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:32.760]   Be as frank as you like. Look, regardless of what you think
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:36.440]   about Trump, this may orcas revelation completely and
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:40.280]   utterly vindicates his approach to wanting to build a wall. And
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:43.920]   there's so many people who won't just admit that he was right that
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:47.120]   we need a strong border wall, not because it's perfect. Not
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.640]   because you can't climb over it if you have the right tools, but
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:53.360]   because a wall is more defensible than an open field.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.960]   Now, look, I'm all in favor of these towers and the cameras.
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.720]   And my understanding is that a lot of the parts of Trump's wall
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.640]   did have cameras on them. Yeah, no, he gets credit for it is
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:05.880]   that you have video now coming out of 1000s of people streaming
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:09.480]   across running the word is you need a wall to stop that you
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:12.440]   also then need cameras and border guards and all the rest
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.760]   of it just so you know, 2000 miles of wall is going to be
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:18.760]   like a decade long project. So that's my only point. Okay, it's
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:22.400]   only a decade long. If you allow all of these core challenges
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.880]   that are designed to frustrate it. The fact of the matter is,
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.880]   look, we don't need 2000 miles of wall because there are a lot
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.160]   of natural barriers along the border, you know, where you have
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.440]   deep rivers or mountains or whatever, we're not gonna need
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:36.080]   the wall. However, there are pieces of the wall that were
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.760]   literally laying on the ground. They were unfinished from
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.080]   Trump's term. By the way, Trump should have gotten that done. He
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.920]   didn't, in any event, whatever. The point is, the Biden
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.600]   administration was actually selling those pieces of wall for
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:50.040]   scrap metal for two cents on the dollar. This was a story that
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.800]   came out. Now they're admitting that we need the wall. That was
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.920]   pure politics. That makes no sense. They had the construction
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.760]   materials. They should have just finished it.
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:02.680]   That is kind of ridiculous. Yeah, that's utterly ridiculous.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:06.280]   That's like crazy. It's because the American government didn't
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:10.400]   like who said the right thing. Yeah. And the tone in which he
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:14.600]   said it. Yes. And they didn't like the separating of children
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:17.040]   from whatever and they politicize that both parties are
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:23.000]   equally just gross. It should be a point based system, you lock
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.880]   the border, and you allow people in, you know, as I've said, 10
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:30.200]   times on this podcast based on merit, what they're going to
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.840]   contribute to our society, that's work, that's recruitment,
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:36.520]   some amount of people who are need asylum, because they're
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.000]   going to be murdered, ie Afghanistan, people who
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.080]   supported us, Afghanis who supported us during the war. And
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.400]   then finally, the ordering process of people applying to
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:48.240]   come in here. Do your jobs, everybody. Please, Nick. What
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:50.160]   happens when you get to the border, guys? Do you just get
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.360]   admitted to America?
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:56.760]   Guys, this is insane. Okay. The Biden administration started
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:02.400]   auctioning off what they called spare border wall parts. Okay. I
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.800]   mean, how does Biden live this down? I think it's the cost of
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.000]   the election. Yeah, you're 100% right about that. Yeah, I think
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.720]   this is like, this is a setup for a very bad ad. Absolutely.
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:13.200]   Yeah. I mean, I think this is just because it's become so
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:18.960]   politicized. Point based system, recruitment over chaos, build a
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.800]   wall build a tower.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:24.000]   What do you do in the meantime, there, there are 10s of
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.680]   thousands of people a day hitting the southern border
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:28.560]   National Guard, we have something called the National
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.720]   Guard, we send them there, they have to be deployed anyway, you
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:34.000]   just deploy the National Guard. But same more, same more, like
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.600]   you would put the military to basically turn these people
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.920]   around. Of course, of course, you turn them around. Yes,
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:41.680]   that's it. Well, so you build a wall, your National Guard will
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:44.040]   be quickest, the towers we second quick quickest and the
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.680]   wall is going to take forever, but you need a while. How do
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:48.640]   you but how do you process the asylum claim? Because isn't the
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:51.240]   whole point of asylum? Like, you can't send them back to this
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:54.520]   country in which they're going to be killed in. And so it's an
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.960]   imperfect process, Chamath, obviously. So Saks and I and a
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:01.360]   few other folks, we held a fundraiser for Vivek Ramaswamy
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:04.160]   last week. And we talked about this a lot. And one of the
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:07.720]   things that we learned is that all the people that come to the
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:10.880]   southern border are trained in YouTube and Tick Tock and
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:15.200]   Instagram, exactly what to say so that you have to accept the
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:18.360]   asylum claim. And so the asylum, there should be a limited number
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.080]   of them. That's it. Just you have this many per year. But you
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:24.000]   don't I understand. But but you don't know whether that person
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.400]   who was helping us in Afghanistan ends up coming in
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:30.080]   October and not in March. And that's the reason why they can't
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:34.480]   get in. The thing that I learned is that it's a it's a specific
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:37.240]   script. It's available in multiple languages, right? So
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.280]   anybody who gets to the southern border knows exactly what to say
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.720]   so that America is forced to accept you.
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.280]   That's not how asylum should work.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.720]   The bad news is not everybody's gonna get in. Not everybody will
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.400]   get in. That's it.
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:50.240]   Jake out. There's two things we need to do in addition to your
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:52.800]   point about sending troops to the border, because we do need
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.120]   the manpower. Yeah, it's obvious. Number one, to Chamath's
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.920]   point, you can't just say the word asylum and get in. That
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:01.640]   doesn't make sense. You should have to produce evidence of
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:06.000]   actually meeting the case for asylum, which is not being
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.920]   economically disadvantaged. It's being politically
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:11.000]   prosecuted, where if you're sent back to your home country,
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.160]   they're going to put you in jail or kill you. And there aren't
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:17.680]   many countries in the world, quite frankly, where that is
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.160]   going to be a valid claim, just to be honest about it. I mean,
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:23.840]   if you have a freedom fighter from Iran coming over, who's
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:26.360]   going to be put in jail or killed, let them in. But that's
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.160]   not most of the people lining up at our border.
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:31.000]   If you're coming from Mexico, there's a very small chance that
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:31.920]   you are being
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:34.360]   the other thing we've got to do is you got to reinstitute
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:39.080]   remain in Mexico. That was the policy. Yeah. You can't just
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:40.720]   waiting on this side of the border because they're never
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.280]   going to show up in court. Yeah.
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:45.480]   I mean, listen, we, we want immigration to this country. It
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:48.120]   has to be logical. And the fact is, everybody wants to come
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:51.200]   here. That's a great thing. We should be taking advantage of
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:54.560]   that. But it can't be chaos. It's got to be orderly. That's
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.560]   what everybody wants. I don't know why how this became a
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:59.680]   political issue. Everybody wants orderly. Everybody wants
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.520]   recruitment. Nobody wants an open
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:04.000]   border. But Jake, in order for it not to be a political issue,
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.680]   you need both parties to agree and they currently don't. I mean,
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:09.360]   think about it. What's in Biden's interest right now is to
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:11.360]   do a 180 on this issue before it's too late.
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:13.960]   He's got to do it. Yes, absolutely. And it's very simple
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.480]   for him to say, which is but he hasn't done it because everybody
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:20.200]   knows that the border doesn't have a wall. We've seen an
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:23.360]   increase, there's been a 10x increase, this the situation on
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.720]   the field has changed. Therefore, we're going to change.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.880]   And we're going to do all these things. And if one of them is
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:30.600]   building a wall, and you want to say gotcha, you can say gotcha.
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:34.200]   But it's the right thing to do. Because data has changed my
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:37.000]   opinion. Where do we get to the point where data can't change
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.160]   your opinion? Data should change your opinion, the data is clear
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.920]   that more people are coming through. That's why I made such
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.880]   a point at the top of this is like, we don't even have good
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:48.000]   data. But these sensor towers would do would at least give us
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.520]   data. And we give us clarity. And then you only need, you
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:56.200]   know, a unit every half mile. So you need 4000 units patrolling
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.920]   the border, and they would catch everybody. It this isn't as
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:03.480]   expensive as people think it is. This could be I mean, the last
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:05.920]   the last amount of money we gave, what was the last
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:08.600]   appropriation for Ukraine, SAC since I'll give you a red
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:09.100]   meal?
[00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:12.600]   Well, we've already appropriated or authorized over
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:16.280]   close to 100 million. And there's 24 billion.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.800]   Okay, so for three or 4% of that cost, we could have the sensor
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:20.920]   towers. It's crazy.
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:22.720]   We're defending Ukraine's border, but not our own.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:24.520]   It's a very valid point. Independent.
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:29.120]   The populist Republicans up in arms. It's this combined with
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:31.200]   the the lack of fiscal discipline.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:34.040]   Now, the craziness about this is if we were sitting here 20
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:36.960]   years ago, the republicans were trying to open the border to
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:41.320]   have more low skilled workers to work in restaurants to work in
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.480]   businesses. That's not the place we are today. We have too many
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.960]   people coming in. These are not just
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:46.800]   it's even worse.
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:50.400]   skilled workers to pick vegetables. It's a different
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:50.880]   group.
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:53.960]   There was a point in time, Jason, where the Wall Street
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:56.760]   Journal editorial page, which is really the voice of the GOP
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:00.280]   establishment, yes, supported a constitutional amendment in
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:04.320]   favor of an open border. This was very much the point of view
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:08.240]   of the old Republican Party, which was this libertarian, open
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:13.040]   borders, open trade free markets position. And the results of
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:16.720]   those policies have been partially disastrous. I mean, I
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:19.320]   understand the value of free trade and so forth. But and
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:21.160]   obviously want to have high skilled immigration. We've
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:24.360]   talked about that. But it was too much of a good thing. I
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:27.360]   mean, they didn't draw intelligent distinctions. But we
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:30.840]   still have I think this to your point about the battle inside
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:33.600]   the Republican Party. We still have that old GOP
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:36.280]   establishment. And now there's this new populist wing that
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.520]   wants to make, I think, sensible changes.
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:42.440]   Here's the Wall Street Journal story from 2001. Open after
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:43.200]   borders. Why not?
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:48.320]   There it is. Yeah, that was Bob Bartley, who was the longtime
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.480]   editorial page editor. He was kind of like a hero in the
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:53.000]   conservative movement. When I was in college, I read a great
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.440]   book by him called the seven fat years about supply side
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.760]   economics. And I think he was right about a lot of that stuff.
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:03.200]   But along with that economic policy came, I think this open
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:08.120]   borders, completely open trade view that I think produced a lot
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:11.080]   of negative results and has to be revisited. And by the way,
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:13.880]   there's a third leg of that stool, which is forever worse.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:17.600]   The Wall Street Journal is one of the most pro Ukraine
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:21.720]   publications there is both in the news pages and in the
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:26.800]   editorial page. And they have never revisited the results of
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:29.120]   our disastrous foreign policy where we keep intervening all
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:32.960]   over the world. This is the old Republican Party. There's a new
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:36.520]   Republican Party that is emerging. And unfortunately,
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:39.840]   Kevin McCarthy found himself on the wrong side of that divide.
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:42.400]   Alright, so moving on to our next topic, there was a notable
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:47.040]   accident with a cruise robo taxi in San Francisco this week or
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:51.880]   not. This is being framed by some as the first automated
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:54.440]   cruise vehicle to get in an accident. But what actually
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:58.800]   happened is not accurate. So there was a hit and run incident
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:02.120]   in San Francisco when we were struck by a human driver, that
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:05.720]   human driver fled the scene. The hit and run launched tragically
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:08.280]   the woman underneath a cruise vehicle, the cruise vehicle
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:11.200]   braked aggressively according to cruise but stopped with its rear
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:14.880]   tire on top of the woman's leg. Police asked crews to keep the
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:19.360]   vehicle in place and lock it which they did. Emergency
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:23.760]   respondents arrived and use the jaws of life to get the car off
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:26.680]   the woman's leg. Local media picked the story up.
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:31.400]   And the way the police asked crews to leave the car leave the
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:32.760]   car on the woman's leg.
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:40.320]   Yes. I do that. Well, I think actually, sometimes. No, no, I
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:43.680]   do think for my time as an EMT, sometimes moving the person can
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:46.360]   cause more damage than leaving it until you have the emergency
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:49.680]   services on the scene. So they like to wait for emergency
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:52.880]   services in LA because moving it because they could have a broken
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:56.400]   bone hit your firm femoral artery, and then you could bleed
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:58.400]   out. So they just say stay where you are. Don't make any more
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.280]   movements until
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:02.520]   dude, car on top of them. That's ridiculous.
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:05.960]   It's on the person's leg. So that would mean that they're not
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:09.360]   in any danger, it might be painful. But if you were to move
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:12.320]   them, I was taught this when I was an EMT, you if you move
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:14.160]   people, you have to be very careful because you could cause
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:16.600]   a spine injury, they can become paralyzed, or you could cut a
[00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:18.040]   major artery, you got to be very
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:19.400]   how long were you an EMT?
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:22.440]   I was the first class of what was called EMT frs first
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:26.120]   responders. And I worked at Bravo ambulance in Brooklyn as
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:27.920]   on a volunteer one for about three or four years.
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:30.840]   Did you have like a tight outfit like a tight polo? What do you
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:33.520]   wear? Skinny jeans? Just skinny
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:38.280]   jeans, green pants and a white collared shirt. And yeah, I
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:41.600]   never told you guys the first call I ever got. I never told
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:43.800]   you that story. Were you like, were you like a sexy paramedic?
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:44.920]   Or were you just like a pair of
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:47.760]   me whatever you want me to be sure. Whatever works for your
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:48.400]   fantasies.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.320]   He's blushing.
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:53.280]   My first call you're a sexy paramedic. I was a little sexy
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.760]   as a paramedic got him blushing.
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:57.240]   Here's my first call. I swear to God, it's a night before
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:59.600]   Thanksgiving Wednesday night. It's a big night in Brooklyn. I
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.120]   don't know if in other places, but the night before
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:03.440]   Thanksgiving, everybody goes out and parties. So big Wednesday
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:06.520]   happens. First call comes in. I was I was originally the person
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:09.520]   who picked up the I was the operator at the 911. But then my
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:13.960]   second job I was on the bus. And so first call first shift is big
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:18.040]   Wednesday guy gets we get a call that a guy got stabbed. We go.
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:22.320]   The guy is outside TJ Bentley's and I kid you not the guy was in
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:24.800]   charge of the ambulance says cut the jacket off. I take my
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:27.640]   shears. We have these really sharp scissors and boom, we go
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:30.920]   right up the sleeve we cut his jacket. He goes Oh, my members
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:37.440]   only jacket. We cut him open. And his giant hairy chest. Blood
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:41.680]   is pumping out like it's like a little water fountain. And the
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:44.360]   the guy who was running the bus I remember was I just he puts his
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:47.040]   hand up out there shows this guy. You got bigger problems in
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:50.000]   this member only jacket. He says get the mast pants the mast
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.200]   pants just so you know are used in war. We get trained in them.
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:56.080]   You never use them. mast pants are a blood pressure cuff you
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:58.600]   put over people's pants. Oh yeah, take the blood in their
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:01.400]   legs. You put it into their chest so that they at least
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:04.840]   survive. The guy says get the mess but I said get the mass
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:07.760]   pants. The mass pants are packed away. You never use them. I'm
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:11.880]   getting the mass pans out. We're whaling down Fourth Avenue to
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:14.600]   get this guy and his blood pressure dropping his heart
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:17.240]   rates dropping blood all over the bus. We're trying to control
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:19.880]   the bleeding. He survived. You save him. We saved him. Yeah,
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:24.240]   but that was my first call. First call. Nuts. This was a
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:28.120]   volunteer gig. I volunteer paid for it. Nope. Not everything's
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.000]   about money. Freebird. Not everything's about money.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.480]   Freebird. I'm not saying it is. I'm just asking. I'm joking.
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:37.200]   With you. Yeah, I want to be a superhero. Yeah. That's all I
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:42.320]   texted. I texted Jamie. Jason's brother and I asked him if this
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:46.480]   was true. And I asked for a photo. Hey, Nick, you want to
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:49.280]   you want to put up the photo? No, please. Oh, there I am.
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:54.760]   Heart stops. This is the guy you want to come restart.
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:49:00.160]   Did your heart stop? Did your heart stop? I'm gonna
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:03.760]   resuscitate it. Nick show the other one. This is the original
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.120]   outfit that when he became a paramedic. No, this better not
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:10.080]   be x rated. Oh, God. Oh, there. I like the second one better.
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:12.280]   Yeah, we know which one you like better days.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:16.120]   A nurse is that a thermometer he's got? What does he have in
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:16.400]   his hand?
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:16.880]   Needle?
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:21.120]   thermometer. I think that's like a coke bottle. I think that
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:23.400]   could be a thermometer. We might need to check your temperature.
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:26.160]   David. It's like a Pepsi bottle. What the hell? We're gonna take
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:27.520]   your temperature, Dave. I don't know.
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:30.200]   This would be what kind of temperature does that take for
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:30.360]   you?
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:33.360]   Well, I know it's gonna be really hot.
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:35.920]   Oh, Jason, you did a great job.
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:40.160]   We really, really appreciate your contributions. Wow. Great
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:43.800]   job. All right. Back to the story about cruise. This
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:47.680]   terrible accident. Wow, we got derailed. Yeah. Well, thanks for
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:50.240]   the work you did. J. Cal. Thanks for your service. Okay, so
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:55.960]   I'm gonna take your vitals.
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:00.520]   Okay, local media picked up your eagle tattoo on your arm, too.
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:03.880]   That was that was removable. local media picked up on this
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:06.760]   reporting that cruise was responsible for the incident.
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:10.760]   Director of News for the San Francisco Chronicle, which is a
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:15.440]   lunatic publication. Woman run over by cruise self driving car
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:19.360]   on Market Street in downtown San Francisco, pulled from under
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:23.680]   rear axle circumstances under investigation. The San Francisco
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:26.960]   standard posted on x a woman suffered traumatic injuries
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:31.240]   after being trapped under a cruise robo taxi in downtown San
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:34.720]   Francisco Monday night. Fire Department spokesperson said a
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:38.400]   few weeks ago, as you know, a video circulated on x formerly
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:41.800]   known as Twitter of 20 or so cruise vehicles causing a
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:46.200]   massive traffic jam at an intersection in Austin. The
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:51.680]   robo taxi provider issue has become very divisive here in San
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:55.560]   Francisco. There are now multiple companies working on
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:59.320]   sure that a mutual in San Francisco will put pilot on it.
[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:03.120]   They call it to brick the car. Yeah, yeah. Why would they do
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:06.200]   that? Because they're lunatics. And it represents technology.
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:10.120]   That's the real story here. The real story is the very deep
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:13.720]   disdain for technological progress. And the second story I
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:18.480]   think that's so important is the total lack of assumption of risk
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:22.760]   generally in the US which limits progress in meaningful ways. Let
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:25.480]   me just pull up some data that I shared here. So Nick, if you
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:28.920]   pull up this first chart, I'll give you guys some some numbers.
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:32.360]   For every 100 million miles driven in the US, there's about
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:35.600]   one and a half deaths car accident deaths. There's about
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:39.360]   3.2 trillion miles driven per year in the US. So about 45,000
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:42.080]   people die from auto accidents each year. This is a crazy
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:48.480]   number 2.3 million people have auto accident related injuries
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:52.840]   in the US each year. And there's 6 million car crashes each year
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:56.440]   in the US. That's one crash for every half million miles driven.
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:52:00.280]   Pretty, you know, incredible statistics. So if you look at
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:04.040]   this chart, it kind of shows the car fatalities over time. Now,
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:07.040]   what's the leading cause of car fatalities will go to the next
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:10.800]   distracted driving. Number one, I should have I should have done
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:12.840]   this as a quiz. Number one DUI.
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:17.160]   Jesus, that is unbelievable that even this day.
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:21.360]   Yeah. Number two, speeding. Number three, not using your
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:24.760]   seatbelt. So by the way, all three of those are the same.
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:29.840]   Yeah, also 80% of those 80% of deaths are DUI speeding and
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:32.760]   seatbelt non use. Now go to an autonomous
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:34.440]   driver. Those are all opt in.
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:37.160]   So now go to an autonomous driving world. You won't see
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:40.040]   DUI is those things are programmed to not speed.
[00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:41.880]   Obviously, they're not going to run if you don't put your
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:44.600]   seatbelt on. And then the fourth one is distracted driving. The
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:47.760]   real question is what incremental accidents or what
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:51.880]   incremental errors to autonomous cars make that might, you know,
[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:56.280]   kind of cause new deaths or new accidents. But the net is that
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:59.360]   we have an incredible number of car accidents, 6 million
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:02.760]   accidents a year, two and a half million injuries a year 45,000
[00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:06.320]   deaths a year, most of which can be prevented by things that are
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:09.800]   just basic human stupidity. The first three are all opt in. So
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:13.440]   what you're saying is Warren Buffett and Geico are probably
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:16.080]   responsible for lobbying and creating this mess in San
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:19.640]   Francisco. Do the insurance companies need to exist a
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:22.360]   chamat? conspiracy corner?
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:25.280]   Well, I actually think there's a very different driver for why
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:28.000]   these things so I just want to make the case first off, that if
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   you if you zoom out and you don't take the anecdotal story
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.640]   of the woman trapped under the cruise car, it's an awful story.
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:37.720]   But that anecdote allows people to heighten their fear and
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:41.240]   heighten their emotion and create a response to autonomous
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:44.840]   driving as if that is a cause of a problem. So if you zoom out
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:47.840]   and you ask the question, dude, 50,000 people a year are dying
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:50.680]   because of human stupidity that we can just completely take off
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:54.200]   the streets. It's such a no brainer, that this technology
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:57.840]   should progress. And I'll give you guys another story in 1999.
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:02.160]   There was the clinical trials for gene therapy had begun. And
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:05.480]   there was a guy named Gelsinger. He was a young kid, I think he
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:08.880]   was 18 or 19 years old, and he passed away from the gene
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:12.320]   therapy. And it turns out that there was actually Dr. malpractice
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:16.760]   that was primarily responsible for his death. After that
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:19.880]   happened, the FDA and the regulators stepped in, and they
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:22.840]   basically put a halt to all gene therapy clinical trials for
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:27.120]   about seven years. The number of lives that were lost during that
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:29.680]   seven years that went on that we did not make progress on getting
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:34.920]   gene therapy programs to market is significantly higher than the
[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:37.240]   number of people that would have lost lives, which by the way, it
[00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:41.160]   turns out when you go back to this, this particular death was
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:44.720]   driven by Dr. malpractice, not by the gene therapy technology
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:47.880]   necessarily itself. And a lot of the stuff was understood. And I
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:50.400]   think we've heard Peter Thiel and others speak a lot about how
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:55.080]   the US has lost our appetite for risk. We say that if anyone dies
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:57.840]   or if any bad thing happens, a new technology should not
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:01.400]   progress. But when we look at the benefit of new technology
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:04.560]   relative to the cost of it, many of these technologies should
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:07.880]   progress at an accelerated pace, not at a decelerated pace and
[00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:10.520]   the stepping in to stop these things from moving forward
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:13.320]   because number one, we're really afraid of new technology.
[00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:15.840]   Number two, we you know, we kind of want to there's a lot of
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:18.440]   regulatory capture and incumbency that wants to see
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:21.320]   these things not succeed. I think we're really denying
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:25.520]   ourselves in many cases, the opportunity to realize progress
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:28.920]   because we're so concerned about any loss. nuclear fission is a
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:32.280]   really great example of this three mile island accident and
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:35.040]   Fukushima. You know, if you look at the total number of lives
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.640]   lost, and there's incredible statistics, which I should
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:39.840]   probably not pull off the top of my head, I should probably make
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:42.200]   sure I get the right numbers. But Chernobyl is another good
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:44.040]   example. If you look at the total number of incremental
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.640]   cancers, and the total number of lives that were lost from
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:48.680]   Chernobyl, you look at three mile island, you look at
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:52.760]   Fukushima, you can actually six, you can you can make a
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:56.760]   statistical argument that even with those extraordinary
[00:55:56.760 --> 00:56:00.280]   cataclysmic disasters, the number of lives that could have
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:02.840]   been improved the number of lives that could have been saved
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:05.440]   the progress that people have been could have been could have
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:07.800]   made the number of people that could have been pulled out of
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:11.200]   poverty if we made cheap, abundant energy available at an
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:14.280]   accelerated pace rather than at a decelerated pace, it could have
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:16.760]   had a much more significant effect. So I view this in the
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:19.640]   lens, this autonomous driving backlash in the lens of what we
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:22.440]   see with a lot of new technologies, which is we lose
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:25.720]   our appetite for risk, we lose our tolerance for any sort of
[00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:29.240]   incremental loss. And we lose perspective on the fact that
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:33.880]   that loss is far, far, far outweighed relative to the gains
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:36.080]   that you gain if you can get that technology into market
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:40.480]   faster, not slower. And I think that's just such a real kind of
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:44.040]   storyline that's not told very often about how technology and
[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:46.600]   progress is limited, particularly in the modern age,
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:48.120]   because once you have enough stuff, you're not willing to
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:51.320]   take as much risk. Meanwhile, you see China building 450
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:55.040]   nuclear fission stations, and the US building none. And I think
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:59.920]   that that's part of the story of where the US is today. Yeah, I
[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:02.040]   mean, I know that was a big rant. But for me, I'm just like
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:05.000]   so sensitive to this stuff, you know, like, all of this like
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.240]   anti tech stuff and anti progress stuff, because you then
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:11.000]   pick an anecdote and you focus on the anecdote and you miss the
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   bigger fucking picture.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   Well, what's so funny about San Francisco is this, it's the city
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:19.080]   that both is the first to approve the testing of it. And
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:22.760]   then where there's a small fraction of citizens who try to
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:26.040]   go and sabotage it, I guess the next issue is how close are we
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:30.240]   to having these at scale cruises currently in San Francisco,
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:34.920]   Austin and Phoenix, waymo. Very expensive cars, by the way.
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:38.240]   They're currently in San Francisco and Phoenix 24 seven
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:42.200]   and launch in LA soon. And Tesla has been working on this. You
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:46.080]   know, it's another example of this SpaceX, some shrapnel got
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:50.680]   blown into the uninhabited desert lands around Boca Chica
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:53.840]   Texas. You're talking about Starship? Yeah, Starship. The
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:56.840]   big one. Yeah. And they come in and they're like, shut the whole
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:59.840]   thing down. You can't have shrapnel flying around. Think
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:02.800]   about the risk tolerance equation here. So if you delay
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:07.240]   SpaceX by six months, to make sure that shrapnel doesn't fly
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:11.720]   through the desert, that's six months longer till humans can
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:16.840]   perhaps inhabit the moon, go to Mars, do all these extraordinary
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:19.840]   things. This is what I mean about the lack of tolerance for
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:23.400]   risk. We have to assume that there is a cost in moving things
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:26.720]   forward, there has to be a cost in progress. You don't go fight
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:30.440]   a war and try and move the front lines of a battlefield further
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:33.120]   into the enemy territory and assume you're going to have no
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:36.800]   loss. And all of human progress needs to be thought about in a
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:39.840]   similar way, we have to have some degree of loss and some
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:43.720]   tolerance for risk as we try and make progress with our species.
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:46.800]   And technology always is going to have setbacks, it's always
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:50.160]   going to have mistakes. But if the net benefit far outweighs
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:53.360]   those mistakes, we have to be willing to accept it and gets
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:56.240]   everyone to kind of take a broader perspective on what
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:59.200]   we're doing, that this isn't just about maintaining status
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:02.160]   quo and not getting hurt. This is about the great benefits we
[00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:05.480]   get from moving things forward. And we've lost that in such a
[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:09.120]   profound way over the last 50 years in Western culture.
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:13.880]   Another great example of this to add to your tirade is challenge
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:17.280]   trials. And these have been banned for a long time. And if
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:19.280]   you don't know what a challenge trial is, is you introduce
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:22.440]   something like let's say COVID into a person who has had a
[00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:25.960]   COVID vaccine. And yeah, they're assuming some risk in doing
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:28.360]   this, but it was a young person, as we saw probably wouldn't be
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:30.600]   that much risk. And there are people who would do it. And
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:34.240]   there are this whole concept of challenge trials could reduce in
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:37.240]   the long term, a massive amount of debts, but it's not allowed
[00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:40.920]   because of ethics issues. What are your thoughts on that
[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:42.440]   freebird challenge trials?
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:45.440]   I mean, it's look, there's so many examples, we could just
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:48.320]   keep going through this and from energy markets and nuclear
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:52.840]   technology to biotechnology to space technology to I've lived
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:56.200]   it. I mean, like GMO technology and bioengineering and food
[00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:59.600]   systems, there's a fear and a concern and like Rob Henderson
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.400]   said at our summit, I've always viewed those to be luxury
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:05.880]   beliefs, that this idea that I don't want to have my precious
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:09.720]   things changed, when the benefit really accrues mostly to the
[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:12.400]   poorest people in the world, that people that can't afford
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.400]   is by the way, because that's an important point that people
[01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:18.640]   don't realize, when you make things more productive, whether
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:22.600]   it's an acre of land to make more food, or a unit of energy
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:25.600]   and the cost comes down per unit of energy. Those of us who
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:28.720]   already have a lot of stuff and have all of our basic needs met
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:30.600]   we have housing, we have shelter, we have food, we have
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:33.280]   energy, we can afford it, we live in a great environment, we
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:35.440]   live in a place that we can do whatever the heck we want,
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:39.560]   anytime we want. We don't care if the price goes up by 30%. I'm
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:42.480]   happy to go down to Whole Foods and feel good to plop down an
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:46.200]   extra 50% to buy an organic banana, someone who only makes
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:51.840]   $8,000 a year cares very deeply about that cost Delta, they need
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:55.160]   to see the cost of food go down, the cost of energy go down, the
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:59.040]   cost of medicine go down, the improvement that's driven by
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:03.000]   technology and has been for 10,000 years, mostly accrues to
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.680]   the poorest people in society first. Well, that's the problem.
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:09.880]   And so we all who are in charge, those of us who are rich, who
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:12.480]   are elite, who have power, who have control, who have
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:15.200]   influence, who run the fucking government, we all get to raise
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.240]   our hand and say, I don't want to take any more risk, because
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:20.640]   one person died. Meanwhile, a million people are starving to
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:23.440]   death over the next three months. And you can make that
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:26.920]   same story and you can connect those dots in every area of
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:31.120]   technology that humans are have lost their risk tolerance for in
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:35.760]   the wealthy industrialized West. And we are largely I think, not
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:38.760]   just hurting ourselves because of the economic costs and all
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:41.000]   the other stuff that's going on that we're now seeing is very
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.440]   apparent. But we're also limiting the intelligence and
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:48.680]   the energy to make technology and progress it that could
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:51.760]   benefit the whole world. We're limiting its ability to diffuse.
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:57.080]   And I think it's it's really profoundly sad. And I hope that
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:00.200]   we one day look back at this era as almost like a pseudo dark
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:04.160]   ages. And we wake up someday, and recognize that we need to
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:05.360]   take some degree of reason.
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:08.480]   All right, listen, whatever.
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:13.640]   So I got a little passionate about the whole anti tech stuff.
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:17.920]   Hey, we like it. We like it. And listen, 35 people died building
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.240]   the Golden Gate Bridge, right? Like, the people wanted to see
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:24.280]   that progress people took risk. That's it. No risk, no reward.
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:26.680]   To that point. I think it took two years to create the Bay
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:29.720]   Bridge and 17 years to do the repair to it. I mean, that's how
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:30.800]   crazy things have gotten
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:34.320]   $2 billion to $2 billion to build those suicide nets on the
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:36.320]   side of the Golden Gate Bridge and some fraction of that to
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:39.560]   build the whole friggin bridge. And even on a dollar adjusted
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.960]   basis. It's ridiculous. It was five. It's interesting. He said
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:45.760]   a 550 million to build the bridge in US dollars. And then
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:48.760]   yeah, it was the same amount or build the nets. So
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:52.080]   that's a question about the cruise thing. So do you believe
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:55.440]   that crews will have a good solution to self driving? I'm
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:58.160]   just like a little bit skeptical. Are they owned by GM
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:02.120]   now? Yeah. But didn't they raise money from SoftBank? Isn't
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:04.720]   there some like independent funding as well that happened? I
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:07.600]   thought it was sold to GM. I'm just like, it was part of it was
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:10.760]   sold to GM and then they set it up as a sub and they like like
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:13.080]   alphabet did with Waymo alphabets raised 5 billion in
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:16.720]   outside money into Waymo. And I think that crews or GM tried to
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:18.880]   do the same thing where they've got SoftBank and a bunch of
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:20.840]   institutional investors in cruise.
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:24.000]   But majority of my show that's right. Yeah, it was spun out
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.720]   because GM didn't have the ability to bankroll it. It's
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.160]   obvious that these are getting there. The question is, is I
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.600]   think it's more like 10 years before this is fully deployed.
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:36.400]   Also, you have to build all the cars. If Elon does get out this
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:39.840]   robo taxi vehicle for 25k, which he seems like is well on the way
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:43.560]   with the Model 3 to getting to this was an early mock up from
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:47.800]   Walter Isaacson's book, which looks pretty sharp, and it
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:50.440]   doesn't have it's like a two seat car. So these things
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:55.440]   zipping around San Francisco, etc. at a reasonable speed 2535
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:59.120]   miles an hour. I think he's pretty close to having this I
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:04.840]   use the self driving beta, full self driving FSD I use it all
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:08.080]   the time. I used to only use it on highways. Now I use it on
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:12.640]   side roads. I disengage it when it's on roads that are not
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.480]   clearly marked. You know,
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:17.280]   have you guys taken a cruise or a way more road?
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:20.040]   I haven't taken either. I got invited to the beta though for
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:21.520]   cruise. You guys want to check it out.
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:26.680]   Personally, I would not trust the cruise ride. I don't believe
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:29.280]   they were responsible for this accident as it turns out. But
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:33.120]   I'm just skeptical that some of these initiatives are going to
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.880]   pan out. I think Tesla's
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.240]   why are you skeptical? Yeah,
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:41.800]   I think it's a hard problem to solve. And I'm just dubious
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:46.800]   about GM's ability to develop tech at this level of
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:50.160]   sophistication. Tesla will get there. I think Tesla is already
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:52.680]   there. Well, if an autonomous Tesla drove up and pick you up,
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:55.040]   would you do that? Would you take a ride in that? I mean, not
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:58.680]   today. But I mean, when they get there, which I don't think will
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:01.000]   be 10 years. I mean, it seems like Tesla's this way ahead of
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:01.680]   everybody else.
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:03.560]   Come off. What do you think? Where do you think the tech is?
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:06.880]   I think this is a an inference problem for Tesla. And it's a
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:10.120]   learning problem for everybody else. So I think in order to
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:13.960]   build level five autonomy, you have to have good reasoning. And
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:16.120]   I think in order to have good reasoning, you just need to have
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:19.960]   enough training data where you literally see every potential
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:23.920]   branch and node in a decision tree. And so it's one thing to
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.200]   be able to scan a light, know that it's green and then go
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:29.240]   forward. But when you multiply that by every intersection,
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:32.680]   every light in every city, it's a massive, massive learning
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:36.320]   problem. So the thing that GM and crews don't have, in my
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:39.840]   opinion, is a path to acquire enough data to be credible.
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:43.240]   Could they solve a limited set of streets in San Francisco?
[01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:50.080]   Yeah. Yes. And so if you have the city, sort of block off
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:53.640]   certain parts of the neighborhoods and say, no more
[01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:57.560]   human driven vehicles in these sections, only these three or
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:02.480]   four licensed providers can be inside of it. I think that crews
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:05.920]   and Waymo could work. But if you're going to live in a world
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:08.800]   where there's autonomy, meaning like humans can drive wherever
[01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:11.640]   they want, I think Tesla is the only one because I think they've
[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:15.040]   acquired and they are acquiring so much training data that for
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:19.120]   them, they're fine tuning reasoning. And it's exactly what
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:22.240]   Jason just described. Jason is a perfect example of a consumer
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:28.360]   now, who has adopted it, call it 70% of his use cases, and is
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:33.560]   incrementally kind of like getting towards 90% or 95%. And
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:36.040]   I think that that's impressive. I would agree with Jason, I use
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:41.440]   FSD 100% on the highways. And depending on where I'm going, so
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:43.720]   like this weekend, when I when I came to David, your house,
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:48.600]   Texas house, full FSD the whole way. Yeah, to 101. It's
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:52.400]   bulletproof, bulletproof. And then in the city. Yeah. And
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:55.840]   navigating to get into into David's house, I thought it was
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:59.800]   it was pitch perfect. And there was one or twice where I'm
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:02.680]   actually the person that's panicking and disengaging. Yes,
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:05.960]   like intersections, right, left turns. And also just on the
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:08.440]   highway, like I get a little skittish at times if it goes if
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:13.160]   it speeds up or whatever. My point is, Tesla is so close to
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:16.480]   it. So I do trust that they'll have a credible solution in the
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:19.640]   next four or five years. And these other companies, I think
[01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:23.000]   that they need to have a solution for training and I
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.760]   don't see it. Yeah, the point is, there's over a million cars
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:31.640]   recording because when you buy a Tesla, you turn on self
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:34.880]   driving, it's in every car. And so every car is recording data
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:38.320]   all the time. As opposed to GM, GM doesn't take the time to put
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:41.520]   the $10,000 20,000 off package half a million new sensor
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:45.680]   collecting millions of miles a quarter, a quarter added to the
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:48.800]   network. Exactly what Tesla did years and years ago is even
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:51.960]   before self driving was a thing. They put all the cameras in the
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:54.960]   cars to collect the data. And you're right, GM doesn't do
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:58.560]   that. If GM did that to their legacy gas cars, and then
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:01.360]   funneled that into cruise, I think they would have a decent
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:05.920]   shot, but they're not doing that. Here's a light of waymo in
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:09.000]   and I brought this up because you know, I think there's two
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.160]   different strategies going on here. Tesla's going for the
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:14.800]   whole magilla. They want to be able to do dirt roads you've
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:18.640]   never been on waymo and crews are working from constrained
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:21.880]   areas that they can perfect. And Phoenix is the perfect area
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:25.840]   because that's a grid based system, very wide highways, and
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.520]   it was planned. And so if you have a planned community, you
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:33.000]   know, it's not like a city in Italy or France, where it's like
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.640]   the roads have been there for 800 years. When you have some
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:40.040]   modern city where it's a grid based system, Austin falls into
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.920]   this as well for a large portion of Austin, it's going to be
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:45.960]   fairly easy to do those. And so that's what we'll see my
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:49.160]   prediction is we'll see this. Also, it's very flat, obviously
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:52.480]   no hills and also weather. So you know, the Northeast will be
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:55.640]   the last place when you go to Boston, or, you know, you're in
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:58.400]   other places that don't have a grid based system and you have
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:02.600]   ice and snow. This stuff is 10 plus years out, but in a dry
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:06.040]   place with consistent weather like California, Phoenix, etc.
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:11.040]   It's it's, it's it's now, right? It's now I think, okay, in Bill
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:16.080]   Gurley's regulatory capture corner. We have an interesting
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:20.000]   story about J s x if you don't know jet suite x that to the J
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.960]   s x stands for this is an airline that offers hop on public
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:28.640]   charter flights out of FBOs, tiny airports usually reserved
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:31.680]   for private jets, and they give passengers the private jet
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:35.280]   experience for the cost of roughly a first class ticket at
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:39.840]   major airlines, maybe double the cost of coach ticket 700 bucks
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:43.880]   one way from Westchester to Miami $1400 round trip, not a
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:48.760]   bad deal. By comparison, United on the same day are between 500
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:53.640]   and 800. First class from Newark to Miami. Jet suite x has 47
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:56.160]   airplanes with 1200 crew members.
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:59.240]   Let me cut in and give you my anecdote. On Saturday, I took a
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:04.200]   J s x flight from Vegas to Oakland. What were you doing in
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:07.120]   Vegas? I went to the opening night of the YouTube concert at
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:07.640]   the sphere
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:09.360]   opening night at the sphere.
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:12.240]   It was incredible. Yeah, this year, I looked at the photos and
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:15.080]   the videos. I wasn't super impressed. Is it impressive in
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:16.880]   person because it didn't come across in the videos.
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.120]   Yeah, it's incredible. You got to go see it. I think it's
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:23.320]   incredible how. So it's the first like live experience that
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:28.240]   I think you have kind of live analog elements like a band and
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.520]   this incredibly immersive digital experience because it's
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:34.400]   a 360 foot tall dome. And the entirety of the interior of the
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:38.280]   dome is a digital screen. So there were these scenescapes
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:41.280]   that they created that were like dynamic video on these walls,
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:45.080]   that it's hard. I don't think the videos do it justice like
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:48.360]   when you're actually when you're in this room during this shot
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:50.600]   right here, and I was kind of sitting center I was also I went
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:52.240]   down on the floor looks like you're in the desert or
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:55.880]   something. It's like you're there, dude. I mean, it's
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:59.520]   inexplicable. It's more real than VR. It's like you're in
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:03.480]   this world. And they even did these amazing integrated scenes
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:06.080]   where they had like helicopters flying overhead. And then they
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:09.720]   had spotlights coming out of the ceiling while the helicopters
[01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:12.680]   were flying in the video above you. They did like a hot air
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:15.520]   balloon flying above you and they drop like a rope down. So
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:19.000]   it was this total integration of like physical and virtual
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.480]   content. And I think like you to to be honest, as great as the
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:25.880]   concert was, is almost like the most boring thing you could
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:28.800]   probably do with that setup. Over time, you could probably
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:32.440]   integrate a lot more things you could have giant sets and giant
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:35.320]   scenes and people you know, doing stuff physically Star Wars
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:39.680]   movie, Star Wars in real life, you could have like, the
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:42.080]   siege of Carthage and you can have ships on the ground and
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:43.840]   then you can see the battle scene behind you and you'd be
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:46.200]   like in the middle of it. The whole thing was really
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:50.200]   incredible. I heard about the sound. Hundreds of speakers. So
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:52.360]   when I was down on the floor, I went right by the stage on the
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:56.480]   floor. The some of the sound is actually distorted down there
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:59.320]   and it's not that good. When you're in the seats that set
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.520]   back where the sound is really designed hundreds of speakers
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:04.920]   like built into the wall. I heard each seat. There's there's
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:09.200]   seat speakers, but really comes from the dome and the dome sound
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:11.320]   when you're sitting in the seats is really like immersive and
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:14.480]   incredible. So you took JetSuite X back and then I did get three
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:17.560]   eggs. By the way, I will my prediction on the sphere. I
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:20.280]   think there'll be like dozens of these things soon enough. Okay,
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:23.000]   because this can become like a new form of live entertainment
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.240]   venues, not just a stage where someone stands on it and plays
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:28.600]   music. It's a new model and more than musical artists. I think
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:31.840]   you'll see like new kinds of art and new kinds of things happening
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:34.640]   on these in these things. Anyway, there's also video on
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:37.000]   the outside. So you can do advertisements or make it look
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.440]   like a pumpkin or make it look like a basketball. I saw that
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:41.520]   it'll get cheaper and cheaper over time. The first one was
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:44.000]   what to two and a half billion dollars, they'll make smaller
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.880]   versions of it, it'll be a couple 100 million. It's almost
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:48.800]   like IMAX theater. So roll them out all over. So back to JetSuite
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:52.880]   X 240 bucks, you drive up just like an FBO, like a private
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:57.480]   terminal, drive up, walk in, no security, no lines, no check in,
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:00.440]   get on, get off. It's like flying a
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:03.000]   way to have some check in so they know your name and stuff.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.360]   Yeah, you walk up and they they you give them the ticket. And
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:09.280]   then they do a gate side check in, they take your bag and they
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:12.320]   put it all they take it out under the plane, save an hour on
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:15.440]   either half hour. Oh my god, dude, it's so hassle free. It's
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:18.320]   ridiculous. And like when my mom comes to visit, she takes it.
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:22.120]   She loves it. But obviously, there's got to be some catch. I
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:24.680]   don't really know these regs, but there's some catch. I'll
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:29.280]   explain that now. So they have 47 airplanes 1200 crew members,
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:32.560]   American Southwest and several major aviation unions are
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:37.440]   accusing JSX of exploiting a regulatory loophole that they
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:40.600]   can hire pilots who are too old to fly for commercial airlines
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:44.880]   and who don't have the requisite 15 hour 1500 hours of flying
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:49.520]   experience because they are a smaller airline. JetSuite X says
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:53.320]   its captains average over 8000 flying hours, and first officer
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:56.960]   average over 3000 flying hours. So they're blowing past the
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:00.280]   regulation. So that's obviously a red herring. According to
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:03.280]   JetSuite X, two huge US airlines and their labor unions want
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:07.720]   companies like JetSuite X small air carriers that actually care
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:10.640]   about providing you with much needed choice and high quality
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:14.400]   service to be legislated out of existence. And by the way,
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:17.160]   JetSuite X has a couple of the other airlines I think United
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:20.400]   has an investor. So the other airlines actually want this
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:23.720]   there obviously is a difference in security. But one difference
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:28.040]   is not how many hours the pilots have obviously, it's going
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:32.440]   through TSA. So the ability to not go through TSA is such a key
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:34.920]   part of this experience and to not go through a big terminal,
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:39.040]   JetBlue and United support JSX. And I think they're exploring
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:44.360]   doing this themselves. So regulatory capture at its best,
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:44.760]   I guess
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:49.160]   I'll take the unpopular side of this. I think it's easy to blame
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:52.240]   this regulatory capture boogeyman here. Okay, I think
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:56.440]   JetSuite X seems like an amazing service. It has Starlink, a
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:59.600]   bunch of my friends have taken it, they seem to enjoy it a lot.
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:06.560]   But here is the the the clever arbitrage that JetSuite X is
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:10.920]   taking, which is that they fly under what's called part 135 of
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:13.880]   the FAA. And that is when you take a private plane and you
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:17.200]   charter it, the airlines fly under what's called part 121.
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:21.120]   And the rules are very different if you're 121 versus part 135.
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:24.920]   And the biggest rule is the training of the pilots, which is
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:28.000]   that there are minimum hour requirements to be a commercial
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:33.440]   airline pilot, which is about 1500 hours, versus 250 hours for
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:38.520]   a part 135 charter pilot. So I think the question is, is that
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:41.800]   it's one thing where you charter a plane with two or three of
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:46.480]   your friends, that's a part 135 license in a small plane. But
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:50.800]   when you take a large plane with nobody else, you don't know. I
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:52.720]   think there's a pretty credible argument that that's a
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:56.040]   commercial airline. And I do think that it's reasonable that
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:00.360]   if you're running a commercial airline through a loophole, at
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:02.400]   some point, if you get big enough, that loophole is going
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:04.960]   to be obvious, obvious enough that people will ask it to be
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:09.720]   closed. I think what you want to have is this loophole closed,
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:14.320]   or you decide that part 135 where there are so many people,
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:17.400]   the pilots should be at a certain flight training
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:18.120]   standard.
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:22.360]   And to JetSuite X's defense, they reported their captains
[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:26.800]   average over 8000 flying hours. So that is a magnitude more five
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:30.720]   x more than five times the rules and first office average over
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:34.520]   3000. So why not just up that number of hours to 500 or 1000?
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:36.320]   Yeah, or just make it make everybody 15.
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:39.520]   To your point, just like say, go to the FAA and say, Look, we're
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:42.400]   going to continue to fly part 135. But here are the exact we
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:46.560]   promise to never hire a pilot that is not under this 1500 hour
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:49.760]   threshold, etc, etc. There's all kinds of ways to go around it.
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:52.120]   But I do think it's important to acknowledge that they're
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:55.360]   basically running a United. Yes, they're pretending that it's a
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:58.080]   private plane. And I think that there are some Yeah, it's a mini
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:02.680]   United yet. No, because United runs those regional legs as
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:06.560]   well. Yes. In in equivalent size planes. So I do think it should
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:09.960]   exist. I just think that it should exist on a relatively
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:12.680]   level playing field. I don't want somebody else to use a
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:14.920]   loophole. So I would not want them to use a loophole either
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:17.840]   part 135 exists. I'm actually in agreement to take a private
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:20.400]   plane and charter it not to run an airline.
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:23.400]   All right, everybody. This has been another amazing episode of
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:27.960]   the all in podcast. Thank you to from his sphere of influence,
