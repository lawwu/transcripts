[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440]   "Isn't there anyone who knows what Christmas is all about?"
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.200]   Charlie Brown with the million dollar question.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.920]   Who can tell us what Christmas is all about?
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.500]   Today on the Ask Pastor John podcast, we find someone who knows what Christmas is all about,
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.500]   an angel.
[00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.480]   An angel whose priceless words are recorded for us in the Bible in Luke chapter 1, verses
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.760]   26 to 38.
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.400]   On Christmas day 2005 at Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis, John Piper preached
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.720]   a sermon on this text.
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.240]   He titled it, "The Child to be Born Will Be Called Holy, the Son of God."
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.200]   Here's a clip of what he said.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.700]   In the sixth month, that is the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy with John the Baptist,
[00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.760]   the angel Gabriel was sent from God.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.520]   I think that's the most fundamental thing you can say about the meaning of Christmas,
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.800]   that it originates with God, starts with God, has to do with God.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.040]   God sent this angel.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.200]   God got this thing started.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.380]   There is a meaning of Christmas without God.
[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.640]   There's no biblical meaning of Christmas without God, and there's no historical meaning of
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.180]   Christmas without God, but there's an American meaning of Christmas without God, and there's
[00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.120]   a European meaning of Christmas without God, and I got an email this week that informed
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.080]   me that there's a Buddhist meaning of Christmas in Bangkok with all the frills minus God.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.440]   That's a remarkable thing, but there is no biblical, true, historical meaning of Christmas
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.440]   without God.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.920]   In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:52.160]   Christmas is about the creator of the universe who is not part of the universe.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.080]   We're not pantheists.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:01.360]   It's about the creator of the universe, distinct from his creation, creating what is not he,
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:10.020]   and then penetrating to become, become part of it without ceasing to be the uncreated
[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.100]   non-part of it that he is.
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.100]   That's Christmas.
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.860]   Do you remember how God identified himself, named himself in Exodus 3, verse 14, when
[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.420]   he sent Moses to deliver his people, and Moses said, "They're going to ask me who did this,"
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.980]   and he said, "You tell them I am who I am sent you."
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.300]   What does that mean?
[00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.860]   It means God is absolute reality.
[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.560]   He doesn't come into existence.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.100]   He doesn't become what he's not.
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.780]   He doesn't get better today than he was yesterday.
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.180]   There is zero development in the divine being.
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.040]   He simply is.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.540]   Before you were, I am, galaxies were, or anything that could cause the Big Bang was, he was,
[00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:09.300]   is, will be, no beginning, no ending, no development, no becoming, absolute non-created reality.
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:18.740]   And then he created what is not God, a universe, and on Christmas he entered it.
[00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:27.640]   This universe, the moral part of it, the personhood part of it, the us, the personal part of it
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.220]   is in rebellion against the King.
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.060]   We're in rebellion against God.
[00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.760]   So when he's coming, he's not just coming to hang out.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.800]   There's a problem he's coming to deal with, and we're it.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.960]   For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whoever believes in
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.140]   him should not perish but have eternal life.
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:56.080]   For God sent not the Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.280]   him might be saved.
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.720]   That's why he's coming.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:06.000]   I think God would say to me what he said to Paul in 2 Corinthians 5, "You're my ambassador
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.420]   this morning.
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.360]   This is the day of salvation.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.800]   Go say in my name.
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.800]   There is an amnesty.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.320]   It is still in force.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.580]   And the amnesty is this.
[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:27.240]   If you will lay down your sword, lay down your weaponry of rebellion against me, just
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.040]   drop it.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.160]   In your heart right now, just drop it.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:41.800]   And then kneel or fall or lie down like a little baby and receive my forgiveness for
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.440]   all the rebellion against my kingship.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.440]   It's free.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.040]   I paid for it with my son's blood.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.400]   And then swear allegiance to me as king.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.840]   And if you will, you will be a child of God and you will live forever.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.400]   There will be a wall of fire around you called God and in the midst will be the glory.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.960]   And you will enjoy the revelation of God forever and ever and ever.
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:19.160]   And death will be a portal into paradise."
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.880]   That was a clip from John Piper's 2005 Christmas sermon.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:27.980]   The full sermon and over a thousand other messages are available free of charge at DesiringGod.org.
[00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.640]   We will be back with a new episode on Thursday morning, looking ahead to some exciting things
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.680]   coming from Desiring God in 2014.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.080]   But until then, I'm your host Tony Reinke, wishing you a wonderful Christ-centered Christmas
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.080]   celebration.
