[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.080]   Our first question comes from Irfana, who asks,
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.840]   "How can a freelancer perform deep work?
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.920]   The freelancer has to create his personal brand on LinkedIn.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.520]   You know, suppose he's a social media manager,
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.200]   he needs to have a social media presence."
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.080]   Well, Irfana, I think this is an example
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.960]   of an important phenomenon to discuss briefly,
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.960]   which is single drop social media use.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.920]   And what I mean by single drop social media use
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.920]   is the mindset that if there is any social media use
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.520]   that is necessary in your life,
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.880]   so something professionally or what have you,
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.920]   there's, you know, job applicants
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.400]   and you have to check for questions on Facebook
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.360]   or something like that,
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.800]   that if there is any, a single drop of social media use
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.680]   in the pool that is your activity time,
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.600]   then you have to just unrestrictedly use social media
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.120]   from there on out.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.800]   And that's what I'm sensing in this question,
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.880]   that as a freelancer,
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.680]   there's some stuff you might want to do on LinkedIn.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.440]   Maybe you have a LinkedIn Pulse style newsletter
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.760]   and/or you have to keep up on inquiries from people
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.720]   or keep up with your network.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.280]   I don't know exactly what it is,
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.880]   but in your mind that small amount of mandated use means,
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.200]   I guess I just have to be on social media all the time.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.560]   And that's not the case.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.480]   In fact, this would be the challenge I would give you.
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.200]   Let us say I said,
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.260]   here's the new law under a penalty of $100,000 fine.
[00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.480]   You are only allowed to be logged into LinkedIn
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.500]   for 20 minutes once a week.
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.880]   I bet you would be fine.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.160]   I bet you would be fine.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.020]   What would happen if that was the law?
[00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.600]   Well, first of all, if you were posting content on LinkedIn,
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.880]   you would just write it elsewhere.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.040]   And during that 20 minutes, you would post,
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.320]   you would make it weekly.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.680]   If there were requests coming in
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.120]   or you wanted to do some networking,
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.320]   just during that 20 minutes,
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.720]   you would answer the request
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.160]   and you would maybe do some pokes.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.040]   Maybe you would update your profile to somehow say,
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.920]   I do LinkedIn messages on Fridays
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.100]   or whatever day you do it.
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.400]   Maybe you'd miss a couple things
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.660]   or a couple of people would be annoyed
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.020]   that you were slow getting back into them,
[00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.000]   but who cares, right?
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.140]   This is a numbers game.
[00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.640]   It's just over time being on there
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.100]   may be surfaces the occasional opportunity.
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.920]   So you would be absolutely fine in 20 minutes once a week,
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.600]   which is a negligible footprint.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.840]   This is the type of exercise I want people to do
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.840]   when they think about unavoidable social media use.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.200]   What if I was only doing this
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.520]   for a very small amount of time, quite infrequently?
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.840]   Could I really make that work?
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.240]   Would I get most of the value?
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.360]   And I think in most cases, the answer would be yes.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.800]   So do not allow the single drop
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.280]   of social media requirement in your life
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.440]   be the instigating force that gets you
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.980]   to endlessly lose yourself into those distractions.
[00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.600]   All right, we have a question here from Career Opportunist
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.760]   who says, "Are there times where it is worthwhile
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.440]   to follow intimations of your career interest,
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.040]   even if you take non-trivial cuts in your career capital
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.680]   outside of the corner cases you've already mentioned
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.480]   in your book, so good they can't ignore you?
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.720]   Are there some elaboration here?"
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.320]   So we can get some context to this question.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.360]   So Career Opportunist clarifies
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.920]   that he is a backend software engineer
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.460]   at a large well-known internet company
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.640]   who has built up quite a bit of career capital in that role.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.920]   He then goes on to say, "My core interest in college,
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.140]   however, were in front-end client-facing work
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.520]   as opposed to backend software.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.360]   I'm not tied to a particular job or passion.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.240]   I just want to experience building user-facing software
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.160]   as opposed to just behind-the-scenes code."
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.720]   So he says, "I can either choose
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.060]   to become a more proficient backend engineer,
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.560]   but it does feel like a less interesting route for me,
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.100]   but I could do that and focus instead
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.400]   on the opportunities to negotiate lifestyle improvements."
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.280]   All right, so I don't have a definitive answer,
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.040]   but I'll tell you my instinct here.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.320]   The grudging thing you put at the end,
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.240]   like I guess what I could do is even though
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.400]   maybe front-end stuff seems more interesting,
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.300]   I could get better at backend engineering
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.040]   and focus more on lifestyle improvements.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.120]   I actually think that's probably the right answer.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.820]   And it might not be the answer you want to hear from me,
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.840]   but I think at this stage of your career,
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.320]   the right thing to do, I'm going to guess,
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.760]   you haven't told me, but I'm going to guess
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.860]   you're at that critical stage,
[00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.720]   this roughly quarter-life stage
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.240]   in your late 20s, early 30s,
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.920]   where you're no longer starting out,
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.360]   you have skill, you have talent,
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.480]   you begin to have some options,
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.000]   but you're also not at that mid-life stage
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.500]   where there's other things going on in your life.
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.600]   I would say at this stage,
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.560]   this is an important time to do
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.760]   lifestyle-centric career planning.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.040]   I'll explain what that is in a second,
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.080]   but what I think is going on instead
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.780]   is you're feeling a bit adrift,
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.720]   because again, you've got to that quarter-life stage
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.520]   where you found the job, you found the skill,
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.940]   you have some stability, you have some ability,
[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.480]   and now you're thinking what's next.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.280]   And in our culture, and especially American culture,
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.280]   I say our culture, we have this instinct
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.000]   that the content of our job
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.960]   is going to be the key driver of our satisfaction.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.760]   So when you feel that initial tinge of malaise,
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.860]   because you've reached a plateau,
[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.920]   your culturally trained mind immediately says,
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.880]   well, maybe if we shifted a little bit
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.280]   the content of our work, we would no longer be adrift,
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.440]   we would break through the malaise.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.220]   So maybe it's back-end software is the issue,
[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.560]   and the reason why I'm feeling this malaise
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.600]   is that I really should be doing front-end software.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.640]   I think if you make that shift,
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.540]   it would be kind of interesting,
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.280]   but you'd be back in the same place in a couple of years.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.520]   So now is the time to do lifestyle-centric career planning,
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.120]   which is what I think is the answer
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.180]   to that feeling that so many standard knowledge worker types
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.620]   feel around this part in their life.
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.900]   Now, I've talked about this before,
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.380]   but the basics of lifestyle-centric career planning
[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.000]   is that you identify
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.320]   what do I want my day-to-day life to be like
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.000]   in all of its attributes,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.280]   not what do I want my work to be like,
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.600]   what do I want my actual life to be like?
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.640]   And I want you to think about things like,
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.940]   where am I living?
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.960]   Am I in the countryside?
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.240]   Am I in a skyscraper?
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.720]   Am I in a small town?
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.400]   Am I helping my neighbors build a barn?
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.960]   Or is it I am having people over,
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.840]   commonly just shooting the breeze out on a front porch
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.160]   while people walk by?
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.160]   Or is it I'm at a underground bar scene
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.320]   where there's interesting new poetry being done, whatever.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.200]   What is my day like?
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.020]   What am I doing?
[00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.860]   Where do I live?
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.080]   How much am I working?
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.240]   Am I getting after it?
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.680]   Or is work a small part of my job?
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.720]   Am I seasonal?
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.200]   Am I spending six months a year not even working at all
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.440]   and doing other types of things and traveling around?
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.520]   These type of questions.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.040]   What am I doing with my time?
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.080]   What about my character?
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.560]   What is my role in the community?
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.760]   What is the philosophies by which I live?
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.760]   How deep is my existential grasp of my life?
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.360]   All of these type of questions.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.760]   You fix this lifestyle.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.680]   You feel it and you taste it
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.160]   and you imagine a typical week or day
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.420]   and something that really hits those intimations of,
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.400]   yes, this is right.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.680]   And then you say, great, what are the paths to get there?
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.200]   And that's where you build your plan.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.360]   And work then fits into that plan.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.680]   And work then becomes a mechanism by which
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.160]   you make progress towards this lifestyle
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.040]   that pushes all of these right buttons and really resonates.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.040]   And that is where as you enter this quarter-life period,
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.360]   your focus goes.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.480]   Aiming the ship that is your life towards the port
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.240]   that is a lifestyle that is deeper, that resonates with you.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.220]   Whatever those answers might be.
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.920]   And again, I keep emphasizing different people
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.080]   have different answers to these questions.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.580]   It could look very different depending on the people.
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.320]   That's where I'd want you to put your energy.
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.280]   Now, if you do this exercise,
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.080]   eight times out of 10, you're gonna find,
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.000]   oh, if I have a lot of career capital
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.320]   in something like back-end software design,
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.160]   massively increasing that capital,
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.520]   because it's easy to take good capital and make it great
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.600]   than it is to go from no capital to good capital.
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.480]   Massively increasing that capital quickly
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.400]   and using that as a lever to take control
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.040]   of aspects of my life and career
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.440]   is almost always gonna be the right thing to do.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.560]   An example comes to mind from my book,
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.600]   So Good They Can't Ignore You, which you mentioned.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.640]   There was a very similar character in that book.
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.900]   Someone in a very similar situation to you.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.540]   This was Lulu, and she was a back-end programmer.
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:38.120]   I believe she was databases,
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.760]   more like a database programmer designer, but similar idea.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.400]   Not front-end facing, worked for financial sectors.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.240]   As she got better and better at that,
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.880]   she said, "What did I want my life to be like?"
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.640]   And she used that as a lever to build
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.120]   a really cool lifestyle where she did
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.320]   six months on, six months off.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.120]   So she left the company where she was.
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.200]   She went to a consulting role.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.640]   She was heavily in demand because she was great on this.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:02.840]   She would do six months on.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.940]   That's roughly enough time to do one or two engagements.
[00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.520]   She lived relatively cheaply, right?
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.960]   With her wife in Jamaica Plain.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.320]   It was a cool, it's a cool neighborhood outside of Boston.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.280]   They had this cool old house that they were renovating.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.920]   And they weren't living lavishly.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.440]   They weren't living in, let's go buy
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.400]   a really large, expensive house.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.580]   So then you could spend the other six months
[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.680]   doing interesting things and scuba diving.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.920]   She got a pilot's license.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.160]   Her family was from Thailand.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.720]   So she would go do extended visits there.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.720]   And it was just a really interesting lifestyle.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.200]   But she figured out what she wanted.
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.040]   And then she said, "What's the best way to get there?"
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.440]   "Oh, I'm a great database developer.
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.720]   I can wield that to get where I want to get."
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.520]   So that is what I'm going to suggest for opportunities
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.320]   is do the lifestyle-centric career planning thinking
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:52.080]   and work backwards to say, "How do I get there?"
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.960]   And then see where that takes you.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.240]   So again, it's likely it might take you,
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.080]   will tell you almost certainly take the skill
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.400]   you have out for a spin and use it to build a cool life.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.880]   It might tell you, however, when you do this,
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.560]   like you want to be running a small startup
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.600]   that's front-end facing and you live kind of cheap
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.760]   and you're living somewhere kind of cool.
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.760]   So maybe it would put you to front-end facing work,
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.400]   but it would be pushing you there for a reason.
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.560]   This is part of a big picture, not just an instinct
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.440]   that maybe this would make me happier.
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.760]   The final thing I will say,
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.320]   if you're interested in front-end design
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.120]   just as an intriguing intellectual challenge,
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.280]   even if this exercise has you stick with back-end programming
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.960]   and using that as your main leverage,
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.040]   your main career capital lever,
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.760]   do some front-end work as a hobby.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:38.760]   Build a front-end facing website that you do
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.040]   as a side hustle or a side project
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.760]   that you build up and build up those skills,
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.680]   build it around something you're really interested in.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:51.600]   Like you're some sort of super fan of "The Matrix"
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.440]   or something like this.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.520]   I just watched that movie last night,
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.160]   that's why I'm thinking about it.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.840]   Jesse's shaking his head.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.920]   You're a super fan of "The Matrix" or something like this,
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.720]   and whatever, or you're really into some,
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.880]   I'm not good with this, "Dungeons and Dragons" or something.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.080]   I don't know, but you know what I'm saying?
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.040]   Like, okay, build it about something interesting, fun,
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.240]   a community that you get some depth out of, whatever it is,
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.800]   and you could get that experience as well.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.520]   All right, so that's a long answer to a short question
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.600]   because I really wanted to get to that bigger point,
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.440]   which is I'm increasingly a big believer in this idea
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.120]   that stage one of your career is figuring out
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.320]   how to be a adult in the world who's dependable
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.800]   and gets things done and starts to develop a real skill,
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.320]   to get real career capital.
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.480]   Stage two, deploy that capital
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.200]   towards a vision of the ideal lifestyle.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.280]   And then stage three is actually probably gonna be
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.680]   much less career-focused.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.800]   You're in this lifestyle,
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.600]   it's gonna be much more about yourself and self-discovery.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.360]   I mean, I think it sets you up
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.200]   for the classic midlife crisis,
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.400]   for it not to be a crisis,
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.840]   but to be a time of actual discovery.
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.080]   So that's my advice, lifestyle-centered career planning,
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.800]   underrated, can't emphasize it enough.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:05.040]   All right, we have a question here from Groupmate.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.560]   Groupmate asks,
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:12.200]   "How do you effectively manage group projects in college?"
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:16.920]   You don't, you know, Groupmate,
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.800]   group projects in college are pretty hit or miss,
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.280]   usually pretty bad.
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.200]   You elaborate here that,
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.440]   'cause you're a Cal Newport type, you are organized,
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.200]   and therefore you basically end up doing a lot more work
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.840]   because you're not on board
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.880]   with the typical college strategy of,
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.840]   hey, this is due tomorrow,
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.120]   why don't we stay up all night
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.520]   and do something kind of crappy?
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.400]   You actually wanna plan your work out in advance,
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.400]   and so you end up doing most of the work.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.600]   That is the price you pay
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.000]   to have your act together in college.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.680]   You're not gonna love group work.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.600]   The only two pieces of advice I can give is,
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.680]   A, avoid it when you can,
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.840]   because it's not gonna go well for you.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.080]   B, work with the very best people you can.
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.120]   I remember having this experience
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.720]   as an undergraduate computer science student
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.960]   with problem-set groups,
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:11.040]   and I was good at computer science.
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.040]   I'll put this the humble way.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.160]   I was good at computer science,
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.920]   as you might've predicted
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.320]   based on my later career trajectory.
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.200]   I learned pretty quickly
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.080]   that there was a lot of people
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.440]   who wanted to be in problem-set groups with me
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.480]   because they would get all the right answers.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.480]   It wasn't very useful to me though, right?
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.000]   I would basically just do the work,
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.320]   and eventually I found one or two students
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.120]   who were really smart,
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.040]   and these were the students I would come back to
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.040]   to work with again and again,
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.240]   and we complimented each other,
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.400]   and it made these problem-set groups really effective.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.360]   I actually got a note like a year or two ago.
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.240]   It was actually pretty cool.
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.120]   I'd forgotten about it,
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.960]   but it was a group mate I worked with in a lot of courses
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.280]   who I really liked working with,
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.440]   and he came across on my writing or something recently.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.520]   So this is 15, 16 years later,
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.680]   and he sent me a note about,
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.120]   "Hey, I remember working on problem-sets
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.440]   "with you back at college."
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.800]   So that was pretty cool,
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.040]   but that was really useful.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.960]   So pick the smartest people,
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.760]   the most organized people you can when you can.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.160]   Avoid group projects when you can't,
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.640]   and when all that else fails,
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.560]   I'm just gonna validate your frustration.
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.240]   I'm not a big fan of group projects in college,
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.640]   and so you're not doing anything wrong.
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.440]   It's just kind of the price you pay.
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:25.920]   All right, moving on here,
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.740]   we have a question from Rodrigo.
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:33.660]   Rodrigo asks, "Do you recommend listening to music
[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.760]   "while doing deep work?"
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:37.840]   Well, it's up to you.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.340]   Some people do, some people don't.
[00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.880]   What I always tell people when they ask about this
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:48.840]   is that music can help you drown out other distractions
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.820]   and get into the mood of deep work
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.640]   if you practice first doing deep work
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.480]   with that specific type of music.
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.800]   So it is a trainable thing.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.600]   If you listen to the same Mozart sonatas
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.220]   every time you do deep work,
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:03.360]   the first few sessions,
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.640]   you might actually find it a little bit distracting,
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.080]   but after a while, your brain learns to filter it out
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.400]   and it can be effective.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.240]   So that's the only caveat I would give.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.440]   The people who use music have practiced
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.240]   working with that music.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.480]   This can get pretty extreme.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.760]   I do tell the story sometimes of a novelist
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:24.720]   I interviewed years ago who had four kids at home.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:28.440]   It was a very noisy home, and he had to work there,
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.280]   and he wrote a lot.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.040]   He was a self-published novelist
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.640]   who did a lot of word count.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:37.520]   And what he did in the end was got NASCAR-style headphones.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.880]   So they're heavily insulated,
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.240]   and you can also play audio through them.
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.880]   Because I guess at NASCAR, what you do
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.080]   is you wear these really insulated headset headphones,
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.120]   but you want the audio of the commentary playing.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.440]   And he would put Metallica,
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.720]   would blast Metallica
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.240]   into these heavily insulated headphone speakers.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.080]   So there was literally no sound from his kids.
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.000]   That's what it takes.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.840]   And I have three kids, so I can attest to this.
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.240]   That is probably what it takes to actually
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.680]   eliminate the sound of your kids from your life
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.720]   if they're home and you are trying to work at home.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.440]   That's what it really takes.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.000]   He learned to write pretty productively
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.840]   with Metallica blasting in his ears.
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:20.280]   If I tried this now, it would be incredibly distracting.
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.920]   If I did this consistently for two weeks,
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.280]   my mind would easily tune it out.
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.800]   It would actually probably be pretty effective.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.100]   So, Rodrigo, it's all about practice.
[00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:34.040]   All right, let's do one more question about deep work.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.600]   This one comes from Mr. S.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.640]   Mr. S asks, "What do you do when your boss
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.940]   has allocated you to a team half time?"
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.420]   All right, he elaborates,
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:50.360]   "I worked full-time on one team for my current employer.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.480]   My boss has decided that we need to start on a new effort
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.760]   and has put me and one other person
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:55.600]   to work on this new effort.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.300]   We were supposed to spend half our time on this new project
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:59.480]   and the other half on our old team,
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:04.000]   but I feel like I'm still allocated 100% to both teams now.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:04.960]   It's exhausting."
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.760]   All right, Mr. S, here's my suggestion.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:12.440]   Ask your boss specifically which half of my hours
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.280]   do you want me working on the new team?
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:18.360]   50% as an abstract number means nothing.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.440]   Should it be the mornings?
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.200]   Should it be the afternoons?
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.380]   Should it be two hours in the morning,
[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.220]   two hours in the afternoon?
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:26.560]   I want the fix down, boss,
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.520]   the hours when I'm working on team A
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.400]   and the hours in which I'm working on team B,
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:35.400]   and I am going to completely segregate these two efforts.
[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.600]   You can give a good reason for it.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.720]   I'm a Cal Newport fan.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.420]   Context switching is better to treat these
[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:40.540]   like two separate jobs
[00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.540]   as opposed to mixing them together in one job,
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:45.040]   but then do that and then stick to that.
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.020]   If you want to have a meeting related to team A,
[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.040]   it has to be scheduled in team A hours.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.220]   If you want a meeting having to do with team B,
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:53.440]   it has to be scheduled in team B hours.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.460]   If you're going to work on team A,
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:55.440]   it has to be in team A hours.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.280]   If you're going to work on team B,
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.500]   it has to be in team B hours.
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:58.780]   It could be splitting the day in half.
[00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:00.900]   It could be splitting the week in half.
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.180]   Thursday, Friday is team B.
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:03.980]   Monday, Tuesday is team A,
[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:05.980]   and we split Wednesday down the middle.
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.580]   But what you want here is specificity.
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.180]   When should this work happen?
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:13.060]   Now, there is a bigger point here
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.660]   I want to briefly emphasize,
[00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:19.820]   which is that in knowledge work writ large,
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:25.700]   a real issue we have is this push model of work allocation,
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:29.700]   where anyone can push work onto anyone else's plate
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:30.980]   where it's up to them to figure out
[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.240]   what to do with the mess.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.580]   This is a disaster for overload.
[00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.900]   We get way too much work on our plate
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.860]   because there's no one regulating this.
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.580]   There's no one looking at how much is on your plate.
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.620]   There's no one saying what is reasonable.
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:47.140]   So we end up with way too much work on our plate.
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:49.060]   Can't make progress on all of it at the same time.
[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.460]   So that is stressful, but it's not just stressful.
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.780]   Each of these things that's now on your plate
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:57.620]   brings with it some amount of fixed overhead.
[00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:00.460]   Emails about that work with people checking in,
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.460]   weekly meetings, you've had to schedule
[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.220]   to make sure that progress is being made.
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.140]   And so when your plate gets full enough,
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:09.420]   the fixed overhead itself can take over most of your hours,
[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.140]   squeezing out almost any of the time
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:12.380]   to actually get work done.
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.600]   So it's a huge problem.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.860]   I'm a big believer in having
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.500]   a much more explicit allocation of work
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.800]   where we think through how much can you do?
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.500]   How much are you doing?
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:27.500]   Does it make sense to give you something else?
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.140]   I call this a pull-based method
[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.760]   because you're basically pulling work
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.220]   into time you have available.
[00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:36.260]   So you're never oversubscribed,
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:37.340]   as opposed to a push method
[00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.700]   where any amount of work can be pushed towards you.
[00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.400]   This is roughly what I'm getting at, Mr. S,
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.380]   when I suggest that you ask your boss,
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:47.800]   what hours, what days do you actually want
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.060]   this 50% work to be done?
[00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:54.460]   'Cause what you're doing here is actually forcing work
[00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:57.300]   to account for when it's gonna get done.
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:58.980]   Well, where are the hours where this is gonna get done?
[00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.740]   That hour is already spoken for.
[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:01.760]   You wanna have a meeting here,
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.180]   but that hours have already been put aside
[00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.020]   for this other work.
[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:04.960]   So now there's no time for your meeting.
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.660]   You're making explicit, things take time.
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.100]   What time do you want me to give to this?
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.240]   And honestly, I think there should be a bigger effort
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.460]   to do this with more work.
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.440]   I wrote about this in "A World Without Email,"
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.580]   that when it comes to, for example,
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.500]   service work among professors,
[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:24.700]   that there should be a specific budget.
[00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.740]   Here is how many hours of service work
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:30.280]   you are allowed to do max per week.
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.720]   And when things get assigned to you,
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.040]   you actually have to estimate
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.500]   how many hours you're gonna spend on it.
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.200]   In fact, put those hours aside.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.180]   Here they are on my calendar when I'm working on this.
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.620]   If you wanna talk to me about this,
[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:42.820]   it's on my public calendar.
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:44.540]   And when those hours are filled up,
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.020]   nothing else can come to you.
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.540]   Yes, this would create a problem at first
[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:49.460]   because there's all these people that want you to do things.
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.620]   Like I know your hours are full, but this is important,
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:52.460]   but you know what?
[00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.940]   That back pressure reforms the system.
[00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:57.560]   And less of these requests are allowed to be generated.
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.380]   And more of these requests generating entities
[00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.420]   have to figure out other ways to get their work done.
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:03.900]   So I don't mean to go on a big rant here,
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.540]   but the unregulated allocation of work
[00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.360]   and knowledge work is a disaster.
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:13.060]   It's convenient, it's flexible,
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.560]   but it is a terrible way to get work done.
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:20.300]   It's like running a car factory where everyone comes in
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:22.100]   and you just say, "Guys, there's a bunch of parts
[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:23.380]   "around here, you do you,
[00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.140]   "like we're just gonna kind of build cars."
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.060]   Yeah, it's convenient, it's flexible,
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.820]   but nothing's gonna get done.
[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.660]   Or if it does, the cars are gonna get built terribly
[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:33.540]   and it's gonna take a long time.
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.920]   So it's time to start pushing back
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.700]   against the unrestricted allocation of work.
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.320]   Mr. S, if your boss wants you to spend 50/50,
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.440]   make him tell you what that 50/50 is,
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.040]   make him live by that decision.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.800]   They're now hours he cannot get you to do work for team A
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.220]   because it's team B hours, et cetera.
[00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.100]   And if he wants to put another thing on your plate,
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.240]   where are those hours coming from?
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.560]   It's time to get explicit.
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:54.840]   Don't just push stuff on my plate.
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:57.980]   I'll pull in what I actually have time for.
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:00.840]   And what we don't have time for
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.860]   is more questions about deep work.
[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:06.540]   So let's move on now to some questions about the deep life.
[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:10.240]   Our first question comes from Clarissa.
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:14.240]   Clarissa asks, "I do a daily schedule,
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:18.060]   "but how do I avoid feeling like it's redundant?
[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:21.040]   "Sometimes I don't need to change things around
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.800]   "and I skip scheduling my time block
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.340]   "and then it snowballs into one day
[00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:27.960]   "and then two days, the next thing you know, it's a week."
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.360]   Well, Clarissa, let's focus in on this issue
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:36.360]   of falling off the habit of daily time block planning
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.860]   and how that can snowball to many days without it.
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:43.160]   Typically, it's a sign that you're overworked.
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:47.020]   There's too much going on, your mind is exhausted.
[00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:48.480]   So I think it's actually an important signal.
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.800]   It's not a failing, it's an important signal
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.440]   that maybe we need to pull back on commitments
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.620]   so that the amount we're doing each day is less
[00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:57.660]   and try to get more time off.
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:02.380]   Your mind needs time off and it's getting it informally
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:06.140]   by just refusing, mentally speaking, to do any planning.
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:11.680]   The thing I'm gonna recommend that you do persist with,
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.660]   even during these periods,
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:16.420]   is some sort of bare bones tracking.
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:19.820]   So for me, it's the metric tracking space
[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:20.900]   in my time block planner.
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:24.460]   There's certain key metrics I write in there every day.
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.900]   I never skip that, that's sacrosanct.
[00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:28.380]   Now, this takes 20 seconds
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.140]   and you just do it at the end of the day, right?
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:33.840]   But it keeps you at least in a mindset
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:38.080]   of I am being intentional, I'm keeping track of my life.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.060]   I have not just given up on intentionality
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:42.120]   in my living altogether, even though it only takes 20 seconds
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.900]   and even if what you're writing down is really bad.
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.620]   So if there's things you track, like, did I read today?
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:48.580]   Did I eat well today?
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:49.420]   Did I exercise today?
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:50.700]   And you're not doing all of it,
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.300]   you're writing that down saying that you didn't do it.
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.500]   Bad or not bad, that is like a bare bones fallback plan
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:57.580]   that I'm always doing that,
[00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.740]   even if I'm not getting around to my time block planning.
[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:01.660]   And then it makes it much easier to say,
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:03.340]   okay, well now let me actually go back
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:04.920]   to doing my time block plans.
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.940]   So do the fallback mode,
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:09.820]   so I have the very basic behavior, the metric tracking,
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:10.780]   you never stop doing,
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.160]   so you never leave the mindset of I control my life
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.940]   and I care about what's happening in my life,
[00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.100]   even if it takes 20 seconds.
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.220]   And then two, if you're consistently skipping time blocking,
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:22.020]   take that as a signal that you have too much going on.
[00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:24.380]   That's okay, it's an important signal.
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.620]   You need a day off, you need earlier shutdowns,
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:29.060]   you need to take three things off your plate.
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:31.340]   It's useful information,
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.620]   not a sign that you're doing something wrong.
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:37.660]   We have a question here from Patrick.
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:42.540]   Patrick asks, how would you approach including
[00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:46.640]   non-work activities into my workday?
[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:51.860]   Well, if it's during the actual hours of your workday,
[00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.500]   so after your time block plan begins,
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.140]   but before you do your shutdown ritual for the day,
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.020]   you just time block it.
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:02.220]   You just time block it like any other thing you would do.
[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:05.060]   In fact, time blocking it allows you to find the best times
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:08.940]   for scheduling this non-work related activity.
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.940]   You have some control over where that's gonna fall,
[00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:12.220]   so it's not just happening randomly.
[00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:14.320]   You're more likely to get more of it done.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.900]   I do this, for example, with exercising,
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:18.940]   and for sure with book reading,
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:22.000]   where I'll just block off a time for book reading.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.940]   The other thing you can do is to shut your days down
[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:26.180]   earlier on some days.
[00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:28.880]   So I can end my day at 3.30, full schedule shutdown complete,
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:32.700]   3.30 to 5.30, I'm doing my leisure activity I'm really into.
[00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:33.540]   That's a great period.
[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:34.980]   I love that end of the day period
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:37.540]   where other people are working, but you're done
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:40.500]   because you're organized and you're in control,
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.740]   and you can end that day early without it being a crisis
[00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:43.980]   because you've controlled all of your time,
[00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:44.860]   you've controlled your weeks,
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.420]   you've controlled your semester plans,
[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:48.820]   and so you might try doing that as well.
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:51.540]   But just time block that like anything else.
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:54.980]   All right, so we have another question here.
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.640]   This is also from Patrick.
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.980]   Patrick says, "How do you structure your time
[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.500]   "if you love what you do?"
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.220]   I wonder if this is the same Patrick as before.
[00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:07.620]   It probably is, actually.
[00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:08.900]   Here's a little bit of an elaboration.
[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.300]   Patrick says he's a PhD student,
[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.220]   and that he enjoys my work.
[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:14.180]   Thank you, Patrick.
[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:16.580]   He really loves what he's doing,
[00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:19.420]   but some of his leisure activities are related to his work.
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.780]   So Patrick says he's researching AI,
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.940]   but is also interested in the epistemology
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:26.380]   of knowledge discovery from data.
[00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:28.740]   So he's reading philosophy and trying to write
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.260]   some epistemological short papers.
[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:35.220]   He's also taking some MOOCs, massively online courses,
[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:37.800]   to improve his science writing skills.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.140]   He's doing that in his free time
[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:41.700]   after he does schedule shutdown and complete.
[00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:43.660]   He also reviews academic papers
[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:47.020]   and tries to eat healthy foods and reads a lot.
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:49.900]   And he's trying to figure out, here's what he says.
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:51.320]   "As you can see, some of these leisure activities
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.680]   "are also work-related, although not that closely.
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.060]   "I emphasize that I enjoy doing these activities.
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:58.380]   "Do you think this is a sustainable approach,
[00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:01.340]   "or do I need to focus more on another bucket of my life?"
[00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:05.200]   All right, so basically, Patrick, you have a cool job,
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.260]   and you have a lot of things you're interested in,
[00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.420]   and there's a lot of overlap
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.340]   between the things you're interested in and your job.
[00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.260]   And I think that's all great.
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.060]   And I'm not going to advocate
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:18.020]   for significantly reducing this energy
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:20.220]   and just leaving more time free in your schedule.
[00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.380]   You're doing nothing because you're being energized by this.
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:25.820]   What I would, I think what I would moderate here
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:29.260]   is commitment activities.
[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:31.820]   See, I'm gonna draw a clear distinction.
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:33.220]   Here are things I have to do
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:35.820]   as part of a long-term commitment,
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:38.940]   versus here is something I'm going to do right now
[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:41.140]   because it's interesting.
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:43.860]   But it would be no problem if I didn't do it.
[00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:45.220]   I'm interested in it.
[00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:47.860]   I'm taking this online course at my own pace
[00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:49.140]   because I want to be a better science writer.
[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.980]   I'm reading this book because I'm interested in the topic.
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:54.840]   I have a hobby AI project I'm monkeying around with
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:58.120]   because it seems like it's interesting.
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:01.300]   I think it's fine to have a bunch of stuff like that,
[00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:04.700]   that you're using to free up, to fill up your leisure time,
[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:08.380]   because it's not gonna cause stress if it's not commitments.
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.260]   It's not gonna cause stress
[00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:14.020]   if you know that you can put the break down as needed.
[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:15.800]   If something in work comes up that's urgent,
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:19.140]   you can not take that course for two weeks.
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:20.600]   If there's a family emergency,
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.700]   it's not a big deal if you stop reading the book.
[00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:24.380]   So make that distinction.
[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:26.180]   Keep the stuff that you are committed to,
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:27.620]   what you're doing in work,
[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.620]   the academic projects you're working on, the mentoring,
[00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:30.900]   the stuff that you have to come back to
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.940]   and you have no options, keep that reasonable.
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:35.820]   Control that, keep that footprint small.
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:40.900]   And then if you want to explore whatever
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.660]   in the time that remains, that's great.
[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:43.820]   I think that is good.
[00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:45.540]   So just make that clear distinction,
[00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:49.820]   filling your time with things that you can pause as needed
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:53.480]   is I think completely fine if you find that energizing.
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:58.360]   All right, we have a question here from Jenny.
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.300]   Jenny says, "How do you suspect that you're thinking
[00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:04.380]   "about living a deep life will change in retirement?"
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:09.320]   Well, I don't think it will change at all.
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.820]   And what I mean by that is I don't think
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:16.100]   my general framework for thinking about the deep life
[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:20.160]   has to change in any substantial way
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.500]   as you shift from full-time work to retirement.
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:27.060]   The decisions and activities that this framework generates
[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:28.740]   will of course change
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:31.020]   as you shift from full-time work to retirement.
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:34.580]   So just as a reminder, my framework for the deep life says
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.260]   you identify the buckets that are important to you
[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.220]   and your life and your vision of a life well-lived
[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:43.380]   and you give each of these buckets independent attention.
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:45.060]   You start with keystone habits
[00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:46.820]   and then you overhaul that part of your life.
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:49.380]   And so you make sure that you're seeing holistically
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:50.940]   all the elements of your life that are important
[00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:52.660]   and that you're giving intention to each of those
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:56.900]   and making sure that they have a expression in your life
[00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:58.700]   and they're an important part of your life.
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.940]   So what happens when you retire?
[00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:04.700]   It just changes what you're doing in some of those buckets.
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:07.580]   In particular, you have what I call the craft bucket,
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:09.500]   the bucket that's dedicated to work.
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:12.020]   That's gonna look a lot different after retirement.
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.740]   Craft is still important,
[00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:16.380]   producing things of value, skill is still important,
[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:19.700]   but you'll probably then be pushing that part of your life
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:23.020]   towards more non-professional type craft.
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:25.700]   And the other buckets of your life remain unchanged,
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.140]   just as important as they ever were before.
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:28.940]   Probably most of the stuff you were doing
[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:31.020]   the day before you retired in those other buckets,
[00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:32.860]   you'll be doing the day after.
[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.220]   Your constitution bucket for your health and wellbeing,
[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:36.740]   that's still important, obviously.
[00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:39.300]   Community, what you're doing with your friends and family
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.380]   and those who live around you,
[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:42.500]   gonna be just as important,
[00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.080]   doesn't change when you retire.
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.260]   Contemplation, thinking through philosophical
[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:49.100]   or theological issues is just as important before and after.
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:52.420]   So I think if you're living with this bucket-based approach
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:53.540]   to the deep life,
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:56.200]   it will be a seamless transition to retirement.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:59.420]   When you do your normal introspection
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:01.220]   on each of those buckets,
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:02.980]   your craft bucket will change,
[00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:04.420]   the other ones won't,
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.800]   and you keep going, you keep living deeply.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:12.380]   All right, I think we have time for one more question.
[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:14.420]   This one is from Nicholas,
[00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:15.780]   who prefaces the question by saying,
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:18.220]   "Not sure if you wanna answer this."
[00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:19.980]   Well, Nicholas, I will try to answer this.
[00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:24.980]   You ask, "Which habits are needed to be an MVP
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.200]   "in the academic world?"
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:30.920]   That's a good question, Nicholas.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.320]   Adderall and Lyon?
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:36.720]   Is that what I wasn't supposed to say?
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.800]   No, it's okay.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.720]   The formula is not super complicated.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.760]   If you wanna be a star academic,
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:47.800]   there's three things that are preconditions.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:48.680]   They're not sufficient.
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.680]   This won't necessarily get you there, but they're necessary.
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.000]   So at the very least, you'll have to do these three things.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.640]   And typically, it's A, read,
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:58.380]   and by read, I mean you do the work to keep up
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:03.180]   with the latest literature in your particular specialty.
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:04.860]   If you're a theoretician,
[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:06.740]   you are reading what people are doing
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:09.260]   in the topics you study and mastering their techniques.
[00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.500]   If you're a lab scientist,
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:11.860]   you're looking at the innovations
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:13.260]   in lab scientist techniques,
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:14.580]   and you're learning from it.
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:16.040]   This is really hard work.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.820]   Reading academic papers is hard.
[00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:19.780]   Trying to figure out what academics is doing is hard.
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.100]   The top people spend a lot of time on this.
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.400]   Two, you're working relentlessly.
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.160]   You're always working on research,
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.280]   carefully chosen projects.
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.320]   You're always working on it
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.720]   at a faster pace than other people.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.040]   And when you finish one thing, you move on to the next.
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:36.360]   The total number of hours top academics
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:38.100]   put into their research is typically much bigger
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.840]   than their peers, where it's more seasonal.
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:41.860]   They're working on something.
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:43.680]   They kind of do other things for a while,
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:44.640]   and then they work on it.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.440]   Star academics are relentless about it.
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.440]   It's priority one.
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.640]   They try to fit in the other stuff,
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.880]   the teaching, the whatever, when they can.
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:54.100]   But the time is gonna be on the research.
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:56.600]   And then three, you attach yourselves to stars.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.940]   If you wanna produce MVP caliber work,
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.400]   you have to be training under MVP caliber people.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.940]   It's very consistent.
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:08.800]   It's very difficult to break up to a higher level
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.580]   than you studied under.
[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:11.740]   It typically goes the other way.
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:13.860]   There's a reason why star academics are stars.
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.940]   You have to learn from them how they do it,
[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:17.340]   how they work, what they focus on,
[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:19.260]   their techniques, their work ethic.
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.540]   So you have to work with the very best people.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.080]   Now, you could do those three things
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:25.200]   and not end up a star.
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:28.920]   There's raw brain power and luck play a big role in this.
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:31.440]   I mean, especially in mathematical fields
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:32.440]   or other types of fields,
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:35.800]   there's just horsepower that matters.
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:38.160]   And I don't know how you develop it
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.300]   and how much of it you're born with
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.880]   and how much of it is the training you've done
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.440]   throughout your whole life or whatever,
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.920]   but there's a certain just type of ability
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.240]   to do spatial reasoning
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.720]   or internal numerical manipulations.
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:52.180]   And that's just, you probably have to have,
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:53.100]   and some people don't.
[00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:54.460]   And then there's this luck.
[00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:57.620]   The topic you're working on works.
[00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:59.700]   You can't always predict that.
[00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:04.700]   But you're working on, let's say it's 2018,
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:07.620]   you're starting a postdoc.
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:12.540]   Like I'm gonna do a postdoc at the, wherever.
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.220]   And what I'm gonna focus on
[00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:17.060]   is the phenotypic expressions
[00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:20.660]   of coronavirus genotype point mutations.
[00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:24.220]   And then the coronavirus pandemic comes.
[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:25.980]   Wow, you're gonna get a lot of grant money.
[00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.140]   You're gonna get a lot of demand.
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:30.820]   Like what you're doing is really, really useful.
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:33.300]   That this would be a really good time.
[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:35.380]   Whereas at the same time, if in 2019,
[00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:38.240]   you were an epi professor at Johns Hopkins
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:40.900]   that had just published your first book,
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:43.740]   which was "A World Without Viruses,
[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:49.100]   Why We Will Never Again Face a Big Pandemic
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:54.580]   Because of the Miracles of Modern Technology
[00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:56.380]   and the Ability for Populations
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.460]   to React Nimbly and Quickly."
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:00.460]   Now you're in a bad place.
[00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:02.820]   You're not gonna do as well.
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.580]   So there is luck involved as well.
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:05.540]   But those are the necessary.
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.740]   Like at the very least, you have to be
[00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:09.700]   mastering the literature,
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:11.300]   working relentlessly and working with stars.
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:16.340]   And it's a focused, intense, deep work effort every day,
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:19.540]   reasonable amount.
[00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:21.060]   You could probably only do four hours of this a day
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:22.860]   and just repeat, repeat, repeat.
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:26.460]   All right, well, speaking of repeating,
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:28.340]   I think I'll have to repeat the idea
[00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:31.060]   that we are out of time for today's episode,
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:33.340]   but it is good to be back after my break
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.660]   to be back in the studio.
[00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:38.900]   And we will wrap up today's episode there.
[00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:41.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:44.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.140]   (upbeat music)
