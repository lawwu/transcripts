[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.120]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:14.000]   >> [LAUGH] >> So I won't bother introducing myself.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.720]   First thing I wanna say, a very important thing.
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.040]   We wouldn't be together if it weren't for Taylor Lambert.
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.840]   He's not here with us.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.980]   I don't know if he's gonna tune in or whether Rich will get him on one of his
[00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:26.520]   videos.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.880]   But Taylor, we wish you the best.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.600]   We constantly hope you'll be able to get yourself together and
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.560]   get back here another year.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.360]   But a lot of what I'm saying is dedicated to you and
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.680]   the inspiration that you gave me.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.760]   That said, I wanna start off by saying we're talking a little bit about books.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.600]   I worked with the great Bill Bernstein, Dr. Bernstein, here this morning.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.800]   And he did something that was kind of mean-spirited.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.200]   >> [LAUGH] >> The book Vogel on Mutual Funds has
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.240]   been the number one book on Amazon since the day it was published,
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.220]   seven and a half years ago, and it continues to be the number one book today.
[00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.000]   It's amazing, I don't know any other book in any category that has that sustained
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.120]   kind of leadership for seven and a half, going on eight years.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.960]   Applause, so that's common sense.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.200]   It's a little book, but it's the one that does so well.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.360]   That's number two, by the way.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.000]   >> [LAUGH] >> So Amazon's a good guy,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.560]   I think it's as good as any.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.840]   A lot of volume goes on there, probably 40% of the books sold in America, maybe 50.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.360]   But it's a pretty good test, and obviously I'm pleased with that.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.520]   But Bill, darn him, brings out a book on Materna, Are You Ready?
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.520]   I think it's called.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.200]   It's a great book, it's a short book.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.000]   He gives it away, he's number one.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.520]   >> [LAUGH] >> Don't do that to me.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.600]   >> [LAUGH] >> Not a mini Vanguard there, man.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.320]   >> [LAUGH] >> Cutting costs all over the place.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.000]   But in any event, I think everybody that exists now owns Bill's book, so
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.920]   I can come back to number one again.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.280]   I do want to concede that on the mutual fund list
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.640]   at Amazon is not in the same genre
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.280]   as, say, Fifty Shades of Grey.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.520]   >> [LAUGH] >> Now, you shouldn't have read that.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.000]   >> [LAUGH] >> You must know what's in it when you're
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.720]   laughing.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.640]   >> [LAUGH] >> But in any event,
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.920]   it's been great to see those books do so well.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.480]   And they're three of my books of the most wished for books on Amazon.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.240]   And still selling, and I think it ranks in all books.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.120]   Obviously, not number one, but maybe number 2,500 or 3,000.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.680]   And they have, I think it's 5 million books on Amazon.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.960]   So it's pretty good, and it's an awful lot of fun to have done that.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.760]   And to have it work out so very well with the acceptance of shareholders.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.000]   There are two more books coming out, even though I promised my wife.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   >> [LAUGH] >> I probably told you earlier I wouldn't
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.080]   write anymore.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.720]   These aren't real books, but we're gonna give you,
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.640]   with your loyalty to being here today, we're gonna give you copies of each of them.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.640]   And they're out there, but we don't actually have them now.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.480]   You should all be reading them.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.480]   >> [LAUGH] >> And one is a very short one,
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.520]   more of a pamphlet than a book, called The Man in the Arena.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.680]   And it's the transcript of a follow-up to the Legacy Forum.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.160]   They had a 60-year legacy party they had with me at the Museum of Finance in New
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:49.140]   York, and we had four really distinguished people who took a day off.
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.080]   And basically, they come to New York and talk about me.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.680]   It seems kind of amazing to me, I'm sure it seems kind of amazing to you.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.400]   >> [LAUGH] >> It was Alan Blinder,
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.080]   Professor from Princeton, Head of the Center for Economic Studies,
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.360]   Center for Economic Policy Studies.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.520]   Professor there for many years.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.480]   Former head of the Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.960]   Frequent contributor to the Wall Street Journal regular,
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.920]   contributor to the Wall Street Journal.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.640]   We had Cliff Asness, a hedge fund manager,
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:24.520]   probably the biggest group of hedge funds in America, who had a little side story.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.440]   He tells this story in The Man in the Arena, in this transcript.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.320]   He says he has a license plate on his car that says WWJD.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.840]   And someone says, wait a minute, Cliff.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.560]   Aren't you like a Jewish?
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.280]   What is Jesus doing there?
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.360]   And he said, no, it's not Jesus, it's what would Jack do?
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.600]   >> [LAUGH] >> He's got a great sense of humor.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.600]   >> [LAUGH] >> And the third one was Jim Grant,
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.520]   the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.480]   A brilliant writer, not just about financial stuff, but
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.440]   many other things, he's got a biography of John Adams.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.880]   Biography of the Speaker of the House of many, many years ago.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.680]   And he was there, and his thing was about Bizzaro Vogel.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.640]   Do you all, are you familiar with Bizzaro?
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.280]   Anybody here?
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.800]   Well, Bizzaro is the anti-superman.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.920]   They used to talk about him on Seinfeld, and I had never read it.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:28.000]   Never watched Seinfeld, but he's the exact opposite of who he's supposed to be.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.840]   So Jim Grant's thing is a little riff on me and
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.720]   following a different career for different reasons.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:43.760]   And my career is such that my son decided, my career's a hedge fund manager.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.760]   Bizzaro, the opposite of what I do, and it was superseded.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.400]   My son then thought, that's not the right way to run a business, so
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.040]   my son started the first index fund.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.240]   >> [LAUGH] >> And his last line was something like,
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.840]   whatever the case, it's all about the money.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.040]   >> [LAUGH] >> And the final one was Dick Silla,
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:10.160]   a professor of finance and basic corporate history at NYU.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.800]   And he compared me with, I hate to tell you this, but it's silly,
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.680]   but it's nice, with Alexander Hamilton.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.840]   And I think I came off well in comparison.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.040]   >> [LAUGH] >> But that's in the man of the arena.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.280]   And then I was like this, and thanks to Mike Nolan,
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:35.680]   my wonderful assistant, who's here somewhere over there, we self-published.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.160]   You know selfies, well, this is a selfie.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:44.760]   >> [LAUGH] >> I just decided I'd like to put this
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:50.440]   kind of between the covers of the article I have in the New Journal of Portfolio
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:57.600]   Management called Lightning Strikes, this remarkable coincidence of in two weeks,
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:03.000]   in late September, early October of 1974, starting Vanguard,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.040]   Paul Samuelson's article, the very first edition, 40 years ago,
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.920]   Journal of Portfolio Management, saying, would somebody please start an index fund?
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.080]   And the bottom of the bear market, all that happened very quickly and
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.680]   set the stage for this new company.
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.480]   So that is in there, turns out I've also written 13 essays.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:31.480]   I've printed them also in here, and so you can read what I've written in the past.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.760]   And then two of the most outstanding articles,
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.800]   the outstanding articles of JPM in two particular years.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.920]   And if you get that awesome treat,
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.240]   you're asked to write a retrospective five years later, essentially.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:49.160]   So there are two retrospectives of how the idea is that won these prizes.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.020]   And one, interestingly enough, the very JPM, it's a very,
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:58.060]   very quantitative magazine, and yet of all those 13 articles,
[00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:02.320]   really 12 because this one hadn't been reviewed yet, of the new one, Lightning Strikes,
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:09.560]   all these quants, and they were the ones into the subscribers to JPM,
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.080]   were the ones who picked by least quantitative works.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:17.240]   It's good, one was called New Sherry Duty, No Man Can Serve Two Masters.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.000]   And the other one was called,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.080]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.040]   You get what you pay for or something.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.240]   Well, there's an idea so important that you can't think about anything else.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.760]   And that was the title of it.
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.400]   And so that cost the pension system.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.180]   And then without a lot of big data in there and a lot of complicated formulas,
[00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.080]   those were the ones they selected.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.800]   And then I printed also a sample of the original article.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:47.280]   And one more nice letter from Paul Samuelson to me on my 80th birthday.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.960]   And that's about it, that's in the book.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.320]   And that looks like this.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.040]   And I thought you'd be interested in the dedication.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.520]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.440]   Which I thought about doing a little bit late, just for the last minute.
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.760]   And I think I'll read this, it's not very long.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:12.240]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.680]   I've often said ideas are a dime a dozen, but implementation is everything.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:21.360]   Well, this book is focused on the ideas that inspired the creation of Vanguard,
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.400]   the index fund.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.840]   This dedication honors those, quote, honest to God, down to earth human beings.
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:31.840]   You've heard that expression before, who implemented those disruptive innovations.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:36.520]   And those who inspire our crew, who came to place our clients' interests first.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.640]   So a hearty salute to those who serve in our Vanguard crew.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:45.000]   Those who are responsible for the hard, well, thankless task of getting a day's
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   work done.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.460]   Extraordinarily nice people who do their work with loyalty to our founding values
[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.800]   and commitment to serve our shareholders.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:57.500]   And a second hearty salute to those whom we at Vanguard as trustees and
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.420]   fiduciaries are pledged to serve.
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.940]   Placing their interests first and foremost.
[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.640]   So 20 million families who have entrusted their wealth to our care.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.420]   We teach them, as well as learn from them.
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.920]   Notably from 30,000 vocal heads,
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.920]   the core of one of the most active financial websites in the land.
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.120]   That's the dedication, so it's to you.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.320]   And we will have that for you later on.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.800]   Self-published, and therefore instead of taking six months,
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.160]   when should we get this to the press, Mike?
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.060]   >> Friday.
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:34.640]   >> [LAUGH] >> Is this a great country, or what?
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.240]   >> [LAUGH] >> Jack, I just heard from Taylor.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.660]   Can I interrupt and just read the message from Taylor?
[00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:46.520]   It says, dear Mel, in March 2000, you and I organized the first Global Head
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:50.080]   Conference of 21 investors in my Miami condominium.
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:54.500]   [COUGH] Where Mr. Vogel honored us with his presence.
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.840]   We never imagined that 14 years later we would be chairing a conference,
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:03.160]   approximately ten times larger, and forced to limit attendance.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:07.920]   Participating in Jack's noble crusade to give ordinary investors a fair share,
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.880]   has brought meaning and enrichment to our lives.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.280]   I'm sure it will do the same for
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.920]   every local head who has made the journey to this year's conference.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.000]   I send my affection to each of you, and
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.640]   especially to my dear friend and mentor, Jack Vogel, signed, Taylor.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.360]   >> Well, that's very nice, a nice response.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:29.360]   >> [APPLAUSE] >> Yes, so what I'm gonna do is talk
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:35.080]   a little bit about the personal side of things, a little bit about Maine Arts
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:41.120]   history, and I wanna do that first, because my deck of slides may run a little long,
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:46.760]   and that may have to take a short trip, although those slides will be available
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:52.560]   to anybody here that wants them, maybe take two or three hours to get them created,
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:57.800]   or something like that, but the title I picked was entitled,
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:02.720]   for all but together, Human Beings and Algorithms,
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.840]   as Vanguard's 41st Year Begins.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:11.160]   So going back to the beginning, the title of the introduction,
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:16.600]   I'm really drawing heavily from the introduction to the book,
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:21.200]   is entitled, It's the Best of Times, It's the Worst of Times.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.960]   Always a good idea to throw Dickens in there, and so
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:30.760]   as September 1974 drew a close, and October began,
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:35.400]   there was a fortuitous moment in financial history that was taking place.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:41.160]   A new star, not in the big star sense, but just one more entry in the universe,
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.920]   entered the mutual fund department, a company that had just come into existence,
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.680]   and incorporated on September 24th, 1974.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.120]   It had a unique, you know this, truly mutual structure,
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:57.040]   owned by its fund shareholders, and operated on an annual basis,
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.840]   and it was called, of course, Vanguard.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:05.720]   A week later, October 1st, the first issue of Journal of Portfolio Management was published,
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.800]   under the leadership of founding editor Peter Bernstein.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:12.800]   One of the major papers in that issue was entitled, Challenge to Judgment,
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:19.240]   by Professor Paul Samuelson of MIT, America's first Nobel laureate in economic science.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.880]   He could find no root evidence, as he called it, that any mutual fund manager
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:30.560]   had consistently earned returns that surpassed the returns of the unmanaged S&P 500,
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:35.960]   and basically demanded somebody somewhere start an index fund.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:44.560]   In retrospect, his essay powerfully echoed my early 1951 rudimentary statistical research
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:48.520]   in my Princeton thesis that reached a similar conclusion.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:54.360]   And I witnessed further, much more important than that, my own personal experience.
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:14:03.280]   I'd witnessed firsthand the abject, even catastrophic, failure of the new breed of professional fund managers,
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:07.520]   following the collapse of the go-go era, back in the mid-1960s,
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.320]   a terrible chapter in this industry's history.
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:15.840]   Together, his inspiration, and my experience, with his being Dr. Samuelson,
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:20.080]   shaped my decision to create the world's first index fund.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:25.920]   It would be a logical basis for an investment strategy that follows from,
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:30.400]   and would be fully consistent with, Vanguard's business structure.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:36.000]   Strategy follows structure, as I've said so many times, which is consistent.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.240]   Two days later, October 3rd, the third fortuitous event took place.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.200]   In the long sense, counterintuitive.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:49.200]   At the end of a long, harrowing, banned bear market, 50% decline,
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:56.960]   and from an early 1973 high, very few managers at the funds anticipated that decline,
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.480]   and many funds declined a lot more than that 50%,
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:06.560]   the fund industry had failed the investors who had trusted its money managers.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:14.720]   And fund assets would decline almost fatally, like 40%, 53 billion to 31 billion,
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:19.520]   and only bailed out later on by the money market business.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:20.960]   Amazing story.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:25.520]   So in that two weeks, the moment for a new structure, a new strategy,
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.760]   for a failed industry began.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:28.560]   Amazing.
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.000]   Times were bleak.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.200]   Yes, the opportunity was deeply hidden.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.840]   It was, to some people, totally invisible.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.880]   And yes, the industry was in crisis.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:44.000]   The rest is history, recounted in the essays that are in this book here.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.240]   The new entity managed 1.4 billion of other people's money, OPM, in October '74.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:56.400]   And four decades later, in October '14, 2014, it's now $3 trillion of other people's money,
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:07.280]   the largest-run enterprise in the world, and more than $1 trillion larger than its closest peer.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:11.200]   The Financial Analyst Journal is also celebrating, of course, its 40th anniversary.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:17.360]   They published 13 of my papers, and I republished all of this in this anthology.
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.720]   And it turns out-- I'll make this a brief here--
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:24.720]   there's three very different phases of focus in these papers.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:30.800]   The first phase, 1990-1994, was establishing reasonable expectations
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.760]   for stock market returns in the coming decade.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.280]   I continue to use that to this day.
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.200]   It's proved to be pretty good.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:42.160]   And dividend yield, initial dividend yield, plus subsequent earnings growth,
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.800]   plus or minus short-term speculative return, plus market values change.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.640]   P/Es go up and down.
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.240]   Put them together, and they get the total return on the market.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.680]   I'll talk a little bit more about that and show you the data later on.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:02.000]   The second phase, 1992-2002, I didn't plan.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.960]   And the papers that I wrote during that period focused on the investment performance
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:11.280]   of actively managed mutual funds compared to passively managed index funds.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:16.160]   And I guess I was getting a little more confident about the index funds.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:20.160]   And here, I focused on the relationship between returns and risk
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.920]   and the power of the role played by both of these costs.
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.200]   Then, in this third phase, the most interesting phase,
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.080]   the focus of my interest shifted again,
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:35.840]   veered sharply away from data on stock market returns and mutual fund returns
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:39.920]   to the counterproductive structure of the mutual fund industry,
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:43.760]   in particular, and in general, to the appropriate role
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.440]   of the U.S. financial system in modern society.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.800]   I wrote four papers on these matters in my writing strife.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:58.560]   As I think I mentioned, I did mention two of them became quite popular.
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.560]   Why did I change?
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.760]   Why did I change my focus?
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.000]   I don't know the answer to that, of course.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.240]   As I say in the book, it's perhaps my growing idealism, which is still unshakable,
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:14.880]   and certainly it must have helped, that is now free from the rights
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:18.720]   and responsibilities of running Vanguard.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:25.040]   My readiness, as always, even eagerness to speak out,
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:28.160]   from my self-created bully pulpit.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:33.680]   And if this talk isn't too solicistic, a realization that if I didn't do it,
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:39.520]   there were few, if any, others who would take up the cudgel's grip on it.
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:44.160]   The Lord knows there is much room for reform in our system.
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.120]   Our nation's underfunded retirement plans.
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.960]   Our industry's failure to give individual investors a fair shake.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:54.960]   The conflicts of interest that permeate and inhibit the appropriate regulation
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.440]   and legislation of our financial system.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:01.200]   The reluctance of our money manager agents, that's what they are,
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:05.680]   who collectively hold voting control and 70% of all of America's corporations,
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:09.280]   the stockholding of America's corporations.
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:14.560]   To use that power in dealing with, among other unpleasant issues,
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:19.120]   excessive executive compensation, loose accounting practices,
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.080]   and undisclosed political contributions.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.680]   Each issue is like a maniche for a federal standard,
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:30.480]   fiduciary duty for all those responsible for OPM.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:35.280]   And in short, there's enough work to do now that I continue to speak out
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:43.360]   and not fully quote, but for the next two decades, or three, or four, or more.
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:48.720]   And I don't usually look bad, and I don't think most financial writers do,
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.880]   at my works in retrospect.
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:20:00.080]   But because two of these won the financial best article awards from JPM,
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:04.320]   they ask you to do this five years later after you've written your article,
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.000]   to take a look at what it looks like.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.360]   Every five years, these winners are asked to present a retrospective
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.120]   on their winning papers.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:19.680]   And this little document is published every five years.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:26.560]   So I did that with the speeches that I wrote, outstanding articles in 2008,
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:29.040]   and again in 2009.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:36.320]   Now, that first retrospective, early in '29, was on a 2008 paper at the time.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.880]   Well, so I didn't really have a lot of time to think about it.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.360]   The question's so important, I finally got it right here,
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.760]   that it should be hard to think about anything else.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:49.840]   It was included in the five-year cycle, 2004, 2008, only a year before I was asked
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:55.840]   to write this essay about counterproductive support,
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.960]   counterproductive actions for financial intermediaries.
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:04.160]   It had already, within a year, garnered very broad, high-level support.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:08.720]   I'm not sure that it was so inspired by me, but it happened almost immediately.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:12.960]   A major article in the New York Times, an essay by Simon Johnson,
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:16.320]   former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund,
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:21.280]   and Buttonwood, the incisive columnist of the Economist of London.
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:29.120]   And that's all terrific people adopting this idea of the role of our financial system
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:35.520]   in subtracting value from the returns investors get on its own behalf.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:41.520]   I concluded in that retrospective, expressing my pleasure,
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:48.640]   the escalating, rent-seeking, even rent-gouging by our financial intermediaries,
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:53.760]   never one to waste an adjective, had been recognized,
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:59.280]   initiating as I wrote the title, Of Course, from an idea whose time had come.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:04.240]   And you'll see this in the documents I'll show you later on.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.600]   Not enough, but it's beginning.
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:13.200]   And in 2014, just this year, I was asked to write another retrospective
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:20.000]   of my award-winning 2009 essay, The Fiduciary Principle, No Man Can Serve Two Masters.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:27.920]   Here, the tables were turned, because I had fully five years to consider the impact of what I'd written.
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:32.800]   And in retrospect, what I liked about that paper was the most naked presentation
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.320]   of my native idealism that I've ever dared to write.
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:41.680]   Focuses it was on the need for integrity, principle, and ethical responsibility in finance,
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.080]   in a phrase, fiduciary duty.
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:48.160]   And particularly, I was proud, I hope it's okay to be proud,
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:52.080]   of citing similar wisdom from some of the greatest men in financial history.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:56.640]   Adam Smith can't beat that, John Maynard Keynes, and Ben Graham,
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:00.640]   and of course, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Harlan Bistone,
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:04.960]   whose 1934 essay, The Public Influence of the Bar,
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:08.480]   provided both the inspiration and foundation for that paper.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:13.440]   Yes, as he wrote in that essay, writing in 1934,
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:19.120]   "There is nothing more vital in our own day than those who act as fiduciaries
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.400]   should be held to those standards of scrupulous fidelity
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:26.240]   which our society has the right to demand, as it does."
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:31.360]   That was true in 1934, it was true in 2009 when I wrote that article,
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:36.880]   it is still true in 2014, and it will be true forevermore.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:42.000]   Now, there's a lot more in here, I guess I could say.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.360]   There has been yet another shift, partial shift,
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.240]   because I have busy days and I'm trying to get a lot done,
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:52.240]   and I do want to say thanks to Michael, who is an unbelievable help to me,
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.400]   because Michael and me and Emily, and she'll be here later,
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.960]   you won't know her if you've been here before.
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.080]   My amanuensis, I think that's the right word,
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:04.080]   look it up, and she will be here.
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.280]   And the three of us, plus Sarah who is in the parking lot,
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:12.080]   crank out this huge amount of work, so I'd like to publicly express my thanks to you, Michael,
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.080]   for doing such a fantastic job.
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.200]   You've been to a vanguard, it's around 13 or 14 years,
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.640]   you've been with me for three and a half, and I couldn't do it without it,
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.840]   I could go on about it.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.600]   Kevin is out here somewhere.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:27.920]   My long-lasting, probably long-suffering, are you here, Kevin?
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.960]   Somewhere back there.
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:36.880]   Yeah, there's Kevin, Kevin Lawson.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:41.040]   I couldn't have done it without him in those days.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:45.040]   These guys really made my life a lot more fun,
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.400]   a lot more enjoyable, and they're unbelievable,
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:53.840]   they're playing the computer like Paderewski.
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.320]   I just couldn't do anything without them, really.
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:00.880]   So, another shift, and I'm spending a lot of time,
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.680]   with our crew.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.680]   I do, crew teams will come into my office,
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.080]   you know, they ask me to dance,
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.080]   and there may be seven or eight of them,
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.480]   they can bring you an extra chair, it's not that big,
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.080]   you can hold, I guess, ten, if you are willing to stand,
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.880]   and we'll come in and just talk, and they'll ask me things from now on.
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:24.880]   And, you know, one day, it's ten crew members,
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.280]   the longest-serving of whom,
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:32.080]   have been here since 2013, the longest-serving.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:35.280]   And I say, "Who has the gall to marry,
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:39.280]   to ask for a meeting with me?"
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:44.080]   And, then I did one luncheon with five ladies,
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:47.280]   who have been there for an average of 26 years,
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.280]   in a group that works together,
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:53.280]   and they're all fun, they're all enjoyable,
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.280]   and they can talk about anything they want.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:58.080]   And, I talk to the teams,
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:01.280]   I talk to retirees, when I'm asked,
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.080]   I always say, and the same thing is true,
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.080]   of the Award for Excellence winners,
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.080]   I talk for an hour and a half to each of them,
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.080]   and I talk to anniversaries,
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.080]   if someone has a 20th anniversary or something,
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:16.080]   and I always say, when I get invited,
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.080]   "I will come if the coast is clear,"
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.080]   if you know what I mean.
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.080]   I have no reason to fuss about management,
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.080]   they're getting in their way,
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.080]   I'm just saying, I know what you mean,
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.080]   yes, the coast is clear.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.080]   So, I show up,
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.080]   and I don't want to waste a lot of time,
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.080]   but the human side of business,
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.080]   has become so important to me,
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:38.080]   as this company gets bigger and bigger,
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.080]   I'm going to talk a little bit about that now,
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.080]   but two recent ones were really,
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.080]   amazingly interesting,
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.080]   totally different.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.080]   One was a 25 year anniversary,
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:52.080]   along with the man who was going to retire,
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.080]   he's retiring after 20 years with us,
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.080]   they were on the night shift,
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.080]   they were the tech guys,
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.080]   that keep our machine reworking,
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.080]   all night,
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:04.080]   a thankless job,
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:06.080]   but great people,
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.080]   I got up there,
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.080]   went over to the Stefano Center,
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.080]   made that long walk to the back,
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.080]   a long walk around a long corridor,
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.080]   I had to take the elevator to get upstairs,
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.080]   at this stage of my life,
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.080]   and there were these 25 people,
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.080]   and
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.080]   it looked like the United Nations,
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.080]   old, young, black, white,
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.080]   Chinese, Indian, Latino,
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.080]   every human was a male woman,
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:32.080]   male, female,
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.080]   and it was a great, great evening,
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.080]   in which they turned back and said,
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:40.080]   I haven't had this many pictures taken since my wedding,
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.080]   including,
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.080]   the now popular,
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:48.080]   selfies,
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.080]   and they seemed to love to do the selfies,
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.080]   and it was just a wonderful evening,
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.080]   and I got a note back from the retiree,
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.080]   saying,
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.080]   I think he used the phrase, big shot,
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.080]   no big shot,
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.080]   the Vanguard has ever come to see us before,
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.080]   and I think that's awful,
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.080]   and I was happy to fill the gap,
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.080]   and to make the more than happy,
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.080]   ecstatic,
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.080]   I could hardly sleep that night,
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.080]   I was so excited,
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.080]   and particularly,
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.080]   this is a little sidebar,
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.080]   particularly since my wife,
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.080]   does not like me to be going late,
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.080]   I have a time when I'm supposed to arrive home in the afternoon,
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.080]   which means getting out of the office at 4,
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:28.080]   and getting home at 4.30,
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.080]   and resting a little bit, sometimes even taking a nap,
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.080]   and she doesn't want me working so hard,
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:34.080]   and she doesn't want me working at night,
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.080]   she doesn't want me not being there for dinner,
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:40.080]   and she's right, by the way, in all counts,
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.080]   and she said,
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.080]   what a great thing to do,
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.080]   she understood the difference between,
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:50.080]   a lot of other things I could be doing,
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.080]   and dinner for big shots,
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.080]   and photo, or something like that,
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.080]   which I just don't do anymore,
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.080]   and the other one was,
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.080]   for a 26 year retiree,
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.080]   who just wanted to have a couple of people stop by,
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.080]   she had three pizza pies,
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.080]   and we were all going to have just a bite of pizza,
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.080]   she didn't want a celebration,
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.080]   she didn't want me to come,
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.080]   so of course,
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.080]   I showed up,
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:16.080]   and there were two people who were sitting around,
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.080]   having a pizza pie,
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.080]   she was a lovely woman,
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.080]   and she said something that broke my heart,
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.080]   you made it possible
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.080]   for me to retire early,
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.080]   with her retirement plan,
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.080]   and I said, oh boy, that's a mixed emotion,
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.080]   so I'm getting rid of you,
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.080]   because we're losing you,
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.080]   because we made it easy to leave,
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:40.080]   which we call a paradox,
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.080]   so I started to talk a little bit,
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.080]   about these things,
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.080]   25 year things,
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.080]   I opened T's on my telegram,
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.080]   I'm sure they remember it,
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.080]   because I used to speak at every billion dollar advance we made,
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.080]   and every 10 billion,
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.080]   and I said, Susan, I know you'll remember some of these speeches,
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.080]   and it's amazing,
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.080]   speeches all those years ago,
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.080]   I'm not embarrassed about it at all,
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.080]   it's a great consistency of theme,
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.080]   and I just read a couple of things out of the books,
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.080]   and kid around about a little thing,
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.080]   and she came to us with her assets worth,
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.080]   45 billion,
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.080]   so I thanked her for the remaining,
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.080]   2 trillion,
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.080]   955 billion,
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.080]   and I started to talk,
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:22.080]   and I guess I have kind of a loud voice,
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.080]   and this was just like,
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.080]   all the little cubicles of people answering the phone,
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:28.080]   and that kind of thing,
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.080]   and the next thing I look around,
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.080]   like five minutes into my talk,
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.080]   very very informal,
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.080]   it's like a flash mob,
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.080]   there must have been
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.080]   120 people there,
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.080]   how did this thing happen,
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.080]   you just can't have better days than I have,
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.080]   being with the people that do
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.080]   all the hard work,
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.080]   so,
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.080]   I remind,
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.080]   it gives me a chance to remind our crew,
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.080]   our corporate values,
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.080]   our corporate structure, our corporate history,
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.080]   our investment strategy,
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:02.080]   and I try to explain to them the story of Vanguard,
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:04.080]   I want them to know how hard it was
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.080]   at the beginning, we got a trillion and four billion,
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.080]   God I still can't get it right,
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.080]   a billion and four of assets at the beginning,
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:12.080]   and our shareholders were so impressed,
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.080]   that they took out
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.080]   400 billion dollars for the first three years,
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.080]   there's a vote of confidence for you,
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.080]   and I'm capped off
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.080]   by an article in Forbes magazine,
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.080]   talking about the new separate
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.080]   organizations of Wellington and Vanguard,
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.080]   and it was entitled, you'll notice
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.080]   it right out of Romeo and Juliet,
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.080]   a plague on both your houses,
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.080]   and they did apologize,
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.080]   but I did, if I know why,
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.080]   it took them 23 years to do it,
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.080]   that's a long time to wait,
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.080]   I'm a patient fellow,
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:44.080]   I'll make sure to live that long,
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.080]   but it's a story of contrarian opinion,
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.080]   opportunity deeply hidden,
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:52.080]   introspection about an industry
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.080]   that was losing its way,
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.080]   I guess some courage and stubbornness had to be there,
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.080]   in so many ways,
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.080]   the story of that serving,
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.080]   you know this again,
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.080]   human beings,
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.080]   with their own hopes and fears,
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.080]   and financial goals,
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.080]   it's a story of trusting and being trusted,
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.080]   and realizing through all that
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:14.080]   great fog that we see today,
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.080]   or money values,
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.080]   there is in fact, remain issues,
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.080]   that are white or black,
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.080]   right or wrong,
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.080]   and I say, don't compromise,
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.080]   I've never been good at compromising,
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.080]   I guess there may be a time for it,
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.080]   as one of our directors used to say,
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.080]   never compromise on matters of principle,
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.080]   I didn't spend a lot of time,
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.080]   I don't think four years ago,
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.080]   wondering about whether or not I'd be around
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.080]   to celebrate our 40th anniversary,
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.080]   obviously not everybody lives
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.080]   much beyond 85,
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.080]   and the odds are not improved,
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:48.080]   when you've been beset by profound
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.080]   cardiac challenges,
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.080]   it began 14 years before Van Gorder was even born,
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.080]   when it began I must have been
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.080]   wearing blinders,
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.080]   to ignore the odds,
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.080]   entrepreneurs
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:02.080]   as it said,
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.080]   are as risk averse as everyone else,
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.080]   fundamental characteristic
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.080]   of an entrepreneur is risk seeking,
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.080]   it's self confidence,
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.080]   entrepreneurs may recognize,
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.080]   probably do,
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:16.080]   that starting a business is risky,
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.080]   they just believe their innate skills
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.080]   will win out,
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.080]   a third of all entrepreneurs according to a survey,
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.080]   thought there was no chance, zero chance
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.080]   they would fail,
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.080]   looking back over my own decisions in the early years,
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.080]   I think it's a very receptive
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:32.080]   observation,
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.080]   I guess you could say I just don't scare very easily,
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.080]   yes,
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:38.080]   some great ideas, structure
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.080]   and strategy,
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.080]   central to our ability
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.080]   to change the world, investing for the better,
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.080]   it's very clear that's what we've done,
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.080]   but I yet repeat as I say in the beginning,
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.080]   in my previous introduction,
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.080]   ideas are a dime a dozen,
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.080]   implementation is anything,
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:56.080]   is everything,
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.080]   so I'm shameless about taking every
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.080]   opportunity to be with
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.080]   our crew members,
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:04.080]   to provide what leadership I can,
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.080]   the commitment, they provide the leadership,
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.080]   the commitment, the loyalty,
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:10.080]   the professional skills and the human values,
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:12.080]   that have been essential
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:14.080]   and remain essential to Vanguard's success,
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.080]   and whatever further success
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:18.080]   we might achieve before we
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.080]   celebrate our 50th anniversary,
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:22.080]   and God willing our 100th,
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.080]   which I also expect
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.080]   to be around for,
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.080]   and then
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.080]   maybe I'll be satisfied with
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.080]   well I'm just having this
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:34.080]   88th anniversary this year,
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.080]   so maybe I'll be there for this one, who knows,
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.080]   but these crew members are our legacy,
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.080]   and they are the keepers of our value,
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.080]   leadership, Tom,
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.080]   really can keep those values, you can try and
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.080]   reinforce them, but it all comes
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.080]   from the people who are working day after day
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.080]   together, so there's
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.080]   been great joy in my life, you can probably tell,
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.080]   in these past
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:56.080]   40 years, I love
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.080]   the joy of the battle,
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.080]   I love
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:02.080]   working on the firing line
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.080]   with the crew,
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.080]   those who do the hard work,
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:08.080]   thankless work, often thankless
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:10.080]   serving our clients and owners,
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:12.080]   and I get such joy
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.080]   every day of going
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.080]   over to our galley for lunch,
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.080]   waving to our crew, chatting
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:20.080]   with them, meeting with them on
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.080]   so many fine teams, and I mentioned large
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.080]   and small, and visiting
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:26.080]   on their anniversaries and so on.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:28.080]   So,
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:30.080]   um,
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.080]   let's say
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:34.080]   a couple more things before we get
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:36.080]   all whistled, um,
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.080]   as the days
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.080]   fly on, of course
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.080]   I age, I reckon
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.080]   I don't really feel it, he says,
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.080]   well maybe I feel it, but not
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:48.080]   in my mind, uh,
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.080]   I recognize the time will come
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.080]   when I won't be able to engage
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.080]   in the mission, but I said to myself,
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:56.080]   to continue to speak out
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.080]   for truth and integrity and character in the
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.080]   global plans, striving to build
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.080]   I really do, a better word for investors,
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:04.080]   not just Vanguard investors, but
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.080]   honest to God, down to earth, you've heard this
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.080]   before and I'll repeat it again, human
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:10.080]   beings deserve a fair shake.
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:12.080]   One's strength to carry on
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:14.080]   alas, does not,
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.080]   cannot
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:18.080]   go on forever.
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:20.080]   In my case, the spirit
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.080]   is more willing than ever,
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:24.080]   but the flesh
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.080]   weakens.
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:28.080]   So, for me,
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.080]   the human beings have been part of my
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:32.080]   long career, including all of you,
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.080]   including our Vanguard crew,
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:36.080]   and have been by far its most important
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.080]   aspect, particularly these most
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:40.080]   recent years. I'm not sure I was as considerate of everybody,
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:42.080]   very arbitrary,
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:44.080]   high-handed, dictatorial,
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:46.080]   and when Vanguard started I thought
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.080]   I had to be, it's my nature anyway,
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.080]   but I've learned a lot
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.080]   about dealing
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.080]   with human beings, and I've often
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.080]   said, I like
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.080]   human beings better than algorithms.
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.080]   And I like
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:02.080]   judgment better than process,
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:04.080]   not the Garcia I say,
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.080]   Nick's blessing, you don't require
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:08.080]   an awful lot of algorithms,
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:10.080]   you don't require an awful lot of process.
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.080]   Neither has ever been my strong point.
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:14.080]   In its early years,
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:16.080]   we were young, beleaguered, scorned,
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.080]   but by the mid-80s we developed the momentum,
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.080]   and it's continued ever since,
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:22.080]   building the same bullies and whereabouts
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:24.080]   strategy of power destruction.
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:26.080]   So, in this rapidly
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:28.080]   changing world,
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:30.080]   how many firms
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:32.080]   can say that? They're doing the same thing
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.080]   they've been doing for 40 years,
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:36.080]   and it still works.
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.080]   Especially in those early years
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:40.080]   when success was by no means assured, as I told you,
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.080]   my highest priorities
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.080]   were the need to be
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.080]   optimistic every day, no matter
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:48.080]   how many reverses there were.
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:50.080]   Set the standards for commitment,
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:52.080]   I basically had to be
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.080]   the longest working person there,
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:56.080]   I had to be the first one in the morning,
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:58.080]   and the last one out at night,
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:00.080]   and I was probably not quite the first,
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.080]   but I was usually in the office
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:04.080]   at 6.30, left at 6.30.
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.080]   No, that didn't mean I didn't work at all.
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:08.080]   It's 6.30 in the morning
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:10.080]   and 6.30 at night.
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:12.080]   But, um,
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.080]   to communicate openly
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:16.080]   and to give the crew the strength
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:18.080]   to carry on,
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:20.080]   turn about as fair play, and today
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.080]   it is our crew and all
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.080]   of you at Fogelheads
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:26.080]   who are giving me the strength to carry on.
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:28.080]   The tables have been turned.
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.080]   These have not, these recent years,
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.080]   have not been the easiest for me,
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:34.080]   surprisingly, but I carry on
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.080]   because of your confidence, our crew's confidence,
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.080]   your collective way
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:40.080]   to improve, your respect, your admiration,
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:42.080]   and as some crew members
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.080]   have put it, maybe you too,
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.080]   your love
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:48.080]   to have a life
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:50.080]   and possibly
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:52.080]   be more rewarding.
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.080]   I quoted this song
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.080]   in my
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:58.080]   63rd anniversary
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.080]   in business, beginning with Wellington,
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:02.080]   earlier
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.080]   in summer, I guess,
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.080]   which was the day of July 9th,
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:08.080]   my 63rd anniversary at work,
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.080]   and I concluded with
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:12.080]   a nice little song.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.080]   Sometimes
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:16.080]   in our lives we all have pain,
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:18.080]   we all have sorrow,
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.080]   but if we are wise,
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.080]   we know that
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.080]   there is always tomorrow.
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:26.080]   Lean on me
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:28.080]   when you're not strong.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:30.080]   Lean on me
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:32.080]   and I'll be your friend.
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.080]   I'll carry on.
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:36.080]   I'll carry on.
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:38.080]   And
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:40.080]   at the end of that,
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:42.080]   you know the song.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.080]   Lean on me
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.080]   and I know I lean on you.
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:48.080]   So it's been a fabulous time.
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:52.080]   I am very reflective
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:54.080]   of it. I'll lean until I'm going to need
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.080]   somebody to lean on.
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:58.080]   So,
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.080]   thanks Bobleheads.
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.080]   I lean on you, you lean on me,
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:04.080]   and it's been a very
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:06.080]   rewarding part of life.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:08.080]   The main thing I've tried
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:10.080]   to do
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.080]   is
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.080]   I quoted
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.080]   that document. The main thing
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.080]   I've tried to do since we were founded in 1974
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:20.080]   is create a working environment
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.080]   and an investment environment
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.080]   based on integrity and service
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:26.080]   and values.
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:28.080]   A place where each of us, after Abraham
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:30.080]   and Lincoln, first inaugural,
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:32.080]   each of us are touched by the better
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:34.080]   angels of our nature.
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:36.080]   So,
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.080]   that concludes my rather lengthy remarks.
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.080]   Before we even get to the deck
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.080]   of slides, which Michael will help me
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:44.080]   with, so we'll just pause for a minute.
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:46.080]   We should take maybe a five minute break
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:48.080]   and we'll get these slides together.
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:50.080]   Is that okay, Mike? Sure. Okay, let's
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.080]   just sit and relax here.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:54.080]   [applause]
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:56.080]   [applause]
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.080]   [applause]
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:00.080]   [applause]
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:10.080]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
