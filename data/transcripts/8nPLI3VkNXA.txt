[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.760]   So this is a tough one.
[00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.800]   I feel like it's like asking you to pick your favorite child, right?
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.440]   I've done 200 episodes now, which by the way, we never really
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.560]   celebrated because we just put out an episode as number 200.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.820]   So I don't think I could pick one because as I, I just scrolled through
[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.760]   the list right in front of me and I was like, Oh man, I'd love that
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.040]   takeaway from talking about negotiation.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.000]   That was super meaningful.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.520]   If you ask which one I recommend the most, I often recommend people
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.160]   check out the Arthur Brooks episode.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.860]   I did about happiness because I think it just kind of opened my eyes to a topic.
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.560]   I hadn't thought about a lot and this is a bit of a weird answer, but the
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.880]   research I did for the points versus cashback episode was really meaningful
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.800]   to me because it really twisted my mindset on the value of points and
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.280]   it's just kind of changed the way I think about a lot of things.
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.840]   Sometimes when I do a solo episode, it's not the end result that is so powerful.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.480]   It's the fact that I did 30, 40, 50 hours of research going into it.
