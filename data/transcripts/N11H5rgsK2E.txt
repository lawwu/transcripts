[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.360]   Hi, I'm John Benzinger, and my reading from the Legacy Standard Bible is from Psalm 107.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.980]   "Oh, give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his lovingkindness endures forever.
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.800]   Let the redeemed of Yahweh say so, whom he has redeemed from the hand of the adversary,
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.960]   and gathered from the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.340]   the south.
[00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.040]   They wandered in the wilderness along the way of the wasteland; they did not find an
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.920]   inhabited city.
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.360]   Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted within them.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.660]   Then they cried out to Yahweh in their trouble; he delivered them out of their distress.
[00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.060]   He led them by a straight way to go to an inhabited city.
[00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.780]   Let them give thanks to Yahweh for his lovingkindness and for his wondrous deeds to the sons of
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.920]   men, for he has satisfied the thirsty soul, and the hungry soul he has filled with what
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.720]   is good.
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.920]   There were those who inhabited darkness and the shadow of death, prisoners in affliction
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.200]   and irons, because they had rebelled against the words of God, and spurned the counsel
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.940]   of the Most High.
[00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.880]   So he subdued their heart with labor; they stumbled, and there was none to help.
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.600]   Then they cried out to Yahweh in their trouble; he saved them out of their distress.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.800]   He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and broke their bands apart.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.280]   Let them give thanks to Yahweh for his lovingkindness and for his wondrous deeds to the sons of
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.620]   men, for he has shattered the doors of bronze and cut through the bars of iron.
[00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:41.000]   Ignorant fools, because of their way of transgression and because of their iniquities, were afflicted.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.800]   Their soul abhorred all kinds of food, and they reached the gates of death.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.400]   And they cried out to Yahweh in their trouble; he saved them out of their distress.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.520]   He sent his word and healed them and provided them escape from their destructions.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.720]   Let them give thanks to Yahweh for his lovingkindness and for his wondrous deeds to the sons of
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.920]   men.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.840]   Let them also offer sacrifices of thanksgiving and recount his works with joyful singing.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.480]   Those who go down to the sea in ships who do business on many waters, they have seen
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.200]   the works of Yahweh and his wondrous deeds in the deep.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.780]   He spoke and set up the stormy wind, which raised up the waves of the sea.
[00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.120]   They went up to the heavens, they went down to the depths, their soul melted away in the
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.440]   calamity.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.320]   They staggered and swayed like a drunken man, and all their wisdom was swallowed up.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.520]   Then they cried to Yahweh in their distress, in their trouble, and brought them out of
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.680]   their distress.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.360]   He caused the storm to stand still, so that its waves were hushed.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.840]   And they were glad because they were quiet.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.760]   So he led them to their desired haven.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.560]   Let them give thanks to Yahweh for his lovingkindness and for his wondrous deeds to the sons of
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.640]   men.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.520]   Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people and praise him at the seat of the
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.040]   elders.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.500]   He makes rivers into a wilderness and springs of water into thirsty ground, a fruitful land
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.160]   into a salt waste because of the evil of those who inhabited it.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.560]   He makes a wilderness into a pool of water and a dry land into springs of water.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.460]   And there he causes the hungry to inhabit, so that they may establish an inhabited city,
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.560]   and sow fields and plant vineyards and produce a fruitful harvest.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:40.800]   He also blesses them, and they multiply greatly, and he does not let their cattle decrease.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.800]   But when they decrease and are bowed down through oppression, evil, and sorrow, he pours
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.440]   contempt upon nobles and makes them wander in a pathless void.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:58.000]   But he sets the needy securely on high, away from affliction, and makes his families like
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.260]   a flock.
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.360]   The upright see it and are glad, but all unrighteousness shuts its mouth.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.820]   Who is wise?
[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.400]   Let him keep these things and carefully consider the lovingkindness of Yahweh.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.900]   Amen.
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:22.900]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
