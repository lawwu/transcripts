[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Well, how much joy can we expect to get in this life?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.840]   It's a great question for you, Pastor John, who joined us over the phone today.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.160]   The question comes from Cameron in Northern Ireland.
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.840]   "Dear Pastor John, I'm reading your book Desiring God, Meditations of a Christian Hedonist.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.400]   There your description of the three stages of worship have struck a chord in my heart.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.080]   I know the lowest stage well, where I feel deep sorrow for not being able to worship
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.600]   my Lord as I should.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.960]   I'm also acquainted with the second stage of spending much of my devotional time in
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.720]   a state of intense longing for the full joys of God's presence.
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.560]   However, I find myself only rarely able to experience the unbounded joy and satisfaction
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.220]   of worship which you describe, leaving me in what feels like a state of perpetually
[00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.340]   unsatisfied longing for God.
[00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.840]   How much of the Christian life is marked by an unsatisfied longing for joy that we will
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.640]   not fully find in this life?"
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:13.160]   This question is so important as a clarification of what Christian hedonism really looks like
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.360]   in this life.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:23.120]   I know that I might easily give the impression when I speak of God's purpose for us to delight
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:31.120]   in God above all things that this might mean uninterrupted full satisfaction in this world
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.820]   while we keep our eyes on God.
[00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:41.000]   But from Scripture, from the lives of great saints, from our own experience, we just know
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.080]   that's not the case.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:53.140]   So when Cameron says, "I find myself only rarely able to experience the unbounded joy
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:01.520]   and satisfaction of worship which you describe," my response is, "Such experiences of unbounded
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:09.960]   joy in this fallen world of sin and misery will always be rare."
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.960]   I hope he's not too discouraged by that.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:20.720]   I don't mean that real and deep joy will be rare, but that the kind of joy that feels
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:29.280]   unbounded, that is unmixed with sorrows and the limitations of the sinfulness of the world,
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.960]   such a joy will be rare.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:42.120]   And I say that even though I know that Jesus said in John 6 35, "Whoever believes in me
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.800]   will never thirst."
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:53.000]   Now that could be taken to mean that the satisfaction we experience when we come to Jesus never
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.160]   has any limit or frustration, but only constant and perfect contentment.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.920]   We never thirst.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.400]   I don't think that's what Jesus means.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:17.120]   I think he means first that when you find Jesus, you have come to the end of your quest
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.280]   for satisfaction.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:27.360]   Jesus is the living water and there is nothing better in the universe and nothing that will
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.280]   satisfy more.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.860]   So the quest is over.
[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.640]   You are home.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:41.320]   And the second thing I think it means is that in due time, all frustrations of the fullest
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.360]   satisfaction will be over.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:50.760]   They'll be overcome in the resurrection when we sin no more and deal no more with misery
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.740]   and suffering in this world.
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:04:01.120]   And in the meantime, we have tasted and we know that Jesus is all satisfying.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.240]   We know he is.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.760]   That's what we've tasted.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:12.760]   Sometimes that satisfaction goes very deep and very high and seems to be all encompassing.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:22.240]   More often, it seems embattled and compromised by competing sorrows and miseries.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.160]   And there are a lot of reasons for that.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.440]   And it might be good just to mention them so that it doesn't feel like we're weaseling
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.440]   here.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.320]   Like really, there is there is there's a there's joys we should know.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.560]   And it's really our fault if we could have them if we just believed more.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.560]   And of course, that's true.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.960]   There's always more to be had.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:50.320]   But there are real reasons why we will not experience that kind of unbounded, unembattled
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.920]   fullness in this life.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:59.280]   Number one, in Romans 5, 2, Paul says, we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:08.360]   So our present joy is not the full and complete joy of present glory, but an anticipation
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.520]   of future glory, a foretaste of future glory.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:23.100]   And Jesus in Hebrews 12, 2, endured the cross for the joy set before him on the cross.
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:31.880]   There was joy, I dare say, in the trustworthiness of his father as a faithful judge who wouldn't
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.300]   give him up to Sheol.
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:41.400]   But it was all but snuffed out by the horror of God's judgment.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.860]   But the joy set before him sustained him all the way.
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.220]   And that's what it does for us.
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.200]   We tasted now, but we have a hope of the joy of the glory of God.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.860]   Number two, Romans 12, 15 says, we weep with those who weep and we rejoice with those who
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.860]   rejoice.
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.660]   And in this age, there always be weepers.
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.180]   And so our joy is always mixed with the sorrow of empathy.
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:14.060]   Third, Paul himself showed that he was an example of this in Romans 9, 2, where he said
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:22.260]   he was in constant anguish over his lost Jewish kinsmen, even though he said that we should
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.300]   always rejoice.
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:31.700]   Number four, in fact, he described for us what that looks like in 2 Corinthians 6, 10,
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.140]   where he says, sorrowful, yet always rejoicing.
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:43.780]   In Paul's mind, the Christian life is always rejoicing and often, perhaps simultaneously,
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.140]   always sorrowful.
[00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:55.580]   Five, then you have the psalmists, right, who cry out continually for renewed joy to
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.960]   God as though it's not constant, as though it has to be made new.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:06.060]   Like Psalm 90, verse 14, "Satisfy me in the morning with your steadfast love."
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.660]   Well, why would he cry out that if he was already satisfied?
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:15.820]   Or Psalm 51, 12, "Restore to me the joy of my salvation."
[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:20.140]   Restore, meaning it's gone, something took it away.
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:27.580]   And so even the psalmists, at their best, are modeling for us that joy is something
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:33.860]   we fight for and cry for in its fullness every day.
[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:41.660]   Sixth, Paul describes the whole Christian life as one of progress, not having arrived.
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:47.420]   We're being changed, he says, from one degree of glory to another in 2 Corinthians 3, 18.
[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:53.480]   And so if we're being changed from one degree of glory, that means we're seeing new degrees
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.660]   of glory, we're being conformed with new degrees of glory, and there are fresh experiences
[00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.560]   of joy that we didn't have before.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:07.460]   And finally, John says that when the kingdom finally arrives, God will wipe away every
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.300]   tear from our eyes, Revelation 21.
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:16.040]   So clearly, until that time, our joys are going to be mingled with tears.
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:22.260]   In fact, one old saying has it, I think it's an old American Indian proverb that says,
[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:29.020]   if the eye had no tears, the soul would have no rainbow, which is just one of the ways
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:35.140]   that God makes our tears now serve our joy now.
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:40.720]   There are kinds of joys we would not know without tears.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:48.980]   So we need to be realistic about the fullness and completeness of joy in this life.
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:56.060]   In fact, it will never be as full as it will be in heaven when it's no longer mixed with
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.980]   sin and misery.
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.220]   Let me add one more thing.
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:07.260]   In answer to the question, "Okay, how then do we make it as full as it can be?"
[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:13.860]   Jesus says, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:19.780]   There's a blessing, a happiness, a joy that comes with purity of heart because of seeing
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:27.260]   God, and seeing God is certainly the key to having our joy be as full as it can be.
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:34.380]   Yeah, and that's a day I can hardly imagine right now, a precious hope for our daily living,
[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.260]   to see God.
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.500]   And absolutely impossible to put words to what that will be like.
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:40.660]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:16.700]   That's a great question, and it leads us into a conversation this summer with our next guest
