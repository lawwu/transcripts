[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Who's your REALTOR®?
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Seriously, who is your REALTOR®?
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Lately, there's been a lot in the news about real estate and REALTORS®.

[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   We begin with Marcus in Virginia.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Welcome to the show. How can I serve you today?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Hi. Thank you for having me.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   It's great to be on your show.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   I wanted to start off with a personal question.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   I recently sold all my rental property real estate
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   and was looking for an investment suggestion from you
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   on where I should put--
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   got a total I should have about $100,000.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   The real estate market is not looking good to upgrade in.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   So I wanted to know personally what other investments
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   that you may have uncovered or suggest I put that $100,000 into.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   What are you investing for? What are you hoping to accomplish?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   I'm hoping to invest, increase, and gain monthly cash flow.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   I'm looking to invest in cash flow.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I was recently considering investing in a barber shop.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   My current barber, he owns a business
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   and was looking to start open a second location
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   and add an additional schooling element to his barber shop
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   so he can teach future barbers for the area here in Virginia.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   So I was looking to talk--
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   I have a scheduled appointment with him and his wife this Sunday
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   to talk about investing in that with the money
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   and buying equity and income, generate income from that,
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   and a few other ideas.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   There's a car wash down in Atlanta, Georgia
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   that's looking for some equity investors.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   The duration of the investment, about three years.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   If you give--so they give a baseline.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   They're going to 1.5x your money.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   So if you give them $15,000,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   they're going to turn that into $22,000, $25,000
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   over the course of three years when they sell a car wash
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   to a known business that buys up car washes in the U.S. market.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   So looking at different things.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Didn't know if you had anything that you found,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   but just trying to figure out what to do with that money
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   to produce cash flow for myself.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   What are you living on?
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   I'm a disabled veteran, and I am also self-employed.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   So I do medical carrier work.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   So I deliver pharmaceutical products, prescriptions,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   COVID test specimens, lab equipment,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   lab specimens throughout the--this area in Virginia
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   has a very big presence with medical, big hospitals,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   home health care facilities, a lot of that.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   So I do that for myself, and then I'm a disabled veteran,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   so I receive a monthly stipend from the military
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   until the day I die.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Would you yourself be willing to work in a business
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   that you invest into?
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Absolutely.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Well, I like the direction you're going.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   If you have $100,000 of capital,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   and your goal is to invest for monthly cash flow,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   it's hard to come up with any better possible investment
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   than some form of business that you yourself work in,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   operate, and grow.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   It's not unreasonable to expect that you could turn
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   your $100,000 of capital into a business that could get you
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   $10,000 a month of cash flow or much, much more.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   That's not in any way unreasonable.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Now, the reason it's not unreasonable, though,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   is we're kind of folding in the idea that you're working
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   in the business because that's where you have the ability
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   to then change the business to its maximum amount.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   And so if you just want to create cash flow,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   and that's your investment objective,
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   then that's going to be the highest potential return
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   is going to come from your investing into a business,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   especially one that you work in.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   So I would encourage you to think about the attributes
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   of that kind of business and then go out
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   and look at the opportunities that are in the marketplace.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Now, let me give you just a quick précis on a few
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   of the things that I'm pointing out, though.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Notice I said the business that you yourself work in.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   If you're purely engaging in some form of passive investment
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   where you're going to advance money into a business
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   that someone else is going to work in,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   you're going to have a much lower potential cash flow.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   The barbershop and car wash opportunity
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   both match that description.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   They just want your money, and they're going to take it
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   and go from there.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   That may be a very reasonable thing to do.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   So I'm not saying it's a bad idea.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   I'm trying to help you categorize it in your own mind
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   so you understand what your options are.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   So think about, first of all, am I investing into a business
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   as a passive investment, just a pure money man?
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   And if so, I'm going to be getting
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   a marginal rate of return.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   I'm going to be getting something like a dividend yield
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   on my money, which for $100,000 is going to be
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   the very, very slow way towards your goal.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   If you're investing into something like the car wash business,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   then your $100,000 makes you just a minor investor,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   which again, they might indeed deliver
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   on your 1.5x growth on your money,
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   but it's just going to be a relatively small amount.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   So the question comes down to,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   are you willing to work in the business?
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   And if you are, then you can derive your compensation.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Of course, some of it would be the equivalent of a salary,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   but it's going to be where you have the most control,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   the most impact, probably the most safety,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   and yet ultimately in the fullness of time,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   the largest opportunity.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   So what I would suggest is that you think about
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   that type of structure,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   see if it fits with your overall willingness,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   and then look around within your experience
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   and within your network at the kinds of businesses
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   that other people operate that match that.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   And so look at your medical delivery business
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   and ask yourself, "Well, is there a way that I could expand this?"
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   And this could be the business, because after all, I know this,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   and put the money into this effectively.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   But on literally every corner, everywhere you go,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   you'll find businesses that you could invest in.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   I can't go further to give you a specific suggestion.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   I would encourage you to go and look at some of the franchise directories,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   read some of the franchise opportunities,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   because you're very well positioned to start with a new franchise.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   And if you start with a new franchise,
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   your franchisor will probably give you the information that you need
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   of how much is needed for a franchise fee,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   what the cash flow would be,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   what the kind of business structure would be
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   of every business that you're thinking about getting into.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   On the whole, that's the direction I would go
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   looking for investment opportunities.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Thank you, Joshua.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   I did reach out to a franchise broker.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   He sent me a list of 10 franchises that have a high propensity
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   to do well in my area.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   And the two that I selected, that stood out to me,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   were a home health care franchise and a mental health franchise,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   both with a startup cost of less than $50K to $150K startup cost.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   So those were two other opportunities that I was looking at
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   in addition to the car wash and the barbershop with the school.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   So yes, I have looked into the franchise opportunity as well.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   And let's assume that you invested the $150,000
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   into one of those opportunities that the broker suggested to you.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   What would be the expected profit on one of those kinds of opportunities,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   assuming normal results, within a few years?
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   What would you guess the cash flow would be?
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   I would guess the cash flow would be about $15,000 to $22,000 a month.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   I've also confirmed that with a young lady who owns her own practice,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   and she said that's what she makes in her mental health practice.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   That's what they're bringing in monthly is about $22,000 a month
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   with their mental health practice, and they're all remote.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   They use interns, a lot of interns, and their costs are very, very low.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   So you can see the point that I'm making,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   that if your investment goal is cash flow, you're in the right direction.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   I wouldn't be comfortable making comments beyond what I've said
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   in terms of any particular opportunity,
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   but I think you're looking in the right direction
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   and moving in exactly the right direction.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   So look around your area.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   Keep thinking about what might work well.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Consider this franchise broker.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Maybe consider another 10 from another franchise broker.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Do good due diligence in interviewing other people who are involved in this.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Think about where the franchise agreement puts you in three years, five years.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   But if those things fit your vision, I think you'd be very well served
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   with one of those opportunities.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   So go for it.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   We move to Nathan in Florida.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Welcome to the show.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   How can I serve you today?
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Hi, Josh.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   I'm making sure I'm unmuted.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Can you hear me?
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Sounds good.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Go ahead.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Okay, great.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Hey, this is hopefully an easy lifestyle-related question.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Exploration is a key part of our family culture,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   and we live in the Mid-South, so we do a lot of road tripping.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   I've heard you talk off and on about overlanding or things like that.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   So just looking at refining our setup,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   we typically spend probably 10 to 15 nights a year ground camping.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   So our typical setup is kind of a suburban.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Usually got six bikes and then like a kayak and stand-up paddleboard.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   But the interior volume is still really tight, and it may be marketing,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   but the overland setups look slick, and they add a lot of creature comforts.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   So looking for how to keep doing that
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   and kind of reduce the friction when we say, "Hey, let's go out
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   and check out this place and spend a week."
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   We don't truly need like hardcore overland off-grid,
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   kind of like Earth Roamer extended time off the grid.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   But yeah, just curious.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   I know you've looked around,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   and I've heard you talk about fewer vehicles is better.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   So curious what your thoughts are.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   When you say interior volume,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   are you referring to the interior volume of your suburban?
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   Okay.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   And you're traveling as a family of six, two adults, four children?
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   Correct.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   Kids are, let's see, 12, 10, 6, and 5.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   So they're gradually getting bigger,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   and bikes that I can currently put in the trunk
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   are starting to need rack space on the back.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   If I woke up in your shoes, I'd keep the suburban.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   I'd just add a trailer or a small cargo trailer
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   of a couple different potential varieties.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Have you tried pulling a trailer?
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   See how that works for you?
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   Not for camping in particular.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   We have pulled trailers before,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   so I've been curious about whether it's a toy hauler
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   or a purely cargo or a teardrop, things like that.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   When you say trailer,
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   are you thinking mainly of cargo for the stuff?
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   So there would be two directions
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   that I think would probably solve what you're trying.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   So if you're going out for maximum a couple weeks,
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   I don't think there's any reason at all
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   to consider going with a large structured trailer
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   that you live in.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   When I was younger,
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   my dad bought a cheap old pop-up camper
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   that we took back and forth across the United States.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   And there wasn't enough room in the pop-up camper
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   for the whole family,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   so the boys always got stuck in a cheap tent on the ground.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   And for whatever reason,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   I guess waking up with a wet sleeping bag
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   due to rain and inundation enough times,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   I grew to really get annoyed with that.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   And I would look across the campground
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   and I would see these big giant vehicles
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   of big huge travel trailers
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   and I would just dream someday
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   I could sleep in comfort in a travel trailer
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   and have air conditioning.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   And when it rains,
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   I wouldn't get wet and wake up wet.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   So I dreamed of that.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   Well, I fulfilled my dream.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   And one of the things that I learned was,
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   wait a second,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   going around the world with a travel trailer
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   is an enormous hassle.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   And I'm a very good trailer driver.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   I'm very good at backing a big trailer
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   into a tight space.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Traveling with a big trailer adds,
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   and I like driving big vehicles.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   I've driven big vehicles,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   big trucks, big trailers my whole life.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   It doesn't bother me.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   But it adds a whole different set of friction to your life
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   where it makes it super annoying
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   to constantly have this huge vehicle.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   So having done that,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   I have learned that I would only do that again
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   if I needed a vehicle to live in.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   So if you're going across the United States
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   for a year with your four young children
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   and you're gonna be full-time on the road for a year,
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   I would unquestionably recommend
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   a full-sized travel trailer or fifth wheel
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   or some kind of large RV
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   that you're going to live in
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   because you're on the road for so long
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   that you need that comfort.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   You need the security.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   You need the comfort, things like that.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   If you're traveling a lot,
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   you go with those options for the comfort.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   The problem is if you yourself go to that,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   you're not gonna use it.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   You don't need it.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   And you lose a whole lot of adventure
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   that's currently available to you.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   You would lose a whole lot of flexibility
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   that's available to you
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   by being relatively lightweight.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   And for what?
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   You don't gain anything from it.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   You wanna be outside.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   When you're camping for up to 15 nights a year,
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   then you wanna be outside.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   You wanna be in the elements.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   And if you have a rainy night
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   or the weather is really terrible
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   and you're in that situation,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   then you just bail on the campground,
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   go rent a place at a hotel with an indoor pool
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   and go stay there for a couple nights.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   And that's infinitely cheaper
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   than going with a travel trailer.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   So if I woke up in your shoes
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   from what you're describing,
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   I would keep the Suburban,
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   but I would just add a small trailer.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   And there'd be two ways to go about it.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Way number one, which would be super simple,
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   would just be to add a small cargo trailer.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   I'm picturing maybe an eight foot trailer
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   and not full width,
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   but keep it as like a six foot width,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   eight feet long,
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   something single axle
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   or a very small double axle,
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   just for the confidence of having the double axles,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   but keep it small and narrow.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   And that way you have a place
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   where you can put your bikes,
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   you can put everything
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   that's currently inside of the Suburban
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   into the trailer,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   but you have a trailer that tows really easily,
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   backs really easily,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   is really simple to put in and out of a campsite
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   and you just keep all of your current stuff
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   set up with it.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   And if you're not doing hardcore backwoods travel,
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   then that can work out fine.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   If you are doing,
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   meaning you can take that
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   on plenty of dirt roads,
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   no issues,
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   put some good 10 ply tires on it
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   and you can go down
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   all the back roads that you want.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   If you need to genuinely go off road
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   on some kind of trails,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   then you may be able to flip the axles
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   or put a small lift on it,
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   something like that
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   and have something that could handle
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   a little bit more off-road trails,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   but that just empties out
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   your driving vehicle,
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   keeps you very nimble,
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   very lightweight,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   super easy,
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   but you just keep your current ground tent set up.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   The second version would be
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   if you're genuinely going onto off-road trails
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   and you really need off-road capacity,
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   then I would consider investing
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   into a purpose-built off-road trailer
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   and one with large tires,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   a lift,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   one of those nice three-way tow hitch connections
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   so that you can handle all the bumps
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   and all of the off-road camber pretty easily.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   That would work well.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   Who's your realtor?
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Seriously,
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   who is your realtor?
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Lately,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   there's been a lot in the news
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   about real estate and realtors,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   so let us help clear the air.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   California realtors are Californians just like you,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   your neighbor,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   your best friend's brother,
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   and your kid's baseball coach,
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   and we all strive every day
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   to be your trusted advisors
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   on the biggest financial decision of your life.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   No one cares more about helping Californians
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   live the California dream
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   than California realtors
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   because we know California real estate is not easy.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   That's an understatement,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   but if you're a first-timer,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   we help you confidently get in the game,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   and if you've been there, done that,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   we're there to help you get through what's new and different.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   We tirelessly negotiate so you don't have to,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   and we help you get past all the tough stuff
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   and on to the good stuff,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   not because it's our job,
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   but because it's your dream.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   Let's go to work.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   California Association of Realtors.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   And then if you need comfort,
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   just get one and maybe put one rooftop tent on it
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   for you and your wife,
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   and then keep the kids in a nice ground tent,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   or get one big enough
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   where you could put two big rooftop tents on it
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   so you have a little bit more
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   of just the convenience of the rooftop tent on the trailer,
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   but yet you're still living outside around the vehicle.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   I think those are the two most practical setups
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   that would work for what you're describing
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   and would fit your use style.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   Okay.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   And when you describe those,
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   I'm picturing like the open-air cargo trailer,
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   not like--
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   The second version.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Either one could work.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   When I described the first one,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   I was picturing an enclosed cargo trailer.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   The second one,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   I'm picturing an open cargo trailer
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   with, again, like a rack built
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   with a couple of rooftop tents on it.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Right, right, right.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   Okay.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   I think the first option is pretty obvious
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   from like brands and stuff like that.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   Do you have any of the second variety
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   that you've looked at?
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   I don't.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   They're all obscenely overpriced
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   as far as I'm concerned.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   I know, yeah.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   They are obscene.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   Every time I've looked at them--
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   They're absolutely obscene.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   But I would go on to Expedition Portal.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   Go in the forums there on expeditionportal.com
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   and see what the discussion would be there
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   from some of those guys who know that market.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   Okay.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Yeah, has your family wound up being an outdoors culture?
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   I know you guys did the wild in the RV.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   Have you guys continued in that vein?
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Yes.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   That's where I've spent so much time thinking about it
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   and what I've decided is the only way--
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   There is no perfect vehicle
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   that works for every circumstance.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   So the only rational way to approach these decisions
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   is to design a specific trip
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   or a specific set of trips
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   and then create the vehicle for that.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   The vehicle that you want for 15 nights of camping
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   in state parks around your home
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   within a four to five-hour drive of your home
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   is going to be very different than the vehicle
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   that you want for a one-year expedition
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   from Alaska to Argentina.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   So just think about the specific trips.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   But I think that generally for most people,
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   a small cargo trailer, a nice enclosed one
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   so that when it's raining, when it's dusty,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   your stuff can stay cleaner.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   You can put the bikes back there.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   All your camping gear goes in there.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   You can bring along some slightly bigger pieces of gear
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   that make your car camping trip a little easier.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   Slightly bigger stove, bigger tables,
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   bigger, more chairs.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   All that stuff fits beautifully in the cargo trailer,
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   and yet you're still lightweight,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   easy to go down the road at a good pace,
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   and pretty inexpensive.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   - Excellent. All right.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   Well, hopefully it was an easy one.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   - Yeah, I was going to say, thanks for the softball.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   It doesn't get easier than that and more fun.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   Joshua in Texas, welcome to the show.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   How can I serve you today?
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   - Hi, Josh.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   - Can you hear me?
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   - Yes, sounds good. Go ahead.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   - Hi. Thank you for taking my call.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   And I'm a first-time caller,
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   and I wanted to say thank you for your great insight
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   and ability to foresee the future during the pandemic.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   I think you greatly helped me stay safe and myself as well,
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   and I just wanted to say thank you for that.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   - My pleasure.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   - I am trying to buy my first car.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   I've never bought a car.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   I've had the same make and model of car
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   since I was in high school, and I'm now 30.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   So I am trying to buy a car, but I essentially have no cash.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   It's close to $100,000, but it's, like, all in crypto.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   And I don't have -- I know there's options.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   I've looked at a lot of options, but I'm just stuck on how to get --
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   I need about $7,000 for the down payment,
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   and I'm just a little stuck on how to get the money
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   and, like, what should I -- or should I still do this?
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   I don't know. I really want the car, but I don't know.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   I was just saying if you could help me out.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   - How much is your income?
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   - Right now, I make about $60,000.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   With this current job, I'm not working my normal job in HR.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   I'm a compensation analyst.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   Hired back on or get another job.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   Should be around, like, $90,000.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   But currently, at this exact --
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   - So you're 30 years old.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   You're earning $60,000 a year, and as I understand it,
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   you don't have any money saved that is available for buying a car,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   but you do have about $100,000 in crypto value.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Is that correct?
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   - That's correct.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   - Why don't you have any money saved?
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   - I just -- I don't know.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Like, I've adapted to this mindset.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   I was -- when I first got into personal finance,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   like, serious, like, five years ago,
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   I kind of just was stuck on the --
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   where I'm going to invest everything and not keep any --
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   like, only keep $1,000 cash on hand, basically,
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   and, like, it's been really hard for me to break that.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   So I'm kind of just really, like, basically addicted to it.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   Anytime I get money, I just want to invest it over.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   I had probably about $10,000 not too long ago,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   and, like, situations came up where I, you know,
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   probably used it for something else, like my normal life,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   but I ended up just investing it,
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   and I've kind of just ended up in the position now
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   where I just have no cash on hand.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   - Other than the $100,000 in crypto,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   do you own any other investments,
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   such as retirement investments, things like that?
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   - About half of that is actually in a retirement account
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   that I moved from a 401(k) to a IRA, a crypto IRA.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   And outside of that, I mean,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   I have, like, $3,500 in a Roth IRA
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   and, like, $2,000 in a random brokerage account.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   - And so you have $3,500 in a Roth IRA
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   and $2,000 in a brokerage account.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   And what's wrong with your current car?
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   - There is nothing wrong with it.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   It actually runs fine.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   I believe this--
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   The reason why I want the car is kind of an image deal.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   I mean, just what I do in my life,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   like, it does kind of--
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   I need to have a nicer car.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   Like, it's something I've vacated for a long time
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   and, like, or, you know, just haven't really prioritized,
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   and, like, I believe it's time for me to do this.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   - Okay.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   And are you single or married?
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   Do you have children?
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   - Single, divorced.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   - Okay.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   So I'm totally in favor of your buying another car.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   I think that's great.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   If you observe the fact that I've got this junky old car
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   and this junky old car is no longer appropriate for me
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   and I need to upgrade my car,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   then absolutely, go ahead and upgrade your car.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   The first thing to talk about is how much money
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   you should consider spending on your new upgraded car.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   If you care about building wealth,
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   if you care about becoming wealthy,
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   then I would recommend that you target spending
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   about 10% to as high as 50% of your income
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   on the purchase of another car.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   So the more extreme version,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   the closer to 10% you are,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   the faster you can build wealth.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   But I recognize that there may be good reasons
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   to go as high as 50% of your income.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   So your budget for your next car should be between $6,000
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   and as high as $30,000 total.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   That's the total purchase price of your vehicle.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   So again, from a purely financial perspective,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   go as close to the $6,000 as you possibly can.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   But if it turns out that there's a vehicle that's appropriate,
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   that would be $11,000,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   I'm not going to beat you up and say you're stupid.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   And if you go as high as 50%,
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   I won't call you stupid,
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   but any higher than 50%, I'll call you stupid.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   So you judge in there.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   But your budget should be between $6,000 and $30,000.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   The second component of your budget
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   should involve exclusively the money that you have
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   that you can give to another person for the car.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   It is stupid to borrow money on car loans
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   because to do so will always result in your overspending
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   for something that goes down in value like crazy.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   So if you can't pay cash for it,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   you shouldn't buy it when it comes to something like a car
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   or any other depreciating asset.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   So you do have money, you just don't want to spend it.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   You first of all have some value of the car that you have
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   that you could sell.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   If you sold the car that you have right now,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   how much would it sell for, do you think?
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   Probably about $2,500.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   Okay.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   So the time to sell a $2,500 car
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   is when the $2,500 car is working well
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   and there's nothing wrong with it.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   So you could sell the car for $2,500.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   There's $2,500.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   You have $2,000 in a brokerage account that you could use,
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   and there'd be another that'd take you to $4,500.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   And then if you need to take some money out of your Roth IRA,
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   then you could do that as well.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   What I think you should be very concerned about
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   is why don't I have more money.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   So if you're making $60,000 a year
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   and you don't have money saved,
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   you should ask yourself why is it that I don't have it.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   If all the money is investments
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   because that's what I've been putting money into,
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   great, good for you.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   But just go ahead and wait three months,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   stop investing for three months,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   and in three months with a $60,000 income as a single man,
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   you should be able to save another $5,000
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   just out of your income.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   So what I would suggest is you put the current car on the market,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   see if you can start to get a little interest in that.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   Somebody might give you $2,500 for it,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   and then just start saving money like crazy out of your budget.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   And within three or four months,
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   you should have $5,000 to $10,000 in savings
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   with just those things right there
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   that you can go and purchase another car.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   The idea being that recognize that I need a car,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   so I need to save for one and go buy one,
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   and that takes a priority over my other investing.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   But don't put yourself in a mindset
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   where I'm going to go and buy a $40,000 car
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   and I need a $7,000 down payment.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Don't spend money that you don't have.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Just save money. Save money for the car.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   And if you need to upgrade for a better image, great.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   But there's no reason why that needs to happen
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   in less than three months or six months
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   that it takes you to save the money for your next car.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   Okay. All right. That makes sense.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   I don't really have anything else to add.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   I mean, my plan was to get the new car,
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   and then I was going to try to start a little rental car company.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   That is part of the plan for the next five years.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   You're breaking up just a little bit after you said
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   you were thinking about starting a rental car company,
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   which is fine.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   If you have a business-making idea
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   and you think that you could rent out this little $2,500 car
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   and there's some way to do that,
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   then sure, you could probably make more money with it as a rental
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   than what you're going to get selling it out in the open market.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   I'm not saying no to any of those things,
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   and I would give you full rights of decide whatever is best for you.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   I just want you to follow two or three rules.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Rule number one is 10% of your income
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   is the total value of the car up to as high as 50%,
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   so your budget should be $6,000 to as high as $30,000.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   Rule number two, you only buy what you can afford to pay cash for,
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   and so you have to actually save it,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   or you have to sell some investment that you've previously made
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   and use that money to purchase the next car.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   And then number three is think really carefully
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   about what you actually need from the perspective of image,
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   whatever you're trying to express,
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   and make a wise decision into a smart car
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   that will fit this image issue without being stupid.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   So for example, image issue might mean
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   I need to drive a car that is a little bit newer.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   Well, maybe a Tesla Model 3 or something like that
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   doesn't come with the baggage that it gives you a high-performance,
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   high-functioning car that doesn't come with the baggage of a BMW 3 Series.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   And so you don't want image to be kind of this aspirational thing
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   because what happens is frequently when people say that,
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   they turn towards the entry model of a luxury brand,
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   and the entry model of a luxury brand winds up making you look stupid
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   because, "Look, I got my BMW 3 Series."
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   Yeah, you just weren't rich enough
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   to actually afford a decent car with that company,
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   and now you wind up with high ownership costs, high maintenance costs,
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   and it just turns into a piece of junk very quickly.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   So I think the perfect car for most guys, for most people, is a Toyota Prius.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   Unless you need something that has a higher level of sex appeal,
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   in which case go and find some kind of crossover SUV or something like that
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   that kind of doesn't fit any kind of image issues,
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   a Toyota Prius is a perfect vehicle.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   No one knows whether you're a greenie or just smart with money,
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   and yet it's a great, reliable vehicle that you can have for many years,
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   widely available, good parts availability, it's great.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   Otherwise, look for something else.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   Look for some kind of efficient crossover or something
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   that just doesn't fit any kind of standard mold,
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   and that way you're not driving something that's clearly cheap, clearly junky,
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   but you are fixing your image issues, but you're doing it in an intelligent way.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   So with those things in mind, go and do that.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   Just give yourself three to six months and save for it,
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   and use it as a chance to save like a crazy man
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   so that you can pay for the thing that you actually want.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   Cavanaugh in California, welcome to the show.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   How can I serve you today?
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Cavanaugh, time for you. Go ahead.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   Sorry. Hi. My name's Kirsten.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   Sorry, I don't know why I said that.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   Sorry about that.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   Oh, no problem.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   I was calling because I've been listening to you for years.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   I think we have somewhere around the same number of kids.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   I have five kids.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   Great.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   I think you have somewhere around there.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   We also homeschooled, also Charlotte Mason style.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   I feel like we've got a lot in common,
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   so it's not like our family has grown a lot.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   I've listened to you over the years.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   Sure.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   I have two kid-related questions for you.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   The first would be, and I don't know,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   maybe this is something you'd end up doing a whole show about at some point.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   I know you've talked about traveling with kids.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   I would love some tips on the financial side of traveling with kids.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   I was curious, do you play any of the credit card games to do the points
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   or the companion passes or anything?
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   I know when you did that big traveling trip, you flew a ton.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   Given that we're also flying with five kids,
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   I'm just wondering how some people do it because it's crazy.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   Sure.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   I'll answer that.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   What's your second question just so I know how to position my answers?
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   My second question is about my oldest who is about to be 12.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   He's going into sixth grade.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   He is a unique kid.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   I would say he's very dyslexic.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   He struggles with that.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   He loves audiobooks.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   He actually spends more time listening to audiobooks than anyone I've ever
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   known.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   Hours and hours a day.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   He's absolutely insecure because of his dyslexia.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   He ended up being very athletic and does very well in several sports to the
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   point where we ended up involving him in travel sports,
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   which is always one of those things I said we'd never do.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   Amazing how our commitments go out the window when we face a circumstance
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   where all of a sudden I need to do this thing that I said I would never do.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   I spent years saying we would never do that, but here we are.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   He's also the kind of kid that has a really good head on his shoulders and
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   is very financially savvy.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   He's always starting different businesses and has saved several thousand
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   dollars at only 11 and is already investing in the stock market.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   He just loves that kind of thing.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   He's already thinking about what kind of career he wants in the future.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   When you're talking about all the different trades and everything,
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   that's kind of -- we've had a couple conversations about it, too.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   Interestingly, his latest idea is that he wants to be a plumber and start his
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   plumbing empire, as he calls it, because his dad is self-employed and owns his
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   own business, too.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   He's familiar with the concept.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   I'm just curious if you were talking to a kid in that situation, you tend to
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   have good outside-the-box ideas.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   What kind of thing?
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   He's great with his hands.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   He does all kinds of things.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   I'm just curious if you had any directions to start looking into for him.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   Absolutely.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   First of all, let's start with that one, and then I will answer the travel
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   question directly.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   I just want to do it, and I'll do it now in this show rather than saving it for
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   another episode, because somehow my list of shows I should do tends to be longer
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   than the shows that I do do.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   First, I would say that even though your son has profound dyslexia, he shouldn't
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   automatically avoid some kind of academic or intellectual work.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   I want to say two stories.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   First, Andrew Pudowa, who is a well-known speaker in the homeschool – Pudowa, I
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   think he says his name anyway.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   I'm pretty sure we've listened to his interviews of his son, because he's also
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   dyslexic.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   Are you saying the right thing yet?
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   Good.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   For those who are uninitiated, he's the guy who started something called the
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   Institute for the Excellence in Writing, is well-known in homeschool circles,
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   speaks at all the conferences.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   As I understand his story, he had his son, who was profoundly dyslexic, couldn't
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   read a book with his eyes until he was 15 years old, something like that, and
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   just couldn't do anything with his eyes until he was in his teenage years.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   I don't know what he ultimately broke through with, but what Andrew would say
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   is that this son of his, he did everything with audiobooks, and this son of his
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   never stopped listening to audiobooks.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   Basically, his entire homeschool education was audiobooks.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   As it turns out, because I listened to a seminar that he gave on how to teach
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   people to be effective writers, he alleged that this son of his was actually a
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   better writer when they were able to develop strategies to deal with the
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   dyslexia, he was a better writer than any of his other children.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   In thinking back about it, he realized that because he had had so much exposure
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   to the verbal language, his son had a much deeper connection with language than
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   any of his children did who read with their eyes.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   It was based upon that that actually convinced me to not try to get away from
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   audiobooks as a means of learning.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   The point that he alleged in the talk that I listened to was that when children
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   are very skilled at reading with their eyes, then they have a tendency to skip
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   over the language and just read for meaning, whereas when someone's always
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   reading with his ears, then he hears the language all the time, and thus the
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   beauty of the language is imprinted on him more to a deeper level.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   We live in 2024, in which not only is there massive profusion of professionally
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   recorded audiobooks, but also we have really good AI voice generation where any
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   document can be read aloud to your son, and so he can have amazing access to the
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   text, and I would just make everything reading with his ears while you work with
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   whatever therapists and things like that who are working for solutions for him to
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   be able to function in reading with his eyes.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   The second thing I would say is that this in no way diminishes his long-term
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   success.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   My friend Mikel Thorup has an interesting story.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   He runs Expat Money, and he dropped out of school when he was 12 or 13 years old,
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   and one of the big issues for him was dyslexia.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   He couldn't do well in school, and he just couldn't conquer it.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   So he dropped out of school, started traveling the world, and thought, "I just
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   can't learn.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   I'm not fit for learning in any way, shape, or form."
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   Later on, he figured out that he could read using audiobooks, and so today he
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   listens to audiobooks constantly, and he reads over 100 books a year, and he does
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   it all by listening to audiobooks at about 3x speed, and that's how he consumes his
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   reading.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   He runs a multimillion-dollar business, is financially independent, travels the
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   world, he and his wife have three beautiful children.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   He's in no way limited by the learning disability that gave issues for him when
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   he was younger because he figured out how to work with it.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   And so today, with the world of audiobooks, especially with accelerated
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   audiobook listening, your son can use that to learn just as well as anyone else.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   And then if you'll continue to get him therapy until he figures out something
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   that works for him to be able to read with his eyes effectively and knowing that it
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   might take many more years, I don't think he should just automatically walk away
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   from a life of the mind because of this, but rather he should approach it from the
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   perspective of, "I can do this, and I can also do these other great things because
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   there's nothing wrong with blue-collar businesses.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   There's nothing wrong with any of these businesses."
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   But he shouldn't just automatically let his dyslexia be seen as something that is
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   a handicap that can't be overcome.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   It can be overcome, it is being overcome, and it can continue to be overcome,
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   especially in today's world.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   Who's your realtor?
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   Seriously, who is your realtor?
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   Lately, there's been a lot in the news about real estate and realtors,
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   so let us help clear the air.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   California realtors are Californians just like you, your neighbor, your best friend's
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   brother, and your kid's baseball coach.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   And we all strive every day to be your trusted advisors on the biggest financial
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   decision of your life.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   No one cares more about helping Californians live the California dream than
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   California realtors because we know California real estate is not easy.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   That's an understatement.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   But if you're a first-timer, we help you confidently get in the game.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   And if you've been there, done that, we're there to help you get through
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   what's new and different.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   We tirelessly negotiate so you don't have to, and we help you get past all the
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   tough stuff and on to the good stuff, not because it's our job,
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   but because it's your dream.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   Let's go to work.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   California Association of Realtors.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   Yeah, I appreciate that.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   I think a good bit of it, I mean, he, when you were saying has a better command
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   of language, I would absolutely say his vocabulary and command of language are
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   surpasses, like, any other kids I know his age.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   And I would say he is exposed to great literature all the time.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   And we've really prioritized audiobooks.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   We've done Speechify.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   We have done a lot of the, like, AI language stuff.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   And I'm really thankful that, at least if he's dyslexic,
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   he's dyslexic in 2024 where we can, you know,
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   there's so many tools that we can use to help him.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   And I do think, like, learning to advocate for himself,
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   to be able to use those tools in other situations is,
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   and it's still something, despite having encouraged him that way,
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   it's something he definitely feels a lot of embarrassment about.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   And, you know, we're working with him, but it's hard to be a middle school
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   boy, you know, so we have sympathy that way, too.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   Of course.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   But nonetheless, I mean, and so we are, you know,
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   I don't want him to think that any career path is closed for him, too.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   But at the same time,
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   he's absolutely one of those kids that, like,
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   loves to think about the future and, like, plan for the future.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   And he already does like to consider a career.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   So I guess, yeah, I was just curious if there was anything,
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   while we don't want to close doors for him, just, I don't know,
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   any other off-the-wall ideas?
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   Because I notice you tend to be good at that.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   Yeah, well.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   You always have an idea that I've never thought of before.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   Hopefully just some inspiration is important.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   And he needs to just understand that, you know, people are different.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   And one of the things that I'm,
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   it's very easy to poke fun at the kinder,
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   more inclusive society that we all live in,
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   when that society doesn't fit the values that we ourselves want to espouse.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   But I want to appreciate the fact that we do live in a kinder,
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   more inclusive society.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   And it's less,
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   and we're much less likely to spend our time criticizing people
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   for fundamental characteristics that are innate to who they are,
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   when we, instead of just appreciating them for who they are.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   And so one of the things that I've noticed,
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   I've noticed this specifically with autism,
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   that if we went back five or ten years,
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   somebody with autism, you know,
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   a diagnosis of autism felt like a stigma.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   Today, I joke about autism because I'm convinced that a lot of forms of autism
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   are basically a superpower.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   And similar things, ADHD is in some ways a superpower.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   I don't know if dyslexia is a superpower.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   I don't have an argument that it is.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   But the point is simply that these things are,
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   these differences are not differences to be shunned
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   or to be made fun of or discriminated against.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   They're things that genuinely we can work with.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   And so any way that we can inspire his confidence is important.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   I would try to look around and recognize
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   that there are lots and lots of very successful people
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   who are totally dyslexic,
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   and they have been able to figure out ways to deal with it,
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   and in the fullness of time,
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   that there are plenty of benefits to it.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   I've been thinking and thinking and thinking.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   I heard some wacko theory about dyslexia at one point in time,
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   about it being misdiagnosed.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   I can't remember the wacko theory,
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   but go out and look for some wacko theories about dyslexia
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   and see if there's something that you've not considered or not tried.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   But beyond that, I just want to encourage him
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   that you're doing great and keep it up.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   Listening to audiobooks is just as effective as reading them.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   Reading them with your ears is just as effective as reading them with your eyes.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   And I think that the fact that he's in a homeschool environment
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   and he's great at sports, we can work on his strengths.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   And you don't need to--
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   truly, your gifts make a place for you in the world.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   And he should just always lean into his strengths
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   and try to, from time to time, shore up weaknesses.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   But a lot of times, people spend so much time
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   focusing on their weaknesses instead of their strengths
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   that become superpowers.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   And a really powerful tool of success
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   is to focus doggedly on the things that you're really good at
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   and then just let the other things slide.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   And so lean into athletics, lean into literature,
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   lean into whatever is appropriate for him.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   And you can be a world-class speaker.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   You don't have to be able to write to be a world-class speaker.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   So there's plenty of ways to make up for it.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   Let me pivot back now to traveling with children
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   and give you some suggestions.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   First and foremost,
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   I would say that reality always means that we need to acknowledge
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   that it's going to be different traveling with five children
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   than it is traveling with no children.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   And so let's just acknowledge it.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   And that's going to mean that our travels are going to look different
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   when we have five children
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   than they are when we have no children.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   And that's not a bad thing.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   If I have the choice between having five children
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   and traveling in our minivan
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   on a regional or national basis doing road trips around our house
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   versus having no children
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   and spending my time on an airplane
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   bouncing from country to country to country,
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   I'm going to pick the five children every single time
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   because that ultimately in the long run
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   is going to be much more fulfilling
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   and much more effective and a much better lifestyle
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   for everyone above than the bouncing around the world.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   In addition, even for the children,
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   if you grow up as one of five children
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   and your family travel involves traveling around
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   in the family SUV on a regional level,
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   whereas the single only child of your friend
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   is traveling around the world with her parents
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   who can easily buy her plane tickets,
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   I think that there's so much more to be had
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   for the kid that's got four siblings.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   There's so much more to be had from that
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   than bouncing around the world
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   that again I would make that choice again.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   I was just this weekend starting a mini outline of a show
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   that basically traveling is wildly overrated
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   and international travel is wildly overrated
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   because I believe it's important that guys like me
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   who talk about travel and talk about the stuff that we did
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   and I took my children to 16 countries last year
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   so I do have some credentials and bona fides in this area
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   and on the whole while I'm happy about a lot of it,
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   I would say a lot of it is wildly overrated
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   and especially for Americans living in the United States,
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   a lot of international travel is just overrated.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   Most travel in the United States is better
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   than traveling around the world on every objective level.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   The primary reason many people want to do international travel
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   is as a status symbol
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   because as the world has shrunk
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   and as more and more luxury goods have become more common,
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   more cheaply priced, things like that,
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   one of the last remaining status symbols
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   that we can show to others that's not easily achievable
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   has been international travel
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   and so a lot of travel and travel ambition
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   is related to status symbols
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   and I myself am not immune to this.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   One of the reasons I travel is because it allows me to say,
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   "Hey, I've been to all these countries.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   I've been to all these places around the world."
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   It's not only that, so I don't want to oversell the point,
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   but I do want to make sure that we understand
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   that in many cases we're not talking about something that's real.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   Let's say you want to take a vacation to Hawaii
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   or you want to take a vacation to Costa Rica.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   I'm going to bet that on the whole your vacation to Hawaii
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   is going to wind up being cheaper and nicer
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   and a better, more relaxing experience
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   than your vacation to Costa Rica.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   Hawaii is better, everything's simpler,
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   but oh, you didn't get a stamp in your passport.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   Yeah, but so what?
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   If I was looking for the experience,
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   the experience within the United States
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   is probably going to be better on the whole,
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   cheaper on the whole, all things considered,
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   than the experience abroad.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   So if we're going to travel abroad,
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   there needs to be some other reason other than those things
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   and so that's where I embrace the difficulty of it.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   I embrace the cultural challenges.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   I embrace the linguistic challenges.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   I assume that this is going to be worse,
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   it's going to be uglier,
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   it's going to be a more difficult experience,
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   and that's what I'm going for
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   is because I want to see a world that's not perfect,
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   where not all the bushes are beautifully manicured
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   and where not all the people have great customer service.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   So I travel to get worse experiences that cost me more money
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   because I appreciate that cultural diversity
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   and the linguistic diversity, things like that.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   So don't feel pressured that somehow
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   the way that I'm going to be a good parent
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   is to travel around the world with my five children.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   It's perfectly fine to get in your car
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   and drive to the national parks
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   and you're probably going to have
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   much better experiences doing that,
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   even if that were all you did,
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   than traveling around the world.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   If you still have a desire to travel after that,
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   great, I'm with you on that.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   Although having done quite a lot of it,
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   I now appreciate what I didn't appreciate before
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   of those travels around the United States.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   So in order to make this work,
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   you have to pull it apart into its component parts
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   and figure out where does the cost of travel come from.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   And what most people focus on, I think,
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   is often the wrong thing.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   So airplane tickets are, in general,
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   shockingly cheap if you're flexible on time and location.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   So you alluded to traveling with credit card points,
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   things like that.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   It is possible to travel with credit card points.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   I did a whole podcast on the value of credit card points.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   I have traveled on credit card points.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   I've got some travels planned this fall
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   with like an eight-country tour
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   that is all booked on points.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   So I've done it and I'm not opposed to it.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   What I would say is it's broadly overrated.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   And so the people who should use credit card points
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   are generally people who just have high structural expenses,
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   usually in a business,
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   where they book tens of thousands of costs
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   and business expenses,
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   and they can just put that on credit cards.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   So if you've got tens of thousands of dollars
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   of business expenses that are spendable as credit cards,
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   do that, collect the points, and travel that way.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   But the idea of travel hacking
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   for the purposes of collecting points,
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   I think, is probably a poor use of time.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   Not that it can't work,
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   but I don't think it's the highest and best use of time.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   The secret to traveling inexpensively with children
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   is to travel when it's cheap,
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   to travel to the places that it's cheap to travel.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   And so what you are more interested in
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   is low-cost airfare.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   It's hard to book seven tickets on points
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   because much of the reward travel
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   doesn't have availability for seven tickets at a time.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   And you're probably not going to collect enough points
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   that you can get seven first-class seats
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   like the travel hacker people want.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   But what you can do is you can get inexpensive tickets
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   to all kinds of places,
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   especially if you're flexible on dates.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   So each coast of the United States
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   has different places that you can travel inexpensively.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   From California,
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   you have all of the Asian low-cost carriers
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   that can get you back and forth to Asia pretty expensively.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   You've got ZipAir that can get you to Tokyo for a few hundred dollars.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   There's other low-cost carriers that come in and out.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   And if you buy your fares when the fares are cheap
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   and you buy them to the places that are cheap,
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   then you can do well.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   On the East Coast,
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   there's all kinds of discounts to the Caribbean,
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   to Latin America,
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   on all the low-cost carriers,
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   and then to Europe on low-cost carriers and low-cost fares.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   So the first secret to inexpensive family travel
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   is don't try to set a date
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   that you're going to travel in a specific place.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   Rather, figure out where it's cheap to go
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   and when it's cheap to go there,
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   and then figure out what you're going to do when you get there.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   So I would spend time...
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   Google Flights has become so much better
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   that really you don't need much more.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   Spend time on Google Flights Explorers,
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   the Google Flights Explorer tab.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   That's fantastic.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   There are various aggregation services
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   that'll show you cheap fares.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   I subscribed to years to Scott's Cheap Flights,
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   which is now, I think, going.com,
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   something like that.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   You'll find other tools.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   Kayak has an explore function.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   Kiwi has explore functions.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   Skyscanner has various functions.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   All of these tools allow you to figure out
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   where it's cheap to go
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   and when it's cheap to go there.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   And this is the primary tool that I used
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   with our travels last year.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   The way that I put our trip together
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   was I found the first ticket.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   So if you're from the United States,
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   generally you need a transatlantic
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   or a transpacific ticket.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   That's going to be your big cost.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   So figure out when you can get a transatlantic
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   or transpacific ticket at a low cost.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   Then once you're there,
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   in most regions,
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   especially outside the United States,
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   you can get low-cost airfares.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   So we have lots of low-cost carriers
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   in the United States
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   that allow us to get across the country
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   pretty inexpensively.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   So consider accessing those
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   in your travels as well.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   But once you get to Europe,
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   you can jet around Europe
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   for 10 bucks a ticket,
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   25 bucks a ticket
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   from different destinations
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   if you want to go from place to place.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   So with some of my tickets
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   around Europe last year,
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   I would pay for seven tickets,
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   I paid $250 total
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   just because I picked where we were going
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   based upon where it was cheap to get to.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   And you wind up with some kind
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   of random itineraries,
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   but I appreciate the serendipity of that
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   and the randomness of that.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   So that's the first thing
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   with regard to flights.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   Also remember that
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   not everything needs to be on an airplane.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   And so every travel destination,
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   you look at it
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   and then ask yourself
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   if this is a destination
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   where renting a car
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   is going to be the good payoff.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   Because if you can put seven people
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   inside of a car,
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   your cost per person
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   goes down dramatically.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   One person traveling
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   is going to need to use trains
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   and buses and airplane tickets
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   to keep costs low.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   Another person who fills up
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   seven people in a car
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   can generally have
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   a much lower cost per person.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   Also, get familiar with the places
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   that you're going to go
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   and child policies.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   So in Europe, for example,
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   in many places,
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   children can travel on the trains,
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   not international trains
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   and not long distance trains,
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   but on regional trains with no fares.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   So that was something that years ago
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   I didn't understand.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   When I bought a car in Europe
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   the first time,
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   I did that because I said
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   it was way cheaper for us
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   to travel around in our own car,
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   so I'll just buy a car
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   and we'll use that to travel around.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   And then later when I figured out
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   that my children
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   could travel free on the trains
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   with two adult tickets,
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   and I realized
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   that makes a lot more sense
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   for me to do.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   And so think about
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   the cost per person
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   per method of conveyance.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   And there's more than just airplanes.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   There's airplanes, there's trains,
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   there's private rental cars, buses,
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   all of them have their place.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   The second thing is ask yourself
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   is the cost of transportation
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   worth the experience?
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   Let's move to accommodation now.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   With accommodation,
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   Airbnb is a major savior
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   for large families.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   I've come to despise Airbnb
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   as an infinitely worse experience
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   as compared to staying in hotels.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   Years ago we were all excited
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   about Airbnb
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   because of all the cool experiences.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   It sucks.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   I've spent so much time
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   in conflicts with owners
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   and just junky experiences.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   I will always now prefer a hotel
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   whenever possible
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   unless I'm traveling
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   with my entire family.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   In which case,
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   a lot of times
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   it just makes a lot more sense
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   to rent one apartment
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   where I can fit seven people
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   instead of three different hotel rooms
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   for me to fit seven people into.
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   And so for a family,
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   you want to get used to Airbnb.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   And you want to look
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   at the destination you're at
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   and ask yourself
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   do we need to move around a lot
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   or is it fine to go to one place
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   and stay there?
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   The longer you stay in a place,
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   the lower the nightly costs
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   that you can get
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   and the lower the daily costs
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   for the cost of your travels are.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   So the worst way to travel,
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   excuse me,
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   the most expensive way to travel
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   as a family
[00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   is to go to a lot of places
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   and move very quickly.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   Because what happens is
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   your transportation costs,
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   excuse me,
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   the most expensive way to travel
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   as a family
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   is to go to a lot of places
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   to move very quickly
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   and to stay for a very short period of time.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   Let's say that you travel with your family
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   to across the seas
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   and you wind up
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   with $600 round trip tickets overseas
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   and you're going for a two-week trip.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   Well, $600 round trip tickets times five,
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   that's $3,000.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   You're going for a two-week trip.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   Let's assume now
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   that your daily cost
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   is $3,000 divided by 15
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   would be,
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   it's too late in the day,
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   too tired to figure that out.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   My calculator broke.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   You do the math.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   30-day ticket on $3,000 would be,
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000]   I can't even do verbal math at the moment.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   The point is the daily cost of your tickets
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   is very, very high.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   And the shorter your trip,
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   now the daily cost of your tickets gets higher.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   But if you can take that same $3,000 of expenses
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   and you can go overseas for two months
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   and you can amortize that $3,000 over 60 days,
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   your daily cost is now much lower
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   than it otherwise would be.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   And if now you're moving into an Airbnb
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   in one city for 30 days,
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   you get a 25% monthly rental discount in one
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   and then another one and another one for 30 days
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   and you get another 25% monthly rental discount
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   and now you have lower cleaning fees,
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   things like that,
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   your daily cost of your accommodation is now lower.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   And then the third big cost has to do with food.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   And so travel is hard for big families
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   because the expenses of tickets are much higher
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   and the expenses of eating out now become much higher.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   And so if you're taking five children out
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   to eat three times a day,
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   then it wouldn't be difficult for you
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   to be spending $500 to $750 a day in food costs.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000]   And so you want to prioritize a place
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   where you can choose your eating out to strategic,
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   to either a peak experience or something else.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   And so you want to stay in a place where you can cook
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   and you want to go out to eat once a day
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   or once every other day or once every third day
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   and only go out to eat when it's meaningful
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   rather than just constantly eating out
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   just because we're moving too fast to stop
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   and go to the grocery store,
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   buy groceries and things like that.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   The final thing that if you really want to travel
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   and you want to travel on a budget,
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   the best way to do that is to get your own RV for a family.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   The lowest possible cost of travel for a large family
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   is to have your own RV and to travel in your own RV.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   So if you do this, and you can do this all around the world,
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   but if you do it that way,
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   you now aren't paying per person per bed per night.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   You know the beds you're going to sleep in
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   and you're usually going to pay, depending on the place,
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   you're usually going to pay a fee for the vehicle
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   for a camping spot rather than a fee per person.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   You can now have your own food that you travel with
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   and it's easy for you to cook it
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   because you have your own cookware, things like that.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   And so the actual costs of travel diminish quite a lot.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   So it's mostly about trying different styles
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   and going for a style that's going to give you
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   the kinds of travel experiences that you're looking for
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   and do it on a lower cost.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   And so my number one recommendation is
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   buy an RV or rent an RV, but in many cases, buy an RV,
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   plan for the time when you can travel
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   for longer periods of time,
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   going for two or three month trips
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   rather than two week trips,
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   and then recognize that a lot of the stuff
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   that you want to get from the travel,
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   you don't have to travel overseas to get,
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   that rather you can do a lot of that close to home
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000]   and you can do a lot of the culture stuff even at home.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   One more comment and then I'll stop.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   One of the biggest surprises to me
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   has to do with things like foreign language acquisition.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   Many people have a very unrealistic idea
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   of how effective foreign travel is
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000]   for the purposes of language acquisition.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   And I myself previously had an unrealistic perspective.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   This is one of the reasons people want to travel.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   It's actually very hard to learn languages while traveling
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   unless you're genuinely going to move to another country
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   and enroll your children in a local school
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   where they can be genuinely fully immersed
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   into the local culture,
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   which by the way is a strategy that you should consider.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   If your family situation permits it,
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   then a good way to travel Europe
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   is not to try to take an annual trip to Europe for three weeks.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   Rather, it's to wait until you've got a 15 year old,
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   a 13 year old, a 11 year old, a nine year old,
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   and a seven year old and then move to Europe for a year.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   Rent a house in Europe for a year.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   Rent out your house in California for a year.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   Live in Europe.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   Enroll your children into a local school
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   or homeschool in Europe
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   and then make short trips from your central location.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   Because once you're there, it's super easy.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   Let's say you set up a base in the UK.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   It's easy for Americans to access the UK
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   because you can get a six month visa free entry as a tourist.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   So you come in, rent a house in the UK
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000]   and that becomes the place that you go from.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   Well, now you have super cheap airfare
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000]   back and forth from London to every corner of Europe
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   very inexpensively
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   and you can take weekend trips
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   or you can take two week train trips.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000]   And so having a location where you do your travels
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000]   from a more central location
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   is a much better idea than trying to plan a two week trip
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   and buy seven tickets every year.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000]   Back to language acquisition.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   The problem with language acquisition abroad
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   is that when you are on vacation
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   and when you are traveling
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   you spend so much time focusing on logistics
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   because the daily logistics of what you eat
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000]   and where you stay
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   and what you do are so time consuming
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   you have no time to spend on language studies.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   So you don't actually wind up learning much language
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   while you're gone.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.000]   The best you can hope for in terms of language studies
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000]   on a trip abroad
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   is to have just a little bit of activation.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000]   Your best format for actual immersion study is at home
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   where everything's under control
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   and we can just do two hours of French every day
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000]   and we can watch movies in French
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   and we can listen in French
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000]   and we can read in French
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000]   and do all that stuff for two hours a day.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   And then once you have a very high level of French comprehension
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   then go to France
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000]   and spend a few weeks in France
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000]   and enjoy that as like your language activation
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   where we now have lots of chances to speak.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   But if your children have very rudimentary language ability
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   don't think that somehow it's gonna magically fix itself
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   by traveling abroad.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   So that was quite a lot
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   but hopefully that's enough to get you started
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   with a few ideas.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   - No, I appreciate it.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   That's some good stuff to chew over.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   I have some ideas already to think about
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000]   so I appreciate that.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000]   - Good, anything else?
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000]   - Oh, probably when I have more time, sometime
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000]   I'd love to call in.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000]   Push back a little on your last thing
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000]   about women in Harrison, but I don't have enough time
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000]   to do that right now
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   'cause I just picked up my kids in the car
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   so I'll have to do that another time.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   - Absolutely, I hope you will.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   I'd love to hear your thoughts on it.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000]   So please do that and I wish you well.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000]   All right, Lindsey in Colorado, welcome to the show.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   How can I serve you today, Lindsey?
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000]   - Hi Joshua, it's good to talk with you.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:27.000]   I wanted to get your perspective on college.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000]   I've been interested of course to hear your thoughts
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000]   on higher education throughout the years
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   and I especially appreciated your recent episode
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   on scholarships.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000]   Let me give a little background about what I'm hoping
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000]   to get your perspective on.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   So my husband and I are both highly educated
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   but not necessarily from elite schools.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   My husband is foreign educated
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000]   and then I went to schools in the US and I'm an attorney
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000]   and we've always really valued education for our kids.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   We've been very intentional about education
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   and thank God our kids seem to be, they're young
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   but they seem to be very bright, very academically inclined.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   And I would have thought that we would be doing everything
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.000]   we can to set them up to go to elite universities
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   in the United States.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   If their inclination continues, I also am of two minds.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000]   I believe that we can also get pretty much everything
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:38.000]   that you get at university in books and on YouTube.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000]   However, both the, I think that the opportunities
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   that come with getting an elite degree are just second to none.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000]   That you get both the signaling that you get to say
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000]   you're an intelligent person who went to XYZ school
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   and then you get to network and meet people
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   and just make more opportunities for yourself.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   So I would have thought that that would be the case.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   However, over the past, let's say decade,
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   I think I've been watching or we've been watching
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:15.000]   with growing concern about, with respect to some
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.000]   of the values that are, and the dogmas that are
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000]   being promoted on campuses.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.000]   Another piece of this is that we're Orthodox Jews
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:34.000]   and so I think that in many ways, similar to Christians,
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000]   we are, we have our own set of values
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   that are very important to us and that's gonna carry through
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.000]   and we want our kids to maintain those values as well.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000]   And I've been, it's been a conversation
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000]   in our community, of course, with lots of ideas
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   and thoughts going around.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   And I wanna hear your thoughts though.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   You know, both, you know, we are concerned perhaps
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000]   for our kids' physical safety.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000]   We've been really just aghast at what, you know,
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000]   at people taking over quads and, you know,
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000]   and having these encampments and, you know,
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000]   and defecating there and siding with terrorists
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000]   and yelling at students who, you know,
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.000]   are there to learn and study.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000]   And, you know, and we are also concerned though,
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000]   you know, also for psychological safety
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   and I don't mean that as a, you know,
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   in a very snowflakey way, it's just, you know,
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   if you're paying for the privilege for your kids
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:37.000]   to be, you know, taunted and then also maybe missing out
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   on opportunities with professors and, you know,
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000]   and their peers and everything else.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   And then we're also concerned about their morality.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.000]   You know, with being in an environment like that,
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000]   you know, is something that we would be concerned about,
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   that they themselves might, you know,
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000]   start to adopt this oppressor, oppressed mentality
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000]   and, you know, and all of the mishegas
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000]   that kind of goes with it.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000]   So I'd love to hear your thoughts on that
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000]   and either, you know, when to, I think about like
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.000]   the lobster test or the frog test, you know,
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000]   when you have a frog in boiling water
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   and, you know, if you turn the water,
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000]   you turn the heat up slowly, it, you know,
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000]   it doesn't jump out.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000]   But if you, you know, just dump them into a pot
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000]   of boiling water, they'll jump out.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000]   I've heard that's not actually true, but you get the idea.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   - I do.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:40.000]   - And in any case, you know, whether it makes sense
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000]   or at what point it makes sense to be looking at,
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000]   to be looking at alternatives, whether to, you know,
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:50.000]   whether we maybe shouldn't be going to colleges
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000]   or these elite universities when, you know,
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000]   when we are so counter-cultural
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000]   and they're not really promoting a lot of the values
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000]   that we espouse versus, you know,
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   just choosing the right university versus, you know,
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   making sure to prepare our kids properly
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:12.000]   for the university, you know, with facts, with values,
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   with, you know, speaking and writing ability.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000]   And then, you know, and then of course making connections
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   at the universities themselves to, you know,
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.000]   help our kids, you know, be in the right communities
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000]   with like-minded people.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000]   But I would just love to hear just your perspective
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000]   on kind of all of that.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.000]   - 100%.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000]   How old is your oldest child currently?
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   - They're little.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   We've got seven, five, four, and one.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000]   - Great.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.000]   So the first thing that's, I love the question.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000]   It's something that I think obsessively about
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   and I'm gonna give you my answers.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000]   But there is going to be a big difference today
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000]   versus in the future.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000]   And that difference is partly going to be driven
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   by what is the actual campus environment today
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000]   versus what is the actual campus environment
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000]   10 years from now.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   It's also going to be driven by what are the actual ambitions
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000]   of your individual student
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000]   versus what are the actual ambitions,
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000]   which are unknowable today.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000]   So these are the things that make it difficult to assess
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000]   because the college decision choice
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000]   and college decision process,
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   whether to go or not to go, where to go,
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.000]   all of these things are very individualized
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.000]   and they can't be defined specifically
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.000]   until we get a sense of who your student actually is
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000]   and what your student actually wants to study.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000]   Because, and then also what the actual
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   on-campus environment is in seven years,
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:50.000]   or excuse me, in 10 years for this individual student.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000]   And then where your family finances are
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000]   and what your income is and what your assets are.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000]   So the first thing I would say is,
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.000]   I'm gonna talk about it from a framework perspective,
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000]   but these are all super individual things
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000]   and there are many, all of them are important.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000]   The academic ability of your child,
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.000]   the ability of your child
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000]   to even get into an elite university
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]   based upon whatever the elite universities are
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:19.000]   or are not doing at that point in time for admissions.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000]   The changing nature of the world,
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000]   the value of an elite university education today
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000]   versus the value in the future.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000]   I think that a lot of the elite universities
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   have dramatically diminished their brand value
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000]   with all of the events over the last couple of weeks.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:39.000]   There's no one denying that there still have brand value,
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000]   but I sure don't look at a Columbia grad
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000]   the same way today as I looked at a Columbia grad
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000]   three years ago.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.000]   And so that Columbia grad is gonna have to do,
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000]   if I'm a hiring manager,
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000]   that Columbia grad is gonna have to demonstrate
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.000]   pretty significant evidence to tell me
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:06.000]   that they're not an anti-Semite racist protester of some kind
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:11.000]   who's just crazy and crazy at making decisions.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000]   I mean, that university has problems
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000]   with anti-Semitic philosophy left, right and center
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.000]   and it has for many years.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000]   So it's not a surprise what's boiling over today.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000]   So my point is that brand value can increase
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000]   and brand value can decrease.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000]   And so the value of what to actually go for,
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000]   your children are very young today
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000]   to know that as our mind.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000]   So what we can be doing is be paying attention to it.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000]   And as I would see, the basic focus that we have
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000]   is to prepare for success in any context.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000]   And the nice thing about it is the things that we do
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000]   to prepare our children for success
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.000]   to go to an elite university
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000]   are very similar to the things that we do
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000]   to prepare our children for success,
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000]   understanding that they're going to drop out of school
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:03.000]   at 16 years old and become a self-employed entrepreneur
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000]   who's going to be a total autodidact.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.000]   And we don't want to be so laser focused on college
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000]   being the pathway of success
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000]   that we don't do the broad-based stuff
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000]   that will work in all circumstances.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:21.000]   So it's good to keep kind of a general perspective on it.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000]   Let's start with the first thing that you've alluded to,
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:30.000]   which is actual risks to physical safety
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:38.000]   and actual discrimination, things like that.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:44.000]   On the whole, if there's actual risks to actual physical safety,
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000]   then you will never pursue something
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000]   that results in actual risks to physical safety
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000]   without a strong conviction that you're doing so
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.000]   as a form of protest.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000]   So that's disqualifying.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:59.000]   A college that cannot maintain a physically safe environment
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000]   where students can actually study
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:06.000]   does not deserve any appreciation
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000]   or any respect from outside people.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000]   That's 101, is maintaining a studious environment
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000]   where actual study is going to happen
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000]   without risks of violence.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000]   That's an absolute no-go.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000]   So some things are really simple,
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000]   and that's an obvious no-go.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000]   Because when there's actual violence
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000]   and actual threats of violence,
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.000]   then there can be no free interchange of ideas.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:37.000]   And it's astonishing to me how so many of these colleges
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:42.000]   that have harped on and on about intellectual uncertainty
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:46.000]   and intellectual safety of debating ideas
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.000]   are the first ones to go over
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000]   and become genuinely physically violent.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000]   And so what we can see, I think,
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.000]   is that a college needs to nurture
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.000]   a robust exchange of ideas,
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:03.000]   actual debate, actual principled debate
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000]   over difficult things with absolute free speech
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:11.000]   in order for it to avoid physical confrontation
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.000]   and things like that.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.000]   So some of those things are simple,
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000]   and who knows what the world's going to look like
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000]   10 years from now.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000]   But that's, to me, going to be a clear line in the sand.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:26.000]   The next thing to consider with regard to opportunity
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000]   is going to be driven based upon
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000]   the individual student's ambitions.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000]   Sometimes an elite degree really matters.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.000]   So, for example, let's say that you have a student
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000]   that is growing up to be a lawyer
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:43.000]   and wants to go and become a judge
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000]   for the purpose of transforming society.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.000]   Well, now, having an elite college pedigree
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:55.000]   is going to be very valuable for your student
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:02.000]   to move systematically into a position of power in society
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.000]   where he can develop influence and authority and power.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000]   And so it's much more compelling for him
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.000]   to go and attend an elite university,
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000]   even if he does face some form of discrimination
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000]   and difficulty, things like that,
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000]   because that elite pedigree really matters
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.000]   in something like a legal field,
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.000]   especially if your goal is to be a federal judge
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.000]   or an influential person in government,
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000]   things like that.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000]   That's very different than if your student
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000]   just wants to make money
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.000]   and is just going to go and get a general business degree
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.000]   from a school.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000]   In that case, going to an elite college
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000]   is not a particular "so what."
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000]   You know, okay, it was nice that you got in,
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000]   but a few years later it's not nearly as impactful
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.000]   as something like law.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000]   So that's why I say it's too young to think about,
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000]   because you have to get an idea
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000]   of what direction your child is going to go in.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.000]   Similarly, with regard to cost and the ability to get in,
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000]   one of the things that's so fascinating
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000]   about the elite universities
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000]   has to do with how accessible they are
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.000]   to students who demonstrate financial need
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000]   and how everything changes
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000]   if your schooling is being paid for.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.000]   So as I discussed in that scholarship podcast,
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000]   I remember being an undergraduate business student,
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:19.000]   pulling up the Harvard business degree page
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.000]   and seeing the tuition and saying,
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000]   "Well, I don't have that money, so of course I can't go.
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000]   There's just no way I can do it."
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000]   What I didn't understand
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000]   is that all of the elite Ivy League universities,
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.000]   they all have need-based tuition.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000]   They don't offer merit scholarships,
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000]   but they all offer need-based tuition.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000]   And if a student can get in,
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000]   then the student is going to be able to go.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000]   And so sometimes going to an elite university
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   that has a very high price tag
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000]   that is advertised to the public
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000]   can turn out to be much less expensive
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.000]   for a student than going to a local public university
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000]   if the student is able to be accepted.
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000]   So all of these variations
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.000]   of cost and benefit and opportunity,
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000]   they're all very individualized.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.000]   And so on the whole,
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000]   what you want to focus on, I think,
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.000]   is helping a student
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.000]   to develop strong academic ability
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000]   so that academics can come fairly easily,
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000]   so that verbal ability, mathematical ability,
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000]   all these things are pretty straightforward.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000]   It's going to require work to perform at a high level,
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.000]   but it should be straightforward
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:25.000]   to get good grades, to build those skills.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.000]   And then also, I think,
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.000]   you want to help a student
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000]   to develop interestingness,
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000]   personal interestingness,
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000]   which seems to be one of the things
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000]   that many elite universities really need.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000]   They have plenty of students
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000]   who apply with very high SAT scores,
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000]   perfect GPAs.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.000]   They can check all the boxes
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000]   on all their AP exams.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.000]   But what they're looking for
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000]   is students who have high levels of interestingness.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000]   And I think that we can coach interestingness,
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000]   which turns out to be something
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.000]   that can help you get into an elite university,
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000]   while also showing the student
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000]   how the elite university
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000]   is not in any way necessary.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000]   You can develop interestingness
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000]   and build a world-class network
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000]   by connecting with people online,
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000]   using our more accessible world
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000]   that we have today.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000]   And you can position yourself
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000]   as a thought leader at a very young age,
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000]   which ultimately is the thing
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000]   that gets you accepted
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000]   into an Ivy League university.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.000]   So all the stuff that you do
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000]   to be accepted into an Ivy
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000]   is all the stuff that you do
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000]   to not be accepted into an Ivy,
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000]   but to do well regardless,
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000]   which is what you should do.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000]   So you should just pursue it
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.000]   and then make the actual decision down the road.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000]   The final thing I would say
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000]   with regard to culture is this.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000]   Here's how I perceive
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:46.000]   the mainstream college culture.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000]   In general,
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000]   the intellectual environment
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.000]   on college campuses,
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000]   the philosophy that is mainstream
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.000]   on college campuses
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000]   has not been a philosophy
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000]   that's been able to build populations
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000]   that reproduce themselves.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.000]   On the contrary,
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000]   the only reason we have
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000]   the urban monoculture
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000]   that exists today
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000]   with the ideas and philosophies
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000]   that it has today
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000]   is because this culture
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.000]   successfully stole the children
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000]   from highly fertile and fecund cultures
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000]   who produced children.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000]   And so this primarily happened
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.000]   to Christians back during the 1960s,
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000]   1970s, 1980s.
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000]   As all of the boom
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000]   of college enrollees grew,
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000]   college cultures stole the children
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000]   of Christians in the United States
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.000]   in order to build their roles.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000]   And one of the basic tools
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000]   that they used
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000]   was a broad-scale deconversion strategy.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000]   And they were able
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.000]   to successfully deconvert
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000]   many Christian children
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000]   away from the religion of their parents
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000]   to adopt the general
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.000]   kind of squishy, secular humanism
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.000]   espoused in the major universities.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000]   Interestingly, though,
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000]   that did two things.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000]   Number one is that
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000]   those people don't reproduce.
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000]   They don't have children.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000]   Generally speaking,
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.000]   demographically speaking,
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000]   there's a very low birth rate
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000]   for those communities.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000]   And number two is
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000]   all of the highly religious communities
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000]   that saw what was happening
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.000]   started to figure out and say,
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000]   "Hey, we've got to do something different.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000]   We've got to respond to this in some way."
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000]   Some of that response
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000]   was to pull back.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000]   And so many communities pulled back
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.000]   and said, "We're just not sending
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000]   our children to college anymore.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:35.000]   We're going to encourage other things."
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000]   Many communities built
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000]   alternate institutions.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000]   And so in my own community,
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000]   the Christian community,
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000]   this is where there was a huge growth
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000]   in Christian colleges and universities,
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.000]   which said, "Obviously,
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.000]   we're not just going to keep
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.000]   sending our children off
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.000]   into secular colleges.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000]   We're going to create
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000]   our own institutions."
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:56.000]   Other points of feedback was to say,
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000]   "What is it that's actually happening?"
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000]   And so one of the parenting tools
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.000]   that I observe that has happened
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:07.000]   is that no longer do informed,
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000]   thoughtful Christian parents
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.000]   rely primarily on a culture of sheltering
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000]   as any way of perpetuating their ideas.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000]   That was a tool
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.000]   that many Christian parents of yore used.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.000]   They thought, "Well,
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000]   if I can just keep my children
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.000]   separated from the world,
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.000]   then they won't encounter
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000]   these evil ideologies,
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000]   and then they're more likely
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000]   to stay in the faith of their fathers."
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000]   What they found out was
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000]   that that didn't really work
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.000]   and that as the children got older,
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.000]   then they encountered these philosophies
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.000]   and, in many cases,
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.000]   wound up deconverting
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000]   because they felt like their parents
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.000]   had hidden something from them
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000]   and their parents had not provided
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000]   an adequate immune system
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000]   to keep them from being infected
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000]   by the urban monocultural mind virus.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000]   And so what we have done
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000]   in the Christian community
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000]   is we've gotten a lot better
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.000]   at giving our children
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.000]   a stronger immune system
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.000]   by vaccinating them
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000]   against the urban monocultural mind virus.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000]   And that starts at a very young age,
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000]   and it's not entirely successful.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000]   We still lose lots of children
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000]   away from our religion.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000]   It's a continual thing,
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000]   but we've gotten a lot better at it.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000]   We've gotten a lot better at, again,
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.000]   to use the very serious metaphor,
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000]   vaccinating our children against it.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000]   So I teach my young children
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.000]   systematically all of the philosophies
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.000]   of the left
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000]   and all of the philosophies of the world.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000]   And when you teach them to people,
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000]   you realize how absurd
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000]   the philosophies are
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.000]   or the lack of philosophies.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.000]   And what's funny is even young children,
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:43.000]   they're like,
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000]   "Why would somebody think that?"
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.000]   Like, it's just self-evidently dumb.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.000]   And so I teach aggressive apologetics.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.000]   I teach all kinds
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000]   of intellectual foundations for things.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.000]   And my hope is that that means that—
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000]   and I don't hide anything.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.000]   That's the other thing,
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000]   is that many cultures around the world
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.000]   that have traditionally used
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000]   the ability of a community
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000]   to maintain an insular position
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000]   and to be protected from external debate,
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000]   external attack,
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.000]   external of ideas,
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000]   is finding that with the Internet,
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.000]   those communities
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000]   are no longer sustainable.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.000]   Because now when anybody
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.000]   can just go to Google
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000]   and ask or go to ChatGPT
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.000]   and ask for an answer,
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000]   then now you can't survive
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000]   in a world of insular thinking.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.000]   You have to engage
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.000]   with the ideas around.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000]   So what I think will happen
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.000]   with your community
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.000]   and the same thing
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000]   that's happening
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000]   with Christian communities
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000]   is you will continue to test
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.000]   the ways to inoculate your children
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000]   against ideologies
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000]   that are ultimately toxic
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000]   to your faith.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000]   And some will work.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.000]   Some will not work.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.000]   Some will be effective.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.000]   Some will be ineffective.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000]   But you'll increasingly find
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000]   those things that are effective.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000]   And so then there won't ultimately
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.000]   be proof of it,
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.000]   but you should be more confident
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000]   sending your children out
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000]   into a world that hates them,
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000]   into a world
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.000]   that disagrees with them,
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.000]   knowing that ideally
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.000]   you've equipped your children
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000]   with the tools needed
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000]   to defend their own
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.000]   personal philosophies
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000]   in a straightforward way
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000]   and to think and deal logically
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000]   with whatever the things
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000]   that are coming in is.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000]   And sometimes, by the way,
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000]   not all that's taught
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000]   in a college classroom is bad.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.000]   Otherwise you wouldn't go.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.000]   A lot of times
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.000]   it can provide a valuable correction
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000]   even to your own community.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.000]   And so your children
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.000]   may be those
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000]   who pick and choose
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000]   from those things
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000]   that they disagree with
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.000]   and say, "You know what?
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.000]   "This is an important critique.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.000]   "This is something
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000]   "that we can bring in
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000]   "and change our own family,
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000]   "change our own ideology,
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000]   "change our own community."
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000]   So in conclusion,
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000]   from a culture perspective,
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000]   I think that's what
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000]   your main focus needs to be
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000]   is let me teach my children
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.000]   what we believe,
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.000]   why we believe it,
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.000]   teach my children
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.000]   what others believe,
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000]   why they believe it,
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000]   and seek to install
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:09.000]   a clear, thoughtful philosophy
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000]   so that they can interact
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.000]   with ideas that they disagree with
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000]   and do so in a healthy way.
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000]   And you're much less likely
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.000]   to have your children deconvert
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.000]   when that's the common cause
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000]   rather than if they just
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000]   are super sheltered
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000]   and all of a sudden
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.000]   they're sent into the lion's den
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.000]   and they don't know what to do.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000]   And I would make one final
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.000]   even just academic note of this.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000]   One of the bits of data
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000]   that I find very interesting
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.000]   is for Christians,
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000]   I don't know the data on Jews,
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000]   although it's probably similar,
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000]   but for Christians,
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:46.000]   the more advanced education
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000]   that somebody has,
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.000]   the more likelier that person is
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000]   to be religious,
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000]   specifically Christian.
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000]   So a higher percentage
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000]   of PhD holders are Christian
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000]   than non-college educated.
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.000]   A higher percentage
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000]   of bachelor's degree holders
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.000]   are Christian
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000]   than non-college educated persons.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000]   And this doesn't prove anything.
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000]   It's not a proof of anything.
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000]   And there are plenty of PhD holders
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000]   who are not Christians.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000]   I'm not arguing that the data
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.000]   says anything different
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000]   than what it does say.
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000]   Just simply saying that
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000]   somebody who is highly educated,
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:23.000]   having high amounts of education
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000]   doesn't necessarily mean
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:28.000]   that a person is going
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.000]   to deconvert from the religion
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000]   of his youth
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:36.000]   if that religion was well installed
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.000]   with a robust philosophy
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000]   and engaged with robust interaction
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000]   with the ideas
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.000]   that he's ultimately going
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:47.000]   to interact with.
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000]   - I think that's right.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000]   Thank you.
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.000]   We're also heartened
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000]   by the birth rate
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:57.000]   of some of these groups.
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:03.000]   When you value life and children,
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.000]   you value life and children.
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:10.000]   And not all of this group
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:14.000]   at campus feels that way, of course.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:18.000]   And I definitely think
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000]   it's so important
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:23.000]   to vaccinate.
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000]   I think it's a good metaphor
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000]   in a lot of ways.
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000]   And make sure
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000]   that we're very clear
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000]   about our values
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.000]   and our beliefs
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000]   and not to hide anything.
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000]   I think that's right
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000]   because they'll find it eventually
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.000]   and then would wonder
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000]   why we're hiding it.
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000]   And there's nothing to hide.
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.000]   We believe that our beliefs
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000]   and way of life
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:55.000]   stand up to anything.
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000]   Hang on one sec.
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:01.000]   I think that it's just such a shame
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:05.000]   that when we want our kids
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.000]   to go for an education
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.000]   and to learn
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.000]   and to pursue knowledge
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.000]   and seek truth
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.000]   and do all of these things,
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000]   and to have to send them away now,
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.000]   it seems a little bit more
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000]   like we have to prepare them
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000]   to also be activists,
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:27.000]   which could be fine.
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.000]   Not all kids are fighters.
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.000]   And I think that where we were once thinking
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.000]   that this is for education,
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000]   now it also seems to be
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.000]   for not ceding the space
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000]   to hateful people
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:47.000]   and hateful ideologies.
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:48.000]   But thank you.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000]   You answered the question beautifully.
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.000]   Really appreciate it.
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.000]   - My pleasure.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:56.000]   And oops, I muted me instead of muting you.
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:59.000]   Yeah, and to the point,
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.000]   I would just say
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000]   it's gonna come down to the vision.
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.000]   One of the things that I wish,
[01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000]   so there are many people, I think,
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000]   who are better served
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:10.000]   by being encouraged not to go to college at all.
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:14.000]   With the advent of,
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:18.000]   with the easy availability of information,
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:22.000]   many of the most educated people in the world
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:25.000]   are ultimately gonna be autistic YouTubers
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.000]   who spend all their time reading arcane books
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000]   that are widely available on Google Books
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000]   and interacting with things
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.000]   that would never be touched
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000]   in a college classroom.
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000]   I find some of my favorite sub-stacks
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000]   are people who are outside of academia
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000]   because basically many,
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000]   I don't wanna describe all,
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.000]   but many academics are so cowed
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.000]   that they basically have nothing interesting to say.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000]   They're not willing to touch on anything
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000]   that is potentially controversial.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000]   And so all of the great college,
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.000]   many of the great college professors
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.000]   find themselves ushered out of academia,
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000]   but they have amazing podcasts now.
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.000]   They have amazing sub-stacks.
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.000]   They have amazing things
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000]   where they're engaging in genuine,
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:08.000]   good quality thinking, good research,
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.000]   healthy debate,
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000]   and those are the kinds of communities
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:14.000]   that are producing what colleges used to produce.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000]   And that's why I'm so,
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.000]   and this is obvious,
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:21.000]   this is why I'm so anti-ethnic diversity
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000]   and pro-ideological diversity.
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000]   What has happened is we substituted,
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:28.000]   due to seeing all kinds of racial wrongs
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000]   and trying to fix those,
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000]   we took the word diversity
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.000]   and we decided that the word diversity
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000]   exclusively means
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.000]   that people have different skin colors
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000]   or different sexual attractions
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000]   and sexual practices,
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:45.000]   and we ignored the concept
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000]   of ideological diversities.
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.000]   Well, in a university system,
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000]   that's the death of the university,
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.000]   which should be built
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000]   on ideological diversity.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000]   And there's certainly elements
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:58.000]   of impacts on ideological diversity
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.000]   based upon the experience
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.000]   of different people.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.000]   But at its core,
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:04.000]   you want great ideological diversity.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.000]   So a lot of the universities
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000]   have lost their clout.
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000]   Who trusts them anymore?
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.000]   You don't trust them.
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000]   You know it's in many cases,
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.000]   in many ways,
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000]   an ideological monoculture
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.000]   where everyone's going to say
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.000]   the same thing,
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.000]   believe the same thing,
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.000]   do the same thing.
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.000]   And what's the point?
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000]   When they're actively,
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.000]   we can cite article after article,
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.000]   statement after statement,
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000]   where we know they are actively censoring
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.000]   important research
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000]   because it's not politically correct.
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000]   So a lot of the important research
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000]   is happening in other places,
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.000]   is my point.
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000]   And so there may be people
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000]   who it's dumb to go to college
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:39.000]   because colleges don't offer
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.000]   the value proposition
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000]   of what they once did.
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.000]   On the other hand,
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.000]   there may be many people
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000]   who still need a certain pedigree
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:49.000]   for a certain plan.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000]   And we really want to encourage
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000]   those people to do it.
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000]   We need really smart,
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.000]   really educated,
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.000]   elite judges and justices
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.000]   and things like that,
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000]   people who are really good at that.
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.000]   And if you look back
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000]   over the last 50 years,
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000]   over the last 100 years,
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.000]   you can see that
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000]   within a generation
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000]   or a few generations,
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000]   you can have an enormous change
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.000]   in ideology.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000]   And so these institutions
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000]   are not entirely stuck.
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.000]   If you look in your field,
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000]   just look at how
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000]   the conservative,
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000]   the growth of the conservative wing
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:25.000]   of law
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000]   has resulted in a major change
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000]   in the way that the legal system
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.000]   at the federal level
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:33.000]   and at state level,
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.000]   but how the legal system works.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000]   If you went back 50 years ago,
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.000]   it was not in any way,
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.000]   there was not in any way
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000]   the power of the conservative movement
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:43.000]   in the legal field.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000]   Today, the conservatives
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000]   are very powerful.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000]   There are, in some cases,
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000]   a majority
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000]   and very, very influential.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.000]   But yet, that was
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000]   a pretty hard-won experience.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:58.000]   If you go back to
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000]   all of the Supreme Court justices
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.000]   for the conservatives nominated
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.000]   who turned out not to be conservative.
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.000]   Again and again and again,
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000]   conservatives got their teeth kicked in.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.000]   But they didn't stop.
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.000]   They continued pressing forward
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000]   generation by generation.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000]   They got their people
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000]   into the schools.
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000]   They got their people
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000]   in front of Congress.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:17.000]   They got their people nominated.
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.000]   They got the people
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.000]   to believe that it mattered.
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.000]   They got their president
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.000]   who came in
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:22.000]   and defended the justices.
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:23.000]   And they got the change
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.000]   that they were looking for.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000]   So, is it a durable change?
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.000]   Time will tell.
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.000]   My point is that things can change.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.000]   And so we shouldn't look
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.000]   at the colleges
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.000]   and just make overarching,
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000]   sweeping judgments against them
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000]   and say they're all lost.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000]   We should be thoughtful, precise,
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.000]   and we should look
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:41.000]   at individual students,
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000]   individual colleges,
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:44.000]   individual ideologies,
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000]   individual goals,
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.000]   and make those decisions.
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.000]   And the things that we can do
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.000]   to prepare our students
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:52.000]   to succeed in elite universities
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000]   are the things that we want to do
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000]   regardless of whether our students
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000]   attend the elite universities
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.000]   in the first place.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000]   And so if we focus on doing that,
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000]   then we will in the fullness of time,
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000]   I think, have all that we need
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.000]   to help our students to succeed
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.000]   regardless of the course of action
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.000]   that an individual student can take.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000]   And I expect that, you know,
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000]   my hope within my children,
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000]   I expect that I'll have one child
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000]   who does an online degree
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000]   and gets an online degree
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000]   by 16 years old
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000]   and is an independent entrepreneur
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.000]   who never ever sets foot
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000]   in a college classroom.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000]   I expect I'll have another child
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000]   who goes and winds up getting a Ph.D.
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000]   from an elite university.
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000]   I'm sure that I'll have other children
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.000]   who do other things.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000]   And so that's, I think,
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.000]   what we should expect.
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.000]   And the backlash against colleges
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000]   is ultimately going to be healthy
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.000]   because fewer of the people who should--
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.000]   there are many people
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.000]   who shouldn't have been going to college
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.000]   who have been,
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000]   and those people need to be directed
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.000]   into other directions,
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000]   into trade schools,
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000]   into different colleges.
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.000]   And then the people
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000]   who should be going to elite colleges,
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.000]   hopefully more and more
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.000]   will be going there.
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000]   And I think that
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.000]   even the elite universities themselves,
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.000]   they're probably mostly run
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000]   by well-intentioned people.
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000]   And so while the crazies
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000]   may have all the power at the moment,
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.000]   there's got to be
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000]   some well-intentioned,
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000]   intelligent people
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000]   who recognize the harm
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000]   that's being done
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000]   to academic progress
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.000]   and who will change
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.000]   and who will recalibrate.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.000]   And they're probably not going
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.000]   to communicate that to us
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.000]   because that's not
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.000]   what they say publicly.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.000]   But internally,
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000]   there's probably going to be changes
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000]   and we're going to be
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:29.000]   in a different world
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.000]   a decade from now.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000]   So maybe I'm a Pollyanna.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:33.000]   Maybe none of that is true,
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000]   but I think that
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.000]   it's at least plausible.
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000]   Time will tell how crazy we go.
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.000]   You just look at the pushback.
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.000]   All the DEI stuff now
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000]   is becoming entirely toxic.
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000]   Nobody wants anything to do with it
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.000]   except highly convinced pro-DEI people.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.000]   But in the real world,
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000]   it's now increasingly toxic
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.000]   because it's a philosophy
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.000]   that destroys itself.
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000]   So we know where philosophies go
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000]   if we think them out.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.000]   Thank you so much
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.000]   for listening to today's show.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000]   I really value your being here.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.000]   Remember, if you'd like to be with me
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:02.000]   on a future Q&A show,
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000]   you can go to
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000]   patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance,

[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000]   I would welcome your presence
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.000]   on the next show
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.000]   where we can talk about interesting topics
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:11.000]   like we've talked about today.
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000]   Thank you so much for listening
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.000]   and I'll be back with you very soon.
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.000]   You've always known
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.000]   just how smart she is.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.000]   From her early aptitude for science
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:22.000]   to her first big discovery.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.000]   And now that graduation
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.000]   is right around the corner,
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000]   she can continue to excel.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000]   America's Navy
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:28.000]   offers her the chance
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000]   to get hands-on training
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.000]   and experience
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000]   for the career she was born for.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.000]   From fluid design
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.000]   to cyber intelligence
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.000]   and comms networks
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.000]   or civil engineering,
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.000]   she's an all-around
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.000]   professional
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.000]   who has a great deal
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.000]   of experience
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.000]   in the field of cyber security
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000]   intelligence and comms networks
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.000]   or civil engineering.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000]   It's the smart way to get ahead.
