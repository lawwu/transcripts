[00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:07.680]   yo what's going on y'all is curious mike back with another video i know i ain't talked to
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.680]   y'all for a while but you know something interesting happened i'm out here in capri right now actually
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.520]   um i'm out here with some friends and some family i was on the way out here
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:29.360]   when i got the news that i was traded um i was on a plane ride here and yeah i found out
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.160]   i'm gonna try to do this video in one take so i might be a little all over the place
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:42.240]   but i want to start off expressing my gratitude to the nuggets organization um i remember when i
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.120]   was first drafted i remember draft night um i remember the whole week leading up to draft i was
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.640]   in a ton of a ton of pain dealing with some some back stuff that i had dealt with in college and
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.160]   then all the way leading up to the to the draft and i remember getting a phone call from tim conley
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.320]   um probably the day before the draft and i had no idea where i was going to land because of the
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.280]   injury history and um you know tim me and him had the first conversation we had the day before the
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.600]   draft we never had any any interview um i interviewed with a lot of other teams and nuggets were not one
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.800]   but i talked to tim the day before and um you know then draft night comes around
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.280]   and uh i always expected to be the number one pick in the draft prior to my injury history so
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.000]   the draft night did not go as i expected as i kept kind of dropping dropping dropping until i got selected
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.160]   by the nuggets with the 14th pick and um and one of these videos i'll go into more depth about that whole
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:49.520]   draft story but um the point of this video is to express my gratitude to the nuggets organization
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.360]   um tim conley josh kronke stan kronke and the whole front office they took a chance on me that day
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.920]   um they drafted me with the 14th pick and my life was forever changed you know i went out to denver
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.760]   and uh the journey started as a young as a young kid i think i was 18 years old you know just
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:14.000]   not even really experiencing college much because of the injury stuff that had gone on and um now i'm in
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:24.080]   the nba um so my first thanks is to you know josh stan um tim conley and the whole front office for
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.080]   taking a chance on me and changing my life you know and then from there when i got to denver i had to
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.920]   deal with all the injury stuff that i had had prior to the draft and uh ended up having to get another
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.440]   surgery my second back surgery before i had played a game in a nuggets uniform

[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.680]   said i pretty much went from high school to the nba because i never got to play i never got to really
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:58.560]   play college basketball because of the injuries so coach malone i appreciate you um you know helping
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.560]   me out helping me grow as a player and uh really i remember i really broke out in the bubble um
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.600]   it was really my rookie year my rookie year i did not play but then my second year in the nba was
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.680]   really considered my rookie year because um it was my first year playing so we played for a while and
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.440]   then we had that hiatus because of covid i don't even know if you say hi i don't even know if i said
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:29.520]   hiatus right but we had that break because of covid and then we went out to the bubble and um i actually
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.400]   got a lot of playing time for the first time because a lot of guys were injured or not injured a lot of
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.880]   guys had covid so when i went out there i immediately was starting and um i really broke out you know
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:47.360]   i think i had three 30 point games in a row um and coach malone really threw me into the fire in those
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:59.840]   playoffs really as a as a rookie um so i appreciate you coach malone as well so i'm really excited for
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.320]   this next chapter out here in brooklyn i think um over there in denver i felt like my my ceiling had
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:11.600]   kind of plateaued um you know we we have a very um we we just have a way of playing you know and
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:20.640]   how joker plays how jamal plays that two-man game is very potent and um you know that's how we play
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:26.080]   and i am so appreciative of the way we play we end up winning a championship but i do feel like
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.680]   like my ceiling in denver kind of plateaued a little bit and i'm excited for this next chapter in brooklyn
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:38.640]   for sure it's crazy because me and cam are actually boys uh we're pretty we're pretty cool you know we're
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:44.800]   even having talks of swapping homes you know he might stay in my crib in denver i might stay where he lived in
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:51.280]   uh brooklyn um but anyways obviously denver got a great player and a great dude and i'm excited
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.840]   excited for him to be able to finally you know compete for a championship over there
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.080]   and i myself am excited to expand my game and be able to do what i do
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.680]   um yeah but i want to get into the story of how i found out i got traded
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:14.320]   i actually was on the plane over here to saint tropez and um you know i'm over here trying to
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:20.000]   enjoy my time before i get back to work before i head back to denver and get back to to work and i'm
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.200]   laying down on the plane and uh i got on the wi-fi and i saw a text i got from my agent and from um
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.040]   someone in the front office over in denver i think it was john wallace
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.600]   just saying you know yo can you get on a phone call it's urgent and i immediately knew what was
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:43.520]   up i immediately knew it was what was going on um so i couldn't get on the phone with either of them
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:49.200]   because i'm on the plane you know um and i just started texting back and forth my agent and i was
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.320]   like man where are we going like where am i where am i headed to and he told me brooklyn and my first
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:08:02.160]   thought was just like kind of shock honestly because i think two days prior i was walking around
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:08.640]   my uh my home in denver i actually was staying at the uh the four seasons residences and i was down
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:15.760]   there at the bar or something and um i ran into john wallace i didn't even know he was the newly
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:24.080]   appointed gm because i uh yeah i'm off social media so i had no idea i ran into him we sat down we talked
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.600]   for a while and he started telling me you know how we're going to build the team who he wants to get
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:36.080]   who he wants to surround surround us with you know and who he wants in the second unit he wants to find
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.880]   a point guard that could feed me the ball in the second unit all this stuff getting me really excited
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:48.400]   but i also think he heard in my voice that i kind of you know wanted to to grow my game i didn't want to
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:53.280]   plateau i want to keep getting better throughout my career and i think he also heard that but i was i had
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.920]   no idea you know from that conversation i'm thinking we're going to make some changes we're going to move
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:03.360]   some things around i'm going to feel more comfortable next year um coming back in with that second unit
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:08.960]   and uh i was excited for it so when i heard the news when i got the text from john wallace and uh
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:14.640]   you know my my uh agent i was shocked but um at the end of the day that's the nba that's the business
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:20.640]   and i have no hard feelings and i'm excited for the nuggets organization because like i said
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:25.440]   previously i think it was a clip that went viral last year but yeah if we don't win a championship
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:30.720]   within this next year or two after winning you know they're going to make some changes you know nicola's
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:37.280]   in his prime jamal's in his prime and if we're not stacking the championships we may have to make a
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:42.320]   change and you know for me it was tough because i wasn't able to play the way i wanted to play i
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:48.080]   wasn't able to hoop the way i wanted to hoop in the playoffs because of you know my shoulder it's still
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:53.120]   a little messed up you can kind of see it's a little popped out still still healing up but i was i was
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:10:00.400]   severely limited in what i could do in the playoffs and um that was hard that that's the the taste that i
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:08.320]   left with the nuggets fans and organization you know i really felt like i i let the team down this past
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.560]   playoffs you know i went out there and i tried but i was playing with one arm like legitimately my whole
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.600]   shoulder was popped out torn i was putting a needle in it every other day trying to get the pain down
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:23.840]   but regardless i went out there and i tried to play after the shoulder injury and i just wasn't able to
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:30.160]   be myself and i wasn't able to help the team and um you know that hurts that's that's that's how
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:37.200]   my journey with the nuggets ended but everything happens for a reason you know if you know me you
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:42.160]   know i'm a man of faith you know i believe i believe in god and you know i tried to put my faith
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:47.760]   into him in these in these situations i know that he's not going to abandon me you know there's a verse
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:55.760]   that says those who he began a good work in he's going to complete and i do believe that um so i'm excited
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:02.800]   for this next chapter i know i'm just rambling but um it's good to be able to get this out before i i
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:08.640]   go to brooklyn tomorrow and meet with everybody it's just good to express my gratitude to the nuggets
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:16.160]   and everything and kind of tell y'all how i'm feeling with everything um i'm very excited and i'm ready to
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:21.200]   to get this next chapter of my life rolling uh yeah so i got this little camera you know what i'm
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:26.080]   saying i'm gonna be dropping more videos once in a while whenever you know something comes to mind i'm
