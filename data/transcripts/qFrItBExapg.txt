[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.160]   Well, as another year inches to its conclusion and we look back on the
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.880]   smoldering rubble we call 2020, I can't imagine a more important topic for our
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.360]   focus than God's providence over all things. Of all the things we could have
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.080]   never expected to experience and witness in 2020, Scripture tells us that God
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.120]   governs over all things according to His will and for the ultimate good of His
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.040]   bride. Making that case is Pastor John and his next book release simply titled
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.480]   Providence. A 750 page book releasing in less than two months on January 12th is
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.960]   Pastor John's biggest solo book project by far and we're mentioning it this week
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.840]   because you can now pre-order the title from our friends at Westminster Books
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.800]   for just $19.99 a copy. We're thankful for their partnership and encourage you to
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.680]   order through them as you consider supporting faithful independent
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.720]   Christian booksellers. Go to WTSBooks.com to pre-order, that's WTSBooks.com and
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.640]   there you can get it for $19.99 a copy. Last time on the podcast on Monday I
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.080]   talked with Pastor John about the book and his hopes and dreams for it. There I
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.200]   mentioned Pastor John has recorded for us two audiobook excerpts, the
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.040]   introduction and the conclusion, two sections that offer a really good
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.080]   preview of the entire book. And with the demands on his time it's it's pretty
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.400]   doubtful that he'll be able to read any more of it than these two sections. I'm
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.160]   grateful that he did. So today here is the introduction, it's 32 minutes long. The
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.240]   conclusion coming up next time on Friday is 55 minutes long. Combined it's an hour
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.520]   and a half of audiobook recordings that will serve as our podcast content for
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.880]   the next two weeks as we take a brief break for Thanksgiving. We're gonna
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.880]   return with new episodes on Monday November 30th to unveil some new
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.000]   features to the podcast that are coming up in December. Looking forward to
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.440]   sharing those with you then. Until then, here now is John Piper reading the
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.920]   introduction to his forthcoming book, Providence, coming out on January 12th.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.920]   Introduction.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.800]   Four Invitations.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:08.240]   God has revealed the goal and nature and extent of his providence. He has not been
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:15.080]   silent. He has shown us these things in the Bible. This is one of the reasons
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.080]   that the Apostle Paul says all Scripture is profitable. The prophet lies not
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.880]   mainly in the validation of a theological viewpoint, but in the
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.400]   revelation of a great God, the exaltation of his invincible grace, and the
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:40.000]   liberation of his undeserving people. God has revealed his purposeful sovereignty
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.800]   over good and evil in order to humble human pride, intensify human worship,
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.720]   shatter human hopelessness, and put ballast in the battered boat of human
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.960]   faith, steel in the spine of human courage, gladness in the groans of
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:06.880]   affliction, and love in the heart that sees no way forward. What we find in the
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:14.240]   Bible is real and raw. The prizing and proclaiming of God's pervasive
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:21.480]   providence was forged in the flames of hatred and love, deceit and truth, murder
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:29.280]   and mercy, carnage and kindness, cursing and blessing, mystery and revelation, and
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:37.520]   finally, crucifixion and resurrection. I hope my treatment of God's providence
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:44.840]   will have the aroma of this shocking and hope-filled reality. In this
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.880]   introduction, I would like to offer you four invitations.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.560]   Counterintuitive Wonders
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:03.960]   First, I invite you into a biblical world of counterintuitive wonders. I will argue
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:10.160]   that these wonders are not illogical or contradictory, but they are different
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:16.120]   from our usual ways of seeing the worldâ€”so different that our first reaction
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:26.400]   is often to say, "That can't be." But the "can't" is in our minds, not in reality. How
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:35.040]   unsearchable are his judgments, and how inscrutable his ways. For example, in the
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:42.880]   justice of his judgment, God raises up a cruel shepherd for his people and then
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:49.840]   sends punishment on that shepherd. "Behold, I am raising up in the land a
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.840]   shepherd who does not care for those being destroyed, or seek the young, or
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:03.360]   heal the maimed, or nourish the healthy, but devours the flesh of the fat ones,
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:12.360]   tearing off even their hoofs. Woe to my worthless shepherd, who deserts the flock,
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:19.840]   may the sword strike his arm and his right eye, let his arm be wholly withered,
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:31.200]   his right eye utterly blinded." Zechariah 11, 16-17. This jars us. For most of us,
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:40.120]   this is not how we usually think about the ways of God. First, that God "raises up" a
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:47.440]   brutal shepherd for his people seems to implicate God in sinful brutality.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:54.200]   Second, that God judges the shepherd for his worthlessness seems like
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:01.880]   capriciously condemning what he himself ordained. There are many such scenes in
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:10.160]   the Bible, and I will argue that in them all, God is neither sinful nor capricious.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:18.240]   If we are prone to be critical rather than be changed, we should put our hands
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:28.760]   on our mouths and listen. We are sinful and finite. God is infinite and holy.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:34.280]   "My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways," declares the Lord.
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.920]   "For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:50.720]   ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts." Isaiah 55, 8-9. I am inviting you into a
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:57.800]   world of counterintuitive wonders. I hope that you will let the Word of God
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.840]   create new categories of thinking rather than trying to force the Scriptures into
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:11.320]   the limits of what you already know. When Paul calls us to be "transformed by the
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:19.040]   renewal of our mind," part of what he has in mind is the overcoming of our natural
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:24.840]   resistance to the strangeness of the ways of God. Immediately before calling
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:31.920]   for transformed minds, he writes, "Oh, the depth of the riches and the wisdom and the
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:37.800]   knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and how inscrutable his
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:43.000]   ways! For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor, or
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.520]   who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid? For from him and through
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:59.840]   him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen." Romans 11, 33-36.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:06.800]   In the end, my invitation into the biblical world of counterintuitive
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:14.200]   wonders is an invitation to worship. God is vastly greater and stranger and more
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:21.360]   glorious and more dreadful and more loving than we realize. Immersing
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:27.960]   ourselves in the ocean of his providence is meant to help us know him, fear him,
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:33.360]   trust him, and love him as we ought.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:40.040]   Penetrating through words into reality.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:49.800]   Second, I invite you to penetrate through words into reality. Providence is a word
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:59.360]   not found in the Bible. In that sense, it is like the words "trinity," "discipleship,"
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:10.760]   "evangelism," "exposition," "counseling," "ethics," "politics," and "charismatics."
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:18.080]   People who love the Bible and believe that it is God's Word want to know what
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:26.800]   the Bible teaches, not just what it says. They want to know the reality being
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:34.040]   presented, not just the words that were written. The Bible itself makes clear
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:40.120]   that it is not enough just to say the words of the Bible. The Bible mandates
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:47.240]   that all churches have teachers. All churches are supposed to have elders, and
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:52.440]   elders are required to be teachers. The task of a teacher is not just to read
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:58.680]   the Bible to his hearers, but to explain it. And explaining means using other
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:03.520]   words besides the ones in the text. Throughout the history of the church,
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:10.760]   heretics have frequently insisted on using only Bible words in defending
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:17.240]   their heresy. This was certainly the case for the fourth-century Arians, who
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:24.800]   rejected the deity of Jesus and were happy to use Bible words to do so. RPC
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:31.320]   Hansen explained the process like this, "Theologians of the Christian Church were
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:37.000]   slowly driven to a realization that the deepest questions which face
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:45.320]   Christianity cannot be answered in purely biblical language because the
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:51.280]   questions are about the meaning of biblical language itself. The longer I
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:57.640]   have studied Scripture and tried to preach it and teach it, the more I have
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:05.040]   seen the need to encourage preachers and laypeople to penetrate through biblical
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:12.280]   words to biblical reality. How easy it is to think we have experienced communion
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:19.480]   with God when our minds and hearts have stopped with verbal definitions,
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:24.240]   grammatical relations, historical illustrations, and a few applications.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:30.760]   When we do this, even Bible words themselves can become alternatives to
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:39.960]   what Paul calls "spiritual understanding." I am going to use the word "providence" to
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:49.720]   refer to a biblical reality. The reality is not found in any single Bible word. It
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:55.800]   emerges from the way God has revealed himself through many texts and many
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:02.040]   stories in the Bible. They are like threads woven together into a beautiful
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:08.960]   tapestry greater than any one thread. We are using a word that is not in the
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:16.200]   Bible for the sake of this larger truth of the Bible. Of course there are
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:22.520]   dangers in doing this, just like there are dangers in using only Bible language
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:27.240]   which can be twisted to carry false meanings while giving the impression of
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:33.760]   biblical faithfulness. I will mention one danger among others. Since the word
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:41.280]   "providence" is not used in specific biblical texts, we have no biblical
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:50.280]   governor on its meaning. We can't say, "The Bible defines providence this way." We
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:56.520]   could say that only if the Bible actually used the word "providence."
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:05.000]   Whenever you ask what a particular word means, there must be a meaner if the
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:13.440]   meaning is to have validity. So if the meaner is not one or more of the
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:22.240]   biblical writers, then when I use the word "providence," I must assign a meaning. That is
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:30.280]   what I do in chapter 1. I don't assign an arbitrary meaning. I try to stay close
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:35.560]   to what others have meant by the word in the history of the church, but I do
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:43.080]   choose the meaning. You can see what this implies. It implies that the issue before
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:51.720]   us in this book is not the meaning of the word "providence." The issue is this. Is
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:14:01.560]   the reality that I see in the Bible and call "providence" really there? There's no
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:07.140]   point in quibbling over whether "providence" is the best word for the
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:14.520]   reality. That is relatively unimportant. The all-important question is whether
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:21.140]   there is a reality in the Bible that corresponds to my description of the
[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:27.440]   goal, nature, and extent of God's purposeful sovereignty. You will see in
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:33.520]   chapter 1 why I use the short definition "purposeful sovereignty" for "providence,"
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:41.080]   but for now, I am simply flagging the danger that it would be a sad mistake to
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:48.520]   miss the biblical reality by focusing on the word.
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:53.480]   A God-entranced world.
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:15:03.560]   Third, I invite you into a God-entranced world. Jesus said to look at the birds
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:09.840]   because God feeds them and to consider the lilies because God clothes them.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:18.400]   Jesus' aim is not aesthetic. His aim was to free his people from anxiety. He really
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:26.120]   considered it a valid argument that if our Heavenly Father feeds the birds and
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:34.760]   clothes the lilies, how much more surely will he feed and clothe his children?
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:43.600]   This is simply astonishing. The argument is valid only if God really is the one
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:49.160]   who sees to it that the birds find their worms and the lilies wear their flowers.
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:56.360]   If birds and lilies are simply acting by natural laws with no divine hand, then
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:05.200]   Jesus is just playing with words. But he is not playing with words. He really
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:13.760]   believes that God's hand is at work in the smallest details of natural
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:22.360]   processes. This is even clearer in Matthew 10 29 through 31. "Are not two
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:29.960]   sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:35.520]   your father. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:44.000]   You are of more value than many sparrows." God does not just feed the birds and
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:52.200]   clothe the lilies. He decides when every bird, countless millions every year, dies
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:17:00.400]   and falls to the ground. His point is the same as in Matthew 6. He is your father.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:07.000]   You are more precious to him than birds. Therefore you don't need to be afraid.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:14.200]   That kind of pervasive providence combined with that kind of fatherly care
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:23.960]   means he can and will take care of you. So seek the kingdom first with radical
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:29.120]   abandon and don't be anxious.
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:33.560]   Charged with Grandeur
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:43.160]   This God-entranced view of the world was not peculiar to Jesus. The psalmist sings
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:49.880]   to the Lord of his specific care of the creatures he has made. "These all look to
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:55.360]   you to give them their food in due season. When you give it to them, they
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:18:00.360]   gather it up. When you open your hand, they are filled with good things. When
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:08.600]   you hide your face, they are dismayed. When you take away their breath, they die
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:14.880]   and return to the dust. When you send forth your spirit, they are created and
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:25.080]   you renew the face of the ground." Psalm 104 27 through 30. God's involvement in
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:33.320]   nature is hands-on. The kind of closeness that causes the biblical writers to make
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:40.400]   declarations like, "He makes grass grow on the hills. The Lord appointed a great
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:47.760]   fish to swallow up Jonah. The Lord appointed a plant. God appointed a worm
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:55.440]   that attacked the plant. He brings forth the wind from his storehouses. He it is
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:01.680]   who makes the clouds rise, who makes lightnings for the rain. He rebuked the
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:09.040]   wind and the raging waves." This is not poetry for godless naturalistic
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:18.640]   processes. This is God's hands-on providence. God does not intend for us to
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:26.760]   see ourselves or any part of the world as cogs in the wheels of an impersonal
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:34.280]   mechanism. The world is not a machine that God made to run on its own. It is a
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:42.640]   painting or a sculpture or a drama. The Son of God holds it in being by the word
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.520]   of his power. Gerard Manley Hopkins expressed it
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:55.160]   unforgettably in his sonnet, "God's Grandeur." The world is charged with the
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:20:02.600]   grandeur of God. It will flame out like shining from shook foil. It gathers to a
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:11.400]   greatness like the ooze of oil crushed. Why do men then now not wreck this rod?
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:18.760]   Generations have trod, have trod, have trod, and all is seared with trade,
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:26.880]   bleared, smeared with toil, and where's man's smudge and shares man's smell? The
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:36.040]   soil is bare now, nor can foot feel being shod. And for all this, nature is never
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:43.960]   spent. There lives the dearest freshness deep down things, and though the last
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:51.360]   lights off the black west went, oh, morning, as the brown brink eastward
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:59.280]   springs, because the Holy Ghost over the bent world broods with warm breast and
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:03.640]   with, ah, bright wings.
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:08.400]   Seeing the Rising Sun
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:15.440]   I will never cease to be thankful that in my college days Clyde Kilby was one
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:22.160]   of my literature professors. He gave us a lecture once on the awakening of
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:28.080]   amazement at the strange glory of ordinary things. He closed the lecture
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:37.400]   with ten resolutions for what he called mental health. Here are two of them.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:45.080]   I shall open my eyes and ears. Once every day I shall simply stare at a tree, a
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:54.040]   flower, cloud, or a person. I shall not then be concerned at all to ask what
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:22:01.160]   they are, but simply be glad that they are. I shall fully allow them the mystery
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:07.320]   of what C.S. Lewis calls their divine, magical, terrifying, and ecstatic
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:14.120]   existence. Even if I turn out to be wrong, I shall bet my life on the assumption
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:20.400]   that this world is not idiotic, neither run by an absentee landlord, but that
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:27.240]   today, this very day, some stroke is being added to the cosmic canvas that in due
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:33.600]   course I shall understand with joy as a stroke made by the architect who calls
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:42.040]   himself Alpha and Omega. Because of Kilby's eye-opening influence, and because
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:49.120]   of what I now see in the Bible as an all-embracing, all-pervasive providence, I
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:59.240]   live more consciously in a God-entranced world. I see reality differently. For
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:05.800]   example, I used to look at sunrises when I was jogging and think that God has
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:12.200]   created a beautiful world. Then it became less general and more specific, more
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:19.320]   personal. I said, "Every morning God paints a different sunrise. He never gets
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:26.720]   tired of doing it again and again." But then it struck me. No, He doesn't do it
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:33.800]   again and again. He never stops doing it. The sun is always rising somewhere in
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:41.560]   the world. God guides the sun 24 hours every day and paints sunrises at every
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:49.280]   moment, century after century, without one second of respite, and never grows
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:56.040]   weary or less thrilled with the work of His hands. Even when cloud cover keeps
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:03.760]   man from seeing it, God is painting spectacular sunrises above the clouds.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:12.080]   God does not intend for us to look at the world He has made and feel nothing.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:20.000]   When the psalmist says, "The heavens declare the glory of God," he does not
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.880]   mean this only for the clarification of our theology. He means it for the
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:32.360]   exaltation of our souls. We know this because of what follows. In the heavens
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:38.480]   He has set a tent for the sun, which comes out like a bridegroom leaving his
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:48.560]   chamber, and like a strong man runs its course with joy. Psalm 19, 4 and 5. What
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:55.680]   is the point of saying this? When we look at the handiwork of God in creation, we
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:03.760]   are to be drawn into bridegroom-like joy, and into the joy of an Eric Little
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:08.600]   running with his head back, elbows pumping, smile bursting in chariots of
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:17.480]   fire, basking in the very pleasure of God. I am inviting you into a God-entranced
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:27.880]   world. No, we are not naive about the miseries every sunrise meets. You will
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:33.600]   perhaps be shocked at the implications of God's pervasive providence in the
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:41.040]   suffering and the death of this world. The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:53.400]   And the exalting Sun dawns on 150,000 new corpses every morning. That's how
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:59.960]   many people die every day. In a world with this much God-entranced beauty, and
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:07.080]   this much God-governed horror, the biblical command to "rejoice with those
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:14.520]   who rejoice, weep with those who weep" means that we will continually be
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:20.800]   sorrowful, yet always rejoicing.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:24.320]   To know God.
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:34.240]   Fourth, and finally, I am inviting you to know, maybe as you never have known, the
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:40.880]   God whose involvement in his children's lives and in the world is so pervasive,
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:49.560]   so all-embracing, and so powerful that nothing can befall them but what he
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:56.880]   designs for their glorification in him and his glorification in them. The death
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:02.520]   of the Son of God ransomed a people for God from every tribe and language and
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:07.520]   nation. The transaction between the Father and the Son in the death of
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:14.800]   Christ was so powerful that it secured absolutely, for all time and eternity,
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:20.040]   everything needed to bring the Bride of Christ safely and beautifully to
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:29.680]   everlasting joy. Romans 8.32 may be the most important verse in the Bible
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:36.920]   because it establishes the unshakable connection between the greatest event in
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:44.920]   the universe and the greatest future imaginable. He who did not spare his own
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:54.040]   Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:28:07.320]   all things? Indeed, how will he not? All things, all things. Let no one boast in
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:12.880]   men, for all things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:18.360]   or life or death or the present or the future. All are yours and you are Christ's
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:29.040]   and Christ is God's. 1st Corinthians 3 21 through 23. All things ours because
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:38.240]   the Father did not spare the Son. When Christ died, everything, absolutely
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:44.760]   everything that his people need to make it through this world in holiness and
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:53.160]   love was invincibly secured. God the Father predestined it, everything we need
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:59.880]   and promised it to us. God the Son purchased it for us. God the Spirit
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:07.760]   performs it in us. Nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:16.400]   I would like to help as many as I can to know the God of all-embracing,
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:27.360]   all-pervasive, invincible providence. His Word is spectacularly full of knowledge
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:34.200]   about God's ultimate goal. Cover to cover it rings with the riches of his grace
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:41.240]   toward his undeserving people. Page after page tells the stunning story of the
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:48.360]   nature and extent of his providence. Nothing can stop him from succeeding
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:56.560]   exactly when and how he aims to succeed. I am God and there is no other. I am God
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:01.440]   and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:07.600]   times things not yet done, saying, "My counsel shall stand and I will
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:16.080]   accomplish all my purpose." Isaiah 46 9 and 10.
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:22.040]   Goal, nature, extent.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:29.600]   The book is divided into three parts. Part one defines providence and then
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:36.880]   illuminates a difficulty, namely the self-exaltation involved in God's aim to
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:43.760]   display his own glory. Part two focuses on the ultimate goal of providence. Part
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:50.880]   three focuses on the nature and extent of providence. I have chosen this order,
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:58.920]   goal before nature and extent, because I think we understand more clearly what a
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:05.840]   person is doing if we know the end he is pursuing. If I know your goal is to build
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:12.720]   a house in Minnesota, I will understand what you are doing when you dig a
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:20.200]   massive hole in the ground. Basements are important in this climate. Otherwise,
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:27.400]   without knowing your aim, I won't know what the hole in the ground means. The
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:35.200]   nature and extent of the hole is explained by the goal. I refer to the
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:42.200]   ultimate goal of providence because God is always doing 10,000 things in every
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:49.080]   act of providence. That is an understatement. Each of those 10,000
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:57.320]   things is intended, which means that God has millions and millions of goals
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:06.600]   every hour. He accomplishes all of them. We don't know most of them. That too is
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:12.800]   an understatement. So part two of this book is not about trying to know all
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:19.000]   these goals. That is impossible. What I want to know is where everything is
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:27.320]   going. What is the goal that guides everything? Then we can grasp more fully
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:36.320]   the nature and extent of his providence. By the question of extent, I mean how
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:44.200]   much and how completely does God control things, including human beings. By the
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:50.960]   question of nature, I mean, for example, what means does God use to control
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:58.480]   things? Is the word "control" even the right word? It is not my default word to
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:04.280]   describe providence, not because the word is false, but because it tends to carry
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:11.040]   connotations of mechanical processes and coercive strategies. I will use it, but I
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:17.480]   hope to continually show why these connotations do not attach to God's
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:28.200]   providence. Providence is all-embracing and all-pervasive, but when God turns the
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:33.680]   human will, there is a mystery to it that causes a person to experience God's
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:40.800]   turning as his own preference, an authentic, responsible act of the human
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:47.720]   will. God is sovereign over man's preferences. Man is accountable for his
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:56.640]   preferences. God's hidden hand in turning all things and his revealed commands
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:04.160]   requiring all obedience are in perfect harmony in the mind of God, but not in
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:12.480]   our visible experience. We are obliged to follow his revealed precepts, not his
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:22.640]   secret purposes. We will see that such is the nature of providence.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:32.640]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
