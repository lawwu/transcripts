[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   We haven't taken an international trip with the kids since we
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.980]   went to London two years ago.
[00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.220]   And now that they're two and four, we decided we were ready to do it.
[00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.460]   So I used award tool and seats.arrow to set up a bunch of alerts from San
[00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.700]   Francisco and LA to major European airports, and we looked over the
[00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.180]   dates of the first kind of two weeks of that four week window.
[00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.240]   Now, if you have the premium versions of either of these tools or a few
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.020]   others, you can set these alerts up really easily across a bunch of
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.660]   different destinations with all kinds of criteria from cabins to stops,
[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.300]   to duration, maximum number of miles, maximum fees, and really, we didn't
[00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.460]   care where we ended up because we were only looking at direct flights
[00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.860]   from San Francisco and from pretty much every city in Europe you can
[00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.420]   get to direct, it's really easy to buy a short ticket from Paris or
[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.100]   London or Frankfurt or Zurich to somewhere else in Europe.
[00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.380]   So we were really flexible.
