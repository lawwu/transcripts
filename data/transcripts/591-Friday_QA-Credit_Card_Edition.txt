[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:36.540]  ï¿½
[00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.740]   at the market harm
[00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:55.660]  ,,,,,
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.680]   or because of some very compelling circumstances
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.840]   that you've decided makes sense to go into debt.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.300]   And I believe you're an adult.
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.300]   Your moral obligation is to pay the debt.
[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.260]   How you actually do that, that's up to you.
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.220]   But I also believe that credit cards
[00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.440]   can be a very valuable way
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.020]   of actually borrowing the money.
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.840]   And they're often just beat upon
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.540]   by people who don't understand the system.
[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.940]   Now, the concepts that we've been discussing
[00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.800]   are not entry-level concepts.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.300]   My goal and my hope with even the course
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.020]   that I've launched is to take you up a level
[00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.180]   where you don't have to pay the debt.
[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.420]   And I believe that's a very valuable way
[00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.460]   of actually borrowing the money.
[00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.480]   And I believe that's a very valuable way
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.500]   where you don't have to pay the debt.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:55.520]  , but rather you understand the credit card system,
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.520]   how it works and how it can serve you.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.520]   And so we talk a lot about credit card debt.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.520]   Hopefully it's coming through that I want you to pay off your credit cards, but I want you to do it in an intelligent way that makes sense in your life and in your lifestyle. Today's Q&A call is exclusively open to those who have purchased the recent credit card course. Thank you for those of you who have purchased. If you haven't bought it yet, this is a great opportunity to learn how to learn how to use credit cards.

[00:06:42.960 --> 00:07:12.940]   credit limit. Other credit card companies are known and build their business model on working with consumers who are in lower credit score ranges. And those are frequently some of the most profitable consumers for them. So they're much more patient. So first, I would say this is an argument in favor of having a good balance of cards, a good mixture of cards.
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:12.940]   The

[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:42.940]   a
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:42.940]   good argument in favor of having a good balance of cards. This is also a favor from different issuers that have different profiles. This is also a point in favor of making sure that whenever possible, you always have far more credit in advance than you would ever need. I stated in a previous show and also try to emphasize in the course, if you think that your maximum debt that you might ever need to borrow would be $10,000 you are much more well served by having if possible $100,000 of available credit issued to you,
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:42.940]   if you think that your maximum debt that you might ever need to borrow would be $10,000 you are much more well served by having if possible $100,000 of available credit issued to you,
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:42.940]   if you think that your maximum debt that you might ever need to borrow would be $10,000 you are much more well served by having if possible $100,000 of available credit issued to you,
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:52.620]   embrace
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.000]   back in in subscribe
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:54.980]   M is but I I Sh Ren
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.780]   I was getting ready to do that actually this week and
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:18.380]   okay yeah so the only way to solve your problems is to change your utilization
[00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.540]   ratio that's the only way to solve it and there are only two ways to solve it
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.900]   you can either increase the amount of credit available to you or you can
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.820]   decrease the amount of debt that you have so let's first start with talking
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:34.540]   about how to increase the amount of credit available to you recognize that
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:34.540]   the credit card marketplace is huge there are thousands of people out there
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:09:04.340]  , there are thousands and thousands of credit card companies who are competing
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:34.140]  , there are thousands and thousands of credit card companies who are competing
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:34.300]   in the credit card market and so if you're in the credit card market and you
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:34.340]   you're in the credit card market and you're in the credit card market and you
[00:09:34.580 --> 00:10:04.340]  , you're in the credit card market and you're in the credit card market and you're in the credit score of 700 they will choose the cards that are issued to people with a credit score of 700 they will choose the cards that are issued to people with a credit score of 700 they will choose the cards that are issued to people with a credit score of 700 you need to recognize that the credit card business they want your business basically no matter what your credit score is one of the big things that people feel which is wrong is they feel the credit card companies only want your business if your credit score is high credit card companies do want your business if your credit score is high but they also want your business if your credit score is low is lower
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:04.340]   credit card companies do want your business if your credit score is high but they also want your business if your credit score is lower but they also want your business if your credit score is lower
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:34.340]   the credit card companies don't want you it's just a matter of finding out which ones do want you and most companies will have different cards that are servicing different types of consumers different types of people with different types of people with
[00:10:35.340 --> 00:11:04.340]   a credit card companies do want your business if your credit score is low is lower but they also want your business if your credit score is low is lower but they also want your business if your credit score is low is lower but they also want your business if your credit score is low is lower but they also want your business if your credit score is low is lower but they also want your business if your credit score is low is lower
[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:34.340]   and say hey your credit score is 700 we think that that this would serve you and this is a better place for you to start than just by going down to local wealth cargo branch or bank of america branch where you don't know what they would like to offer you so it start with making applications for a new credit card when making those applications try to choose the ones that you think are likely you're likely to get approved for but i would make many applications there is basically no harm in terms of what you're doing but I would make many applications there is basically no harm in terms of what you're doing
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:43.180]   making many applications and let me show why I say basically there is a
[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:43.200]   making many applications and let me show why I say basically there is a
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.260]   making many applications and let me show why I say basically there is a minor component of your credit score which is based upon
[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:45.280]   minor component of your credit score which is based upon
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.540]   minor component of your credit score which is based upon recent applications for credit but that
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:46.560]   recent applications for credit but that
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.760]   recent applications for credit but that the impact of that is fairly negligible it's a
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:49.780]   the impact of that is fairly negligible it's a
[00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:51.500]   the impact of that is fairly negligible it's a couple of points seems to be a couple of
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:51.520]   couple of points seems to be a couple of
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.100]   couple of points seems to be a couple of points for each credit card application
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:53.120]   points for each credit card application
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.000]   points for each credit card application fairly negligible compared to the
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.020]   fairly negligible compared to the
[00:11:55.060 --> 00:12:21.180]  , so what I would do is I would make a
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:21.200]  , so what I would do is I would make a
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.020]  , so what I would do is I would make a list of you know whatever five or ten
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:25.020]   list of you know whatever five or ten
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:25.020]   you know whatever five or ten cards you think are best for you and I
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:25.020]   cards you think are best for you and I would sit down and on one day I
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:25.020]   would sit down and on one day I would launch through all five or ten of
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:25.020]   would launch through all five or ten of those applications and do them all at
[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:33.740]   Mister

[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:52.840]   I'm going to apply for it. I'm going to get it. And I would be applying for so many new offers to raise my available credit, to lower my cost, to refinance my debt, that I just wouldn't want to hassle of dealing with a credit freeze. Once I'm entirely out of credit card debt, and I've paid off all my debt, and I'm not playing this game anymore, I would at that time reestablish the credit freeze. That's my opinion. What's the risk of that? Well, you have the risk of additional risk of identity theft, but I think the risk is
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:45:22.380]  , I think the risk is minimized here because you're actually watching your credit profile very carefully. You're carefully observing the lines of credit that I'm issued to you. You're carefully paying attention to all the details. Most people don't do that. So I think the risk is minimized here. And if somebody seals your identity as making applications, maybe at that point in time, you would go, you would be able to identify it and quickly correct it. Now, you may have a different opinion. I respect that opinion. I don't think this is right or wrong. But in my opinion, the hassle of maintaining a credit freeze while you're actually doing it, you're going to have to pay for it.
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:51.900]   While you are playing this credit card game, it's just not worth it. I would keep it, my credit unfrozen, finish the game out, get to a balance of zero, keep my credit card portfolio just how I wanted it, and then reinstitute the credit freeze. As I close out the Q&A show, I hope that you learned something from those calls. I hope that you were benefited in your own situation. Looking at your own situation can be hard because you may not know all of the different things you can do. So hopefully by listening
