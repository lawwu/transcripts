[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.120]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in the third chapter and the tenth verse.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:18.720]   The tenth verse in the third chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, to the intent that
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:27.680]   now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the Church
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.440]   the manifold wisdom of God.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.060]   This statement, you remember, comes as a part of the statement we were considering together
[00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.720]   last Sunday morning, which begins in verse 9 and ends at verse 11.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.640]   The apostle is giving an account of his message and the whole purpose of his calling and his
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.680]   ministry.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:57.720]   He has said that he had been called that he might preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.640]   riches of God.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.520]   But more than that, and to make all men see, to enlighten all men, to bring light to all
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:13.920]   men, that they may see what is the fellowship of the mystery, the plan of this great mystery,
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.080]   which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things, to
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.080]   the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.360]   by the Church the manifold wisdom of God, according to the eternal purpose which he
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:39.720]   purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.160]   Now the apostle, we must bear in our minds as we are working through the details of this
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.240]   mighty statement which he is making in this third chapter, the apostle's supreme objective
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:00.840]   is this, is to enable these Ephesians to whom he was writing to take a correct and a right
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.000]   view of the fact that he, Paul, was a prisoner.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.640]   Now they were in trouble over that.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.440]   They found it very difficult to understand it, how such a mighty man of God, a man who
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.720]   had been so signally called and honoured and blessed by God, should thus be allowed by
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.560]   God to suffer imprisonment, with all the consequences that followed that.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.940]   And his method, as we have been seeing, is this.
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:37.000]   He wants them not so much to look at him as he is at the moment, not at his present sufferings.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.840]   He says this is but an incident.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.640]   He wants them to see him in terms of his great calling, the wonderful privilege that had
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:56.080]   been given to him, he of all men, who is less than the least of all saints.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.640]   This great honour and privilege had been given of not only being saved but being called to
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.680]   be an apostle and in a very special way being chosen as the one to whom was entrusted this
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:17.360]   special and peculiar task of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles and showing them how
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.600]   they are fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of God, how they are fellow
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:30.840]   heirs and fellow partakers together of the promise and fellow members in the body.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.720]   Now he seems to say that is the thing for you to look at.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.480]   And therefore he goes on with his description of his great ministry and the glory of the
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.600]   message which had been committed to him.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:51.560]   His idea is that if they only see that, then as he says in verse 13, they will no longer
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.960]   faint for him.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:00.760]   Wherefore I desire that he faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.520]   I am suffering like this, says the apostle, because of the great privilege of my calling
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.520]   as an apostle.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.960]   It is directly a consequence of that.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.680]   So do not look at this, look at that.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.520]   Now there, as I have been trying to indicate, is a principle that as Christians we can always
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.040]   employ.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.200]   The apostle Peter, in his way, you remember, puts it like this.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.800]   If we suffer as Christians, he says, blessed are we.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.160]   It is something to glory in.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.740]   Because if we are suffering as Christians and because we are Christians, well then unto
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.760]   us has been given the great honor of not only following in the footsteps of a man like this
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:50.000]   apostle Paul, but even of following in the footsteps of our blessed Lord and Master himself.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.720]   Although he was without guile, suffered and was persecuted and finally put to death.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.800]   And we are to follow his example in every respect.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.520]   Well now then, that is the great thing that the apostle has got in his mind.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:12.000]   Now here in this tenth verse, as I say, he puts it in this most extraordinary manner.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.100]   It is one of the most amazing statements in the whole of the scripture.
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:23.160]   This calling of his, this message that he had to preach, we have already seen what it
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.180]   is to the individual Christian that we are able to partake of the unsearchable riches
[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.600]   of Christ.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:36.680]   We saw last Sunday morning what it means in terms of God's world plan, God's world
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.840]   purpose, which he is surely bringing to pass.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:49.480]   But here in connection with that second statement, the apostle interjects, as it were, this remark.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:55.600]   He says, "I am commissioned to make all men see this, whether they are Jews or Gentiles,
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.840]   whatever they are."
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.280]   But indeed he says there is something even bigger than that.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.720]   Through this message which I am preaching his is, and through the result of that preaching,
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:13.920]   namely the church of which you are a part, the staggering and astounding thing is that
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:21.080]   even the principalities and powers in the heavenly places are being taught something.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.080]   They are being instructed.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.640]   They are being given knowledge.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:31.520]   Something is happening through you and through all who are members of the church which even
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:40.200]   thus is enlarging the understanding of these august and mighty beings.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.240]   Now that is the matter that we have got to look at this morning.
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.500]   Now it is very important that we should realise that when he talks about the principalities
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:57.520]   and powers in the heavenly places or in the heavenlies, he is referring to the angels
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.720]   and to the brightest and the most glorious angels.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.480]   I am saying that because some have thought that this is a reference rather to the fallen
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.440]   angels and to the devils.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:15.080]   But if you take that interpretation, it seems to me you miss the real object which the apostle
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:21.640]   has in mind here, and you certainly miss the thrill and the glory of what he is saying.
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:28.200]   There is no doubt that the fallen angels, the devils, do understand also and are given
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:34.000]   to see their utter folly, and do see it partly through the church.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.720]   But this is something here still more staggering.
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:44.800]   Here he is referring, and if you take this phrase and just follow it through wherever
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:50.120]   you find it in the scripture, and I think you will find that invariably it refers to
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.880]   those angels that are ever always in the presence of God.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:03.600]   So what the apostle is saying is this, that this thing which is happening in the church
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:12.000]   is so stupendous, is so glorious, that even those bright angelic beings who have spent
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:21.320]   the whole of their life in the presence of God, even they are staggered and amazed at
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.320]   it.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:28.960]   Now, these angels who have been created by God have spent the whole of their existence
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.520]   immediately in the presence of God.
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:43.400]   But according to the apostle, this which takes place in the church is something that they
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.240]   had never thought of and had never dreamed of.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:54.160]   It surpasses even their knowledge, their comprehension, and even their imagination.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:59.240]   Now then, this comes home to us, you see, in this way, that you and I are members of
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.040]   the church.
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:08.200]   And the statement is that it is by the church, through the church, that this takes place.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:14.760]   So that as the apostle was anxious that the Ephesians should realize the truth about themselves
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:21.040]   and about the apostle Paul, and as the result of so doing should even glory in tribulations,
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.720]   so you and I should do the same.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:28.140]   In other words, we are given here a portrayal of the church in her dignity and greatness
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:33.400]   and glory, which in a sense, I say, rarely does seem to surpass anything that the apostle
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.960]   has ever said anywhere else.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:40.240]   There can be nothing, surely, that is higher than this.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.880]   Very well then, let me try to put it to you in the form of a number of principles which
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.040]   will tend to bring out this glory.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:53.840]   The first proposition I would put to you can be stated in these terms.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:10:04.440]   Christianity and its salvation is the supreme manifestation of the wisdom of God.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.360]   Now I want to repeat that.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:18.520]   Christianity and its salvation is the supreme, the highest manifestation of the wisdom of
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.400]   God.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.800]   What do we mean by the wisdom of God?
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.800]   Well, here is a good definition of it.
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:29.680]   The wisdom of God is that attribute according to which he arranges his purposes and his
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:40.360]   plans, arranges his means, and brings forth the results that he desires perfectly.
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.400]   That is wisdom.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:47.500]   That is, of course, human wisdom in a sense, isn't it?
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:54.160]   Wisdom is that faculty, that quality, that very rare faculty and quality, which enables
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:01.280]   a man thus to see round a situation and to so order and arrange everything that it will
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:08.640]   lead inevitably to the most desirable and the most desired result.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.440]   What a difference there is between knowledge and wisdom!
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.440]   There are many men who have knowledge, but they haven't got wisdom.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.960]   Wisdom you see in a sense is the capacity and the power to make use of your knowledge.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:25.120]   Man can be a very learned man, but if he lacks wisdom, he is useless.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:30.880]   Now that applies in every profession and in every walk of life, over and above a knowledge
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.200]   of the facts.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:41.240]   The thing that differentiates the supreme artist, the great scientist, the great man
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:47.200]   in any profession, is that he has got this further quality of being able to use and to
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:52.880]   harness all he knows in order to lead to the desired result.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.160]   Well now the Bible talks about the wisdom of God.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:04.120]   It is one of the attributes in the character and the being of God.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:10.840]   And what the apostle here is telling us is that in and through the Church, in and through
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:19.280]   the Christian salvation, this attribute of God is being revealed to the principalities
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:28.120]   and the powers in the heavenly places in a greater manner than ever before.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.720]   Let me put it to you like this.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:36.760]   The principalities and the powers in the heavenly places obviously knew already a great deal
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.720]   about the wisdom of God.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:47.640]   Spending their time there in the presence of God, they are in that wonderful position
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:54.360]   of being able to observe all that God does and all that God arranges.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.200]   And therefore they were well aware of the wisdom of God.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:03.400]   They had seen it, for instance, in nature and in creation.
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:08.800]   Even for anyone who has an eye to see, the wisdom of God can be seen in a marvelous manner
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.800]   there.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:18.320]   Take any flower you like, dissect it, and you will find that it has been built up and
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:25.120]   made on a very definite plan and on a very definite design.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:30.120]   Not only that there is no question at all, but that the greatest characteristic of all
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:37.680]   God's handiwork in nature is the essential simplicity of the pattern with which he always
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.680]   works.
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:43.160]   Now that's a thing that's worth contemplating.
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:47.840]   God always works in a very simple manner and on a very simple pattern.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:54.080]   You can get flowers which look highly involved and complex and complicated, but if you dissect
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:59.840]   them, I say, you will find that you always come back to a very simple pattern.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:05.840]   And what appears to be complex is but an aggregate, a collection of a number of these very simple
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.720]   patterns.
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:12.040]   And that runs right through the whole of nature.
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:18.400]   It is the differentiating and distinguishing characteristic of God's work everywhere.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:26.720]   And it's there, I say, that you see God's essential wisdom in this simple pattern.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.400]   Now again I want to use the illustration.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:37.360]   I suggest that the outstanding characteristic of all genius, of supreme competence in any
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:43.080]   department, is always simplicity.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:47.160]   The great artist always gives the impression that what he's doing is quite simple, and
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.780]   you think as you watch him that you could do it.
[00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:56.440]   But the sort of man who's fussy and makes you feel that the thing is really difficult,
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.880]   it's just a proclamation that he's not doing it too well.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:09.320]   Work it out, I say, in any profession, in any calling, in any respect in life whatsoever.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:13.680]   And when the man who's a real expert comes along, if another man has got into difficulties
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:18.160]   and doesn't quite know where he is, the expert comes along and he just pushes that
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:23.920]   there and that here and there, the thing is open and it's quite simple.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:28.520]   You see it supremely, of course, in the preaching of our blessed Lord and Savior, though he
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.700]   handled such profundities.
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:36.240]   His essential pattern was always a very simple one.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:42.720]   How often has this been forgotten in the whole of life and in the Christian church herself?
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:49.680]   People always seem to have the foolish notion that the really great and profound is that
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.800]   which they cannot understand.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.880]   It's the exact opposite.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:16:01.160]   If a mind isn't clear and able to express itself clearly and to extract its principles,
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.600]   it's a sign of confusion and a lack of ability.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:09.000]   Well, now I say all that is seen very perfectly in the whole realm of nature.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.720]   And the angels, of course, have been observing this.
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:16.800]   They've been watching how God had so planned creation that you get every year spring, summer,
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.320]   autumn, winter, same thing every year.
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.120]   How simple it all is.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:26.600]   And how a thing starts in such a simple manner and grows and develops and then begins to
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:32.620]   blossom and to bloom and to reach its maturity and fade and wither and die.
[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:33.620]   Always the same thing.
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.800]   What a wonderfully simple pattern.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.880]   There shines gloriously, I say, the wisdom of God.
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.280]   And then, of course, they'd seen it also in history.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:49.440]   They'd been watching right through all the history that is recorded in the Old Testament.
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.720]   And they'd seen how God had been handling the nations.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:59.160]   They'd watched him how he'd patiently allowed some great tyrant to rise up and stride the
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:04.320]   world as a kind of colossus and cause all the people in the nations to quake in their
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:08.240]   shoes and everybody to be terrified and alarmed.
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.640]   And even they perhaps began to wonder what was happening.
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:16.680]   And then they'd find that at a given moment God would arise and scatter his enemies.
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.040]   And they'd gone as if they'd never been.
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:22.600]   The wisdom of God in history.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:26.720]   And at a time like this, my dear friends, there's nothing more profitable for us than
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.400]   for us just to read history.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.240]   To read it, of course, with a Christian eye.
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:36.280]   If you don't read it with a Christian and a biblical eye, you'll come to Hegel's
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.400]   conclusion, which was, you remember, that history teaches us that history teaches us
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.840]   nothing.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.440]   But if you look at it with a biblical or with a Christian eye, well, you'll find that it'll
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.280]   teach you a great deal.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:52.320]   Because at the back of it all, you will see the wisdom of God.
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.880]   Allowing, permitting, this and that, but always in control.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:02.000]   The Lord reigneth and he's always there and at his own time he does things.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.640]   And the angels had been watching all this and admiring it and worshipping God as they
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.640]   looked at it.
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:13.240]   And then, of course, in a very particular way, they'd been watching and observing
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:19.920]   the whole history and story of the Jews.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:26.600]   One day they saw God looking at a man whose name was Abram, living in a pagan country
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.320]   amongst a lot of pagans.
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.740]   They couldn't understand God's interest in this one man.
[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.800]   But they watched.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.760]   And they saw him calling him out, out of his own country, taking him to a land he didn't
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:42.080]   know where he was going, but he went.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.280]   And they began to see it.
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:48.280]   God was forming a nation for himself, creating a people for himself.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.660]   And they watched it all.
[00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:54.200]   The call of Abram is coming to Canaan.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:19:00.560]   The children being born, the purpose being furthered through Isaac and then through Jacob
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.280]   and not Esau.
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.360]   And in every move they see the wisdom of God.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.000]   Perhaps they thought at first that Esau was going to be the man, but no, it was Jacob.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.600]   Esau was a much nicer man, a hunting kind of fellow, a haughty fellow.
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:20.120]   Here he was, a wonderful man to look at and so on, not like this cringing Jacob who spends
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:24.760]   his time in the house, always round about his mother, a miserable type of man.
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:28.920]   But that's the one that God chooses, and they couldn't understand it.
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:35.120]   But then they began to see the purpose unfolding, that God is here giving a great illustration,
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:39.920]   and he is not, as it were, calling the righteous, but sinners to repentance, taking hold of
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:44.080]   the worst and turning it into the best, and thereby revealing his great wisdom.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.880]   Well, they'd been watching all this.
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:49.800]   And how the children of Israel had gone down into Egypt and everybody thought that's the
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:50.800]   end.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:56.840]   And then how suddenly God smote Pharaoh and his hosts in the Red Sea and brought the children
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:00.880]   of Israel back into Canaan and the whole of the subsequent history.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:06.640]   They'd seen all this, and they knew all about it, and they'd been watching this tremendous
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.320]   manifestation of the wisdom of God.
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:19.920]   "Ah, yes," says the apostle, "but you know, it isn't there they've really seen it.
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:25.960]   It is as the result of the message entrusted to me and what has resulted in the church
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:31.440]   that these principalities and powers in the heavenly places have been able to see the
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.560]   manifold wisdom of God."
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:37.480]   Oh, yes, they knew about the wisdom.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:46.680]   What they didn't know was its many-sidedness, its variegated character, the great varieties
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:54.280]   of colors in this wisdom about which they knew the essence.
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:59.160]   In other words, the apostle's argument is this, that the angels, these principalities
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:04.560]   and powers, have been brought to see through the church that God's wisdom is a much bigger
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.220]   thing than they'd ever imagined.
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:14.280]   That it is more varied, more variegated, that there are colors in it which they were never
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:19.520]   aware of, that there are hidden glories in it which even they knew nothing about, though
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:25.680]   they, as it were, had always been living in the school of God.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:29.000]   Now here is a very interesting picture.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.920]   It's a kind of illustration which the apostle uses by implying this word "manifold."
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:40.200]   What he's really saying is this, you see, that the light, the whiteness of the light
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:47.560]   of God's wisdom has suddenly appeared in the colors of the spectrum.
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.400]   It's been broken up into its component parts.
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.160]   They saw nothing but the whiteness.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:58.420]   They're now seeing all the shades, all the varieties of colors, the variegated wisdom
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:21:59.420]   of God.
[00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:00.420]   Very well.
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:08.080]   I go on to my second principle, therefore, which is this, that the church is the medium
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:12.320]   through which this does become manifest.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.520]   So the illustration is this, you see.
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:23.080]   The church is the kind of prism that is put in the path of the light and splits up the
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:27.080]   whiteness into the colors of the spectrum.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.320]   What a conception of the Christian church!
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.360]   Here it is, I say.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:36.200]   Without it, well, the angels could see the light, they could see the wisdom, but they
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.960]   had no conception that all this was in it.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.200]   How have they come to see it now?
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.680]   Well, the prism has been put there.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:51.000]   The church, it is through the church as a medium that the angels have got this new conception
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:59.040]   of this transcendent glory of the wisdom of God.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:04.840]   Now then, this is surely the most important thing that you and I can ever grasp and ever
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:09.240]   realize.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:18.200]   The Christian church to which you and I belong is the most wonderful thing that the world
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:22.920]   has ever seen or ever will see.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:26.560]   That is the proposition.
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:33.040]   The Christian church is the most wonderful thing in the world at this moment, more wonderful
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.840]   than anything in nature.
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:41.200]   We are all very interested in the wonders of nature, aren't we?
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.200]   We'll travel miles in order to see them.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:49.600]   We'll go to Switzerland to look at the great mountains.
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:53.400]   We'll travel to America to look at the Grand Canyon.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.240]   Marvelous, we say.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.360]   Wonderful, thrilling.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:04.080]   And we'll spend great amounts of money in order to do so.
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:10.040]   We'll look at these great spectacles and we say, "What a tremendous thing."
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:15.600]   The proposition of the apostle is this, that all these things pale into insignificance
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:22.960]   when put side by side with the Christian church, when put side by side with those of us who
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:29.320]   are Christians who are gathered together at this moment in this congregation.
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:33.440]   Something that we can see for nothing without traveling at all.
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.440]   Here we are.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:40.400]   You and I, my friends, as members of the body of Christ, are the most wonderful thing in
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:48.600]   the universe, the most amazing thing that God has ever done.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:55.040]   You can't explain the great mountains or the phenomena of nature without God.
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:58.360]   You can't explain these flowers without him.
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:03.640]   I think I've told you before the story of the man living here in London who went on
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:07.760]   a holiday to the country in the early September once.
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:13.320]   And he stood there and happened to look at a great field of wheat ripe under harvest.
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:20.240]   And there it was in all its golden splendor with a slight breeze just playing upon it.
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:25.760]   And he looked and he said the only thing that a man should say when he looks at such a sight,
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:30.880]   he said, "Well done, God."
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.440]   The wisdom and the marvel of God's handiwork.
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:38.960]   But my dear friends, it's the church that really shows it.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:43.520]   The thing that you and I belong to, the thing that we are parts of.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:49.880]   This is the supreme and highest manifestation of God's handiwork.
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:54.280]   The rest is nothing to God by comparison with this.
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:26:01.120]   Very well then I want to draw two very important conclusions at this point.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:08.240]   How terribly wrong it is therefore for those who call themselves dispensationalists to
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:13.880]   say that the Christian church was a mere afterthought in the mind of God.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:18.240]   That he'd never really intended it in eternity that the Lord Jesus Christ came to earth and
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.300]   preached the gospel of the kingdom.
[00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:21.840]   And then the Jews didn't receive it.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.480]   It was because the Jews rejected the gospel of the kingdom.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:29.840]   Ah, as an afterthought the church came in.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:38.880]   The greatest thing in the universe, the mightiest concept of God's own wisdom, an afterthought.
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:42.720]   You see how we deny scripture.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:50.920]   By our errors the church, far from being an afterthought, is the brightest shining of
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.040]   the wisdom of God.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:57.120]   It is equally wrong to say that the church is only temporary and that a time will come
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:01.880]   when the church will be removed and the Jews will come back or the kingdom will come back.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.720]   There is nothing beyond the church.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:10.280]   She is the highest, the supremest manifestation of the wisdom of God.
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:15.040]   And to look forward to something greater than the church is to deny not only this verse
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.280]   but many another verse in the scripture.
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:28.320]   There is nothing conceivable beyond the church because she is the final expression of the
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.320]   wisdom of God.
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:36.800]   The thing above all others that enables the angels to see into the wisdom of God.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.720]   Very well that brings me to my third principle which is this.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:46.640]   How God shows and manifests this variegated wisdom of his in and through the church and
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.040]   in salvation.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.920]   Let me give you some thoughts to meditate upon.
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:57.480]   I take it my friends that this is the sort of thing that you and I will spend our eternity
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.480]   in thinking about.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:05.280]   Did you notice what I read to you in the reading at the beginning out of that first chapter
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.480]   of Peter's first epistle?
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.320]   Did you notice what I ended on?
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:16.280]   Which things, he said, the angels also desire to look into.
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.480]   What is he talking about?
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.480]   The Christian salvation and the Christian church.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.440]   Now look at that phrase again.
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:27.200]   Which things also, he says, the angels desire to look into.
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.640]   Now the correct translation there is this.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:37.240]   That the angels of God, he says, are stooping down in order to look at it.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.240]   It's a wonderful picture that.
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.520]   It's a sort of anthropomorphism if you like.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.680]   But there they are, that's the actual word that Peter used.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:48.800]   The angels in glory, you see, are looking down over the ramparts of heaven.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.800]   They're stooping down to look at what?
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.640]   To look at you and me, to look at the Christian church.
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:58.640]   This manifestation of the many-colored wisdom of God.
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.000]   They're looking down upon it.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.360]   They've never seen anything like it.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:09.240]   They who spent their eternity in the presence of God.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:14.120]   And therefore I say that you and I must start looking at it now.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:18.320]   Because we are going to go on looking at this for all eternity.
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.640]   And we'll never cease to be surprised and amazed at it.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.640]   Well, what do you see?
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.800]   Well, here are some of the things.
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:33.880]   Think for a moment of the amazing way in which God solved the problem raised by sin.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:37.920]   You see, we are talking about the wisdom of God.
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:42.320]   Now here I say is where you see the wisdom of God.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:51.880]   The way in which he contrived and thought out of dealing with the problem of sin.
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:30:00.920]   What the apostle is saying here is this, that this, and I say it with reverence, this is
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:06.960]   the greatest problem that has ever confronted God.
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:11.880]   That is why salvation is the greatest manifestation of the wisdom of God.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:15.360]   You know, it wasn't a difficult thing for God to create the light and the sun.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.760]   All he said was, "Let there be light."
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.760]   And there was light.
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:22.120]   You have great mountains.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:25.280]   They're nothing to God.
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:30.160]   The nations are like a drop in the bucket, the small dust of the balance.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:36.280]   To send a pestilence, to cause an earthquake, it's nothing to God.
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:39.920]   These things to him are simplicities.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.680]   There was no problem there.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.400]   But here is the problem.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.880]   Man in sin.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:52.080]   I say with reverence, here is a problem for God.
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:56.680]   The greatest problem that God ever has faced or ever will face.
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.040]   There is nothing beyond it.
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:05.040]   So the greatest wisdom is needed to solve this problem.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:09.640]   If any of you think that salvation, the salvation of men, was a simple thing for God, well,
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:17.320]   you're just telling me that you don't know your New Testament, nor your Old Testament.
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:21.000]   Do you think that forgiveness is a simple thing for God and that just because God is
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.560]   love, he says, "All right, I'll forgive you"?
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:29.520]   My dear friend, if you believe that, you might as well burn your Bibles.
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:40.440]   The forgiveness of sins, dare I say it, text, even the wisdom of God.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:44.360]   I'm at any rate certain I'm right when I say this.
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:48.840]   The angels could see no way through it.
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:52.240]   That's why they are surprised when they see what God has done about it.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.160]   They couldn't see it.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:32:00.000]   They knew that some of their fellows had sinned and had been cast down and reserved in chains
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.640]   in hell by God.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:06.120]   That's what Peter says in the second epistle, the second chapter.
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:07.840]   They'd seen that.
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.760]   Then they saw men fall.
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:12.160]   And they said, "What can be done?
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.160]   Nothing can be done."
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:16.160]   They saw no way out of it at all.
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:21.320]   Oh, this question of the salvation of men, the salvation of a single soul, the forgiveness
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:31.440]   of sins, is the most tremendous problem that has ever arisen or can ever arise in the whole
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:35.160]   of the universe and even for God himself.
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.600]   What's the difficulty?
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.600]   Well, it's this.
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.200]   "But God is love," you say.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.840]   I agree with you.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:49.120]   But don't forget that God is also just, that God is also righteous, that God is also
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:54.840]   holy, that God is the Father of lights with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:59.400]   turning, that God cannot deny himself.
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.840]   He is eternally, always, ever the same.
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:10.160]   And he is perfect, and there is never any contradiction anywhere or any argument in
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.360]   the being and in the character of God.
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:19.840]   Hence the problem raised by sin.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:28.320]   If God is to forgive sin, he must forgive sin in a way that not only manifests his love,
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:37.720]   but equally manifests his justice, his righteousness, his holiness, his truth, his eternity in glory,
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:41.360]   his unchangeableness.
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:44.040]   How can it be done?
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:46.640]   Is there a way possible?
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.480]   Must not the love of God inevitably come into conflict with his justice?
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:55.920]   Can his mercy be made compatible with his forgiveness?
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.800]   That's the problem, that's the question.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:04.800]   And the central glory of the Gospel is this, that it is the revelation of how the eternal
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:08.180]   wisdom of God solved the problem.
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:12.080]   Now I read to you that portion out of the third chapter of the epistle to the Romans,
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:16.960]   in order that you might see that stated perfectly and in its most glorious fashion by the great
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:17.960]   apostle.
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.720]   Here is the problem.
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:26.680]   How can God be just and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus?
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:32.920]   How can God justify the fact that he covered over the sins of the children of Israel under
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:33.920]   the Old Testament?
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.200]   That's the question.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.200]   How can it be done?
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:37.200]   God gave the law.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:40.320]   Well now in forgiving isn't he putting the law on one side?
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:43.200]   No, says Paul, we establish the law.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.920]   We are not making the law void, we are establishing it.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:50.160]   How can you at one and the same time carry out the law and forgive the sinner?
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:51.160]   God's found the way.
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:56.040]   He's reconciled his own love and justice and mercy and compassion.
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:59.640]   They're all one and shining gloriously together.
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:03.960]   Well, you know the psalmist who wrote the 85th Psalm, he'd had a preview of this, he
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:09.480]   didn't understand it, but he said, "Mercy and truth are met together.
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.280]   Righteousness and peace have kissed each other."
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:18.000]   Oh, loving wisdom of our God!
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:24.720]   When all was sin and shame, a second Adam to the fight and to the conflict came.
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.720]   Do you see it?
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:32.880]   Do you see this eternal wisdom of God which enabled him to do this tremendous thing for
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:40.080]   us and yet to remain God, unchanged and shining in every direction with the same glory and
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:45.040]   the same perfection?
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:50.760]   I'm free to confess to you that I know of nothing which is more thrilling than to try
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:55.000]   to think of that.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:02.360]   And oh, how we rob God of his glory in imagining for a moment that forgiveness and salvation
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:05.160]   are simple and easy.
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:10.960]   My dear friends, it constituted a problem in the mind of the eternal, ghastly to the
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.800]   angels.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.280]   It was God alone who could solve it.
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:19.400]   Well, let me put that to you a little more in detail.
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:22.480]   There it is as a principle, but look at it in detail.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:27.600]   Look at the way in which he did it.
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:30.240]   How can men be redeemed?
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:33.400]   How can God have any dealings with him?
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:37.400]   And the way, you see, he thought of and devised was this.
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:43.400]   He sent his own son and sent him into the world.
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.280]   How can this humanity be lifted up?
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:48.480]   There's only one way, said God, and I'm going to take it.
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:51.000]   I will send my son down.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.560]   He will take humanity unto himself and he'll raise it up.
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:59.200]   Whoever could have thought of such a thing?
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:01.760]   Whoever could have imagined such a thing?
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:06.280]   Did these angels ever imagine that that second person in the blessed holy trinity that they'd
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:11.600]   seen ever since their creation, this substance of the eternal substance, the only begotten
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:16.000]   son in the bosom of the Father, could they ever have foreseen that he would come out
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.200]   as it were and go down and be born as a baby in Bethlehem and live as a man?
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:22.480]   Never dreamt of it.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:26.080]   And when they saw it, they were amazed at it.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:33.200]   And they saw this wisdom of God manifesting itself in facets and in angles that had never
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:38.160]   entered into their comprehension.
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:46.840]   And then, of course, they watched him living as a man amongst men, made under the law,
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.720]   and giving a perfect obedience to it.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:53.640]   Can you imagine their thoughts and their feelings?
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:58.200]   When they saw this brightness and the effulgence of the Father's glory working as a carpenter
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:02.640]   in a shop in Nazareth?
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.360]   That's wisdom, my dear friend.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:07.120]   You see the simplicity coming out again.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:09.400]   He didn't send him to be born in a king's palace.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.520]   No, no, in a stable.
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:12.520]   That's wisdom.
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:16.400]   Work it out for yourselves.
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:21.200]   The last thing you'd ever expect, going down to the depths.
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.680]   And yet you see the purpose shining through it all.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:28.600]   If he hadn't gone to the very depths, he couldn't have raised the lowest.
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.340]   We'd have done it in a very spectacular manner, wouldn't we?
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:35.280]   That isn't wisdom, that's our human fussiness in sin.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:41.160]   God does it in this essentially simple manner, a helpless babe, and all that follows through
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:45.280]   from it.
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:52.640]   But then of course when they saw him on the cross, even they must have started wondering
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:55.600]   what it was that was happening.
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.820]   Is this God's wisdom?
[00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:05.540]   It seems to be the hour of triumph, of hell and of the devil and of the world at its worst.
[00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:08.180]   But it wasn't.
[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:12.000]   What was happening there, says this apostle in writing to the Colossians, is this, that
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:19.040]   on that cross and by dying there, he was putting these forces that were against him to an open
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:26.520]   shame, triumphing over them in it.
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:30.760]   Using them and their own subtlety and their own cleverness to bring his own great and
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:33.960]   glorious purposes to pass.
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:38.080]   For what he was doing there, you see, was he was making him the sin bearer.
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:42.200]   He was putting the sins of men upon him and there he was dealing with them.
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.160]   He's punishing them so he remains just and righteous.
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.720]   The sin is punished, the law is fulfilled.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:52.440]   He kept it perfectly, he's now bearing its penalty, the law is honoured, he's establishing
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:59.400]   the law and yet you see, he's opening a way for God to forgive us our sins.
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.040]   That's the wisdom.
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:06.400]   And so you can go on working right through every detail of it and you'll understand
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:12.240]   how the apostle, what he had in his mind when in writing, you remember to Timothy, he puts
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:17.280]   this in that first epistle in the third chapter in the sixteenth verse.
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:21.880]   Without controversy he says, "Great is the mystery of godliness.
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:31.120]   God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit then, seen of angels, preached
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:35.960]   unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory."
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:39.600]   And I've been expounding to you the meaning of the phrase "seen of angels."
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:44.920]   They were watching all this and they were amazed and astonished as they saw it all,
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:49.360]   but they suddenly realised, "This is the wisdom of God which we thought we knew, but
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.680]   here we now really see it."
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:41:00.040]   Well then, as the result of that I'm entitled to say this, that this is, I say, the final
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:06.280]   and the supreme manifestation of God's wisdom, the way he's reconciled his own attributes,
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:11.400]   the way he's done it in detail, yes, but particularly, and this of course was very
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:16.600]   high in the estimate of the apostle at this particular point, the way that he contrived
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:20.680]   to bring the Jew and the Gentile together.
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:26.600]   I suppose in many ways that's one of the most marvellous things of all, Jew and Gentile,
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:33.280]   absolutely different, traditional enemies with all their traditions opposed to one another.
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:37.200]   And the angels used to look down and see the world divided into Jew and Gentile, as it
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.680]   still is.
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.160]   What can be done about this?
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.600]   How can they ever?
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:45.840]   And of course they'd watched men trying to do it by glossing it over, just patching
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:50.280]   it up as it were, making them shake hands for a moment, only to rearm and then stab
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.480]   one another in the back when they had a chance.
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:57.400]   Is there any way wherever it can be done?
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:01.280]   And at last they saw it happening in the church.
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:06.360]   And the Jew and the Gentile are brought together in the church not as a temporary truce, not
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:11.280]   simply by putting some kind of force between them to prevent them getting at one another
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:15.800]   and killing one another, not some police action, no, no.
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:19.120]   They're made one fellow members in a body.
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:20.120]   How has he done it?
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:22.220]   Well, here you see the wisdom of God.
[00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:25.440]   He hasn't just taken the two as they are and somehow brought them together.
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:28.720]   He first of all takes the Jew and he smashes him to the ground.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:34.140]   He then takes the Gentile and smashes him to the ground.
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:38.280]   He makes them both see that they're both sinners, that there is none righteous, no,
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:39.860]   not one.
[00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:43.480]   The Jew, having seen himself as he is in the sight of God, has nothing to be proud of,
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:47.760]   neither has the Gentile.
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:52.560]   And there they both are licking the dust and seeing their unutterable hopelessness and
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:56.180]   at the same time seeing that they're identical.
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:59.940]   And then, you see, having brought them down, he raises them up, not simply as they were,
[00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:04.740]   he makes new men of both of them so that the Jew is no longer a Jew and the Gentile is
[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:06.300]   no longer a Gentile.
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:10.780]   Each is a new man in Christ Jesus, who after the flesh still Jew and Gentile, but that
[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:15.340]   forgotten in Christ, the new man, the new creation.
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:19.920]   And they're both identical, they're both members of the same body, interlocked together
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:25.200]   in the same joint, they're one and they can't help it.
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:28.080]   That's the wisdom of God.
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:31.760]   And then if you watch the way in which he does all this, the way in which he treats
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:34.960]   us all in different ways.
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:38.920]   The soul of Tarsus, you see, has to strike him on his back on the road to Damascus and
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:40.720]   the risen Lord appears to him.
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:46.300]   Lydia, her heart is quietly opened, an earthquake brings the Philippian jailer in.
[00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:51.380]   Oh, if we could only go back across our experiences, every one of us this morning, we'd see this
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:53.380]   many-sided wisdom of God.
[00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:54.940]   He knows us, every one.
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:57.500]   Some of us need to be knocked down, some need to be lifted up.
[00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.140]   He knows, he does it.
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:01.100]   There's no end to his wisdom.
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:05.580]   And then consider the timing, the way in which God times all this.
[00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:09.580]   Look at the Old Testament, there are the people crying out, "How long, O Lord?
[00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:10.580]   Why don't you come?
[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:13.140]   Why don't you send the Messiah?"
[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:15.660]   But he did it when the fullness of the times was come.
[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:16.660]   When was that?
[00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:21.740]   Well, you see, he had given the children of Israel enough time to see that the law, the
[00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:24.020]   mere possession of the law, couldn't save them.
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:25.160]   They thought it could.
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:29.160]   He gave them long enough to be absolutely convinced that it couldn't.
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:33.740]   And he at the same time gave the Greeks, the philosophers, enough time to see that their
[00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:36.960]   philosophy couldn't save the world either.
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:41.220]   Now you see, if God had sent Christ before these two things, some people might have gone
[00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:44.820]   on thinking, "Well, you know, if philosophy had only had a chance, it would have done
[00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:45.820]   it."
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:51.080]   So God allowed Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, and all the rest of them to come and teach,
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:57.580]   and set up their schools, and found their great followings, and lead to nothing.
[00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:01.340]   And then having proved that nothing could do it, he does it in his way.
[00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:06.280]   And so his glorious wisdom shines forth.
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:10.980]   And as you follow the subsequent history of the Church, you see it still shining in all
[00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:13.780]   its glory.
[00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:18.360]   How many times have men thought that the Christian Church is finished?
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:22.620]   How many times have they laughed at her, and ridiculed her, and almost buried her?
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:30.600]   But as they were about to put her in the grave, suddenly there's a resurrection, a revival.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:37.320]   And so God confounds his enemies, and displays his wisdom, so that we can say with the psalmist,
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:42.440]   "The wrath of men shall praise thee."
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:45.920]   And it's a wonderful thing, it seems to me, to be a Christian at a time like this, do
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:54.120]   you know, out of the present manifestation of the wrath of men, God is manifesting his
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:55.120]   wisdom.
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:46:00.520]   And the end of all this, as of all things that have happened like it before, is going
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:05.720]   to be that the wrath of men shall praise God.
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:08.760]   His purposes will ripen fast.
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:11.720]   Men can never stop them, nor frustrate them.
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:15.160]   What he has purposed, he will most surely perform.
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:19.760]   Very well, your responsibility and mine is this.
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:23.280]   Are we manifesting this wisdom of God?
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:26.120]   It's through the Church he does it.
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:29.120]   Is it being seen in us?
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:36.160]   Are we reflectors in our little way of this bright shining of this eternal wisdom?
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.360]   Are you somewhere in the spectrum?
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:43.760]   Is it being flashed through you?
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:49.560]   God forgive us if we are failing, but the way to succeed is to meditate upon these things,
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:56.240]   to look at it, to realize the truth about yourself as a part of the Church, and go on
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:00.720]   meditating upon it and dedicate yourself to him.
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:14.720]   And then through you, the light will shine in one of its variegated colors, and the angels
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:20.320]   will be made to be amazed at what they see in you.
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:27.000]   It was our blessed Lord himself who said that there is great rejoicing amongst the angels
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:34.880]   of God over every sinner that repenteth.
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.400]   Amen.
