[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.860]   [music]
[00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.940]   Irma writes in to ask, "Pastor John, is discouragement a sin?"
[00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:19.500]   It all depends on what the experience of discouragement is for Irma and for me.
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:28.500]   Let's make some distinctions between the sin kind of discouragement and the non-sin kind.
[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.800]   I think it's helpful to compare discouragement to something like anger and irritation and
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.920]   sorrow for our sin because I think all of those are possible without sin and they are
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.440]   quickly converted into sin and the question is what's the difference.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.960]   So the Bible says, "Be angry, but do not sin.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.480]   Don't let the sun go down on your anger."
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.120]   And then it says in James, "Be slow to anger, the anger of man does not work the righteousness
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.120]   of God."
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.440]   So anger is dangerous.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.720]   If you go to bed with it, if you come to it too quickly, if you stay with it too long,
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.040]   it's going to rot on you.
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.760]   And same thing with irritation.
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.960]   I've always wondered about this because it says in Acts 17 that Paul was irritated in
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:27.760]   his soul when he saw the idolatry and according to 1 Corinthians 13, love is not irritated.
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.920]   And it's the same word and even though the word easily irritated is stuck in in the translations,
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.160]   it just says irritated.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:42.400]   So there is irritation that love doesn't do and there is irritation that love does experience.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.080]   There's a holy irritation that can pass quickly into sinful irritation.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.640]   Same way with sorrow.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:58.040]   It's right to feel remorse and sorrow when we sin, but if that sorrow starts to paralyze
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:05.080]   us, if it doesn't willingly bow and receive grace, it's going to become a deadly and ungodly
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.760]   sorrow.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.880]   So those analogies help me when I come back now to discouragement and I say, "It's right
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:20.640]   to be saddened and disappointed and disheartened by the sin in our lives or the failures of
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.960]   other lives we see or the sins that our family members or our church or maybe our pastor
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.520]   is committing.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.120]   We see it and our hearts sink.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.120]   We're sad.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.120]   We're disappointed.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.560]   I think that's a kind of discouragement and I don't think it's wrong to feel that way.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.360]   What did Jesus feel in Mark 9 when he said, "Oh, faceless generation, how long am I to
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.360]   be with you?
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.920]   How long am I to bear with you?
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.360]   Bring him to me."
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.520]   What was Jesus feeling when he felt, it seems like, irritated, a holy irritation at the
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:05.360]   faithlessness of his disciples, a kind of holy frustration that his efforts to bring
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.240]   them to faith is taking so long?
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.240]   That's not sin in Jesus.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.520]   It's not an expression of delight.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.800]   He's somehow discouraged with the way they are.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:28.840]   So when we see a faithlessness in others or in ourselves, we ought to disapprove.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.980]   We ought to feel disheartened at failures of love.
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.720]   We ought to feel remorse at our sin and ache for the lostness of others.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.840]   And the big question is, what's the difference?
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.640]   Or when does the good kind become the bad kind?
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.960]   And here are the things I think Irma should watch for.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:55.760]   Watch for discouragement starting to turn into self-pity.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:04.640]   Watch for discouragement starting to paralyze you and keep us from doing what we should.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:15.160]   Watch for the threat to the abiding contentment that you have in God so that you can't say
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.960]   sorrowful yet always rejoicing.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:23.760]   If that always rejoicing starts to be defeated by your discouragement, discouragement's gotten
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.120]   into the sinful category.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.200]   When it leads us to doubt God's goodness or his wisdom or his power, it's passed over
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.400]   into the sinful part.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.160]   When it stamps our lives so that we're not outgoing and loving toward people anymore,
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.960]   we're just moping, feeling sorrow for ourselves, and we're so preoccupied with our own discouragement
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.960]   we can't love people anymore, we know our discouragement has become sin.
