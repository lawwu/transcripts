[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500]   - When people are giving presentations,
[00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.100]   you want the slides to live on their own
[00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.740]   because you mentioned they might get shared around,
[00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.500]   but you also don't want them to be distracting
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.720]   when you're talking.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.860]   Do you tell people to create two different presentations?
[00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.060]   - Yes, 100%.
[00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.300]   Yeah, almost always, because at the end of the day,
[00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.900]   your slides, I mean, think about it.
[00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.220]   You're giving a presentation with slides.
[00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.220]   What do you actually want them to do, the person?
[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.820]   Do you want them to read the slide,
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.300]   the words on there, and read the information?
[00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.180]   Then what are you doing there?
[00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.100]   Like, they're reading it.
[00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.340]   And if you don't want them to read it, then why have it?
[00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.060]   Like, unless it's just a picture,
[00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.020]   you're describing it, like, right, exactly.
[00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.500]   So there are your two things.
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.060]   You want them to read it or you don't.
[00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.200]   If you don't want them to read it,
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.040]   then it better be something
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.740]   that accentuates what you're saying.
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.580]   Bullet points, pictures, simple messages, like that simple.
[00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.300]   If you put up something enough that they have to read,
[00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.820]   there's no point in having it there
[00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.500]   because if you're talking, they're not gonna,
[00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.620]   what are they, trying to split time on reading it?
[00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.620]   Doing, jumping ahead, it's just, it's a disaster.
[00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.540]   People wanna put slides
[00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.500]   so it looks like they've done a lot of work.
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.340]   It's like, okay, by the way,
[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.740]   I'm not even against that sometimes.
[00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.140]   Sometimes there's graphs and charts that look good.
[00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.500]   So you put it on a slide
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.180]   and when you're presenting in person,
[00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.980]   but you're not speaking to the numbers on there.
[00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.580]   You're saying, we did extensive research
[00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.820]   and I will send you this in detail
[00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.020]   so you can read what this slide says,
[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.820]   but here's the summary, right?
[00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.700]   As opposed to like, here's the market research response.
[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.740]   As you could see here, it's like,
[00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.420]   your slides should accentuate what you're saying,
[00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.140]   not trying to do the work for you.
