[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.800]   All right.
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.920]   Let's do one more question here.
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.560]   What are we at?
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.640]   We're rolling along here.
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.180]   Let's do one more deep work question.
[00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.360]   This one is from Sparky.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.880]   Sparky says, in a 2014 blog post,
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.760]   you talked about temporary plans.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.360]   As I am a professor as well, these longer two to three week
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.680]   plans seem more useful than a purely weekly plan
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.320]   for occasions like end of the semester
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.360]   or a period before spring break or a big conference travel.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.160]   Do you have any updated tips or advice for these?
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.960]   I do, Sparky.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.520]   So when I used to talk about temporary plans,
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.280]   these were either habits you were temporarily trying out
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.600]   or work heuristics or plans that apply to a time
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.200]   delimited period, like the next month
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.480]   or the next two or three weeks.
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.120]   And I used to email these to myself.
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.520]   They'd be in my inbox, temporary plans,
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.440]   and so I could see them in there.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.820]   The main change I've made, Sparky,
[00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.000]   is I don't do that anymore.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.400]   I just have the temporary plans live on my weekly plan.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.360]   And when I redo my weekly plan, I'm like, yeah,
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.980]   this temporary plan is still in effect,
[00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.360]   so I'll just keep it there.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.120]   And I used to email my weekly plans to myself.
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.480]   Now I print them out.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.200]   Now I just keep--
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.320]   I don't want to have to look in my inbox at any occasion
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.720]   when I don't have to.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.840]   So that's my one change, is just have that live
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.000]   on your weekly plan.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.320]   At the top of your weekly plan, you
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.920]   can even label them as ongoing or temporary plans.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.400]   And I just have a Word document where my last weekly plan
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.560]   exists, and I just update it.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.240]   When I update it, there's a lot of these bigger picture
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.760]   temporary plan or heuristic type things that I just keep there.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.040]   So that'd be my only change.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.980]   (upbeat music)
