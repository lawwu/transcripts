[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.860]   I think probably most people are familiar
[00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:04.980]   with having an important decision
[00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.120]   where they have to weigh path A versus path B.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.060]   And I was in that place.
[00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.800]   I was actually choosing between a job
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.540]   at one institution and another institution,
[00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.700]   each of which had tremendous advantages,
[00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.180]   neither had any striking disadvantages,
[00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.000]   but it was a really hard decision.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.540]   And those close to me at that time will tell you
[00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.220]   that it was just brutal.
[00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.060]   - Been there.
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.940]   - Yeah, I made everybody around me suffer tremendously
[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.800]   to the point where people were just like flip a coin.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.540]   Now I'm not an indecisive person.
[00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.540]   I think it's one of these things where big decisions
[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.780]   I think deserve a lot of time and attention
[00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.060]   and it was a time constrained thing.
[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.260]   So I was poring over this pro cons list.
[00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.620]   I was watching YouTube videos,
[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.460]   trying to figure out best ways for decision-making.
[00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.300]   I was trying to, I actually-
[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.420]   - Isn't it amazing by the way,
[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.500]   when we're in those situations
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.980]   and I know exactly what you're talking about
[00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.020]   because I was pretty sure I was in exactly
[00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.500]   the same position.
[00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.120]   The things you do in those circumstances
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.840]   to get some insight are wacky.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.400]   Like I'm sure you were Googling things
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.420]   that you had no business Googling
[00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.020]   these kinds of decision trees and-
[00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.860]   - Oh yeah.
[00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.700]   - I mean, it turns out-
[00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.140]   - They're mathematical models that like there's the,
[00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.700]   actually my colleague at NYU, Tony Mavishin,
[00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.740]   I forget the name of the model,
[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.600]   but there's a model about how many towns
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.440]   you should evaluate.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.500]   It's an old kind of old example of a towns
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.660]   you should evaluate in terms of where to start a business.
[00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.940]   Like, is it two, is it three?
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.820]   And there's an optimal strategy there.
[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.120]   In any event, most of it wasn't helping.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.420]   And I do believe that at some point
[00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.380]   you don't want too many committee members
[00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.700]   'cause it just gets confusing.
[00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.180]   So the two best pieces of information
[00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.700]   came from the following practices.
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.860]   One was a colleague said,
[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.740]   "Forget all the superficial pro-con stuff."
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.500]   And I actually think this has proved to be very useful
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.580]   in all domains of life for me.
[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.060]   He said, "Take yourself through a typical weekday
[00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.460]   in one place versus the other.
[00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.620]   Wake up, where are you going to go?
[00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.620]   How are you going to travel?
[00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.980]   Take yourself through the practicals of the day
[00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.540]   because everything else falls away
[00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.860]   once you're at a place
[00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.300]   or you're in a type of relationship.
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.500]   Take yourself through a given day.
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.060]   Don't think about the relationship
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.020]   or the institution that you're going to work for,
[00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.500]   the school you're going to go to.
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.660]   That's important,
[00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.140]   but take yourself through the entire day."
[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.420]   So I did that.
[00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.820]   And then he said, "Also do it on a weekend
[00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.420]   because in our profession, we tend to work all the time,
[00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.180]   but occasionally you take a day off."
[00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.540]   And so that was very useful.
[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.020]   The other thing that was very useful,
[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.180]   which was completely surprising to me was at that time,
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.020]   I was training in a boxing gym
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.500]   and I was doing some speed bag work and decent at it.
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.340]   You get into a rhythm.
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.700]   And what's so great about speed bag work
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.820]   is that you get into a rhythm
[00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.420]   where you forget that you're trying to do the movement
[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.260]   in a particular way.
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.120]   These central pattern generators,
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.140]   as we call them in neuroscience, take over.
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.600]   And you're just kind of turning your hands over in a way
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.820]   and like every once in a while you can think,
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.820]   okay, I need to put a little more hip swivel into this
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.140]   or a little more head movement
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.480]   and practice my slips or something.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.240]   But it's largely unconscious after a certain point.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.260]   And I was doing that.
[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.540]   And all of a sudden, boom,
[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.820]   a thought just geyser to the surface.
[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.300]   And I made my decision.
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.420]   And that was my final decision.
[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.140]   And I never went back from that decision.
[00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.640]   And so it was in the act of not trying to parse things
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.920]   to words that words sprung up from my, whatever,
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.160]   unconscious somewhere in my brain,
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.240]   cortical or subcortical, I don't know.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.180]   And it was like, that's it.
[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.920]   And I was overwhelmed by that.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.160]   And again, I don't share all that
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.520]   because I think it's speed bags
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.720]   or it's the example I gave before
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.000]   that's gonna solve it for everybody.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.640]   But that these answers to hard problems
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.760]   seem to come from very diametrically opposed approaches,
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.000]   verbal construction of complete sentences
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.360]   with paper or deliberately like Dyseroth does.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.860]   And then also like not trying to get an answer at all,
[00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.040]   boom, the answer shows up.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.480]   What in the world is that?
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.840]   - So it speaks to this idea that first of all,
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.400]   there are no one size fits all solutions
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.260]   to addressing many of the big kinds of problems
[00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.920]   and decisions we have to face.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.160]   So there are different modalities
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.620]   to self-discovery and insight.
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.780]   And yes, you can think very rationally
[00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.800]   and work it through and write about it
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.720]   and have conversations with other people.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.400]   And then you can also allow
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.400]   your unconscious problem-solving machinery to do its thing.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.740]   We don't understand completely how this works,
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.740]   but we do know that your experience is not infrequent.
[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.600]   Many people report having moments of insight
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.540]   when they are not otherwise engaged.
[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.880]   And one line of thinking is that
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.520]   we are doing problem solving behind the scenes
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.520]   that we're not aware of
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.240]   and the solutions are bubbling up to awareness.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.620]   So I actually, this may be the wrong usage of terms,
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.080]   but I weaponize this process for myself.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.760]   So before I exercise, before I get on the treadmill
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.600]   or row or do whatever I'm gonna do,
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.080]   I will load up the particular issue
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.260]   that I'm trying to find a solution for.
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.680]   Sometimes it's how to word a paragraph.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.480]   It might be if I'm working on a book,
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.880]   how to find the right kind of story.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.880]   If it's an interpersonal issue that I've gotta smooth over,
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.760]   I load that up and then I just get on the device.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.960]   It's usually an aerobic exercise that I'm doing.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.480]   And I don't really think about it in any fixed way,
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.040]   but inevitably the ideas,
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.900]   the potential solutions bubble up into awareness.
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.500]   That is a real valuable tool that I possess
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.660]   that I think allows me to have success
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.300]   in various areas of my life.
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.700]   It also identifies one of the reasons
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.620]   why chatter can be so unbelievably pernicious.
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.180]   So we didn't get to all the benefits of the,
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.500]   there's one more benefit of the inner voice
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.340]   that I wanna get to,
[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.060]   but I'm gonna take a detour here for a second
[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.080]   'cause I think this is really important.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.300]   If we think of chatter as the dark side of your inner voice,
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.020]   you're basically continuing to loop over
[00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.660]   the same problem in your head without making any progress.
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:19.620]   What if this happens?
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:20.560]   Why did this happen?
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.580]   I'm such an imbecile.
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.240]   You're just continually going over
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.420]   that negative phenomenon or experience.
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.880]   You're not making any headway.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.580]   One of the things that that does
[00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.740]   is it consumes our attentional resources.
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.060]   It acts like a sponge that soaks up those limited resources.
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.820]   And so what that means is when I get on the treadmill
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.660]   or rowing machine and that's typically the time
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.700]   that I spend innovating, right?
[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.660]   Coming up with solutions that allow me
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.840]   to progress personally and professionally,
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.260]   I don't have, my mind's not working
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.040]   to solve those problems.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.980]   Instead, it is stuck dealing with this other muck
[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.820]   where I'm not getting anywhere.
[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.700]   And so we actually see, if you look at the literature,
[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.740]   that one of the ways that chatter undermines people
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.180]   is it interferes with their ability
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.380]   to focus and solve problems.
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.900]   And that's just one way it undermines people,
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.700]   but that is a huge, huge liability.
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.860]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.900]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
