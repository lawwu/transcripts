[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   All right, Jesse, what do we got next?
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.340]   Next question is from Roger, a senior level consultant in Wisconsin.
[00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.880]   For midsize projects such as preparing a large proposal for a new client, my tendency is
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.840]   to allow the effort to fill the available time up to the deadline.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.360]   How do I know when something is good enough to be done?
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.240]   Yeah, these type of perfectionist issues are common, especially in knowledge work where
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.460]   you have many different things you're being asked to do.
[00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.000]   It can be psychologically difficult at some point to say this is good enough, let's move
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.960]   on.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.760]   If you can't get to that point, you end up like Roger is talking about here, feeling
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.160]   every minute, staying up late, letting other things fall on the wayside because you're
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.640]   just not quite comfortable finishing because it could be better.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.640]   What about this?
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.720]   What about that?
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.480]   And that can be damaging both psychologically, but also to your career prospects.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.920]   The one thing I would recommend, Roger, is clearly identifying the subset of things you
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.100]   do in your job that are what I call needle mover activities.
[00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.000]   These are the things that really make the biggest difference in your career.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.360]   These are probably going to be the things that most heavily leverage your hard won skills
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.080]   and or produce the most value for your organization.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.300]   These are the things if you can do them at a very high level, will give you leverage
[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.500]   over everything else.
[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.960]   This is what we care about, right?
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.520]   So if you are a ad copywriter, a madman type situation, it's like how effective are the
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.420]   ad campaigns you're writing?
[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.540]   Are they actually generating a lot of business for clients?
[00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.780]   That's the needle mover activity.
[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.460]   If you're the developer at a startup, how crisp and robust is your code?
[00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.420]   If you can write really sharp code that's very stable and very efficient, man, that's
[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.420]   what matters.
[00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.720]   That's what allows us our product to work.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.340]   It saves us all these hours of repair and support.
[00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.460]   It's the skill that matters.
[00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.460]   If you're a professor, papers.
[00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.220]   Are you writing papers that are attracting citations and are being published in top venues?
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.140]   These are needle mover activities.
[00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.920]   Once you clearly identify what the needle mover activities are, you can be much more
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.300]   comfortable with the psychological toll of saying this is good enough with everything
[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.300]   else.
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.060]   So you're the ad copywriter.
[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.280]   This is the thing that really matters.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.700]   When there's a one-off thing you're asked to do, like, "Hey, can you get together client
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.620]   testimonials for our website?"
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.220]   You're more comfortable saying, "I'll just do a good enough job.
[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.540]   I found some testimonials.
[00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.540]   I made a plan.
[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.540]   I found them.
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.540]   I checked them.
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.540]   I did it on time.
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.540]   It's at a reasonable level of quality.
[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.540]   Great.
[00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.540]   Let me get back to the thing I really care about."
[00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.100]   You're a professor doing a committee.
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.860]   Let me make sure I'm responsible and reasonable and I show up and do the stuff I say I'm going
[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.420]   to do and I don't want to hand in crap, but I'm keeping this pretty contained.
[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.100]   I have an hour for it here, half hour for it here, and I'm happy with just that's good
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.100]   enough.
[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.540]   So when you know what really matters, you don't sweat so much about the stuff that doesn't
[00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.680]   matter so much.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.940]   Now keep in mind, if you don't take this approach, if you instead fall back on the perfectionist
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.560]   approach, "I just want everything to be beautiful," this can actually be counterproductive for
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.720]   your career.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.920]   If people learn, "Oh, you're someone that no matter what I give them is going to do,
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.600]   they're going to obsess about it and it's going to be 2x better than I would do myself.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.480]   If I tell them to get client testimonials, they're going to find all these different
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.040]   testimonials and go back and get them revised and they're going to find images and it's
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.640]   going to be really great for the website," I'm going to start wanting you to do more
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.760]   and more of these things.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.760]   You will become my go-to person for these type of activities.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.280]   And what you're going to find yourself then is drowning in what in the research literature
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.760]   they called non-promotable activities.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.480]   So activities that are not directly related to the main thing you do.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.760]   You're the professor who everyone wants on their committees because you really do such
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.000]   a good job, but now you can't do your research.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.560]   And that's what ultimately matters for you keeping your job.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.280]   You're the ad copywriter that everyone wants to pull onto their internal facing initiatives
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.080]   because they know that stuff will get done.
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.120]   And because of that, you're not producing the award-winning campaigns on which you could
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.280]   build your career.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.520]   So there's a cost beyond just the psychology of, "Oh, my schedule is full because I can't
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.520]   let things go."
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.240]   There's a cost to your career trajectory if you're too good at too many things.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.080]   Put your energy into the needle moving activities, be reasonable, a reasonable, responsible human
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.080]   on everything else.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.080]   I won't be late.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.360]   I won't drop the ball and I'll be fine.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.720]   But I'm not really trying to blow you away with the stuff that doesn't really matter.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.640]   I think it's actually better for your career growth paradoxically to be worse at some things
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.040]   and better at others.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.080]   It's not the case that being as good as possible at all the things you do is actually going
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.240]   to be the fastest route to progression inside your career.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.160]   [Music]
