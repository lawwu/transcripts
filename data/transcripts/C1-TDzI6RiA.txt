[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480]   Well, how can I meaningfully bless my children before bed?
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.480]   I love this question.
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.280]   It is from a dad named Wes.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.280]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.280]   Thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.160]   My question is about blessing my children.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.920]   I have three boys, six and under.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.000]   Among the household duties that I regularly assume is bedtime, I have since each was born
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.600]   sang "Jesus loves me" to them every night, thousands of times, inserting their names
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.960]   into the lyrics.
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.240]   I am stunned at the impact this little song has.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.560]   Even when a child is melting down and revolting against being put to bed, they will not let
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.880]   me skip the song.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.520]   Additionally, I pray for each son as well.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.960]   Now, I have decided to give each of my boys a blessing.
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.220]   It will be given to them nightly, and it must be theologically rich since it will be memorized
[00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.600]   by them throughout the years.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.080]   There are so many biblical truths I want them to understand and carry on into adulthood.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.440]   I can't seem to find the right words or scriptures to incorporate them all.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.760]   If you were writing or selecting a blessing for your son to carry throughout his life,
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.160]   how would you do it and maybe more specifically, what truths would you want them to hear every
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.160]   night?
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.720]   Pastor John, what would you say to Wes?
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:18.400]   Well, since Wes seems to me to be so far ahead of most parents here, let me cheat a little
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:27.240]   bit on his question and back up and give some words of explanation and foundation and encourage
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.800]   judgment, I hope, before I say something brief in response to his particular question
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.680]   about a content for the blessing of his children.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.280]   What I mean when I say he's ahead of most parents is that I would guess very few parents
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.200]   actually have given a lot of thought to what a blessing over their children would look
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.800]   like or whether they should do it at all or why they should do it or what it should include.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:03.120]   Like he's asking, so in answering Wes, I want to encourage parents who maybe never even
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.360]   thought that this is a good idea to give it some serious consideration, namely blessing,
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:17.240]   speaking blessing over their children regularly, perhaps nightly as they put them to bed.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.740]   So a little background and explanation.
[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:26.920]   The most famous blessing in the Bible is probably Numbers 6, 24 to 26.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.240]   The Lord bless you and keep you.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.460]   The Lord make his face shine on you and be gracious to you.
[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.700]   The Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace.
[00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.380]   Now here's what's unique about a blessing like that, as opposed to a simple prayer.
[00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:52.700]   In prayer, we are talking directly to God, and when we use the word you in prayer, we
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.180]   mean you, God.
[00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.380]   We're not talking directly to people when we pray, even though corporate prayer is good
[00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.860]   and it's intended that people are to hear us and say amen when we pray.
[00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.620]   But in a blessing, we are talking directly to people or a person.
[00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:19.140]   And when we use the word you, we don't mean God, we mean you, the person that we're talking
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.140]   to.
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:28.260]   And yet we are intending for God to be the one who acts in response to our blessing.
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.500]   In other words, a blessing is moving in two directions.
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:39.280]   We really do intend for two persons to hear what we are saying.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:48.660]   The one we are addressing directly, and God, whom we intend to hear us and will give the
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.940]   blessing on the person that we're talking to.
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:04:00.540]   So when we say, "The Lord bless you and keep you," we are directly speaking to another
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.500]   person or group of people, but we're asking the Lord to do the blessing.
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:15.340]   So when we bless someone, we're making plain that we believe God is the decisive actor,
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.260]   but that he uses human means to perform his act of blessing.
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.020]   If we don't believe that, we wouldn't be speaking the blessing.
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:33.820]   Our speaking, we believe, that's why we do it, our speaking is part of God's way of doing
[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.220]   the blessing.
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.580]   This is what's unique and powerful and precious about a blessing.
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:48.860]   In the very act of blessing, we become part of the means by which God blesses the person
[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.260]   that we're speaking to.
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:59.880]   So the relationship that such a blessing forges is part of the blessing that God imparts.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.720]   This is why it can be so powerful with our children.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.680]   The blessing is coming from God through daddy.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.520]   It's coming from God through daddy.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.500]   That's a very powerful moment as children come to understand what's going on here.
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.760]   So here are a couple of bridges between the Old Testament practice.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.360]   You might wonder, "Well, yeah, they did that in the Old Testament.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.960]   Where's that in the New Testament?"
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.920]   Here's some bridges between Old Testament blessing, like number six, for example, Isaac
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:36.820]   blessing his sons by faith in Hebrews 11, 20 to 21, referring back.
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:43.080]   For example, Jesus says in Mark 10, 15, "Whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.960]   child shall not enter the kingdom."
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:54.780]   And he took them in his arms and he blessed them, laying his hands on them.
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:02.800]   So it's a very Christ-like thing to do, to bless children, laying our hands on our children
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.520]   as we speak a blessing over them.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:15.840]   Now, what guidance do we get from the apostles as to what a Christian might say in a blessing
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.320]   on another Christian or on a child or family?
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.080]   Here are a couple of pointers.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:29.140]   It's amazing to me that at the beginning of every single letter that Paul wrote, that
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:39.620]   he says something like, "Grace to you, grace be to you, and peace from God our Father and
[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.260]   the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:46.140]   It's Romans 1, 7, and it's at the beginning of every letter.
[00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:52.140]   And at the end of every single letter, no exceptions, he writes something like, "The
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:56.380]   grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you."
[00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.140]   That's Romans 16, 20.
[00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:05.140]   Now, these are the kind of blessings which Paul pronounces over the recipients of his
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.140]   letters.
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.620]   They're addressed to the readers, to you.
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.500]   He's saying you, readers.
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:17.340]   But they are intended to call down grace and peace from God the Father and from the Lord
[00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.340]   Jesus.
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:25.780]   So Paul expects that his words will be part of the blessing that God imparts with grace
[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.060]   and peace to the readers.
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:34.680]   And I think the reason he says, "Grace to you, be to you, grace be to you," at the beginning
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:40.820]   of the letters, and "Grace be with you," at the end of the letters, without exception,
[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:48.700]   is that the divine truth of the letter itself is part of the powerful grace that is coming
[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.820]   to them as they read the letter.
[00:07:52.820 --> 00:08:01.060]   And then the abiding effects of the truth-mediated blessing coming to them in the letter goes
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:08.940]   with them as they get up and leave the reading of the letter and enter into their daily lives.
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:16.500]   So the biblical content, you might say, of our blessing spoken over our children is found
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.580]   between the beginning and the end of Paul's epistles.
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:24.920]   You want to know what to bless your children with, you read the epistles.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:33.260]   And if we would go to the heart of the matter, it would be, I think, let Romans 8.32 guide
[00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.000]   the content of your blessing.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Here it goes.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.880]   "He who did not spare his own son, but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.700]   him graciously give us all things?"
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:56.220]   In other words, make sure that God's unfathomable gift of his son to die for us is placed as
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:04.540]   the foundation of all grace and all peace and all the blessings that come to your children.
[00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:10.660]   And then summarize that grace and peace with words surrounding Romans 8.32 and the rest
[00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:16.860]   of Romans 8, "called, justified, inseparably kept through hardship, through suffering,
[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.060]   for the enjoyment of God's presence forever."
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:25.980]   I think one of the best guides, this little advertisement, I think one of the best guides
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:33.220]   for us is David Michael's little booklet, A Father's Guide to Blessing His Children.
[00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:37.060]   You can find that over at truth78.org.
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:45.220]   And some look your children in the eye and speak grace and peace into their lives based
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:54.420]   on the gift of God in the death of Jesus, and make plain the central blessings that
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:10:01.660]   Christ has purchased for his children—freedom from sin, everlasting life, everlasting joy,
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:09.260]   eternal presence of God, of Jesus, keeping them through all the hardships of life and
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:10.260]   suffering.
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.940]   What a privilege for dads.
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.460]   Thank you, Pastor John, for this advice.
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:19.740]   Well, whether you listen in the car or the gym or doing chores, thank you for inviting

[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.380]   great one from Wes.

[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.460]   You can send us your own question online at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:44.820]   Well, last week, we talked a little bit about the challenge of why our theology doesn't
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:48.940]   change our lives quickly, at least not as fast as we would like it to.
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:53.180]   We also talked about the expulsive power of a new affection that those new holy affections
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:59.060]   we have for God help push out of our lives the fallen desires that we have for sin.
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:04.300]   But from those topics emerges another related question, namely this one.
[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:09.020]   Realistically, how changed will my desires become in this life?
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.420]   It's a question from a listener named Emma.
[00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.860]   It's a really great one, another really great question.
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:15.860]   And that's up next time.
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:16.860]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.100]   We'll see you back here on Monday.
