[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600]   Hey everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.480]   In this episode, I want to talk about racism
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.280]   and how we can deal with racism
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.720]   and what we can do about racism, because I'm mad.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.720]   I'm pissed off.
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.680]   This shit is fucked up and bullshit.
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.000]   What's happening in the black community is an outrage.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.400]   The woman in Central Park calling the cops on a black man
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.800]   for asking her to put her dog on a leash
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.600]   and then going into hysteria,
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.640]   saying that he's attacking her.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.200]   I mean, what if there was no video camera?
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.760]   You could easily see a situation
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.080]   where the cops would side on her side
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.120]   and put the black man away,
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.640]   and then there would be no due process.
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.120]   You can see that happening.
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.280]   I'm sure that's happened many times in the past.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.160]   What about the young black man who was hunted down
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.360]   by two citizen vigilantes and then shot?
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.320]   And of course, what about George Floyd,
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.760]   who was lying on the ground?
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.520]   He wasn't resisting arrest,
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.640]   and he got choked to death
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.640]   because an officer put his knee on his neck.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.120]   I mean, this stuff keeps on happening
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.160]   over and over and over again.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.480]   And thank goodness there is cell phone footage,
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.160]   because otherwise, this stuff is just gonna get swept
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.080]   under the rug because the system is messed up.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.480]   There's institutional racism all throughout the country,
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.920]   and as a result of historical institutional racism,
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.440]   you are seeing a massive widening of the wealth gap
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.240]   between white America and black America.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.760]   For example, segregation of housing,
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.320]   having different loan terms based on your race,
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.280]   getting shut out of universities because of your race,
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.080]   not getting a job because of your race,
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.080]   not getting the same opportunities
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.520]   because you have nobody in that organization
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.600]   who looks like you who can fight for you.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.320]   Institutional racism is systemic and it's endemic,
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.200]   and it's not going away anytime soon
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.760]   because the people in power are gonna have to hurt,
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.320]   are gonna have to lose some of that power,
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.040]   give up some of that wealth in order to help
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.160]   those who have been negatively affected
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.240]   by institutional racism.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.480]   This change takes generations,
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.120]   and hopefully, hopefully by speaking up and speaking out,
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.400]   the younger generation, the next generation,
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.120]   those who are poised to inherit trillions of dollars
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.160]   of wealth from their parents are gonna recognize
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.480]   how messed up the system is
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.600]   and that they should do something about it
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.680]   by utilizing their wealth and power to help others.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.760]   If you don't believe there is systemic,
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.680]   endemic, institutional racism all throughout the country,
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.240]   let's just look at some statistics.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.640]   This is from 2014, and I'm sure the data for 2020
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.960]   is gonna look even more egregious.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.720]   If you think institutional racism does not exist,
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.240]   you would assume that the median household net worth
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.600]   between white America and black America
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.680]   is quite similar post-college.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.720]   The higher the education level goes,
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.760]   the closer the net worth levels.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.320]   So let's take a look.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.560]   According to the Survey on Income
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.120]   and Program Participation of 2014,
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.320]   the median household net worth for white America
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.320]   with a high school education is $118,580.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.640]   The median household net worth for black America is $6,660.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.200]   That's with a high school education.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.240]   The median net worth for white America
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.680]   with some college is 135,415.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.680]   The median household net worth for black America is 18,200.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.520]   Now with a college degree,
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.360]   the median household net worth for white America is 268,000.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.160]   However, the median net worth for black America,
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.360]   this is with a college degree, is 70,219.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.920]   Fine, there's all sorts of different levels of college,
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.240]   qualities of college, forget about legacy admissions,
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.520]   all that crap.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.920]   Now let's look at post-college.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.520]   So a master's degree and a doctorate degree.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.360]   These institutions are much fewer
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.880]   and they're much tighter in terms of the quality.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.920]   The median household net worth for white America
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.880]   with a post-college education is 455,000,
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.000]   whereas the median household net worth for black America
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.240]   with post-college education is only 141,000.
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.960]   So we're talking about a 3x differential
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.720]   despite having a master's degree or doctorate degree,
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.160]   this is less than 15% of the college educated population.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.320]   And think what happens when there's this discrimination
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.320]   that goes on in society for decades, if not centuries.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.480]   And think about what happens to your wealth
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.280]   if you allow it to compound for a long enough time period.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.080]   Compound interest is the most powerful force in finance.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.480]   And if you are given or if you start
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.000]   with a higher level of wealth
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.320]   and you get to earn a higher income
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.000]   and you get to save a higher amount
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.900]   every single year for decades or centuries,
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.140]   you are gonna blow that wealth gap wide open.
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.920]   And you can forget about meritocracy
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.320]   because for our children,
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.920]   it's gonna be a tremendously unfair fight.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.720]   And as a father now, I think about my children all the time.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.620]   I think about how they're gonna compete
[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.400]   in this ultra competitive society.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.120]   I think about so many of the setbacks
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.040]   they are probably gonna face due to discrimination,
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.720]   due to racism, whether it's overt or it's disguised.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.020]   Because let's be frank,
[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.020]   most discrimination is a disguised form of discrimination
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.520]   that is spoken behind closed doors, behind closed doors.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.880]   And it's disguised because you cannot really figure out
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.580]   what is going on in the decision maker's head
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.000]   when he or she decides not to hire you for the job
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.140]   or hire you for some side hustle or pick you up
[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.440]   or want to or not wanna work with you for some project.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.640]   It's that disguised discrimination,
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.960]   that disguised racism that is really hard to identify.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.040]   And let's be honest,
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.080]   we all have some preconceived notions
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.480]   and beliefs about certain people.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.120]   And that's just how we process information.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.600]   We need to process information
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.480]   and come to some kind of conclusion and make a judgment.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.400]   And we can't not make a judgment
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.800]   because we wouldn't be able to function efficiently.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.700]   But I challenge everyone to really think about an issue,
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.140]   get to know a person before passing judgment.
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.240]   It is really much harder to hate someone
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.960]   if you get to know someone.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.000]   This is one of my main messages of this episode.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.600]   It is much harder to hate someone
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.040]   if you get to know someone.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.360]   And this is why I encourage everyone
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.640]   to try to learn another language,
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.040]   to travel abroad, to live abroad
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.000]   for an extended period of time,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.800]   to diversify your social network.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.040]   Look around and see who you're all friends with.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.840]   Are you all friends with people who look like you,
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.840]   talk like you, come from the same background as you,
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.320]   same socioeconomic class as you?
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.000]   If so, it's gonna be hard for you to grow.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.840]   It's gonna be hard for you to get out
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.200]   of the normal and natural way of thinking and doing things.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.440]   But if you get out there and diversify your network
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.960]   and make an effort to learn and grow,
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.760]   I promise you things will get better.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.940]   But in the short run, unfortunately,
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.720]   you will be probably looked upon as an outcast,
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.880]   someone who might be ruffling some feathers
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.320]   just for change, an agitator or whatnot.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.760]   For myself, here in the personal finance community,
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.800]   financial samurai is often looked at as an outcast.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.080]   I don't participate in all these conventions
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.560]   that tend to congratulate the same people
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.040]   over and over again.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.680]   I'm not constantly out there trying to self-promote
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.040]   so I can sell something, and it's totally fine.
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.840]   I just don't have much to sell, right?
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.480]   I've got a book on severance negotiations,
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.360]   and that's about it.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.760]   I just wanna live my life,
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.320]   but I also wanna speak my truth,
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.600]   get my message out there on what I believe in,
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.520]   and I'm not afraid of the herd.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.820]   I don't need to be in a herd to feel safe and protected.
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.140]   If someone's gonna come at me, I'm gonna defend myself,
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.440]   I'm gonna defend my family,
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.360]   and I'm gonna come after them if they cross the line.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.920]   That's just the way I've always been since I was a kid.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.640]   One of the main reasons why I talk so much
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.840]   about personal finance and why I want everybody
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.080]   to gain financial independence
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:06.040]   is so that you guys can speak up, speak your mind,
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.000]   and not be so afraid of financial ruin.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.800]   You don't have to kiss anybody's ass at work
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.740]   if they are doing something bad or they're berating you.
[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:17.000]   You don't have to look the other way
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.600]   if you see some type of injustice.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.760]   You speak up, you say, "Hey, yo, what are you doing?
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.240]   "What are you doing?"
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.400]   If you can save up enough money
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.880]   and build a large enough passive income portfolio,
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.200]   you will have the courage to speak up.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.200]   I've talked about racism in the past in several posts,
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.760]   maybe four or five,
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.880]   whether it was experiencing the Ku Klux Klan
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.520]   down in Abington, Virginia when I was visiting my girlfriend
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.860]   to experiencing multiple types of racial incidences
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.360]   when I was growing up in Virginia
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.980]   for high school and college.
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.300]   And racism, frankly, is one of my main motivators
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:56.240]   to not stop, to keep working hard, to keep saving,
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.800]   to keep being free,
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.260]   because I went through so much crap growing up
[00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.460]   in international schools and in American schools.
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.340]   And I wanna share some of them with you.
[00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.980]   So if you have racial tendencies,
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:12.020]   if you haven't traveled, if you haven't gotten to know me
[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.300]   or gotten to know the person you're trying to hate on
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.580]   or you are hating on, maybe you will stop.
[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:18.980]   Maybe you will learn to empathize
[00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.740]   because it's really important
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:25.580]   that you know that racism is wrong and it's very exhausting
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.460]   and it's sometimes deadly to the person
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.340]   on the receiving end of racism.
[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.620]   My first experience with racism started in the fourth grade
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.360]   at Taipei American School in Taiwan.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.320]   We always had a Americans versus Chinese soccer game
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.780]   during recess.
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:44.700]   The issue was I was an American, but of Asian ethnicity.
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.280]   Americans was really a code word for white,
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.940]   which included my white European classmates.
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.980]   And it was just so weird at that time.
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.100]   I knew at that time, fourth grade,
[00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.140]   that this thing didn't make sense
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.540]   and it was creating this fissure between us,
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.340]   unnecessary fissure, but what could I do?
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.260]   I was in fourth grade, I was like nine years old.
[00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:06.540]   So even though we were in Taiwan,
[00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.000]   Asians were called derogatory names on the pitch
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.620]   by non-Asians at the school.
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:13.700]   There was a fight every single week.
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.900]   It was every single week.
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.380]   And I got into those fights.
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.720]   One time I was tripped by a white German kid
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.300]   who proceeded to then stand over me
[00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.260]   and taunt me with racial slurs.
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.900]   He was a slightly bigger kid,
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.980]   but I wasn't having any of that shit.
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:28.820]   No way.
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.860]   So I swept his legs, stomped my heel into his solar plex,
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:33.780]   and he started to cry.
[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.140]   He laughed no longer.
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.780]   We both had to face the wall during the next recess.
[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.400]   And then another time in the seventh grade
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.040]   at the International School of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.380]   I was minding my own business.
[00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:46.460]   I was shooting hoops during recess.
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.860]   When this white kid proceeded to pick up my ball,
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.740]   punt it across the outdoor court for no reason,
[00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.420]   and then top it off with a racial slur,
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.300]   I was like, "Yo, what are you doing?"
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.340]   I was so pissed off.
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:58.140]   I was really pissed off.
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.500]   So I told him, "Look, go get the ball.
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.660]   "Go get the ball, you, blah, blah, blah, blah, right?
[00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.780]   "I was like, go get the ball."
[00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.620]   And then when he refused, I just lost it.
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.860]   So I punched him in his eardrum with an open hand.
[00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.120]   And he went to the nurse's office crying.
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.220]   And then they said he had lost his hearing
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.320]   for about a month.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.420]   And that was a shock to me.
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:18.420]   And I felt really bad.
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.020]   So I apologized to him.
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.180]   And then he apologized to me.
[00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:25.380]   But that was another incidence where I will never forget.
[00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:26.220]   What the hell?
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.060]   And from that day on, we were cool.
[00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:28.900]   We were cool.
[00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.180]   He realized what he had done.
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:33.340]   And I realized I probably shouldn't have gone that far.
[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.300]   And it was interesting because, you know,
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.300]   elementary school, middle school,
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.740]   I was able to fight back.
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.000]   And I always fought back
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.660]   because we were more or less the same size.
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:44.940]   But then starting in high school,
[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:46.560]   people started getting bigger.
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.720]   And I stopped growing.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.340]   I'm only about 5'10".
[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.700]   And I was like 150 pounds then.
[00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.500]   So it was much harder to fight back
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.460]   because it was much more dangerous.
[00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.620]   And some kids brought knives to school.
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.220]   And this was a public high school in Northern Virginia.
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.520]   But even with the size differential,
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.180]   I still fought back on occasion.
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.820]   And it was strategic.
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.220]   You know, I remember getting suspended for a couple days
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.220]   because this big guy, he was like 6'2",
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.560]   he was 40 pounds heavier.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.500]   I was tying my shoe.
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.580]   This was computer science class.
[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.940]   I was tying my shoe, just minding my own business.
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:18.580]   But he wanted to sit in that seat.
[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.220]   And there was no assigned seats.
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:21.660]   So he said, "Sam, move."
[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:22.860]   I said, "Look, I'm tying my shoe.
[00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:23.900]   "Just give me a moment."
[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.420]   And so he had a cheap shot.
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.820]   He pushed me down while I was tying my shoe.
[00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:31.200]   And I hit my head on the back of another desk.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.220]   And so I got up and I punched him in the face,
[00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:36.060]   right in his glasses,
[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.020]   which shattered in his face.
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.240]   And then I remember,
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.900]   I still remember the look on the teacher's face.
[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.020]   She was just frantic.
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.500]   "Oh no, oh no."
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:47.180]   And then everybody was just jeering and cheering.
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:51.340]   And that was when the disciplinarian came in to the room,
[00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:52.740]   pulled us aside, broke us up,
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.220]   told us to knock it out.
[00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.500]   And it was interesting because the disciplinarian,
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.020]   I don't know what his official word was.
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:59.200]   We called him a narc,
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.060]   but he wasn't a narc because he was clearly
[00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.980]   over 40 years old.
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.140]   He was my high school tennis coach.
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.940]   And so he was like, "What are you doing?"
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.860]   And so I got suspended a couple days.
[00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.420]   And, but I told him what happened.
[00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.540]   I said, "Coach, this guy pushed me over.
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.140]   "He was picking on me and I fought back."
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:18.020]   And he's like, "You know what?
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:18.860]   "You gotta fight back.
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:20.780]   "You gotta fight back against that."
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.140]   And then when I was a junior in high school,
[00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:24.220]   I used to work at McDonald's.
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.220]   It was kind of the worst job ever
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.300]   because I had to get in at 6 a.m.
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.960]   And the pay was $3.75 an hour initially.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.260]   And I think I got a raise to $4 an hour.
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.300]   So imagine being in high school.
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:38.540]   It's a weekend and you gotta get in there
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.340]   at 5.55, 6 a.m. to open up shop,
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.540]   make sure everything is clean
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.740]   and start preparing the food.
[00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:47.340]   And you're making $3.75 an hour,
[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:48.780]   which frankly at the time was not a lot.
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.140]   It's minimum wage is minimum wage.
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.740]   So minimum wage right now, wherever you're earning,
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.020]   is not a lot of money, right?
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.700]   So at that time, I remember studying three years of Spanish.
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.020]   My language skills, not so good.
[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:01.980]   But I was studying Spanish
[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.940]   and I wanted to practice my Spanish
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.660]   and all of my colleagues spoke Spanish.
[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.620]   And so I would try to speak to them
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.340]   between eating some apple pies.
[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.220]   Obviously the broken apple pies, not the good ones, right?
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.380]   Or flipping the quarter pounder in cheese
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.740]   and trying not to drop it on the floor
[00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:19.140]   and putting it back in the heating oven.
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.260]   And whenever the manager would hear us speak Spanish,
[00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.340]   he was a white guy and he was total power tripper.
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.020]   He would say something like, "Shut up all of you.
[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:29.540]   "Stop speaking Spanish
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.680]   "and making the customers feel uncomfortable.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.320]   "This is America."
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.160]   Right?
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.140]   And I was thinking, look, we're in the back,
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.440]   we're talking Spanish, we're trying to kill time
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.380]   while we make $3.75 to $4 an hour.
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.100]   What the F's your problem?
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.180]   I mean, he's a total power tripper.
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.740]   And this is when I was realizing, you know what?
[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.700]   I don't know, making $4 an hour
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.420]   and getting verbally abused by this fellow
[00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:54.260]   was not worth it.
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.300]   I'm gonna be frugal, I'm gonna save money,
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.140]   I'm gonna work hard,
[00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:00.100]   and I am not gonna put up with this shit
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:01.820]   for the rest of my life.
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:02.980]   And then as I got to college,
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.180]   at the College of William & Mary,
[00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:05.700]   it's in Williamsburg, Virginia.
[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:06.740]   It's the South.
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:09.760]   It's not the deep South, but it's the South.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.800]   I remember having a midnight snack at Denny's
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.000]   with my girlfriend.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.680]   She's half Asian, half Caucasian.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.100]   And then all of a sudden,
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.880]   four massive football offensive linemen
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.920]   sat in the booth right next to us.
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.200]   And then we looked over, we just glanced over, right?
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.240]   And then they looked over and they said,
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.280]   "Get the fuck out of here, you chinks.
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.840]   "Get the fuck out of here, you chinks,
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.280]   "or else we'll beat the fuck out of you."
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.740]   And man, I was so pissed,
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:38.340]   because you gotta imagine,
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.660]   I'm here with my girlfriend,
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:43.780]   these guys are making me look like a fool,
[00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:46.060]   and I wanna defend my honor and her honor,
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:47.380]   but there's four on one.
[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.420]   And so we paid our bill.
[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:51.740]   And we were about to leave anyway,
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:55.460]   but still, this enraged me so much.
[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.780]   And it's just sticking with me to this day.
[00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.580]   And if there was just one guy there,
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.620]   I didn't care if he was 100 pounds bigger,
[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.120]   I would have gone to war.
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.260]   But when there's four huge guys,
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.580]   who are basically outweighing you six acts,
[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:11.060]   'cause you're just massive,
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.220]   you gotta pick and choose and live to fight another day.
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.700]   And this is a key lesson for many of you,
[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.820]   all of you who are experiencing racism, discrimination,
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:22.040]   some type of antagonist,
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.680]   you've gotta be strategic nowadays.
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.460]   If you're an adult, you've got assets,
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:28.840]   you've got kids to care for and stuff.
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:32.720]   Be strategic in the fights you choose to participate in,
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.340]   because a lot more is at stake now.
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.340]   Back in college, when that incident happened,
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.420]   I thought to myself,
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:41.480]   okay, I can go to war with these guys.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.100]   Maybe the manager will break us up.
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.520]   Maybe I'll get some fists of fury in
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.780]   before I get beat into a pulp.
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:51.100]   But at least I will have defended my honor.
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.380]   But I thought in that instant,
[00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:56.100]   okay, I think I was a junior in college.
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.420]   I'm applying for jobs.
[00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.900]   I don't wanna get in trouble again,
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.380]   because I already got in trouble in high school.
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.380]   If I got in trouble again in college,
[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:07.480]   clearly this was not good and it would ruin my future.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.620]   So I decided strategically,
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:11.980]   all right, you guys win the battle today.
[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.000]   I'm gonna swallow my pride,
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.720]   and I don't want anybody to get hurt,
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.260]   most of all my girlfriend,
[00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:19.180]   but I'm gonna win the war.
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:22.200]   And I'm gonna win the war by using these experiences
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.940]   to motivate me to work hard, to save aggressively,
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.640]   to find a path to financial independence,
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.780]   so I don't have to deal with this type of bullshit anymore.
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.440]   Or at least I don't have to deal as much
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.720]   with this type of bullshit.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.100]   Because if you think about it,
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.980]   a lot of your stresses is due to other people.
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.460]   Well, other people just hate you, they're jealous,
[00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:44.220]   they just wanna put you down, whatever it is.
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.120]   If you have enough money,
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.100]   so you don't have to deal with other people,
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:49.680]   or you can pick and choose exactly
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.700]   who you wanna deal with, life is much better.
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.020]   So for the minorities out there listening
[00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:56.660]   and reading Financial Samurai,
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:00.080]   who are pissed off at what's going on in America,
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.700]   use racism, use discrimination as motivation
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.560]   for you to work hard, take calculated risks,
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:10.240]   save, invest, more than you ever thought you could
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.600]   for your future.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.380]   Unfortunately, and realistically,
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.640]   bad things are gonna happen all the time.
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.800]   And there is gonna be someone out there
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:21.160]   who just doesn't like you for whatever reason.
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.960]   You need to fortify your finances
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.000]   so you can fortify your independence,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.760]   and you gotta figure out how to love yourself
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.580]   and love others by educating yourself.
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.560]   The more you can learn about someone else
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.500]   in some other culture, the less you'll be able to hate them.
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.060]   And the more you can learn to love yourself,
[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:43.100]   the less you'll find a need or desire to hate other people.
[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.660]   You just don't have time for that hate,
[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.780]   you just don't have room for the hate,
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:48.780]   because you're happy with yourself.
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:52.620]   Every single antagonist that I've met online and offline
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:56.100]   has some type of issue, whether it's a personal issue
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.540]   or a financial issue they're dealing with,
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:01.980]   that propels them to take it out on you.
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:05.100]   And because Financial Samurai is a relatively large site,
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.860]   based on the law of numbers,
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.620]   you know, even 1% of a million people who hate your guts,
[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.740]   that's a lot of people.
[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.940]   But when I get to know them,
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:17.020]   I better understand where they're coming from
[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.480]   and where their hatred is coming from.
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.620]   And I would say, almost all of the time,
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.100]   when they get to dig deeper into my work
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.740]   and understand where I'm coming from,
[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.340]   that hatred goes away.
[00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:30.740]   A lot of people find Financial Samurai from a search engine,
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.980]   and they visit once or maybe twice, read a couple articles,
[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:35.540]   and then they never come back.
[00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.740]   So they only get one small glimpse
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.820]   of my thoughts on some topic.
[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.620]   But if you stick around for long enough,
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:43.380]   I think you'll get to understand
[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.500]   the overall principles of Financial Samurai.
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.020]   And I think you'll be able to see
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.980]   other sides of the equation, you know,
[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.700]   different sides, different viewpoints
[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.500]   make for better thought and better people.
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.640]   I wanna end this podcast by saying that
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.220]   if you've ever been discriminated against
[00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:02.300]   based on your race, your sex, age, religion,
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.420]   or whatever it is, just know that you're not alone.
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:09.260]   Plenty of people get slapped around every single day,
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:11.900]   but plenty of people don't rise up and fight.
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.660]   You can either take the insults lying down,
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.540]   or you can get up and get motivated
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:20.100]   to work harder and smarter than you've ever worked before.
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.820]   And when you have the right opportunity,
[00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:26.060]   you should fight back, and you should voice your opinion.
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:27.540]   You need to be heard,
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:31.080]   and you need to confront the injustices out there.
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.240]   Confront these people, talk to them,
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.260]   tell them how their actions make you feel,
[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.700]   and how it negatively affects other people.
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.780]   You must confront them, hopefully in a peaceful way,
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.380]   not like what I did when I was growing up as a kid,
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.980]   but in a peaceful, logical, thoughtful way.
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:52.180]   I have found that if you confront your antagonists
[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:54.740]   in a peaceful and thoughtful way, in a rational way,
[00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:57.060]   give them an opportunity to explain themselves,
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:58.540]   tell them how you feel,
[00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.860]   and how what they're doing is making you feel,
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:03.160]   or how it's negatively affecting other people.
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:07.320]   I have found that more often than not, they will listen,
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.020]   and I think they will come to an agreement
[00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:13.240]   and acknowledge what they're doing is wrong,
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.460]   or at least acknowledge what they're doing
[00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.340]   is making you feel terrible.
[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:20.580]   Too many people don't confront their antagonists.
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:23.460]   They're too afraid, they don't wanna rock the boat,
[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:26.180]   but you should confront them, you should talk about it.
[00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:28.620]   It's important to have these difficult conversations,
[00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:30.220]   otherwise nothing changes.
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.980]   What happens is just people bottle up
[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:35.100]   all their anger inside, and then one day they explode,
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.940]   and they pop off, and they do something really, really bad.
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:40.540]   So try to let out the steam slowly
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.700]   by confronting the issues when they bother you,
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.560]   by having an honest conversation, a respectful conversation,
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.080]   and I think this will help your antagonist too,
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.640]   the person with these hateful feelings,
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:55.840]   learn why he or she is hating on that way,
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.920]   or doing something bad in that way.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:01.560]   Don't let them just keep on doing what they're doing,
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.480]   and don't let that rage inside you bottle up and explode.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.320]   For those of you with racist tendencies,
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:10.000]   I want you to think about some of these final points
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.700]   that I wanna address in a personal finance
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.800]   and a society context.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:18.260]   One, when you assume everyone can happily relocate
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.680]   to a lower cost area of the country,
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.480]   that is an incorrect assumption
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.580]   because not everybody can comfortably fit in.
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:29.360]   Two, when you assume that everyone has an equal opportunity
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.720]   to get good grades and high college test scores,
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.480]   that is an incorrect assumption
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.400]   because not everybody has the financial means
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.040]   to pay for tutors, and not everyone has
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:42.320]   a stay-at-home parent or two loving parents.
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.360]   Three, when you assume that everyone has
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:47.080]   the equal opportunity to get ahead in the workplace
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.060]   when there are very few senior people who look like you,
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.420]   that is an incorrect assumption.
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.200]   People who are already in power
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.360]   tend to take care of people who look, talk, act,
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.880]   and have the same background as them.
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:03.160]   Four, when you assume someone has special talents,
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.840]   intelligence, or skills based on their race,
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.560]   that is a lazy assumption.
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.440]   Everybody is unique.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.520]   Five, when all your friends look the same,
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.280]   talk the same, support the same people,
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:18.640]   interview the same people, believe in the same thing,
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.840]   it's really hard to grow as a person.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.880]   Go out there and learn a new language.
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.500]   When the economy opens up and the restrictions are done,
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.320]   go travel, make different types of friends
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.560]   from different racial backgrounds
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.960]   and different socioeconomic backgrounds.
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.880]   Spend some time listening to their stories,
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.320]   really listen and try to see how they differ
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.480]   from your background and your beliefs
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:45.040]   and see if you can share your background and your beliefs
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.960]   in a thoughtful and respectful manner.
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.400]   Finally, let's not paint an entire group of people
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.480]   based on the actions of a few.
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.440]   I know this is how stereotypes are created,
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.000]   but this is mental laziness.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.680]   We need to be vigilant against mental laziness.
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:04.320]   Just don't assume that everyone is just like this.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.720]   Everyone is different and unique.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.520]   We need to spend the time to learn, to understand,
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.720]   to listen and to share our thoughts and perspectives.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.880]   Thank you for letting me address this important issue
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.600]   in society today.
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.760]   It has affected me my entire life
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.840]   and I know it's gonna affect my children,
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.480]   their entire lives.
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:26.040]   I've been living in this bubble, frankly, since 2001.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:30.320]   I've lived in San Francisco where minorities are a majority.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.560]   Minorities make up 60 plus percent
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.120]   of the San Francisco population.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.960]   And I haven't felt racism in quite a long time,
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.360]   at least overtly that I'm aware of.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.200]   And one of the reasons why we're happy to go to Hawaii
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.480]   to live out our remaining days
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:48.120]   is because Hawaii is a minority majority state.
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.840]   However, I realize not everybody can live
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.160]   in a minority majority city or state
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.360]   and not everybody wants to, that's fine.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.600]   There are plenty of awesome cities and states
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.600]   all across America and I respect that.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.760]   And I also love a lot of these states, including Virginia,
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.560]   where I grew up for high school and college for eight years
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.080]   and where I experienced a lot of racism.
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.160]   I don't think we're born racist.
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:14.680]   We're just taught racist thoughts and actions.
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:19.680]   And I think the more we can share and embrace and love,
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.560]   I think we're gonna make things better.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.480]   So thanks so much for listening to this episode.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:28.120]   And if you found it valuable, please share it
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.880]   and I'll see everyone around and fight on.
