[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800]   The following is a conversation with Stephen Wolfram,
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.080]   his second time on the podcast.
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.200]   He's a computer scientist, mathematician,
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.660]   theoretical physicist, and the founder and CEO
[00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.400]   of Wolfram Research, a company behind Mathematica,
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.680]   Wolfram Alpha, Wolfram Language,
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.240]   and the new Wolfram Physics Project.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.240]   He's the author of several books,
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.400]   including A New Kind of Science,
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.880]   and the new book, A Project to Find
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.280]   the Fundamental Theory of Physics.
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.000]   This second round of our conversation
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.400]   is primarily focused on this latter endeavor
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.920]   of searching for the physics of our universe
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.520]   in simple rules that do their work on hypergraphs,
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.920]   and eventually generate the infrastructure
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.400]   from which space, time, and all of modern physics can emerge.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.200]   Quick summary of the sponsors.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.240]   SimplySafe, SunBasket, and Masterclass.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.860]   Please check out these sponsors in the description
[00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.960]   to get a discount and to support this podcast.
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.680]   As a side note, let me say that to me,
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.040]   the idea that seemingly infinite complexity can arise
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.080]   from very simple rules and initial conditions
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.720]   is one of the most beautiful and important
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.460]   mathematical and philosophical mysteries in science.
[00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.400]   I find that both cellular automata
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.920]   and the hypergraph data structure
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.360]   that Stephen and team are currently working on
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.080]   to be the kind of simple, clear mathematical playground
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.560]   within which fundamental ideas about intelligence,
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.400]   consciousness, and the fundamental laws of physics
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.680]   can be further developed in totally new ways.
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.320]   In fact, I think I'll try to make a video or two
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.500]   about the most beautiful aspects of these models
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.800]   in the coming weeks.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.240]   Especially, I think, trying to describe
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.320]   how fellow curious minds like myself
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.440]   can jump in and explore them, either just for fun,
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.700]   or potentially for publication of new, innovative research
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.080]   in math, computer science, and physics.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.320]   But honestly, I think the emerging complexity
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.960]   in these hypergraphs can capture the imagination of everyone,
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.300]   even if you're someone who never really connected
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.020]   with mathematics.
[00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.760]   That's my hope, at least, to have these conversations
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.840]   that inspire everyone to look up to the skies
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.840]   and into our own minds in awe of our amazing universe.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.820]   Let me also mention that this is the first time
[00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.360]   I ever recorded a podcast outdoors,
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.520]   as a kind of experiment to see if this is an option
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.360]   in times of COVID.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.840]   I'm sorry if the audio is not great.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.560]   I did my best, and promise to keep improving
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.640]   and learning, as always.

[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.960]   As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now,
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.900]   and no ads in the middle.
[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.440]   I tried to make these interesting,
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.240]   but I do give you timestamps, so you're welcome to skip.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.360]   But still, please do check out the sponsors

[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.560]   It's the best way to support this podcast.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.800]   Also, let me say, even though I'm talking way too much,
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.580]   that I did a survey, and it seems like over 90% of people
[00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.860]   either enjoy these ad reads somehow magically,
[00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.800]   or don't mind them, at least.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.320]   That honestly just warms my heart
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.180]   that people are that supportive.
[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.600]   This show is sponsored by SimpliSafe,
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.280]   a home security company.

[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.120]   It's simple, no contracts, 15 bucks a month, easy setup.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.600]   Even I figured it out.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.600]   I have it set up in my apartment.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.280]   Of course, I also welcome intruders.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.300]   One of my favorite movies is "Leon," or "The Professional,"
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.580]   with Jean Renaud, Gary Oldman,
[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.380]   and the brilliant young Natalie Portman.
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.280]   If you haven't seen the movie,
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.880]   he's a hit man with a minimalist life
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.800]   that resembles my own.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.600]   In fact, when I was younger, the idea of being a hit man
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.440]   or targeting evil in a skilled way,
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.640]   which is how I thought about it, really appealed to me.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.860]   The skill of it, the planning, the craftsmanship.
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.680]   In another life, perhaps, if I didn't love engineering
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.040]   and science so much, I could see myself being
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.740]   something like a Navy SEAL.
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.080]   And in general, I love the idea of serving my country,
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.720]   of serving society, by contributing my skill
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.520]   in some small way.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.240]   Anyway, go to simplysafe.com/lex

[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.280]   They're a new sponsor, and this is a trial run,
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.960]   so you know what to do.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.600]   This show is also sponsored by Sun Basket,
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.200]   a meal delivery service.

[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.100]   This is the last read of the trial they're doing,
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.220]   so this is the time to get them if you're considering it.
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.080]   And if you do, it'll help ensure that they decide
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.780]   to support this podcast long-term.
[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.360]   Their meals are healthy and delicious,
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.920]   a nice break from the minimalist meals of meat
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.600]   and vegetables that I usually eat.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.920]   Maybe on a personal note, one of my favorite things to do
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.760]   is watch people cook, especially people who love cooking,
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.040]   and hang out with people over amazing meals.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.600]   I still tend to be strict in my diet, no matter what,
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.400]   even in fancy restaurants, but it brings me joy
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.380]   to see friends and family indulge something like a cake
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.600]   that has way too many calories or ice cream or whatever.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.880]   My mom, in fact, for much of my life,
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.720]   made this cake called an ant hill on my birthday
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.460]   that brings me a lot of joy and way too many calories.
[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.420]   I was thinking of doing a video with my mom as she makes it.
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.460]   I thought it'd be a fun thing to do together.
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.980]   Anyway, go to sunbasket.com/lex and use code LEX.
[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.860]   Do it now so they sign a long-term contract
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.140]   for this podcast.
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.640]   This show is also sponsored by Masterclass.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.300]   Sign up at masterclass.com/lex.
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.140]   180 bucks a year, you get an all-access pass
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.620]   to watch lessons from Chris Hadfield, Neil deGrasse Tyson,
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.020]   Tony Hawk, Carlos Santana, Garrett Kasparov,
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.180]   Daniel Negrano, and many more brilliant world experts.
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.220]   Masterclass has been a really special sponsor.
[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.260]   They believe in this podcast in a way that gives me strength
[00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.340]   and motivation to take intellectual risks.
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.860]   I'm thinking of doing a few solo podcast episodes
[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.220]   on difficult topics, especially in history,
[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.380]   like the rise and fall of the Third Reich,
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.980]   or Stalin, Putin, and many other difficult topics
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.500]   that I'm fascinated by.
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.100]   I have a worldview that seeks inspiring positive insights,
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.100]   even and perhaps especially from periods of tragedy
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.740]   and evil that perhaps some folks may find value in.
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.580]   If I can only learn to convey the ideas in my mind
[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.740]   as clearly as I think them.
[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.460]   I think deeply and rigorously and precisely,
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.460]   but to be honest, I have trouble speaking in a way
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.740]   that reflects that rigor of thought.
[00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.100]   So it really does mean a lot, the love and support I get
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.980]   as I try to get better at this thing,
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.820]   at this talking thing.
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.320]   Anyway, go to masterclass.com/lex to get a discount
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.340]   and to support this podcast.
[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.180]   And now, finally, here's my conversation
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.740]   with Stephen Wolfram.
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.380]   You said that there are moments in history of physics,
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.140]   and maybe mathematical physics or even mathematics,
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.420]   where breakthroughs happen
[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.740]   and then a flurry of progress follows.
[00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.280]   So if you look back through the history of physics,
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.140]   what moments stand out to you as important
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.500]   such breakthroughs where a flurry of progress follows?
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.820]   - So the big famous one was 1920s,
[00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.900]   the invention of quantum mechanics,
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.900]   where in about five or 10 years,
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.700]   lots of stuff got figured out.
[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.980]   That's now quantum mechanics.
[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.580]   - Can you mention the people involved?
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.580]   - Yeah, it was kind of the Schrodinger, Heisenberg,
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.420]   Einstein had been a key figure,
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:56.520]   originally Planck, then Dirac was a little bit later.
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.140]   That was something that happened at that time,
[00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.420]   that's sort of before my time, right?
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.980]   In my time was in the 1970s,
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.260]   there was this sort of realization
[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.060]   that quantum field theory was actually going to be useful
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:13.000]   in physics and QCD, quantum carbon dynamics theory
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.060]   of quarks and gluons and so on was really getting started.
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.900]   And there was again,
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.340]   sort of big flurry of things happened then.
[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.380]   I happened to be a teenager at that time
[00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:26.500]   and happened to be really involved in physics.
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.700]   And so I got to be part of that, which was really cool.
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.060]   - Who were the key figures
[00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.860]   aside from your young selves at that time?
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.020]   - You know, who won the Nobel prize for QCD, okay?
[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:41.420]   People, David Gross, Frank Wilczek, David Politzer,
[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.980]   the people who are the sort of the slightly older generation,
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.080]   Dick Feynman, Murray Gell-Mann, people like that,
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:51.700]   who were Steve Weinberg, Gerhard Hoft,
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.780]   he's younger, he's in the younger group actually,
[00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:59.220]   but these are all characters who were involved.
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.500]   I mean, it's funny because those are all people
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.020]   who are kind of in my time and I know them
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.940]   and they don't seem like sort of
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.140]   these historical, iconic figures.
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.740]   They seem more like everyday characters, so to speak.
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:18.060]   So it's always, when you look at history
[00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.380]   from long afterwards,
[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.120]   it always seems like everything happened instantly.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.680]   And that's usually not the case.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.380]   There was usually a long buildup,
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.900]   but usually there's some methodological thing happens
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.540]   and then there's a whole bunch of low-hanging fruit
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:36.700]   to be picked and that usually lasts five or 10 years.
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.700]   We see it today with machine learning
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:43.200]   and deep learning neural nets and so on,
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.780]   methodological advance, things actually started working
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.380]   in 2011, 2012 and so on.
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:52.060]   And there's been this sort of rapid picking
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.820]   of low-hanging fruit, which is probably
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:10:00.060]   some significant fraction of the way done, so to speak.
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.580]   - Do you think there's a key moment?
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.100]   Like if I had to really introspect,
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.700]   like what was the key moment for the deep learning
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.020]   quote unquote revolution?
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:08.940]   I mean-- - It's probably
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.460]   the AlexNet business. - AlexNet with ImageNet.
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.440]   So is there something like that with physics where,
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.540]   so deep learning neural networks have been around
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.860]   for a long time.
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.980]   - Absolutely, since the 1940s, yeah.
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.900]   - There's a bunch of little pieces that came together
[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:27.440]   and then all of a sudden everybody's eyes lit up.
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.780]   Like, wow, there's something here.
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.460]   Like even just looking at your own work,
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.300]   just your thinking about the universe,
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:38.860]   that there's simple rules can create complexity.
[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:45.060]   At which point was there a thing where your eyes light up?
[00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.500]   It's like, wait a minute, there's something here.
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:51.500]   Is it the very first idea or is it some moment
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.060]   along the line of implementations and experiments
[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.340]   and so on? - Yeah, there's a couple
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:56.340]   of different stages to this.
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:01.060]   One is the think about the world computationally.
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.900]   Can we use programs instead of equations
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.900]   to make models of the world?
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.740]   That's something that I got interested in
[00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.380]   in the beginning of the 1980s.
[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.020]   I did a bunch of computer experiments.
[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.820]   When I first did them, I didn't really,
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.500]   I could see some significance to them,
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.980]   but it took me a few years to really say,
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.900]   wow, there's a big important phenomenon here
[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.380]   that lets sort of complex things arise
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.340]   from very simple programs.
[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:30.540]   That kind of happened back in 1984 or so.
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.980]   Then a bunch of other years go by,
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.500]   then I start actually doing a lot
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.700]   of much more systematic computer experiments and things
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.900]   and find out that this phenomenon
[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:43.020]   that I could only have said occurs in one particular case
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.100]   is actually something incredibly general.
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.380]   And then that led me to this thing
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.660]   called principle of computational equivalence.
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.100]   And that was a long story.
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.420]   And then as part of that process, I was like,
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.860]   okay, you can make simple programs,
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.220]   can make models of complicated things.
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.700]   What about the whole universe?
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.740]   That's our sort of ultimate example of a complicated thing.
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.100]   And so I got to thinking,
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:09.540]   could we use these ideas to study fundamental physics?
[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.420]   I happen to know a lot
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.940]   about traditional fundamental physics.
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:17.300]   My first, I had a bunch of ideas
[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.380]   about how to do this in the early 1990s.
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.060]   I made a bunch of technical progress.
[00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.140]   I figured out a bunch of things
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.220]   I thought were pretty interesting.
[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:26.620]   I wrote about them back in 2002.
[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:27.820]   - With the new kind of science
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.220]   in the cellular automata world.
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.060]   - Right.
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.220]   - There's echoes in the cellular automata world
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:36.700]   with your new Wolfram physics project.
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:37.660]   We'll get to all that.
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.300]   Allow me to sort of romanticize a little more
[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.980]   on the philosophy of science.
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:45.620]   So Thomas Kuhn, a philosopher of science,
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:49.460]   describes that the progress in science
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.180]   is made with these paradigm shifts.
[00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:56.940]   And so to linger on the sort of original line of discussion,
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.140]   do you agree with this view
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.540]   that there is revolutions in science
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.420]   that just kind of flip the table?
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.900]   - What happens is it's a different way
[00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.020]   of thinking about things.
[00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.940]   It's a different methodology for studying things.
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.740]   And that opens stuff up.
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.220]   - There's this idea of,
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.820]   he's a famous biographer,
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:19.620]   but I think it's called the Innovators.
[00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.660]   The biographer of Steve Jobs, of Albert Einstein.
[00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:23.620]   He also wrote a book,
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:24.780]   I think it's called The Innovators,
[00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:29.780]   where he discusses how a lot of the innovations
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:33.860]   in the history of computing has been done by groups.
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.380]   There's a complicated group dynamic going on.
[00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.340]   But there's also a romanticized notion
[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.780]   that the individual is at the core of the revolution.
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.300]   Like where does your sense fall?
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:49.940]   Is ultimately like one person responsible
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.700]   for these revolutions that creates the spark?
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.620]   Or one or two, whatever.
[00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:58.820]   Or is it just the big mush and mess and chaos
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.380]   of people interacting, of personalities interacting?
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.180]   - I think it ends up being like many things,
[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.420]   there's leadership and there ends up being,
[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.100]   it's a lot easier for one person to have a crisp new idea
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.900]   than it is for a big committee to have a crisp new idea.
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.740]   And I think, but I think it can happen
[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.500]   that you have a great idea,
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.300]   but the world isn't ready for it.
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:24.180]   And you can, I mean, this has happened to me plenty, right?
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:27.220]   You have an idea, it's actually a pretty good idea,
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.300]   but things aren't ready.
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.700]   Either you're not really ready for it,
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:34.540]   or the ambient world isn't ready for it.
[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:37.900]   And it's hard to get the thing to get traction.
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:38.740]   - It's kind of interesting.
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:41.740]   I mean, when I look at a new kind of science,
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.660]   you're now living inside the history,
[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.700]   so you can't tell the story of these decades.
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.660]   But it seems like the new kind of science
[00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:54.660]   has not had the revolutionary impact
[00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:59.140]   I would think it might.
[00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:02.620]   Like, it feels like at some point, of course it might be,
[00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:06.260]   but it feels at some point people will return to that book
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.580]   and say there was something special here.
[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:10.420]   This was incredible.
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:11.860]   - Well, look, what happened--
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.580]   - Or do you think that's already happened?
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.020]   - Oh yeah, it's happened, except that people aren't,
[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:19.500]   you know, the sort of the heroism of it may not be there.
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.780]   But what's happened is for 300 years,
[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.540]   people basically said,
[00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.060]   if you want to make a model of things in the world,
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.780]   mathematical equations are the best place to go.
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.220]   Last 15 years, doesn't happen.
[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.620]   You know, new models that get made of things
[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.620]   most often are made with programs, not with equations.
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.300]   Now, you know, was that sort of going to happen anyway?
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.620]   Was that a consequence of, you know,
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:47.260]   my particular work and my particular book?
[00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.820]   It's hard to know for sure.
[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.580]   I mean, I am always amazed at the amounts of feedback
[00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:52.980]   that I get from people where they say,
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:54.340]   oh, by the way, you know,
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.100]   I started doing this whole line of research
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.580]   because I read your book, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:59.940]   It's like, well, can you tell that
[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.060]   from the academic literature?
[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.100]   You know, was there a chain of, you know,
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.540]   academic references?
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:05.860]   Probably not.
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:09.100]   - One of the interesting side effects of publishing
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.980]   in the way you did this tome
[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:15.340]   is it serves as an education tool and an inspiration
[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:19.260]   to hundreds of thousands, millions of people,
[00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.700]   but because it's not a single,
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:25.220]   it's not a chain of papers with 50 titles,
[00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.780]   it doesn't create a splash of citations.
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.620]   - It's had plenty of citations,
[00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.900]   but it's, you know, I think that the,
[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:36.900]   people think of it as probably more, you know,
[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:41.900]   conceptual inspiration than kind of a, you know,
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.860]   this is a line from here to here to here
[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.420]   in our particular field.
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:46.700]   I think that the, you know,
[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.500]   the thing which I am disappointed by
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.420]   and which will eventually happen
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.900]   is this kind of study of the,
[00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.820]   this sort of pure computationalism,
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.580]   this kind of study of the abstract behavior
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.500]   of the computational universe.
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.980]   That should be a big thing that lots of people do.
[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.340]   - You mean in mathematics purely, almost like-
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:08.860]   - It's like pure mathematics, but it isn't mathematics.
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:09.700]   - But it isn't.
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.340]   - It's a new kind of mathematics.
[00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:14.380]   Is it a title of a book?
[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:15.220]   - Yeah, right.
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:16.060]   - Good title.
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:17.900]   - That's why the book is called that, right?
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.180]   That's not coincidental.
[00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.180]   - Yeah.
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.860]   It's interesting that I haven't seen
[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:24.980]   really rigorous investigation
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.900]   by thousands of people of this idea.
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.100]   I mean, you look at your competition around rule 30.
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.340]   I mean, that's fascinating.
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.540]   If you can say something,
[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:38.820]   is there some aspect of this thing that could be predicted?
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.940]   That's the fundamental question of science.
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:41.780]   That's the core.
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:42.860]   - Well, that has been a question of science.
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:47.460]   I think that is some people's view of what science is about,
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.940]   and it's not clear that's the right view.
[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.500]   In fact, as we live through this pandemic
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.300]   full of predictions and so on,
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.340]   it's an interesting moment to be pondering
[00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.420]   what science's actual role in those kinds of things is.
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:02.060]   - Oh, you think it's possible that in science,
[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.900]   clean, beautiful, simple prediction
[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.220]   may not even be possible in real systems.
[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.260]   That's the open question.
[00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:09.540]   - Right, I don't think it's open.
[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.180]   I think that question is answered, and the answer is no.
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:13.100]   - Well, no, no.
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.700]   The answer could be just humans are not smart enough yet.
[00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:17.540]   We don't have the tools yet.
[00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:18.660]   - No, no, that's the whole point.
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.660]   I mean, that's sort of the big discovery
[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:23.300]   of this principle of computational equivalence of mind.
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.820]   And this is something which is kind of a follow-on
[00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:30.180]   to Godel's theorem, to Turing's work on the halting problem,
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.620]   all these kinds of things,
[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.660]   that there is this fundamental limitation
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.300]   built into science,
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.060]   this idea of computational irreducibility,
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:42.420]   that says that even though you may know the rules
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.100]   by which something operates,
[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.100]   that does not mean that you can readily
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.700]   sort of be smarter than it and jump ahead
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.580]   and figure out what it's going to do.
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.700]   - Yes, but do you think there's a hope
[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.700]   for pockets of computational reducibility?
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:02.060]   - Yes, yes.
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:04.780]   - So, and then a set of tools and mathematics
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:07.020]   that help you discover such pockets.
[00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:10.140]   - That's where we live, is in the pockets of reducibility.
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.500]   That's why, and this is one of the things
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.020]   that sort of come out of this physics project
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.460]   and actually something that, again,
[00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.900]   I should have realized many years ago, but didn't,
[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:23.380]   it could very well be that everything about the world
[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:26.540]   is computationally irreducible and completely unpredictable.
[00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.700]   But in our experience of the world,
[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.500]   there is at least some amount of prediction we can make.
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:36.540]   And that's because we have sort of chosen a slice of,
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.300]   probably talk about this in much more detail,
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.900]   but I mean, we've kind of chosen a slice
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.740]   of how to think about the universe
[00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.500]   in which we can kind of sample a certain amount
[00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.620]   of computational reducibility.
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:51.620]   And that's sort of where we exist.
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:55.900]   And it may not be the whole story of how the universe is,
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:59.220]   but it is the part of the universe that we care about
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:00.980]   and we sort of operate in.
[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.580]   And that's, in science,
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:05.700]   that's been sort of a very special case of that.
[00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:09.340]   That is science has chosen to talk a lot about places
[00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:12.100]   where there is this computational reducibility
[00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.740]   that it can find, the motion of the planets
[00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:16.260]   can be more or less predicted.
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:20.660]   Something about the weather is much harder to predict.
[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:22.820]   Something about other kinds of things
[00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:25.180]   are much harder to predict.
[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:29.380]   And it's, these are, but science has tended to
[00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.500]   concentrate itself on places where its methods
[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.100]   have allowed successful prediction.
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:38.220]   - So you think rule 30, if we could linger on it,
[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:41.580]   because it's just such a beautiful, simple formulation
[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.500]   of the essential concept underlying
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.020]   all the things we're talking about.
[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.260]   Do you think there's pockets of reducibility
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.500]   inside rule 30?
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.380]   - Yes.
[00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.620]   That is the question of how big are they?
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:53.140]   What will they allow you to say?
[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:53.980]   And so on.
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.980]   And that's, and figuring out where those pockets are,
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:58.740]   I mean, in a sense, that's the,
[00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.900]   that's sort of a, you know,
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.260]   that is an essential thing that one
[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.820]   would like to do in science.
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.820]   But it's also, the important thing to realize
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:13.820]   that has not been, you know, is that science,
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:15.420]   if you just pick an arbitrary thing,
[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.140]   you say, what's the answer to this question?
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.220]   That question may not be one
[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.900]   that has a computationally reducible answer.
[00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:26.220]   That question, if you choose, you know,
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:28.860]   if you walk along the series of questions
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:30.260]   and you've got one that's reducible
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.660]   and you get to another one that's nearby
[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:32.980]   and it's reducible too,
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.020]   if you stick to that kind of,
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.220]   stick to the land, so to speak,
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:39.620]   then you can go down this chain
[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:41.940]   of sort of reducible, answerable things.
[00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:42.980]   But if you just say,
[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:44.460]   I'm just pick a question at random,
[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.980]   I'm going to have my computer pick a question at random.
[00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:49.260]   - Yeah, most likely it's going to be reducible.
[00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:50.940]   - Most likely it will be irreducible.
[00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:54.700]   And what we're throwing in the world, so to speak,
[00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.420]   we, you know, when we engineer things,
[00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.300]   we tend to engineer things to sort of keep
[00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.260]   in the zone of reducibility.
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.260]   When we're throwing things by the natural world,
[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.500]   for example, not at all certain
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:08.660]   that we will be kept in this kind of zone of reducibility.
[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.260]   - Can we talk about this pandemic then?
[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:12.100]   - Sure.
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:12.940]   (laughing)
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:13.780]   - For a second.
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.980]   Is this, so how do we,
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.900]   there's obviously huge amount of economic pain
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:19.780]   that people are feeling.
[00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:23.940]   There's a huge incentive and medical pain,
[00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.740]   health, just all kinds of psychological.
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.740]   There's a huge incentive to figure this out,
[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:33.300]   to walk along the trajectory of reducibility.
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:38.060]   There's a lot of disparate data.
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.500]   You know, people understand generally how virus is spread,
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.220]   but it's very complicated
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:45.060]   because there's a lot of uncertainty.
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:49.340]   There could be a lot of variability,
[00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:51.740]   like so many, obviously,
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.620]   a nearly infinite number of variables
[00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:57.940]   that represent human interaction.
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:59.940]   And so you have to figure out,
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:02.700]   from the perspective of reducibility,
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:06.620]   figure out which variables are really important
[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:10.620]   in this kind of, from an epidemiological perspective.
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:13.140]   So why aren't we,
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.980]   you kind of said that we're clearly failing.
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.380]   - Well, I think it's a complicated thing.
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:20.220]   So, I mean, you know, when this pandemic started up,
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.860]   you know, I happened to be in the middle
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:24.780]   of being about to release this whole physics project thing.
[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:25.620]   But I thought, you know-
[00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:28.260]   - The timing is just cosmically absurd.
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:29.100]   - A little bit bizarre.
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.340]   But, you know, but I thought, you know,
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.980]   I should do the public service thing of, you know,
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:36.020]   trying to understand what I could about the pandemic.
[00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:38.140]   And, you know, we've been curating data about it
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.300]   and all that kind of thing.
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.660]   But, you know, so I started looking at the data
[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.620]   and started looking at modeling,
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:46.020]   and I decided it's just really hard.
[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.260]   You need to know a lot of stuff
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.860]   that we don't know about human interactions.
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:51.620]   It's actually clear now that there's a lot of stuff
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:53.500]   we didn't know about viruses
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.020]   and about the way immunity works and so on.
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:58.860]   And it's, you know, I think what will come out in the end
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:02.020]   is there's a certain amount of what happens
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.380]   that we just kind of have to trace each step
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:05.820]   and see what happens.
[00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:06.980]   There's a certain amount of stuff
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.340]   where there's gonna be a big narrative
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:12.260]   about this happened because, you know, of T cell immunity.
[00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:14.380]   This happened because there's this whole giant
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:18.700]   sort of field of asymptomatic viral stuff out there.
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.180]   You know, there will be a narrative,
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.380]   and that narrative, whenever there's a narrative,
[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:24.620]   that's kind of a sign of reducibility.
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.180]   But when you just say, "Let's from first principles
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.860]   figure out what's going on,"
[00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:30.860]   then you can potentially be stuck
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:33.700]   in this kind of mess of irreducibility
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.660]   where you just have to simulate each step,
[00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:37.820]   and you can't do that unless you know details
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:40.100]   about, you know, human interaction networks
[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.340]   and so on and so on and so on.
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:46.340]   The thing that has been very sort of frustrating to see
[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.900]   is the mismatch between people's expectations
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:50.740]   about what science can deliver
[00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.700]   and what science can actually deliver, so to speak,
[00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.780]   because people have this idea that, you know, it's science,
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:58.460]   so there must be a definite answer,
[00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:00.500]   and we must be able to know that answer.
[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:05.100]   And, you know, this is, it is both, you know,
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.580]   when you've, after you've played around
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:10.100]   with sort of little programs in the computational universe,
[00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:11.820]   you don't have that intuition anymore.
[00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:14.500]   You know, it's, I always, I'm always fond of saying,
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.020]   you know, the computational animals
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.260]   are always smarter than you are.
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.260]   That is, you know, you look at one of these things,
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.260]   and it's like, it can't possibly do such and such a thing.
[00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.260]   Then you run it, and it's like, wait a minute,
[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:26.180]   it's doing that thing.
[00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:27.500]   How does that work?
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.340]   Okay, now I can go back and understand it.
[00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:31.520]   - But that's the brave thing about science,
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:35.900]   is that in the chaos of the irreducible universe,
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.620]   we nevertheless persist to find those pockets.
[00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:40.260]   That's kind of the whole point.
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:43.060]   That's, like you say that the limits of science,
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:46.820]   but that, you know, yes, it's highly limited,
[00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:48.860]   but there's a hope there.
[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:52.020]   And like, there's so many questions I wanna ask here.
[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:54.220]   So one, you said narrative, which is really interesting.
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:58.100]   So obviously from a, at every level of society,
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.460]   you look at Twitter, everybody's constructing narratives
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.200]   about the pandemic, about not just the pandemic,
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.100]   but all the cultural tension that we're going through.
[00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:08.860]   So there's narratives, but they're not necessarily
[00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:13.860]   connected to the underlying reality of these systems.
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:18.300]   So our human narratives, I don't even know if they're,
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:22.500]   I don't like those pockets of reducibility,
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.900]   'cause we're, it's like constructing things
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.180]   that are not actually representative of reality,
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:33.660]   and thereby not giving us like good solutions
[00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:36.820]   to how to predict the system.
[00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.420]   - Look, it gets complicated because, you know,
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:41.220]   people want to say, explain the pandemic to me.
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.500]   Explain what's gonna happen.
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.620]   - In the future, like predict.
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.300]   - Yes, but also, can you explain it?
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:46.580]   Is there a story to tell?
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.580]   - What already happened in the past.
[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.700]   - Yeah, or what's going to happen, but I mean,
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:54.100]   it's similar to sort of explaining things in AI
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.420]   or in any computational system.
[00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:57.820]   It's like, you know, explain what happened.
[00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:59.860]   Well, it could just be this happened
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.100]   because of this detail and this detail and this detail
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:05.460]   and a million details, and there isn't a big story to tell.
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.900]   There's no kind of big arc of the story
[00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:08.740]   that's going to happen.
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:12.020]   There's no kind of big arc of the story that says,
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:14.500]   oh, it's because, you know, there's a viral field
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.700]   that has these properties and people start showing symptoms.
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.060]   You know, when the seasons change,
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:22.300]   people will show symptoms and people don't even understand,
[00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:24.700]   you know, seasonal variation of flu, for example.
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:28.500]   It's something where, you know,
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:29.980]   there could be a big story
[00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:33.860]   or it could be just a zillion little details that mount up.
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:38.260]   - See, but, okay, let's pretend that this pandemic,
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:41.100]   like the coronavirus, resembles something
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:45.860]   like the 1D Rule 30 cellular automata, okay?
[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:50.860]   So, I mean, that's how epidemiologists model virus spread.
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:52.740]   - Indeed, yes.
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:55.380]   They sometimes use cellular automata, yes.
[00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:57.300]   - And, okay, so you could say it's simplistic,
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:00.540]   but, okay, let's say it's representative
[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:02.340]   of actually what happens.
[00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:07.340]   You know, the dynamic of, you have a graph.
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.740]   It probably is closer to the hypergraph model.
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:10.580]   - It is, yes.
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:13.300]   It's actually, that's another funny thing.
[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:15.340]   As we were getting ready to release this physics project,
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.220]   we realized that a bunch of things we'd worked out
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:20.700]   about foliations of causal graphs and things
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:24.220]   were directly relevant to thinking about contact tracing
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:25.940]   and interactions with cell phones and so on,
[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:27.220]   which is really weird.
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:30.620]   - But, like, it just feels like we should be able
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.980]   to get some beautiful core insight
[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:36.740]   about the spread of this particular virus
[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:40.100]   on the hypergraph of human civilization, right?
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:40.940]   - I tried.
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:42.380]   I didn't manage to figure it out.
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:43.580]   - But you're one person.
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.380]   - Yeah, but, I mean, I think, actually,
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:48.420]   it's a funny thing 'cause it turns out the main model,
[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:51.340]   you know, this SIR model, I only realized recently,
[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:54.340]   was invented by the grandfather of a good friend of mine
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:56.740]   from high school, so that was just a,
[00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.860]   you know, it's a weird thing, right?
[00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:02.060]   The question is, you know, okay, so you know,
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:04.460]   you know, on this graph of how humans are connected,
[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:05.940]   you know something about what happens
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:07.580]   if this happens and that happens.
[00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:09.740]   That graph is made in complicated ways
[00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:12.060]   that depends on all sorts of issues that,
[00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:14.780]   where we don't have the data about how human society works
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:17.220]   well enough to be able to make that graph.
[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:20.580]   There's actually, one of my kids did a study
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:23.420]   of sort of what happens on different kinds of graphs
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:25.580]   and how robust are the results.
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:28.820]   Okay, his basic answer is there are few general results
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.820]   that you can get that are quite robust,
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.180]   like, you know, a small number of big gatherings
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:36.380]   is worse than a large number of small gatherings, okay?
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.660]   That's quite robust, but when you ask
[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:43.060]   more detailed questions, it seemed like it just depends.
[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:44.740]   It depends on details, in other words,
[00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.780]   it's kind of telling you, in that case, you know,
[00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:49.860]   the irreducibility matters, so to speak.
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:53.140]   It's not, there's not gonna be this kind of one
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.140]   sort of master theorem that says,
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:57.580]   and therefore this is how things are gonna work.
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:59.060]   - Yeah, but there's a certain kind of,
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:02.780]   from a graph perspective, the certain kind of dynamic
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:07.780]   to human interaction, so like large groups and small groups,
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:10.580]   I think it matters who the groups are.
[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:12.660]   For example, you could imagine,
[00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:13.780]   depends how you define large,
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:16.400]   but you can imagine groups of 30 people,
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:22.140]   as long as they are cliques or whatever,
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:27.620]   as long as the outgoing degree of that graph is small
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.340]   or something like that, like you can imagine
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.340]   some beautiful underlying rule
[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:34.620]   of human dynamic interaction where I can still be happy,
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:36.500]   where I can have a conversation with you
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.940]   and a bunch of other people that mean a lot to me
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:41.700]   in my life and then stay away from the bigger,
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.300]   I don't know, not going to a Miley Cyrus concert
[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:48.640]   or something like that, and figuring out mathematically
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.300]   some nice rule of behavior. - See, this is
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:52.380]   an interesting thing, so I mean,
[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.760]   this is the question of what you're describing
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:59.320]   is kind of the problem of the many situations
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.580]   where you would like to get away
[00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:01.980]   from computational irreducibility.
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:05.620]   A classic one in physics is thermodynamics.
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:06.820]   The second law of thermodynamics,
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.500]   the law that says entropy tends to increase,
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:13.220]   things that start orderly tend to get more disordered,
[00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:15.040]   or which is also the thing that says,
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.620]   given that you have a bunch of heat,
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:19.780]   it's hard, heat is the microscopic motion of molecules,
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:21.580]   it's hard to turn that heat
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.580]   into systematic mechanical work.
[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:26.260]   It's hard to just take something being hot
[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:29.820]   and turn that into, oh, all the atoms are gonna line up
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:31.500]   in the bar of metal and the piece of metal
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.620]   is gonna shoot in some direction.
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:35.780]   That's essentially the same problem
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:40.060]   as how do you go from this computationally irreducible
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:41.700]   mess of things happening
[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:43.580]   and get something you want out of it?
[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:45.740]   It's kind of mining, you're kind of,
[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:48.340]   now, actually, I've understood in recent years
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:50.900]   that the story of thermodynamics
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.540]   is actually precisely a story
[00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:54.380]   of computational irreducibility,
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:58.620]   but it is already an analogy. - It's interesting.
[00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:02.100]   You can kind of see that, is can you take the,
[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:03.580]   what you're asking to do there
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:07.820]   is you're asking to go from the kind of,
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:10.100]   the mess of all these complicated human interactions
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:12.380]   and all this kind of computational processes going on,
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:14.100]   and you say, I want to achieve
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.260]   this particular thing out of it.
[00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:16.900]   I want to kind of extract
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:18.700]   from the heat of what's happening,
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:22.180]   I want to kind of extract this useful piece
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:25.220]   of sort of mechanical work that I find helpful.
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:26.380]   I mean-- - Do you have a hope
[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:27.340]   for the pandemic?
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:28.620]   So we'll talk about physics,
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:31.340]   but for the pandemic, can that be extracted?
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:32.180]   Do you think? - Well, I think--
[00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:34.380]   - What's your intuition? - The good news is
[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:38.500]   the curves basically, for reasons we don't understand,
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:42.580]   the curves, the clearly measurable mortality curves
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:46.420]   and so on for the Northern Hemisphere have gone down.
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:49.140]   - Yeah, but the bad news is that
[00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:51.700]   it could be a lot worse for future viruses,
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:53.260]   and what this pandemic revealed
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.220]   is we're highly unprepared
[00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:59.860]   for the discovery of the pockets of reducibility
[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:02.580]   within a pandemic that's much more dangerous.
[00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:07.580]   - Well, my guess is the specific risk of viral pandemics,
[00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:12.800]   that the pure virology and immunology of the thing,
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.740]   this will cause that to advance to the point
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:17.420]   where this particular risk is probably
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:19.060]   considerably mitigated.
[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:24.060]   But it's, does, is the structure of modern society
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.980]   robust to all kinds of risks?
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:29.220]   Well, the answer is clearly no.
[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:34.140]   And it's surprising to me the extent to which people,
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:37.380]   as I say, it's kind of scary actually
[00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:39.380]   how much people believe in science.
[00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:42.780]   That is people say, oh, because the science says this,
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:44.340]   that and the other, we'll do this and this and this,
[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.780]   even though from a sort of common sense point of view,
[00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:48.500]   it's a little bit crazy.
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.460]   And people are not prepared,
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:53.020]   and it doesn't really work in society as it is
[00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:54.420]   for people to say, well, actually,
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.580]   we don't really know how the science works.
[00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:58.620]   People say, well, tell us what to do.
[00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:01.620]   - Yeah, because then, yeah, what's the alternative?
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:05.020]   For the masses, it's difficult to sit,
[00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:08.600]   it's difficult to meditate on computational reducibility.
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.300]   It's difficult to sit,
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.140]   it's difficult to enjoy a good dinner meal
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:15.740]   while knowing that you know nothing about the world.
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:17.860]   - Well, I think this is a place where,
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:21.220]   this is what politicians and political leaders do
[00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:22.140]   for a living, so to speak,
[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:24.940]   is you gotta make some decision about what to do.
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:25.900]   And it's--
[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:26.980]   - Tell some narrative.
[00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:28.260]   - Right.
[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:30.980]   - While amidst the mystery and knowing not much
[00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:33.820]   about the past or the future,
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:37.300]   still telling a narrative that somehow gives people hope
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.060]   that we know what the heck we're doing.
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:41.900]   - Yeah, and get society through the issue.
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.820]   Even though the idea that we're just gonna
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:48.660]   be able to get the definitive answer from science,
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:50.660]   and it's gonna tell us exactly what to do,
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:54.380]   unfortunately, it's interesting,
[00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:56.900]   because let me point out that if that was possible,
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:59.240]   if science could always tell us what to do,
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:03.980]   then in a sense, that would be a big downer for our lives.
[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:05.100]   If science could always tell us
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:06.820]   what the answer was gonna be,
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:10.180]   it's like, well, it's kind of fun to live one's life
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:11.760]   and just sort of see what happens.
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:15.140]   If one could always just say, let me check my science,
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:18.380]   oh, I know the result of everything is gonna be 42,
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:21.060]   I don't need to live my life and do what I do,
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:23.040]   it's just we already know the answer.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.900]   It's actually good news in a sense
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.020]   that there is this phenomenon
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:27.700]   of computational irreducibility
[00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:30.780]   that doesn't allow you to just sort of jump through time
[00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:33.740]   and say this is the answer, so to speak.
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:35.200]   And so that's a good thing.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.220]   The bad thing is it doesn't allow you
[00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:39.700]   to jump through time and know what the answer is.
[00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.020]   - It's scary.
[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:44.220]   Do you think we're gonna be okay as a human civilization?
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:46.180]   You said we don't know. - Absolutely.
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:47.020]   Absolutely.
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:52.980]   - Do you think we'll prosper or destroy ourselves?
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:54.820]   - In general?
[00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:55.780]   - In general.
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:57.060]   - I'm an optimist.
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:00.480]   No, I think that it'll be interesting to see,
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.700]   for example, with this pandemic.
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:08.140]   To me, when you look at organizations, for example,
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:12.900]   having some kind of perturbation, some kick to the system,
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.500]   usually the end result of that is actually quite good
[00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:17.780]   unless it kills the system.
[00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:19.580]   It's actually quite good usually.
[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:23.860]   And I think in this case, people, I mean, my impression,
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:24.900]   it's a little weird for me
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:28.140]   because I've been a remote tech CEO for 30 years.
[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:31.660]   This is bizarrely, and the fact that
[00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:34.620]   this coming to see you here is--
[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:35.700]   - One of the rare moments
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:36.740]   that human interaction-- - Is the first time
[00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:40.220]   in six months that I've been in a building
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:41.220]   other than my house.
[00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:42.460]   - Yeah, that's amazing.
[00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:46.220]   - So I'm a kind of ridiculous outlier
[00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:47.140]   in these kinds of things.
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:50.980]   - But overall, your sense is when you shake up the system
[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:55.260]   and throw in chaos, that you challenge the system,
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:57.820]   we humans emerge better.
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:58.900]   - Seems to be that way.
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:36:59.740]   Who's to know?
[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:02.060]   But I think that people,
[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:05.540]   my sort of vague impression is that people are sort of,
[00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:07.140]   oh, what's actually important?
[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:10.460]   What is worth caring about and so on?
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:12.540]   And that seems to be something that perhaps
[00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:16.860]   is more emergent in this kind of situation.
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:19.860]   - It's so fascinating that on the individual level,
[00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:22.340]   we have our own complex cognition.
[00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.140]   We have consciousness, we have intelligence.
[00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:25.980]   We're trying to figure out little puzzles.
[00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:28.300]   And then that somehow creates this graph
[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:31.700]   of collective intelligence, where we figure out,
[00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:33.940]   and then you throw in these viruses
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:35.740]   of which there's millions different,
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:37.900]   there's entire taxonomy,
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.140]   and the viruses are thrown into the system
[00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:42.660]   of collective human intelligence.
[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:45.740]   And the little humans figure out what to do about it.
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:48.700]   We get like, we tweet stuff about information.
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:50.820]   There's doctors as conspiracy theorists.
[00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:53.180]   And then we play with different information.
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:55.740]   I mean, the whole of it is fascinating.
[00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:58.100]   I am, like you, also very optimistic,
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:02.700]   but there's a, just you said the computational reducibility.
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:06.480]   There's always a fear of the darkness
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:09.820]   of the uncertainty before us.
[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:11.140]   - Yeah, I know. - And it's scary.
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:13.420]   - I mean, the thing is, if you knew everything,
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:14.380]   it will be boring.
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:15.300]   (Dave laughs)
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:17.660]   And it would be, and then,
[00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:20.340]   and worse than boring, so to speak.
[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:24.140]   It would be, it would reveal the pointlessness, so to speak.
[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:26.580]   And in a sense, the fact that there is
[00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:28.020]   this computational reducibility,
[00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:30.340]   it's like as we live our lives, so to speak,
[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:31.660]   something is being achieved.
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:33.820]   We're computing what our lives,
[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:36.900]   what happens in our lives.
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:37.740]   - That's funny.
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:39.260]   So the computational reducibility
[00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:41.940]   is kind of like, it gives the meaning to life.
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:43.300]   It is the meaning of life.
[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:45.700]   Computational reducibility is the meaning of life.
[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:46.540]   There you go.
[00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:47.420]   - It gives it meaning, yes.
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:51.540]   I mean, it's what causes it to not be something
[00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:53.500]   where you can just say, you know,
[00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.740]   you went through all those steps to live your life,
[00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:58.060]   but we already knew what the answer was.
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:58.880]   - Right.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:38:59.720]   - Hold on one second.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:02.540]   I'm going to use my handy Wolfram Alpha
[00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:04.140]   sunburn computation thing,
[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:06.140]   so long as I can get network here.
[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:06.980]   There we go.
[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:09.460]   Oh, actually, you know what?
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:11.460]   It says sunburn unlikely.
[00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:12.660]   This is a QA moment.
[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:15.460]   (laughing)
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:16.700]   - This is a good moment.
[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:20.220]   - Okay, well, let me just check what it thinks.
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:22.020]   I can see why it thinks that.
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.540]   It doesn't seem like my intuition.
[00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:25.340]   This is one of these cases where we can,
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:27.820]   the question is, do we trust the science
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:30.340]   or do we use common sense?
[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:31.980]   - The UV thing is cool.
[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:32.860]   - Yeah, yeah, well, we'll see.
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:35.100]   This is a QA moment, as I say.
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:36.940]   (laughing)
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:37.940]   Do we trust the product?
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:39.580]   Yes, we trust the product.
[00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:41.940]   - And then there'll be a data point either way.
[00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:43.540]   - If I'm desperately sunburned,
[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:46.820]   I will send in an angry feedback.
[00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:50.780]   - Because we mentioned the concept so much,
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:51.940]   and a lot of people know it,
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.460]   but can you say what computation reducibility is?
[00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:55.300]   - Yeah, right.
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:58.780]   So the question is, if you think about things
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:01.180]   that happen as being computations,
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:06.100]   you think about some process in physics,
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:09.140]   something that you compute in mathematics, whatever else,
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.940]   it's a computation in the sense it has definite rules.
[00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:16.540]   You follow those rules, you follow them many steps,
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:18.380]   and you get some result.
[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:21.100]   So then the issue is, if you look at all these different
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:22.740]   kinds of computations that can happen,
[00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:24.220]   whether they're computations that are happening
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:25.060]   in the natural world,
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:26.540]   whether they're happening in our brains,
[00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:28.060]   whether they're happening in our mathematics,
[00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:29.860]   whatever else, the big question is,
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:32.100]   how do these computations compare?
[00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:35.540]   Is, are there dumb computations and smart computations?
[00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:37.540]   Or are they somehow all equivalent?
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:41.700]   And the thing that I kind of was sort of surprised to realize
[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.940]   from a bunch of experiments that I did in the early '90s,
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:46.060]   and now we have tons more evidence for it,
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:46.900]   this thing I call
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:48.860]   the principle of computational equivalence,
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:51.940]   which basically says, when one of these computations,
[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:54.300]   one of these processes that follows rules,
[00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:57.640]   doesn't seem like it's doing something obviously simple,
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:00.100]   then it has reached the sort of equivalent level
[00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:03.700]   of computational sophistication of everything.
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:04.540]   So what does that mean?
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:07.220]   That means that, you know, you might say,
[00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:10.140]   gosh, I'm studying this little tiny, you know,
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:11.580]   tiny program on my computer,
[00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:14.260]   I'm studying this little thing in nature,
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:15.320]   but I have my brain,
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:18.380]   and my brain is surely much smarter than that thing.
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:20.480]   I'm gonna be able to systematically outrun
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.060]   the computation that it does,
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:23.980]   because I have a more sophisticated computation
[00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.160]   that I can do.
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.420]   But what the principle of computational equivalence says
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:28.980]   is that doesn't work.
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:31.780]   Our brains are doing computations
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.480]   that are exactly equivalent
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:35.120]   to the kinds of computations that are being done
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.900]   in all these other sorts of systems.
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:38.300]   And so what consequences does that have?
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:40.660]   Well, it means that we can't systematically
[00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:42.240]   outrun these systems.
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:45.820]   These systems are computationally irreducible,
[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:47.780]   in the sense that there's no sort of shortcut
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:50.420]   that we can make that jumps to the answer.
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:51.860]   - In a general case.
[00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:52.700]   - Right, right.
[00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:55.280]   But the, so what has happened, you know,
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:58.740]   what science has become used to doing
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:00.740]   is using the little sort of pockets
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:02.820]   of computational reducibility,
[00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:04.780]   which by the way are an inevitable consequence
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:06.700]   of computational irreducibility,
[00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:09.500]   that there have to be these pockets scattered around
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:11.480]   of computational reducibility
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:14.420]   to be able to find those particular cases
[00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:15.260]   where you can jump ahead.
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:17.300]   I mean, one thing, sort of a little bit
[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:20.260]   of a parable type thing that I think is fun to tell,
[00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:22.420]   you know, if you look at ancient Babylon,
[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:25.120]   they were trying to predict three kinds of things.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:26.460]   They tried to predict, you know,
[00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:27.940]   where the planets would be,
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:29.440]   what the weather would be like,
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:32.140]   and who would win or lose a certain battle.
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:34.620]   And they had no idea which of these things
[00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:36.500]   would be more predictable than the other.
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:37.340]   - That's funny.
[00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:39.640]   - And, you know, it turns out, you know,
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.860]   where the planets are is a piece
[00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:44.380]   of computational reducibility that, you know,
[00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:46.700]   300 years ago or so, we pretty much cracked.
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:48.040]   I mean, it's been technically difficult
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:49.080]   to get all the details right,
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.740]   but it's basically, we got that.
[00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:54.200]   You know, who's gonna win or lose the battle?
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:55.420]   No, we didn't crack that one.
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:56.260]   That one, that one.
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:57.080]   - I can't.
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:57.920]   - Right.
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:58.980]   - Game theorists are trying.
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:42:59.820]   - Yes.
[00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:00.820]   - And then the weather.
[00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:02.620]   - It's kind of halfway on that one.
[00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:03.460]   - Halfway?
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:04.980]   - Yeah, I think we're doing okay on that one.
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:07.420]   You know, long-term climate, different story.
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:10.100]   But the weather, you know, we're much closer on that.
[00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:11.940]   - But do you think eventually we'll figure out the weather?
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:15.160]   So do you think eventually most think
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:17.660]   we'll figure out the local pockets in everything,
[00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:19.820]   essentially, the local pockets of reducibility?
[00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:22.700]   - No, I think that it's an interesting question,
[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.060]   but I think that the, you know,
[00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:26.700]   there is an infinite collection of these local pockets.
[00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:28.580]   We'll never run out of local pockets.
[00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:30.620]   And by the way, those local pockets
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:33.180]   are where we build engineering, for example.
[00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:34.900]   That's how we, you know, when we,
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:38.060]   if we want to have a predictable life, so to speak,
[00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:40.540]   then, you know, we have to build
[00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:43.060]   in these sort of pockets of reducibility.
[00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:44.900]   Otherwise, you know, if we were,
[00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:46.560]   if we were sort of existing
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.760]   in this kind of irreducible world,
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:50.700]   we'd never be able to, you know,
[00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:53.080]   have definite things to know what's gonna happen.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:55.260]   You know, I have to say, I think one of the features,
[00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:58.060]   you know, when we look at sort of today
[00:43:58.060 --> 00:43:59.940]   from the future, so to speak,
[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:02.060]   I suspect one of the things where people will say,
[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:04.460]   "I can't believe they didn't see that,"
[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:07.020]   is stuff to do with the following kind of thing.
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:10.180]   So, you know, if we describe, oh, I don't know,
[00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:12.900]   something like heat, for instance,
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:16.900]   we say, "Oh, you know, the air in here,
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:19.540]   "it's, you know, it's this temperature, this pressure."
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:20.820]   That's as much as we can say.
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:23.740]   Otherwise, just a bunch of random molecules bouncing around.
[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:25.700]   People will say, "I just can't believe
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:27.640]   "they didn't realize that there was all this detail
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:29.740]   "and how all these molecules were bouncing around
[00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:32.300]   "and they could make use of that."
[00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:33.140]   And actually, I realized,
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:35.220]   there's a thing I realized last week, actually,
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:37.180]   was a thing that people say, you know,
[00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:39.460]   one of the scenarios for the very long-term history
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:43.060]   of our universe is a so-called heat death of the universe,
[00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:45.340]   where basically everything just becomes
[00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:47.660]   thermodynamically boring.
[00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:49.340]   Everything's just this big kind of gas
[00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:50.580]   in thermal equilibrium.
[00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:53.140]   People say, "That's a really bad outcome."
[00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:55.460]   But actually, it's not a really bad outcome.
[00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:57.460]   It's an outcome where there's all this computation
[00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:59.440]   going on and all those individual gas molecules
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:01.920]   are all bouncing around in very complicated ways,
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.020]   doing this very elaborate computation.
[00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:06.880]   It just happens to be a computation that right now,
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:10.080]   we haven't found ways to understand.
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:12.800]   We haven't found ways, you know, our brains haven't,
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:15.440]   you know, and our mathematics and our science and so on,
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:18.440]   haven't found ways to tell an interesting story about that.
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:20.080]   It just looks boring to us.
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:25.080]   - You're saying there's a hopeful view of the heat death,
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:26.760]   quote-unquote, of the universe,
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:30.840]   where there's actual beautiful complexity going on,
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:34.900]   similar to the kind of complexity we think of
[00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:37.320]   that creates rich experience in human life
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:38.580]   and life on Earth? - Yes.
[00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:41.120]   - So those little molecules interact in complex ways.
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:43.160]   There could be intelligence in that.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.440]   There could be-- - Absolutely.
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:46.440]   I mean, this is what you learn from this principle.
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:48.280]   - Wow, that's a hopeful message.
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.840]   - Right, I mean, this is what you kind of learn
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:52.000]   from this principle of computational equivalence.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.480]   You learn it's both a message of sort of hope
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:59.320]   and a message of kind of, you know,
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.400]   you're not as special as you think you are, so to speak.
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.800]   I mean, because, you know, we imagine that
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:06.640]   with sort of all the things we do with human intelligence
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:07.920]   and all that kind of thing,
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:10.180]   and all of the stuff we've constructed in science,
[00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:12.280]   it's like, we're very special,
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:15.480]   but actually it turns out, well, no, we're not.
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:17.280]   We're just doing computations
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:19.760]   like things in nature do computations,
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.600]   like those gas molecules do computations,
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:23.560]   like the weather does computations.
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:26.400]   The only thing about the computations that we do
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:30.320]   that's really special is that we understand
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:31.460]   what they are, so to speak.
[00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:33.400]   In other words, we have a, you know,
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.600]   to us, they're special because kind of,
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:37.320]   they're connected to our purposes,
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:39.460]   our ways of thinking about things and so on.
[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:41.200]   And that's some, but so--
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:42.600]   - That's very human-centric.
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:45.560]   That's, we're just attached to this kind of thing.
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:48.320]   So let's talk a little bit of physics.
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:51.020]   Maybe let's ask the biggest question.
[00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:55.360]   What is a theory of everything in general?
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:56.200]   What does that mean?
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:58.040]   - Yeah, so I mean, the question is,
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:01.760]   can we kind of reduce what has been physics
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:05.720]   as a something where we have to sort of pick away and say,
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:08.320]   do we roughly know how the world works
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:11.080]   to something where we have a complete formal theory
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:14.260]   where we say, if we were to run this program
[00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:17.720]   for long enough, we would reproduce everything,
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:19.640]   you know, down to the fact that we're having
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:21.880]   this conversation at this moment, et cetera, et cetera,
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:22.840]   et cetera.
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:25.520]   - Any physical phenomena, any phenomena in this world?
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:27.080]   - Phenomena in the universe.
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:30.360]   But the, you know, because of computational irreducibility,
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:33.760]   it's not, you know, that's not something where you say,
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:36.200]   okay, you've got the fundamental theory of everything.
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:39.960]   Then, you know, tell me whether, you know,
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:42.520]   lions are going to eat tigers or something.
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:45.480]   You know, that's a, no, you have to run this thing
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:48.580]   for, you know, 10 to the 500 steps or something
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:50.840]   to know something like that, okay?
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:54.240]   So at some moment, potentially, you say,
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:57.600]   this is a rule and run this rule enough times
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:59.760]   and you will get the whole universe, right?
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:02.400]   That's what it means to kind of have
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.720]   a fundamental theory of physics, as far as I'm concerned,
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:07.760]   is you've got this rule, it's potentially quite simple.
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:09.400]   We don't know for sure it's simple,
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:12.600]   but we have various reasons to believe it might be simple.
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:15.840]   And then you say, okay, I'm showing you this rule.
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:18.760]   You just run it only 10 to the 500 times
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:20.120]   and you'll get everything.
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:22.260]   In other words, you've kind of reduced
[00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:24.600]   the problem of physics to a problem of mathematics,
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:25.640]   so to speak.
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:27.360]   It's like, it's as if, you know,
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:29.800]   you'd like you'd generate the digits of pi.
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:32.600]   There's a definite procedure, you just generate them.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:34.240]   And it'd be the same thing if you have
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:36.400]   a fundamental theory of physics of the kind
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:41.240]   that I'm imagining, you know, you get this rule
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:43.760]   and you just run it out and you get everything
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:45.900]   that happens in the universe.
[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:50.900]   - So a theory of everything is a mathematical framework
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:55.360]   within which you can explain everything that happens
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:58.640]   in the universe kind of in a unified way.
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:01.760]   It's not there's a bunch of disparate modules of...
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:07.080]   Does it feel like if you create a rule,
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:11.160]   and we'll talk about the Wolfram physics model,
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:16.160]   which is fascinating, but if you have a simple set of rules
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:20.860]   with a data structure like a hypergraph,
[00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:25.120]   does that feel like a satisfying theory of everything?
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:30.120]   Because then you really run up against the irreducibility,
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:32.360]   computational reducibility.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:34.240]   - Right, so that's a really interesting question.
[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:38.180]   So I, you know, what I thought was gonna happen
[00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:42.260]   is I thought we, you know, I thought we had a pretty good,
[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:45.480]   I had a pretty good idea for what the structure
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:47.940]   of this sort of theory that's sort of underneath space
[00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:50.200]   and time and so on might be like.
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:53.440]   And I thought, gosh, you know, in my lifetime, so to speak,
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:55.080]   we might be able to figure out what happens
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:58.180]   in the first 10 to the minus 100 seconds of the universe.
[00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:01.520]   And that would be cool, but it's pretty far away
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:03.880]   from anything that we can see today.
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:05.780]   And it will be hard to test whether that's right
[00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:07.560]   and so on and so on and so on.
[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:10.500]   To my huge surprise, although it should have been obvious,
[00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:12.600]   and it's embarrassing that it wasn't obvious to me,
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:15.620]   but to my huge surprise,
[00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:18.420]   we managed to get unbelievably much further than that.
[00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:21.540]   And basically what happened is that it turns out
[00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:23.180]   that even though there's this kind of bed
[00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:25.300]   of computational irreducibility
[00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:30.100]   that sort of all these simple rules run into,
[00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:34.300]   there are certain pieces of computational reducibility
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:36.260]   that quite generically occur
[00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:38.460]   for large classes of these rules.
[00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:41.020]   And, and this is the really exciting thing
[00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:42.460]   as far as I'm concerned,
[00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:46.060]   the big pieces of computational reducibility
[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:49.340]   are basically the pillars of 20th century physics.
[00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:50.300]   That's the amazing thing,
[00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:52.740]   that general relativity and quantum field theory,
[00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:55.540]   the sort of the pillars of 20th century physics
[00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:59.760]   turn out to be precisely the stuff you can say.
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:00.900]   There's a lot you can't say.
[00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:03.420]   There's a lot that's kind of at this irreducible level
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:05.180]   where you kind of don't know what's going to happen.
[00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:06.100]   You have to run it.
[00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:07.860]   You know, you can't run it within our universe,
[00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:10.300]   et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:13.620]   But the thing is there are things you can say
[00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:17.900]   and the things you can say turn out to be very beautifully,
[00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:19.820]   exactly the structure that was found
[00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:21.580]   in 20th century physics,
[00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:24.100]   namely general relativity and quantum mechanics.
[00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:27.040]   - And general relativity and quantum mechanics
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:30.560]   are these pockets of reducibility that we think of as,
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:34.180]   that 20th century physics
[00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:36.940]   is essentially pockets of reducibility.
[00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:39.460]   And then it is incredibly surprising
[00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:43.500]   that any kind of model that's generative
[00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:48.020]   from simple rules would have such pockets.
[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:49.980]   - Yeah, well, I think what's surprising
[00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:53.300]   is we didn't know where those things came from.
[00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:54.500]   It's like general relativity,
[00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:57.420]   it's a very nice mathematically elegant theory.
[00:51:57.420 --> 00:51:58.980]   Why is it true?
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:01.540]   You know, quantum mechanics, why is it true?
[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:04.720]   What we realized is that from this,
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:07.620]   that these theories are generic
[00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:09.820]   to a huge class of systems
[00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:10.960]   that have these particular,
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:14.020]   very unstructured underlying rules.
[00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:17.500]   And that's the thing that is sort of remarkable.
[00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:19.980]   And that's the thing to me that's just,
[00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:20.820]   it's really beautiful.
[00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:23.300]   I mean, it's, and the thing that's even more beautiful
[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:24.900]   is that it turns out that, you know,
[00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:26.620]   people have been struggling for a long time.
[00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:28.180]   You know, how does general relativity,
[00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:30.580]   theory of gravity relate to quantum mechanics?
[00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:32.900]   They seem to have all kinds of incompatibilities.
[00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:35.580]   It turns out what we realized is at some level,
[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:37.520]   they are the same theory.
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:41.340]   And that's just, it's just great as far as I'm concerned.
[00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:43.660]   - So maybe like taking a little step back
[00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:47.600]   from your perspective, not from the low,
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:50.700]   not from the beautiful hypergraph,
[00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:52.500]   well, from physics model perspective,
[00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:55.460]   but from the perspective of 20th century physics,
[00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:57.220]   what is general relativity?
[00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:58.340]   What is quantum mechanics?
[00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:00.900]   How do you think about these two theories
[00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:04.020]   from the context of the theory of everything?
[00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:05.740]   Like, just even definitions.
[00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:06.580]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.
[00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:08.780]   So I mean, you know, a little bit of history of physics.
[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:12.020]   Right, so I mean the, you know, okay,
[00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:14.180]   very, very quick history of physics, right?
[00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:16.240]   So, I mean, you know, physics, you know,
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:18.980]   in ancient Greek times, people basically said,
[00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:21.200]   we can just figure out how the world works.
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:22.540]   As, you know, we're philosophers,
[00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:24.540]   we're gonna figure out how the world works.
[00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:26.580]   You know, some philosophers thought there were atoms.
[00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:28.940]   Some philosophers thought there were, you know,
[00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:30.580]   continuous flows of things.
[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:32.980]   People had different ideas about how the world works.
[00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:33.820]   And they tried to just say,
[00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:36.820]   we're gonna construct this idea of how the world works.
[00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:38.180]   They didn't really have sort of notions
[00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:40.620]   of doing experiments and so on quite the same way
[00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:41.460]   as developed later.
[00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:43.300]   So that was sort of an early tradition
[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:46.620]   for thinking about sort of models of the world.
[00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:51.180]   Then by the time of 1600s, time of Galileo and then Newton,
[00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:55.260]   sort of the big idea there was, you know,
[00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:56.540]   title of Newton's book, you know,
[00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:57.620]   Principia Mathematica,
[00:53:57.620 --> 00:54:00.420]   Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy.
[00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:04.220]   We can use mathematics to understand natural philosophy,
[00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:07.100]   to understand things about the way the world works.
[00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:10.460]   And so that then led to this kind of idea that, you know,
[00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:12.760]   we can write down a mathematical equation
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:14.960]   and have that represent how the world works.
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.800]   So Newton's, one of his most famous ones
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:19.240]   is his universal law of gravity,
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:21.140]   inverse square law of gravity
[00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:23.340]   that allowed him to compute all sorts of features
[00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:24.940]   of the planets and so on.
[00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:26.260]   Although some of them he got wrong
[00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:27.980]   and it took another hundred years
[00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:30.220]   for people to actually be able to do the math
[00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:31.420]   to the level that was needed.
[00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:33.740]   But so that had been,
[00:54:33.740 --> 00:54:35.260]   this sort of tradition was we write down
[00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:36.300]   these mathematical equations.
[00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:38.620]   We don't really know where these equations come from.
[00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:40.960]   We write them down, then we figure out,
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:43.220]   we work out the consequences and we say, yes,
[00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:45.300]   that agrees with what we actually observe
[00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:47.320]   in astronomy or something like this.
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:49.500]   So that tradition continued.
[00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:51.940]   And then the first of these two sort of great
[00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:55.460]   20th century innovations was,
[00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:57.340]   well, the history is actually a little bit more complicated,
[00:54:57.340 --> 00:55:01.620]   but let's say that there were two,
[00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:03.420]   quantum mechanics and general relativity.
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:05.420]   Quantum mechanics, the kind of 1900
[00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:08.380]   was kind of the very early stuff done by Planck
[00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:12.340]   that led to the idea of photons, particles of light.
[00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:14.900]   But let's take general relativity first.
[00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:19.260]   One feature of the story is that special relativity,
[00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:21.800]   thing Einstein invented in 1905,
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:24.260]   was something which surprisingly
[00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:27.040]   was a kind of logically invented theory.
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:28.820]   It was not a theory where,
[00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:31.460]   it was something where given these ideas
[00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:33.620]   that were sort of axiomatically thought to be true
[00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:36.180]   about the world, it followed that
[00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:38.380]   such and such a thing would be the case.
[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:39.380]   It was a little bit different
[00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:42.020]   from the kind of methodological structure
[00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:45.900]   of some existing theories in the more recent times,
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:47.620]   where it had just been, we write down an equation
[00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:49.940]   and we find out that it works.
[00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:51.540]   So what happened there--
[00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:53.700]   - So there's some reasoning about the light.
[00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:57.160]   The basic idea was the speed of light
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:59.960]   appears to be constant.
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:01.920]   Even if you're traveling very fast,
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:05.080]   you shine a flashlight, the light will come out.
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:07.140]   Even if you're going at half the speed of light,
[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:08.920]   the light doesn't come out of your flashlight
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:11.160]   at one and a half times the speed of light.
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:13.080]   It's still just the speed of light.
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:15.780]   And to make that work, you have to change your view
[00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:19.640]   of how space and time work to be able to account
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:21.480]   for the fact that when you're going faster,
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:24.440]   it appears that length is foreshortened
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:26.240]   and time is dilated and things like this.
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:27.200]   - And that's special relativity.
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:28.560]   - That's special relativity.
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:32.120]   So then Einstein went on with sort of
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:34.760]   vaguely similar kinds of thinking.
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:37.960]   In 1915, invented general relativity,
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:39.920]   which is a theory of gravity.
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:42.480]   And the basic point of general relativity
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:47.480]   is it's a theory that says when there is mass in space,
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:49.680]   space is curved.
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:51.040]   And what does that mean?
[00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:55.140]   You usually you think of what's the shortest distance
[00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:58.880]   between two points, like ordinarily on a plane in space,
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:56:59.920]   it's a straight line.
[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:04.620]   Photons, light goes in straight lines.
[00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:06.480]   Well, then the question is,
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:10.300]   if you have a curved surface,
[00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:12.160]   a straight line is no longer straight.
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:13.560]   On the surface of the earth,
[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:16.200]   the shortest distance between two points is a great circle.
[00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:17.040]   It's a circle.
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:23.000]   So Einstein's observation was maybe the physical
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.800]   structure of space is such that space is curved.
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:29.640]   So the shortest distance between two points,
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:32.900]   the path, the straight line in quotes,
[00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:34.160]   won't be straight anymore.
[00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:38.920]   And in particular, if a photon is traveling near the sun
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:40.580]   or something or if a particle is going,
[00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:42.400]   something is traveling near the sun,
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:45.880]   maybe the shortest path will be one that is
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:49.800]   something which looks curved to us because it seems curved
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:52.800]   to us because space has been deformed by the presence
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:55.480]   of mass associated with that massive object.
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:58:00.480]   So the kind of the idea there is think of the structure
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:03.680]   of space as being a dynamical changing kind of thing.
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:05.520]   But then what Einstein did was he wrote down
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:09.240]   these differential equations that basically represented
[00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:11.600]   the curvature of space and its response to the presence
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:13.040]   of mass and energy.
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:16.740]   - And that ultimately is connected to the force
[00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:20.600]   of gravity, which is one of the forces that seems to,
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:23.600]   based on its strength, operate on a different scale
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:24.800]   than some of the other forces.
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:27.760]   So it operates at a scale that's very large.
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:32.160]   - What happens there is just this curvature of space
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:35.960]   which causes the paths of objects to be deflected.
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:37.200]   That's what gravity does.
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:39.720]   It causes the paths of objects to be deflected.
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:43.160]   And this is an explanation for gravity, so to speak.
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:47.280]   And the surprise is that from 1915 until today,
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:49.680]   everything that we've measured about gravity
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:52.160]   precisely agrees with general relativity.
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:56.440]   And that it wasn't clear black holes were sort of a,
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:57.700]   well, actually the expansion of the universe
[00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:59.560]   was an early potential prediction,
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:02.720]   although Einstein tried to sort of patch up his equations
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:05.100]   to make it not cause the universe to expand
[00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:06.320]   'cause it was kind of so obvious
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:08.140]   the universe wasn't expanding.
[00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:10.480]   And it turns out it was expanding
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:11.960]   and he should have just trusted the equations.
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:14.480]   And that's a lesson for those of us
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:16.680]   interested in making fundamental theories of physics
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:18.640]   is you should trust your theory
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:20.580]   and not try and patch it because of something
[00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:22.000]   that you think might be the case,
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:25.320]   that might turn out not to be the case.
[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:28.360]   - Even if the theory says something crazy is happening.
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:29.400]   - Yeah, right. - Like the universe
[00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:30.240]   is expanding. - Like the universe
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:31.280]   is expanding, right.
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:35.120]   But then it took until the 1940s,
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:36.800]   probably even really until the 1960s,
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:38.560]   until people understood that black holes
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:42.140]   were a consequence of general relativity and so on.
[00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:46.840]   But that's some, the big surprise has been that so far,
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:49.960]   this theory of gravity has perfectly agreed
[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:51.840]   with these collisions of black holes
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:55.840]   seen by the gravitational waves, it all just works.
[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:59.120]   So that's been kind of one pillar of the story of physics.
[00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.560]   It's mathematically complicated
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:03.040]   to work out the consequences of general relativity,
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:05.680]   but it's not, there's no, I mean,
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:09.320]   and some things are kind of squiggly and complicated,
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:12.040]   like people believe energy is conserved.
[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.400]   Okay, well, energy conservation doesn't really work
[01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:15.720]   in general relativity in the same way
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:16.760]   as it ordinarily does.
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:19.220]   And it's all a big mathematical story
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:21.880]   of how you actually nail down something
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:23.600]   that is definitive that you can talk about
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:26.320]   and not specific to the reference frames
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:28.320]   you're operating in and so on and so on and so on.
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:31.280]   But fundamentally, general relativity is a straight shot
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.840]   in the sense that you have this theory,
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:34.880]   you work out its consequences.
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:39.280]   - And that theory is useful in terms of basic science
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:41.200]   and trying to understand the way black holes work,
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.560]   the way the creation of galaxies work,
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:45.840]   sort of all of these kind of cosmological thing,
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:49.200]   understanding what happened, like you said, at the Big Bang.
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.560]   - Yeah. - Like all those kinds of,
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.880]   well, no, not at the Big Bang, actually, right?
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:55.880]   - Well, features of the expansion of the universe, yes.
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:58.200]   I mean, and there are lots of details
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:00:59.680]   where we don't quite know how it's working.
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:02.080]   You know, where's the dark matter?
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:03.240]   Is there dark energy?
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:04.440]   You know, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:07.640]   But fundamentally, the testable features
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:10.080]   of general relativity, it all works very beautifully.
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:13.720]   And it's, in a sense, it is mathematically sophisticated,
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:17.160]   but it is not conceptually hard to understand in some sense.
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:18.720]   - Okay, so that's general relativity.
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:20.760]   And what's its friendly neighbor?
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.080]   Like you said, there's two theories.
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.360]   Quantum mechanics. - Quantum mechanics, right.
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:26.200]   So quantum mechanics, the sort of,
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:28.280]   the way that that originated was,
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.280]   one question was, is the world continuous
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:31.400]   or is it discrete?
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:32.500]   You know, in ancient Greek times,
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:34.020]   people have been debating this.
[01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:36.400]   People debated it throughout history.
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.360]   Is light made of waves?
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:39.200]   Is it continuous?
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:40.020]   Is it discrete?
[01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:42.600]   Is it made of particles, corpuscles, whatever?
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:47.800]   What had become clear in the 1800s is that atoms,
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:51.360]   that materials are made of discrete atoms.
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:53.940]   You know, when you take some water,
[01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:55.560]   the water is not a continuous fluid,
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:57.360]   even though it seems like a continuous fluid
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:58.880]   to us at our scale.
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:00.760]   But if you say, let's look at it,
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.480]   smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller scale,
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:06.320]   eventually you get down to these molecules and then atoms.
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:07.940]   It's made of discrete things.
[01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:10.060]   So the question is sort of how important
[01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:10.940]   is this discreteness?
[01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:12.900]   Just what's discrete, what's not discrete?
[01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:14.060]   Is energy discrete?
[01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:17.380]   Is, you know, what's discrete, what's not?
[01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:19.580]   And so-- - Does it have mass?
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:20.900]   Those kinds of questions.
[01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:21.720]   - Yeah, yeah, right.
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:23.620]   Well, there's a question, I mean, for example,
[01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:26.020]   is mass discrete is an interesting question,
[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:28.100]   which is now something we can address.
[01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:30.620]   But, you know, what happened in
[01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:35.680]   the, coming up to the 1920s,
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:37.680]   there was this kind of mathematical theory developed
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:40.440]   that could explain certain kinds of discreteness
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:44.280]   in particularly in features of atoms and so on.
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:47.740]   And, you know, what developed was this mathematical theory
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:50.160]   that was the theory of quantum mechanics,
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:52.480]   theory of wave functions, Schrodinger's equation,
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:53.640]   things like this.
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:57.280]   That's a mathematical theory that allows you to calculate
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:59.240]   lots of features of the microscopic world,
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:01.440]   lots of things about how atoms work,
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:02.960]   et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:05.720]   Now, the calculations all work just great.
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:09.360]   The question of what does it really mean
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:11.260]   is a complicated question.
[01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:14.240]   Now, I mean, to just explain a little bit historically,
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:17.000]   the, you know, the early calculations of things like atoms
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.280]   worked great in 1920s, 1930s, and so on.
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.660]   There was always a problem there were
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:26.400]   in quantum field theory, which is a theory of,
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.400]   in quantum mechanics, you're dealing with a certain number
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.480]   of atoms, a certain number of electrons,
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:31.940]   and you fix the number of electrons.
[01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:34.900]   You say, I'm dealing with a two electron thing.
[01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:37.180]   In quantum field theory, you allow for particles
[01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:38.880]   being created and destroyed.
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:41.200]   So you can emit a photon that didn't exist before.
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.440]   You can absorb a photon, things like that.
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:44.560]   That's a more complicated,
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:46.280]   mathematically complicated theory.
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:47.960]   And it had all kinds of mathematical issues
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.960]   and all kinds of infinities that cropped up.
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.400]   And it was finally figured out more or less
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:52.920]   how to get rid of those.
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:55.920]   But there were only certain ways of doing the calculations.
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:57.920]   And those didn't work for atomic nuclei,
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.640]   among other things.
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:03.800]   And that led to a lot of development up until the 1960s
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:07.160]   of alternative ideas for how one could understand
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:09.360]   what was happening in atomic nuclei, et cetera, et cetera,
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:11.240]   et cetera, end result.
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.960]   In the end, the kind of most quotes,
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:17.220]   obvious mathematical structure of quantum field theory
[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:19.780]   seems to work, although it's mathematically difficult
[01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:22.980]   to deal with, but you can calculate all kinds of things.
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:26.120]   You can calculate to, you know, a dozen decimal places,
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:27.800]   certain things, you can measure them.
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:28.640]   It all works.
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:29.600]   It's all beautiful.
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:30.440]   Now you say- - By the way,
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.520]   the underlying fabric is the model
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.800]   of that particular theory is fields.
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:36.680]   Like you keep saying fields.
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:37.960]   - Those are quantum fields.
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:40.400]   Those are different from classical fields.
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:44.120]   A field is something like you say,
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:46.920]   there's like you say, the temperature field in this room.
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:49.560]   It's like there is a value of temperature
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:51.400]   at every point around the room.
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:54.000]   That's, or you can say the wind field
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.920]   would be the vector direction of the wind at every point.
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:57.880]   - It's continuous.
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:00.200]   - Yes, and that's a classical field.
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.000]   The quantum field is a much more mathematically
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.320]   elaborate kind of thing.
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:06.400]   And I should explain that one of the pictures
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:08.400]   of quantum mechanics that's really important
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:11.060]   is, you know, in classical physics,
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:12.840]   one believes that sort of definite things
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:13.800]   happen in the world.
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:16.180]   You pick up a ball, you throw it.
[01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:18.000]   The ball goes in a definite trajectory
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.200]   that has certain equations of motion.
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:22.240]   It goes in a parabola, whatever else.
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:25.320]   In quantum mechanics, the picture is
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:26.880]   definite things don't happen.
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:29.720]   Instead, sort of what happens is this whole
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:32.560]   sort of structure of all, you know,
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:34.840]   many different paths being followed.
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:37.840]   And we can calculate certain aspects of what happens,
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:40.560]   certain probabilities of different outcomes and so on.
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:42.440]   And you say, well, what really happened?
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:43.440]   What's really going on?
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.680]   What's the sort of, what's the underlying, you know,
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:46.880]   what's the underlying story?
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:50.680]   What, how do we, how do we turn this mathematical theory
[01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:53.040]   that we can calculate things with into something
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:56.400]   that we can really understand and have a narrative about?
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:59.480]   And that's been really, really hard for quantum mechanics.
[01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:01.560]   My friend Dick Feynman always used to say,
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:03.680]   nobody understands quantum mechanics,
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:06.440]   even though he'd made his whole career
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:10.200]   out of calculating things about quantum mechanics.
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.760]   And, you know, so it's a little--
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:15.160]   - But nevertheless, it's what the quantum field theory
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:18.680]   is very, very accurate at predicting
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:20.280]   a lot of the physical phenomena.
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:21.720]   So it works.
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:24.240]   - Yeah, but there are things about it, you know,
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:26.160]   it has certain, when we apply it,
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:28.840]   the standard model of particle physics, for example,
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:31.520]   we, you know, which we apply to calculate
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:33.440]   all kinds of things, it works really well.
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:34.880]   And you say, well, it has certain parameters.
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:36.920]   It has a whole bunch of parameters, actually.
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:38.800]   You say, why is the, you know,
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:41.560]   why does the muon particle exist?
[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:44.920]   Why is it 206 times the mass of the electron?
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:46.680]   We don't know, no idea.
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:48.360]   - But so the standard model of physics
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:50.880]   is one of the models that's very accurate
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:55.200]   for describing three of the fundamental forces of physics.
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:58.240]   And it's looking at the world of the very small.
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:59.080]   - Right.
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.160]   - And then there's back to the neighbor
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:04.760]   of gravity, of general relativity.
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:07.640]   So, and in the context of a theory of everything,
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:13.560]   what's traditionally the task of the unification
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.160]   of these theories?
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:16.000]   And why is it hard?
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.160]   - Well, the issue is, you try to use the methods
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:20.840]   of quantum field theory to talk about gravity,
[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:22.000]   and it doesn't work.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   Just like there are photons of light.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.320]   So there are gravitons, which are sort of
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:27.960]   the particles of gravity.
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:30.280]   And when you try and compute sort of the properties
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:32.680]   of the particles of gravity,
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:36.040]   the kind of mathematical tricks that get used
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:39.240]   in working things out in quantum field theory don't work.
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:43.000]   And that's, so that's been a sort of fundamental issue.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.800]   And when you think about black holes,
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:48.920]   which are a place where sort of the structure of space
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:52.760]   is, you know, has sort of rapid variation,
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:55.320]   and you get kind of quantum effects mixed in
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:57.520]   with effects from general relativity,
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:58.720]   things get very complicated,
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:01.320]   and there are apparent paradoxes and things like that.
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:03.720]   And people have, you know, there have been a bunch
[01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:07.080]   of mathematical developments in physics over the last,
[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:08.600]   I don't know, 30 years or so,
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:11.560]   which have kind of picked away at those kinds of issues
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:14.000]   and got hints about how things might work.
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.280]   And, but it hasn't been, you know,
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:19.040]   and the other thing to realize is,
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:20.720]   as far as physics is concerned,
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:22.840]   it's just like, here's general relativity,
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:25.800]   here's quantum field theory, you know, be happy.
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:28.840]   - Yeah, so do you think there's a quantization of gravity,
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:31.120]   so quantum gravity, what do you think of efforts
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:33.760]   that people have tried to, yeah,
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:36.360]   what do you think in general of the efforts
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:39.600]   of the physics community to try to unify these laws?
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:41.320]   - So I think what's, it's interesting.
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:43.360]   I mean, I would have said something very different
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:46.400]   before what's happened with our physics project.
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:48.880]   I mean, you know, the remarkable thing is,
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:51.720]   what we've been able to do is to make
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:55.560]   from this very simple, structurally simple,
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:59.440]   underlying set of ideas, we've been able to build this,
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:02.400]   this, you know, very elaborate structure
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:04.480]   that's both very abstract
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:06.880]   and very sort of mathematically rich.
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:09.240]   And the big surprise, as far as I'm concerned,
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:12.960]   is that it touches many of the ideas that people have had.
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:15.520]   So in other words, things like string theory and so on,
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:18.880]   twister theory, it's like, you know, we might've thought,
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:21.000]   I had thought we're out on a prong,
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.640]   we're building something that's computational,
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:25.040]   it's completely different from what other people have done.
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:27.320]   But actually, it seems like what we've done
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:30.440]   is to provide essentially the machine code that,
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:33.080]   you know, these things are various features
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:35.440]   of domain-specific languages, so to speak,
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:37.920]   that talk about various aspects of this machine code.
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:40.320]   And I think there's a, this is something that to me
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:44.600]   is very exciting because it allows one both for us
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.720]   to provide sort of a new foundation
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:48.440]   for what's been thought about there
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:52.000]   and for all the work that's been done in those areas
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.760]   to, you know, to give us, you know, more momentum
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:57.160]   to be able to figure out what's going on.
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:58.840]   Now, you know, people have sort of hoped,
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:01.200]   oh, we're just gonna be able to get, you know,
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:03.400]   string theory to just answer everything.
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:04.920]   That hasn't worked out.
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:07.640]   And I think we now kind of can see a little bit
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:10.400]   about just sort of how far away certain kinds of things are
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.520]   from being able to explain things.
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:14.760]   Some things, one of the big surprises to me,
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:16.640]   actually, I literally just got a message
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:20.840]   about one aspect of this is the, you know,
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:22.680]   it's turning out to be easier.
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:24.920]   I mean, this project has been so much easier
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:26.720]   than I could ever imagine it would be.
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:29.760]   That is, I thought we would be, you know,
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.400]   just about able to understand
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:34.160]   the first 10 to the minus 100 seconds of the universe.
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:35.840]   And, you know, it would be 100 years
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.680]   before we get much further than that.
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:40.480]   It's just turned out it actually wasn't that hard.
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:42.520]   I mean, we're not finished, but, you know--
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:45.880]   - So you're seeing echoes of all the disparate theories
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:47.440]   of physics in this framework?
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:48.480]   - Yes, yes.
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:50.880]   I mean, it's a very interesting, you know,
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:53.360]   sort of history of science-like phenomenon.
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.960]   I mean, the best analogy that I can see
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:58.000]   is what happened with the early days
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.600]   of computability and computation theory.
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:03.520]   You know, Turing machines were invented in 1936.
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:06.040]   People sort of understand computation
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:07.240]   in terms of Turing machines,
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:09.920]   but actually there had been preexisting theories
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:12.880]   of computation, combinators, general recursive functions,
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:14.880]   lambda calculus, things like this.
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:18.240]   But people hadn't, those hadn't been concrete enough
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.320]   that people could really wrap their arms around them
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:21.760]   and understand what was going on.
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:23.440]   And I think what we're gonna see in this case
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:25.960]   is that a bunch of these mathematical theories,
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:28.000]   including some very,
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.680]   I mean, one of the things that's really interesting
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:31.800]   is one of the most abstract things
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:36.200]   that's come out of sort of mathematics,
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:37.480]   higher category theory,
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:40.280]   things about infinity groupoids, things like this,
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:41.720]   which to me always just seemed like
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:44.320]   they were floating off into the stratosphere,
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:46.760]   ionosphere of mathematics,
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:51.080]   turn out to be things which our sort of theory
[01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:53.760]   anchors down to something fairly definite
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:56.640]   and says are super relevant to the way
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:59.200]   that we can understand how physics works.
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.040]   - Give me a sec.
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.520]   By the way, I just threw a hat on.
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:02.800]   You've said that,
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:06.880]   this metaphor analogy that
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:09.360]   theory of everything is a big mountain.
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.720]   And you have a sense that
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:15.520]   however far we are up the mountain,
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:21.400]   that the Wolfram physics model,
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:25.640]   a view of the universe is at least the right mountain.
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:28.360]   - We're the right mountain, yes, without question.
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:30.960]   - So which aspect of it is the right mountain?
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:32.520]   So for example, I mean,
[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:35.640]   so there's so many aspects to just the way
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:37.520]   of the Wolfram physics project,
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:39.280]   the way it approaches the world,
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:42.360]   that's clean, crisp,
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:46.040]   and unique and powerful.
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:49.280]   So there's a discrete nature to it.
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:51.320]   There's a hypergraph.
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.040]   There's a computational nature.
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:54.480]   There's a generative aspect.
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:56.880]   You start from nothing, you generate everything.
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:00.760]   Do you think the actual model
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:02.120]   is actually a really good one?
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:04.120]   Or do you think this general principle
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:06.600]   from simplicity generating complexity is the right?
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:09.040]   Like what aspect of the mountain is the correct?
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:12.760]   - I think that the kind of the meta idea
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:17.160]   about using simple computational systems to do things,
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:21.080]   that's the ultimate big paradigm
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:24.560]   that is sort of super important.
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:26.720]   The details of the particular model
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:28.560]   are very nice and clean
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:30.880]   and allow one to actually understand what's going on.
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:32.200]   They are not unique.
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:33.600]   And in fact, we know that.
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:37.120]   We know that there's a large number of different ways
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:38.600]   to describe essentially the same thing.
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:41.120]   I mean, I can describe things in terms of hypergraphs.
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:43.480]   I can describe them in terms of higher category theory.
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:45.240]   I can describe them in a bunch of different ways.
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:47.480]   They are in some sense all the same thing,
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:50.240]   but our sort of story about what's going on
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:53.600]   and the kind of cultural mathematical resonances
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:54.720]   are a bit different.
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:56.760]   I mean, I think it's perhaps worth
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:58.840]   sort of saying a little bit about kind of the,
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:03.840]   the foundational ideas of these models and things.
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:05.640]   - Great.
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:09.920]   So can you maybe, can we like rewind?
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:11.120]   We've talked about it a little bit,
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:14.080]   but can you say like what the central idea is
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:16.680]   of the Wolfram Physics Project?
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:17.520]   - Right.
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:20.160]   So the question is we're interested in finding
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:21.920]   sort of simple computational rule
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:24.080]   that describes our whole universe.
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:25.480]   - Can we just pause on that?
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:26.320]   It's just so beautiful.
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:30.920]   That's such a beautiful, that's such a beautiful idea
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:35.920]   that we can generate our universe from a data structure,
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:40.760]   simple structure, simple set of rules,
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:42.680]   and we can generate our entire universe.
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:43.520]   - Yes.
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:44.840]   - That's awe-inspiring.
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:45.680]   - Right.
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:49.080]   But so, so, you know, the question is
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:50.480]   how do you actualize that?
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:52.560]   What might this rule be like?
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:55.160]   And so one thing you quickly realize is
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:57.160]   if you're going to pack everything about a universe
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:59.040]   into this tiny rule,
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:02.440]   not much that we are familiar with in our universe
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:04.000]   will be obvious in that rule.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.920]   So you don't get to fit all these parameters of the universe,
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:10.120]   all these features of, you know, this is how space works,
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:12.000]   this is how time works, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.080]   You don't get to fit that all in.
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:16.640]   It all has to be sort of packed in to this, this thing,
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:18.640]   something much smaller, much more basic,
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:22.000]   much lower level machine code, so to speak, than that.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.520]   And all the stuff that we're familiar with
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:26.200]   has to kind of emerge from the operation of-
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:27.840]   - So the rule in itself,
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:30.400]   because of the computational reducibility,
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:32.320]   is not going to tell you the story.
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:35.660]   It's not going to give you the answer to,
[01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:38.360]   it's not going to let you predict
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:40.400]   what you're going to have for lunch tomorrow.
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:41.240]   - Right.
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:42.200]   - And it's not going to let you predict
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:44.800]   basically anything about your life, about the universe.
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:46.760]   - Right, but, and you're not going to be able to see
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:49.160]   in that rule, oh, there's the three
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:50.960]   for the number of dimensions of space and so on.
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:51.800]   - Right.
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:52.640]   - That's not going to be just-
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.600]   - The problem is not going to be obviously-
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:55.720]   - Right, so the question is then,
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:57.800]   what is the universe made of?
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:00.240]   That's a basic question.
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:01.680]   And we've had some assumptions
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:03.000]   about what the universe is made of
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.880]   for the last few thousand years,
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:08.720]   that I think in some cases just turn out not to be right.
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:11.080]   And the most important assumption
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:14.000]   is that space is a continuous thing.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.080]   That is, that you can, if you say,
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:19.240]   let's pick a point in space.
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:20.180]   We're going to do geometry.
[01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:21.520]   We're going to pick a point.
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:24.320]   We can pick a point absolutely anywhere in space.
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:28.080]   Precise numbers, we can specify of where that point is.
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:30.320]   In fact, Euclid, who kind of wrote down
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:32.960]   the original kind of axiomatization of geometry
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:37.960]   back in 300 BC or so, his very first definition, he says,
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:40.680]   "A point is that which has no part."
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:45.680]   A point is this indivisible, infinitesimal thing.
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:50.440]   Okay, so we might've said that about material objects.
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:52.880]   We might've said that about water, for example.
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:54.820]   We might've said water is a continuous thing
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:59.160]   that we can just pick any point we want in some water.
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.780]   But actually we know it isn't true.
[01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:04.140]   We know that water is made of molecules that are discrete.
[01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:06.600]   And so the question, one fundamental question
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:08.360]   is what is space made of?
[01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:10.880]   And so one of the things that's sort of a starting point
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:15.640]   for what I've done is to think of space as a discrete thing,
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:18.560]   to think of there being sort of atoms of space
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:20.600]   just as there are atoms of material things,
[01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:23.120]   although very different kinds of atoms.
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:25.600]   And by the way, I mean, this idea,
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:28.360]   there were ancient Greek philosophers who had this idea.
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:30.260]   There were, Einstein actually thought
[01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:31.840]   this is probably how things would work out.
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:33.840]   I mean, he said repeatedly,
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:35.520]   he thought that's the way it would work out.
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:38.680]   We don't have the mathematical tools in our time,
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:42.520]   which was 1940s, 1950s, and so on, to explore this.
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:45.820]   - Like the way he thought, you mean that there is something
[01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:50.820]   very, very small and discrete that's underlying space?
[01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:56.580]   - Yes, and that means that, so the mathematical theory,
[01:17:56.580 --> 01:17:59.940]   mathematical theories in physics assume that space
[01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:02.380]   can be described just as a continuous thing.
[01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:03.980]   You can just pick coordinates
[01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:05.980]   and the coordinates can have any values,
[01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:07.820]   and that's how you define space.
[01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:11.660]   Space is this just sort of background sort of theater
[01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:13.580]   on which the universe operates.
[01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:17.220]   - But can we draw a distinction between space
[01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:19.100]   as a thing that could be described
[01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:23.620]   by three values, coordinates,
[01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:26.980]   and how you're, are you using the word space
[01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:29.300]   more generally when you say?
[01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:30.940]   - No, I'm just talking about space
[01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:34.340]   as in what we experience in the universe.
[01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:38.460]   - So you think this 3D aspect of it is fundamental?
[01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:40.820]   - No, I don't think that 3D is fundamental at all, actually.
[01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:45.140]   I think that the thing that has been assumed
[01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:48.180]   is that space is this continuous thing
[01:18:48.180 --> 01:18:49.460]   where you can just describe it by,
[01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:51.300]   let's say, three numbers, for instance.
[01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:53.140]   But the most important thing about that
[01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:56.060]   is that you can describe it by precise numbers,
[01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:58.180]   because you can pick any point in space,
[01:18:58.180 --> 01:18:59.620]   and you can talk about motions,
[01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:01.740]   any infinitesimal motion in space.
[01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:03.300]   - And that's what continuous means?
[01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:04.260]   - That's what continuous means.
[01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:06.140]   That's what, you know, Newton invented calculus
[01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:07.620]   to describe these kind of continuous,
[01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:09.420]   small variations and so on.
[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:11.380]   That's kind of a fundamental idea.
[01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:15.340]   From Euclid on, that's been a fundamental idea about space.
[01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:17.540]   And so-- - Is that right or wrong?
[01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:19.980]   - It's not right.
[01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:20.940]   It's not right.
[01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:25.700]   It's right at the level of our experience most of the time.
[01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:27.740]   It's not right at the level of the machine code,
[01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:28.900]   so to speak.
[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:31.020]   And so-- - Machine code.
[01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:33.660]   Yeah, of the simulation, that's right, that's right.
[01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:36.980]   The very lowest level of the fabric of the universe,
[01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:41.980]   at least under the Wolfram physics model,
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:44.220]   is your sense is discrete.
[01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:46.300]   - Right, so now, what does that mean?
[01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:49.140]   So it means, what is space then?
[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:54.140]   So in models, the basic idea is you say,
[01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:56.420]   there are these sort of atoms of space,
[01:19:56.420 --> 01:19:59.060]   there are these points that represent,
[01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:02.060]   you know, represent places in space,
[01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:03.940]   but they're just discrete points.
[01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:06.100]   And the only thing we know about them
[01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:07.980]   is how they're connected to each other.
[01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:09.460]   We don't know where they are.
[01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:10.500]   They don't have coordinates.
[01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:12.900]   We don't get to say, this is a position such and such.
[01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:15.260]   It's just, here's a big bag of points.
[01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:16.100]   Like in our universe,
[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:18.420]   there might be 10 to the 100 of these points.
[01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:20.860]   And all we know is this point
[01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:22.460]   is connected to this other point.
[01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:23.460]   So it's like, you know,
[01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:25.540]   all we have is the friend network, so to speak.
[01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:29.100]   We don't have, you know, people's physical addresses.
[01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:31.540]   All we have is the friend network of these points.
[01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:33.500]   - Yeah, the underlying nature of reality
[01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:35.180]   is kind of like a Facebook.
[01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:37.180]   We don't know their location, but we have the friends.
[01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:38.020]   - Yeah, yeah, right.
[01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:41.900]   We know which point is connected to which other points.
[01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:43.420]   And that's all we know.
[01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:44.820]   And so you might say, well, how on earth
[01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:48.260]   can you get something which is like our experience
[01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:50.500]   of, you know, what seems like continuous space?
[01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:51.580]   Well, the answer is,
[01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:54.220]   by the time you have 10 to the 100 of these things,
[01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:57.780]   those connections can work in such a way
[01:20:57.780 --> 01:20:59.660]   that on a large scale,
[01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:02.260]   it will seem to be like continuous space
[01:21:02.260 --> 01:21:03.740]   in, let's say, three dimensions
[01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:05.220]   or some other number of dimensions
[01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:07.740]   or 2.6 dimensions or whatever else.
[01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:10.380]   - Because they're much, much, much, much larger.
[01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:14.460]   So like the number of relationships here
[01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:16.460]   we're talking about is just a humongous amount.
[01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:18.860]   So the kind of thing you're talking about
[01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:20.220]   is very, very, very small
[01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:22.700]   relative to our experience of daily life.
[01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:23.740]   - Right, so it's, I mean, you know,
[01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:25.060]   we don't know exactly the size,
[01:21:25.060 --> 01:21:30.060]   but maybe 10 to the minus,
[01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:32.740]   maybe around 10 to the minus 100 meters.
[01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:34.860]   So, you know, the size of, to give a comparison,
[01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:38.460]   you know, the size of a proton is 10 to the minus 15 meters.
[01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:42.460]   And so this is something incredibly tiny compared to that.
[01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:45.940]   - And the idea that from that would emerge
[01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:50.940]   the experience of continuous space is mind-blowing.
[01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:53.500]   What's your intuition why that's possible?
[01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:57.460]   Like, first of all, I mean, we'll get into it,
[01:21:57.460 --> 01:21:59.340]   but I don't know if we will
[01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:01.860]   through the medium of conversation,
[01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:06.420]   but the construct of hypergraphs is just beautiful.
[01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:07.260]   - Right.
[01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:08.220]   - Cellular automata are beautiful.
[01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:09.060]   We'll talk about it, but okay.
[01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:11.140]   - Right, but this thing about, you know,
[01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:14.220]   continuity arising from discrete systems
[01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:17.260]   is in today's world is actually not so surprising.
[01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:19.500]   I mean, you know, your average computer screen, right?
[01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:21.980]   Every computer screen is made of discrete pixels,
[01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:23.740]   yet we have the, you know,
[01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:27.060]   we have the idea that we're seeing these continuous pictures.
[01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:29.540]   I mean, it's, you know, the fact that on a large scale,
[01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:33.180]   continuity can arise from lots of discrete elements.
[01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:35.700]   This is at some level unsurprising now.
[01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:37.060]   - But, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:42.060]   but the pixels have a very definitive structure
[01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:46.020]   of neighbors on a computer screen.
[01:22:46.020 --> 01:22:46.860]   - Right.
[01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:51.860]   - There's no concept of spatial, of space,
[01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:55.780]   inherent in the underlying fabric of reality.
[01:22:55.780 --> 01:22:56.620]   - Right, right, right.
[01:22:56.740 --> 01:22:59.940]   So the point is, but there are cases where there are.
[01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:01.740]   So for example, let's just imagine
[01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:03.580]   you have a square grid, okay?
[01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:05.380]   And at every point on the grid,
[01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:07.700]   you have one of these atoms of space,
[01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:10.860]   and it's connected to four other atoms of space
[01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:14.500]   on the, you know, northeast, southwest corners, right?
[01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:17.620]   There you have something where if you zoom out from that,
[01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:19.060]   it's like a computer screen.
[01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:23.260]   - Yeah, so the relationship creates the spatial,
[01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:26.740]   like the relationship creates a constraint,
[01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:31.740]   which then in an emergent sense creates a,
[01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:37.060]   like, yeah, like a, basically a spatial coordinate
[01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:38.140]   for that thing. - Yes, yeah, right.
[01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:40.580]   - Even though the individual point doesn't have a spatial.
[01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:42.340]   - Even though the individual point doesn't know anything,
[01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:44.820]   it just knows what its, you know, what its neighbors are.
[01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:48.860]   The, on a large scale, it can be described by saying,
[01:23:48.860 --> 01:23:50.980]   oh, it looks like it's a, you know,
[01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:52.820]   this grid, this zoomed out grid.
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:54.940]   You can say, well, you can describe these different points
[01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:57.020]   by saying they have certain positions, coordinates,
[01:23:57.020 --> 01:23:57.900]   et cetera.
[01:23:57.900 --> 01:23:59.940]   Now, in the sort of real setup,
[01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:00.780]   it's more complicated than that.
[01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:03.100]   It isn't just a square grid or something.
[01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:05.780]   It's something much more dynamic and complicated,
[01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:07.260]   which we'll talk about.
[01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:10.860]   But so, you know, the first idea,
[01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:12.780]   the first key idea is, you know,
[01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:13.860]   what's the universe made of?
[01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:15.740]   It's made of atoms of space, basically,
[01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:17.820]   with these connections between them.
[01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:19.380]   What kind of connections do they have?
[01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:22.500]   Well, so the simplest kind of thing you might say
[01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:25.260]   is we've got something like a graph
[01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:28.500]   where every atom of space,
[01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:30.940]   where we have these edges that go between,
[01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:33.180]   out of these connections that go between atoms of space.
[01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:35.020]   We're not saying how long these edges are.
[01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:36.420]   We're just saying there is a connection
[01:24:36.420 --> 01:24:39.140]   from this place to the, from this atom to this atom.
[01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:40.660]   - Just a quick pause,
[01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:44.540]   'cause there's a lot of very people that listen to this.
[01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:46.980]   Just to clarify, 'cause I did a poll, actually.
[01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:49.660]   What do you think a graph is a long time ago?
[01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:52.100]   And it's kind of funny how few people
[01:24:52.100 --> 01:24:55.900]   know the term graph outside of computer science.
[01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:57.300]   - Let's call it a network.
[01:24:57.300 --> 01:24:58.340]   I think that's-- - Let's call it a network
[01:24:58.340 --> 01:24:59.180]   is better.
[01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:00.900]   So, but every time, I like the word graph, though.
[01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:03.860]   So let's define, let's just say that a graph
[01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:06.660]   will use terms nodes and edges, maybe.
[01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:11.580]   And it's just nodes represent some abstract entity,
[01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:13.940]   and then the edges represent relationships
[01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:14.860]   between those entities.
[01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:15.860]   - Right, exactly.
[01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:18.060]   - So that's what a graph, sorry, so.
[01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:18.900]   So there you go.
[01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:20.660]   So that's the basic structure.
[01:25:20.660 --> 01:25:23.420]   - That is the simplest case of a basic structure.
[01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:27.900]   Actually, it tends to be better to think about hypergraphs.
[01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:31.620]   So a hypergraph is just, instead of saying
[01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:34.660]   there are connections between pairs of things,
[01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:37.220]   we say there are connections between any number of things.
[01:25:37.220 --> 01:25:39.260]   So there might be ternary edges.
[01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:42.980]   So instead of just having two points
[01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:45.900]   are connected by an edge, you say three points
[01:25:45.900 --> 01:25:48.380]   are all associated with a hyperedge,
[01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:50.260]   are all connected by a hyperedge.
[01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:54.180]   That's just, at some level, that's a detail.
[01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:57.660]   It's a detail that happens to make the, for me,
[01:25:57.660 --> 01:26:00.060]   you know, sort of in the history of this project,
[01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:02.380]   the realization that you could do things that way
[01:26:02.380 --> 01:26:04.420]   broke out of certain kinds of arbitrariness
[01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:06.140]   that I felt that there was in the model
[01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:07.940]   before I had seen how this worked.
[01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:12.500]   - I mean, a hypergraph can be mapped to a graph.
[01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:14.420]   It's just a convenient representation,
[01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:16.180]   mathematically speaking. - Right, that's correct.
[01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:17.020]   That's correct.
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:19.740]   But so then, so, okay, so the first question,
[01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:22.780]   the first idea of these models of ours is
[01:26:22.780 --> 01:26:24.420]   space is made of these, you know,
[01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:26.580]   connected sort of atoms of space.
[01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:29.860]   The next idea is space is all there is.
[01:26:29.860 --> 01:26:31.900]   There's nothing except for this space.
[01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:33.940]   So in traditional ideas in physics,
[01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:37.020]   people have said there's space, it's kind of a background,
[01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:38.780]   and then there's matter, all these particles,
[01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:40.340]   electrons, all these other things,
[01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:43.420]   which exist in space, right?
[01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:46.220]   But in this model, one of the key ideas is
[01:26:46.220 --> 01:26:48.420]   there's nothing except space.
[01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:52.180]   So in other words, everything that exists in the universe
[01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:54.660]   is a feature of this hypergraph.
[01:26:54.660 --> 01:26:55.940]   So how can that possibly be?
[01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:58.660]   Well, the way that works is that
[01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:01.660]   there are certain structures in this hypergraph
[01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:05.780]   where you say that little twisty, knotted thing,
[01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:07.260]   we don't know exactly how this works yet,
[01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:10.980]   but we have sort of idea about how it works mathematically.
[01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:13.020]   This sort of twisted, knotted thing,
[01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:14.860]   that's the core of an electron.
[01:27:14.860 --> 01:27:17.380]   This thing over there that has this different form,
[01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:18.540]   that's something else.
[01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:21.060]   - So the different peculiarities of the structure
[01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:25.300]   of this graph are the very things that
[01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:29.020]   we think of as the particles inside the space,
[01:27:29.020 --> 01:27:31.780]   but in fact, it's just the property of the space.
[01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:33.900]   Mind-blowing, first of all.
[01:27:33.900 --> 01:27:35.900]   It's mind-blowing, and we'll probably talk,
[01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:38.540]   in its simplicity and beauty.
[01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:40.340]   - Yes, I think it's very beautiful.
[01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:44.300]   - But that's space, and then there's another concept
[01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:45.860]   we didn't really kind of mention,
[01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:50.500]   but you think of computation as a transformation.
[01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:51.660]   - Let's talk about time in a second.
[01:27:51.660 --> 01:27:55.340]   Let's just, I mean, on the subject of space,
[01:27:55.340 --> 01:27:57.660]   there's this question of kind of what,
[01:27:57.660 --> 01:27:59.900]   there's this idea, there is this hypergraph,
[01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:02.380]   it represents space, and it represents
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:03.620]   everything that's in space.
[01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:06.260]   The features of that hypergraph, you can say,
[01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:08.300]   certain features in this part we do know,
[01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:09.660]   certain features of the hypergraph
[01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:11.780]   represent the presence of energy, for example,
[01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:13.980]   or the presence of mass or momentum,
[01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:16.060]   and we know what the features of the hypergraph
[01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:17.900]   that represent those things are,
[01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:20.300]   but it's all just the same hypergraph.
[01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:22.220]   So one thing you might ask is,
[01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:24.260]   if you just look at this hypergraph and you say,
[01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:27.140]   and we're gonna talk about sort of what the hypergraph does,
[01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:30.020]   but if you say, how much of what's going on
[01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:34.020]   in this hypergraph is things we know and care about,
[01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:36.500]   like particles and atoms and electrons
[01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:37.540]   and all this kind of thing,
[01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:40.900]   and how much is just the background of space?
[01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:45.260]   So it turns out, so far as in one rough estimate of this,
[01:28:45.260 --> 01:28:47.900]   or everything that we care about in the universe
[01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:50.820]   is only one part in 10 to the 120
[01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:52.060]   of what's actually going on.
[01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:54.060]   The vast majority of what's happening
[01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:57.380]   is purely things that maintain the structure of space.
[01:28:57.380 --> 01:28:59.780]   That, in other words, the things that are
[01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:03.300]   the features of space that are the things
[01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:04.660]   that we consider notable,
[01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:06.500]   like the presence of particles and so on,
[01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:08.780]   that's a tiny little piece of froth
[01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:10.700]   on the top of all this activity
[01:29:10.700 --> 01:29:13.860]   that mostly is just intended to,
[01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:16.500]   mostly, I can't say intended, there's no intention here,
[01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:19.020]   that just maintains the structure of space.
[01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:21.980]   - Let me load that in.
[01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:26.700]   It just makes me feel so good as a human being.
[01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:31.060]   To be the froth on the one in the 10 to the--
[01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:33.180]   - 120 or something of, well--
[01:29:33.180 --> 01:29:37.980]   - And also just humbling how,
[01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:39.900]   in this mathematical framework,
[01:29:39.900 --> 01:29:43.060]   how much work needs to be done on the infrastructure
[01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:44.860]   of our universe. - Right, yes.
[01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:46.860]   Right, to maintain the infrastructure of our universe
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:47.940]   is a lot of work.
[01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:51.540]   We are merely writing little tiny things
[01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:53.380]   on top of that infrastructure.
[01:29:53.380 --> 01:29:57.500]   But you were just starting to talk a little bit about,
[01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:59.780]   we talked about space,
[01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:03.260]   that represents all the stuff that's in the universe.
[01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:06.060]   The question is, what does that stuff do?
[01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:09.180]   And for that, we have to start talking about time
[01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:11.420]   and what is time and so on.
[01:30:11.420 --> 01:30:15.220]   And one of the basic idea of this model
[01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:17.980]   is time is the progression of computation.
[01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:21.020]   So in other words, we have a structure of space
[01:30:21.020 --> 01:30:24.020]   and there is a rule that says how that structure of space
[01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:26.180]   will change, and it's the application,
[01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:28.500]   the repeated application of that rule
[01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:31.340]   that defines the progress of time.
[01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:34.100]   - And what does the rule look like
[01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:35.980]   in the space of hypergraphs?
[01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:38.660]   - Right, so what the rule says is something like,
[01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:40.460]   if you have a little tiny piece of hypergraph
[01:30:40.460 --> 01:30:42.220]   that looks like this,
[01:30:42.220 --> 01:30:44.700]   then it will be transformed into a piece of hypergraph
[01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:46.660]   that looks like this.
[01:30:46.660 --> 01:30:47.900]   So that's all it says.
[01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:51.260]   It says you pick up these elements of space
[01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:55.180]   and you can think of these edges, these hyper edges
[01:30:55.180 --> 01:30:57.700]   as being relations between elements in space.
[01:30:57.700 --> 01:31:01.220]   You might pick up these two relations
[01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:03.260]   between elements in space.
[01:31:03.260 --> 01:31:04.820]   And we're not saying where those elements are
[01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:06.940]   or what they are, but every time there's a certain
[01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:09.220]   arrangement of elements in space,
[01:31:09.220 --> 01:31:12.220]   then arrangement in the sense of the way they're connected,
[01:31:12.220 --> 01:31:14.660]   then we transform it into some other arrangement.
[01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:16.300]   - So there's a little tiny pattern
[01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:18.500]   and you transform it into another little pattern.
[01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:19.340]   - That's right.
[01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:21.500]   - And then because of this, I mean, again,
[01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:24.500]   it's kind of similar to cellular automata in that like,
[01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:26.820]   on paper, the rule looks like super simple.
[01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:29.100]   It's like, yeah, okay.
[01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:32.260]   Yeah, like, yeah, right, from this,
[01:31:32.260 --> 01:31:33.620]   the universe can be born.
[01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:36.660]   But like, once you start applying it,
[01:31:36.660 --> 01:31:39.020]   beautiful structure starts being,
[01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:40.980]   potentially can be created.
[01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:43.540]   And what you're doing is you're applying that rule
[01:31:43.540 --> 01:31:47.260]   to different parts, like anytime you match it
[01:31:47.260 --> 01:31:48.660]   within the hypergraph.
[01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:49.500]   - Exactly.
[01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:53.100]   - And then one of the like incredibly beautiful
[01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:57.140]   and interesting things to think about is the order
[01:31:57.140 --> 01:31:59.260]   in which you apply that rule.
[01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:01.980]   Because that pattern appears all over the place.
[01:32:01.980 --> 01:32:04.340]   - Right, so this is a big, complicated thing,
[01:32:04.340 --> 01:32:05.940]   very hard to wrap one's brain around.
[01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:09.020]   Okay, so you say the rule is,
[01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:10.660]   every time you see this little pattern,
[01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:12.500]   transform it in this way.
[01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:15.780]   But yet, as you look around the space
[01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:17.340]   that represents the universe,
[01:32:17.340 --> 01:32:18.740]   there may be zillions of places
[01:32:18.740 --> 01:32:20.580]   where that little pattern occurs.
[01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:24.380]   So what it says is, just do this,
[01:32:24.380 --> 01:32:26.900]   apply this rule wherever you feel like.
[01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:31.340]   And what is extremely non-trivial is,
[01:32:31.340 --> 01:32:33.500]   well, okay, so this is happening sort of
[01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:35.860]   in computer science terms sort of asynchronously.
[01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:38.980]   You're just doing it wherever you feel like doing it.
[01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:41.780]   And the only constraint is that if you're going
[01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:43.820]   to apply the rule somewhere,
[01:32:43.820 --> 01:32:46.700]   the things to which you apply the rule,
[01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:50.020]   the little elements to which you apply the rule,
[01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:54.940]   if they have to be, okay,
[01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:56.500]   you can think of each application of the rule
[01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:59.780]   as being kind of an event that happens in the universe.
[01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:04.740]   And the input to an event has to be ready
[01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:06.220]   for the event to occur.
[01:33:06.220 --> 01:33:08.220]   That is, if one event occurred,
[01:33:08.220 --> 01:33:09.940]   if one transformation occurred,
[01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:12.700]   and it produced a particular atom of space,
[01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:17.180]   then that atom of space has to already exist
[01:33:17.180 --> 01:33:20.860]   before another transformation that's going to apply
[01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:23.220]   to that atom of space can occur.
[01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:25.820]   - Yeah, so that's like the prerequisite for the event.
[01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:26.900]   - That's right, that's right.
[01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:31.820]   So that defines a kind of this sort of set
[01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:33.860]   of causal relationships between events.
[01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:37.980]   It says this event has to have happened before this event.
[01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:40.220]   But that is--
[01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:42.940]   - But that's not a very limited constraint.
[01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:44.100]   - No, it's not.
[01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:44.940]   And what's interesting--
[01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:47.180]   - You still get the zillion,
[01:33:47.180 --> 01:33:49.740]   that's the technical term, options.
[01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:50.660]   - That's correct.
[01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:52.820]   But, okay, so this is where things get
[01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:54.460]   a little bit more elaborate, but--
[01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:56.620]   - But they're mind-blowing, so.
[01:33:56.620 --> 01:33:59.100]   - Right, but so what happens is,
[01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:01.020]   so the first thing you might say is,
[01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:04.780]   well, okay, so this question about the freedom
[01:34:04.780 --> 01:34:07.220]   of which event you do when,
[01:34:07.220 --> 01:34:10.220]   well, let me sort of state an answer and then explain it.
[01:34:10.220 --> 01:34:11.060]   Okay?
[01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:15.500]   The validity of special relativity is a consequence
[01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:18.260]   of the fact that in some sense it doesn't matter
[01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:20.700]   in what order you do these underlying things
[01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:22.980]   so long as they respect this kind of set
[01:34:22.980 --> 01:34:24.460]   of causal relationships.
[01:34:25.380 --> 01:34:30.380]   - So that's, the part that's in a certain sense
[01:34:30.380 --> 01:34:31.820]   is a really important one,
[01:34:31.820 --> 01:34:35.660]   but the fact that it sometimes doesn't matter,
[01:34:35.660 --> 01:34:39.180]   that's a, I don't know, that's another beautiful thing.
[01:34:39.180 --> 01:34:42.540]   - So there's this idea of what I call causal invariance.
[01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:44.060]   - Causal invariance, exactly.
[01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:46.980]   So that's a really, really powerful, powerful idea.
[01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:49.180]   - Powerful idea which has actually arisen
[01:34:49.180 --> 01:34:51.340]   in different forms many times in the history
[01:34:51.340 --> 01:34:54.860]   of mathematics, mathematical logic, even computer science,
[01:34:54.860 --> 01:34:56.780]   has many different names.
[01:34:56.780 --> 01:34:59.260]   I mean, our particular version of it is a little bit tighter
[01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:01.460]   than other versions, but it's basically the same idea.
[01:35:01.460 --> 01:35:03.660]   Here's how to think about that idea.
[01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:06.340]   So imagine that, well, let's talk about it
[01:35:06.340 --> 01:35:08.100]   in terms of math for a second.
[01:35:08.100 --> 01:35:11.220]   Let's say you're doing algebra and you're told,
[01:35:11.220 --> 01:35:14.260]   multiply out this series of polynomials
[01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:16.780]   that are multiplied together, okay?
[01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:19.140]   You say, well, which order should I do that in?
[01:35:19.140 --> 01:35:21.500]   Say, well, do I multiply the third one by the fourth one
[01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:22.620]   and then do it by the first one?
[01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:24.580]   Or do I do the fifth one by the sixth one
[01:35:24.580 --> 01:35:25.940]   and then do that?
[01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:27.820]   Well, it turns out it doesn't matter.
[01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:29.740]   You can multiply them out in any order,
[01:35:29.740 --> 01:35:31.580]   you'll always get the same answer.
[01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:35.460]   That's a property, if you think about kind of making
[01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:37.100]   a kind of network that represents
[01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:40.700]   in what order you do things, you'll get different orders
[01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:42.780]   for different ways of multiplying things out,
[01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:44.900]   but you'll always get the same answer.
[01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:46.700]   Same thing if you, let's say you're sorting,
[01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:48.900]   you've got a bunch of A's and B's,
[01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:52.500]   they're in some random order, you know, BAA, BBBAA,
[01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:54.380]   whatever, and you have a little rule
[01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:59.380]   that says every time you see BA, flip it around to AB, okay?
[01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:02.300]   Eventually you apply that rule enough times,
[01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:05.420]   you'll have sorted the string so that it's all the A's first
[01:36:05.420 --> 01:36:06.500]   and then all the B's.
[01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:10.060]   Again, there are many different orders
[01:36:10.060 --> 01:36:13.220]   in which you can do that, many different sort of places
[01:36:13.220 --> 01:36:15.300]   where you can apply that update.
[01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:17.140]   In the end, you'll always get the string sorted
[01:36:17.140 --> 01:36:18.500]   the same way.
[01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:22.300]   - I know with sorting a string, it sounds obvious.
[01:36:22.300 --> 01:36:23.660]   That's to me, surprising.
[01:36:24.660 --> 01:36:28.300]   That there is, in complicated systems,
[01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:31.020]   obviously with a string, but in a hypergraph,
[01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:33.340]   that the application of the rule,
[01:36:33.340 --> 01:36:36.700]   a synchronous rule can lead to the same results sometimes.
[01:36:36.700 --> 01:36:39.060]   - Yes, yes, that is not obvious,
[01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:40.700]   and it was something that, you know,
[01:36:40.700 --> 01:36:44.060]   I sort of discovered that idea for these kinds of systems
[01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:46.620]   and back in the 1990s, and for various reasons,
[01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:51.620]   I was not satisfied by how sort of fragile
[01:36:52.020 --> 01:36:54.260]   finding that particular property was.
[01:36:54.260 --> 01:36:56.300]   And let me just make another point,
[01:36:56.300 --> 01:37:01.060]   which is that it turns out that even if the underlying rule
[01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:03.860]   does not have this property of causal invariance,
[01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:07.260]   it can turn out that every observation made by observers
[01:37:07.260 --> 01:37:11.180]   of the rule, they can impose what amounts
[01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:13.820]   to causal invariance on the rule.
[01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:15.460]   We can explain that, it's a little bit more complicated.
[01:37:15.460 --> 01:37:17.940]   I mean, technically that has to do with this idea
[01:37:17.940 --> 01:37:20.100]   of completions, which is something that comes up
[01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:23.100]   in term rewriting systems, automated theorem proving systems
[01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:26.260]   and so on, but let's ignore that for a second.
[01:37:26.260 --> 01:37:27.660]   We can come to that later.
[01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:29.780]   - Is it useful to talk about observation?
[01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:31.380]   - Not yet, not yet.
[01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:33.100]   - Okay, so great.
[01:37:33.100 --> 01:37:35.500]   So there's some concept of causal invariance
[01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:39.420]   as you apply these rules in an asynchronous way,
[01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:42.140]   you can think of those transformations as events.
[01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:44.340]   So there's this hypergraph that represents space
[01:37:44.340 --> 01:37:46.980]   and all of these events happening in the space,
[01:37:46.980 --> 01:37:50.420]   and the graph grows in interesting, complicated ways,
[01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:54.540]   and eventually the froth arises of what we experience
[01:37:54.540 --> 01:37:56.180]   as human existence.
[01:37:56.180 --> 01:37:58.900]   - That's some version of the picture,
[01:37:58.900 --> 01:38:00.740]   but let's explain a little bit more.
[01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:03.580]   - Exactly, a little more detail.
[01:38:03.580 --> 01:38:06.740]   - Right, so one thing that is sort of surprising
[01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:10.060]   in this theory is one of the sort of achievements
[01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:12.340]   of 20th century physics was kind of bringing space
[01:38:12.340 --> 01:38:13.860]   and time together.
[01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:16.500]   That was special relativity, people talk about
[01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:20.060]   space-time, this sort of unified thing where space
[01:38:20.060 --> 01:38:22.580]   and time kind of are mixed, and there's a nice
[01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:27.260]   mathematical formalism in which space and time
[01:38:27.260 --> 01:38:30.780]   sort of appear as part of the space-time continuum,
[01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:34.700]   the space-time four vectors and things like this.
[01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:37.340]   We talk about time as the fourth dimension
[01:38:37.340 --> 01:38:38.820]   and all these kinds of things.
[01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:42.180]   It's, you know, and it seems like the theory of relativity
[01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:44.060]   sort of says space and time are fundamentally
[01:38:44.060 --> 01:38:45.420]   the same kind of thing.
[01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:48.700]   So one of the things that took a while to understand
[01:38:48.700 --> 01:38:53.700]   in this approach of mine is that in my kind of approach,
[01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:56.660]   space and time are really not fundamentally
[01:38:56.660 --> 01:38:57.500]   the same kind of thing.
[01:38:57.500 --> 01:39:00.500]   Space is the extension of this hypergraph,
[01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:04.420]   time is the kind of progress of this inexorable computation
[01:39:04.420 --> 01:39:07.060]   of these rules getting applied to the hypergraph.
[01:39:07.060 --> 01:39:10.020]   So they seem like very different kinds of things.
[01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:13.260]   And so that, at first, seems like how can that
[01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:14.180]   possibly be right?
[01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:16.460]   How can that possibly be Lorentz invariant?
[01:39:16.460 --> 01:39:18.860]   That's the term for things being, you know,
[01:39:18.860 --> 01:39:21.620]   following the rules of special relativity.
[01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:26.140]   Well, it turns out that when you have causal invariance,
[01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:30.140]   that, and let's see, we can, it's worth explaining
[01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:31.020]   a little bit how this works.
[01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:35.100]   It's a little bit elaborate, but the basic point is
[01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:39.940]   that even though space and time sort of come
[01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:43.660]   from very different places, it turns out that the rules
[01:39:43.660 --> 01:39:47.260]   of sort of space time that special relativity talks about
[01:39:47.260 --> 01:39:51.740]   come out of this model when you're looking
[01:39:51.740 --> 01:39:53.700]   at large enough systems.
[01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:56.100]   So a way to think about this, you know,
[01:39:56.100 --> 01:39:59.500]   in terms of when you're looking at large enough systems,
[01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:03.820]   the part of that story is when you look at some fluid
[01:40:03.820 --> 01:40:06.300]   like water, for example, there are equations
[01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:07.860]   that govern the flow of water.
[01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:12.740]   Those equations are things that apply on a large scale.
[01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:14.420]   If you look at the individual molecules,
[01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:16.280]   they don't know anything about those equations.
[01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:19.340]   It's just the sort of the large scale effect
[01:40:19.340 --> 01:40:22.820]   of those molecules turns out to follow those equations.
[01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:25.860]   And it's the same kind of thing happening in our models.
[01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:27.980]   - I know this might be a small point,
[01:40:27.980 --> 01:40:29.580]   but it might be a very big one.
[01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:32.540]   We've been talking about space and time
[01:40:32.540 --> 01:40:35.980]   at the lowest level of the model, which is space.
[01:40:35.980 --> 01:40:39.860]   The hypergraph time is the evolution of this hypergraph.
[01:40:39.860 --> 01:40:43.160]   But there's also space time that we think about
[01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:46.400]   in general relativity for your special relativity.
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:52.400]   Like what, how do you go from the lowest source code
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:55.940]   of space and time we're talking about
[01:40:55.940 --> 01:40:58.180]   to the more traditional terminology of space and time?
[01:40:58.180 --> 01:40:59.020]   - Yeah, right.
[01:40:59.020 --> 01:41:01.820]   So the key thing is this thing we call the causal graph.
[01:41:01.820 --> 01:41:05.260]   So the causal graph is the graph of causal relationships
[01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:06.660]   between events.
[01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:08.980]   So every one of these little updating events,
[01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:10.300]   every one of these little transformations
[01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:13.380]   of the hypergraph happens somewhere in the hypergraph,
[01:41:13.380 --> 01:41:16.820]   happens at some stage in the computation.
[01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:18.240]   That's an event.
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:22.280]   That event has a causal relationship to other events
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:27.280]   in the sense that if another event needs as its input,
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:29.420]   the output from the first event,
[01:41:29.420 --> 01:41:33.300]   there will be a causal relationship of the future event
[01:41:33.300 --> 01:41:35.220]   will depend on the past event.
[01:41:35.220 --> 01:41:37.980]   So you can say it has a causal connection.
[01:41:37.980 --> 01:41:40.980]   So you can make this graph of causal relationships
[01:41:40.980 --> 01:41:42.380]   between events.
[01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:44.180]   That graph of causal relationships,
[01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:47.620]   causal invariance implies that that graph is unique.
[01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:51.220]   It doesn't matter, even though you think,
[01:41:51.220 --> 01:41:53.520]   oh, I'm, you know, let's say we were sorting a string.
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:56.340]   For example, I did that particular transposition
[01:41:56.340 --> 01:41:58.100]   of characters at this time.
[01:41:58.100 --> 01:41:59.020]   And then I did that one.
[01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:00.140]   Then I did this one.
[01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:02.960]   Turns out if you look at the network of connections
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:06.620]   between those updating events, that network is the same.
[01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:08.940]   It's the, if you were to--
[01:42:08.940 --> 01:42:09.780]   - I see.
[01:42:09.780 --> 01:42:11.460]   - The structure, so in other words,
[01:42:11.460 --> 01:42:13.300]   if you were to draw that,
[01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:15.380]   if you were to put that network on a picture
[01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:17.060]   of where you're doing all the updating,
[01:42:17.060 --> 01:42:20.020]   the places where you put the nodes of the network
[01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:22.420]   will be different, but the way the nodes are connected
[01:42:22.420 --> 01:42:23.820]   will always be the same.
[01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:27.280]   - But the causal graph is, I don't,
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:31.060]   it's kind of an observate, it's not enforced.
[01:42:31.060 --> 01:42:33.740]   It's just emergent from a set of events.
[01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:36.380]   - It's a feature of, okay, so what it is--
[01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:38.860]   - It's characteristic, I guess, of the way events happen.
[01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:40.780]   - Right, it's an event can't happen
[01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:42.540]   until its input is ready.
[01:42:42.540 --> 01:42:46.380]   And so that creates this network of causal relationships.
[01:42:46.380 --> 01:42:48.300]   And that's the causal graph.
[01:42:48.300 --> 01:42:51.580]   And the thing, the next thing to realize is,
[01:42:51.580 --> 01:42:54.480]   okay, we, when you're going to observe
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:56.400]   what happens in the universe,
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:59.580]   you have to sort of make sense of this causal graph.
[01:42:59.580 --> 01:43:01.980]   So, and you are an observer
[01:43:01.980 --> 01:43:05.040]   who yourself is part of this causal graph.
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:07.540]   And so that means, so let me give you an example
[01:43:07.540 --> 01:43:08.380]   of how that works.
[01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:11.140]   So imagine we have a really weird theory of physics
[01:43:11.140 --> 01:43:15.100]   of the world where it says this updating process,
[01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:18.180]   there's only going to be one update at every moment in time.
[01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:19.700]   And there's just going to be like a Turing machine
[01:43:19.700 --> 01:43:21.540]   that has a little head that runs around
[01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:23.660]   and just is always just updating one thing at a time.
[01:43:23.660 --> 01:43:26.040]   So you say, I have a theory of physics
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:27.480]   and the theory of physics says,
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:30.460]   there's just this one little place where things get updated.
[01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:31.820]   You say, that's completely crazy
[01:43:31.820 --> 01:43:34.340]   because it's plainly obvious
[01:43:34.340 --> 01:43:37.420]   that things are being updated sort of at the same time.
[01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:39.260]   - Asynchronously, yeah, or at the same time, yeah.
[01:43:39.260 --> 01:43:42.440]   - But the fact is that the thing is that
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:45.580]   if I'm talking to you and you seem to be being updated
[01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:47.180]   as I'm being updated,
[01:43:47.180 --> 01:43:48.960]   but if there's just this one little head
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:51.000]   that's running around updating things,
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.440]   I will not know whether you've been updated or not
[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:55.440]   until I'm updated.
[01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:58.640]   So in other words, when you draw this causal graph
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:01.000]   of the causal relationship between the updatings in you
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:02.440]   and the update is in me,
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:04.400]   it'll still be the same causal graph,
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:07.120]   whether even though the underlying sort of story
[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:10.120]   of what happens is, oh, there's just this one little thing
[01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:13.320]   and it goes and updates in different places in the universe.
[01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:18.040]   - Is that clear or is that a hypothesis?
[01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:21.440]   Is that clear that there's a unique causal graph?
[01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:22.720]   - If there's causal invariance,
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:24.240]   there's a unique causal graph.
[01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:28.060]   - So it's okay to think of what we're talking about
[01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:30.600]   as a hypergraph and the operations on it
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:32.960]   as a kind of Turing machine with a single head,
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:35.740]   like a single guy running around updating stuff.
[01:44:35.740 --> 01:44:39.640]   Is that safe to intuitively think of it this way?
[01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:41.680]   - Let me think about that for a second.
[01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:42.560]   Yes, I think so.
[01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:44.800]   I think there's nothing, it doesn't matter.
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:47.960]   I mean, you can say, okay, there is one,
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:52.880]   the reason I'm pausing for a second is that I'm wondering,
[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:55.840]   well, when you say running around,
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:58.000]   depends how far it jumps every time it runs around.
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:44:59.160]   - Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:01.960]   - But I mean like one operation at a time.
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:03.760]   - Yeah, you can think of it as one operation at a time.
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:06.680]   - It's easier for the human brain to think of it that way
[01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:08.280]   as opposed to simultaneous.
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:10.720]   - Well, maybe it's not, okay, but the thing is
[01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:12.720]   that's not how we experience the world.
[01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:15.760]   What we experience is we look around,
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:19.280]   everything seems to be happening at successive moments
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:21.360]   in time everywhere in space.
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:23.880]   That is the, and that's partly a feature
[01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:25.580]   of our particular construction.
[01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:28.460]   I mean, that is the speed of light is really fast
[01:45:28.460 --> 01:45:30.680]   compared to, we look around,
[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:33.280]   I can see maybe a hundred feet away right now.
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:38.960]   My brain does not process very much
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:41.480]   in the time it takes light to go a hundred feet.
[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:44.200]   - The brain operates at a scale of hundreds of milliseconds
[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:45.480]   or something like that, I don't know.
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:46.320]   - Right.
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:47.760]   - And speed of light is much faster.
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:50.320]   - Right, light goes in a billionth of a second,
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:51.160]   light has gone a foot.
[01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:53.880]   So it goes a billion feet every second.
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:56.640]   - There's certain moments through this conversation
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:46:01.360]   where I imagine the absurdity of the fact
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:03.780]   that there's two descendants of apes
[01:46:03.780 --> 01:46:06.020]   modeled by a hypergraph that are communicating
[01:46:06.020 --> 01:46:09.100]   with each other and experiencing this whole thing
[01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:13.400]   as a real-time simultaneous update with,
[01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:15.420]   I'm taking in photons from you right now,
[01:46:15.420 --> 01:46:18.620]   but there's something much, much deeper going on here.
[01:46:18.620 --> 01:46:19.900]   - Right, it does have a--
[01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:24.140]   - It's paralyzing sometimes just to remember that.
[01:46:24.140 --> 01:46:26.420]   - Right, no, I mean, you know,
[01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:30.780]   as a small little tangent, I just remembered
[01:46:30.780 --> 01:46:32.580]   that we're talking about, I mean,
[01:46:32.580 --> 01:46:37.100]   this, about the fabric of reality.
[01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:40.100]   - Right, so we've got this causal graph
[01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:41.940]   that represents the sort of causal relationships
[01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:43.800]   between all these events in the universe.
[01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:47.720]   That causal graph kind of is a representation of space-time,
[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:50.820]   but our experience of it requires
[01:46:50.820 --> 01:46:53.000]   that we pick reference frames.
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.940]   This is kind of a key idea, Einstein had this idea
[01:46:55.940 --> 01:46:58.980]   that what that means is we have to say
[01:46:58.980 --> 01:47:03.380]   what are we going to pick as being the,
[01:47:03.380 --> 01:47:06.880]   sort of what we define as simultaneous moments in time.
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:11.420]   So for example, we can say, you know,
[01:47:11.420 --> 01:47:13.100]   how do we set our clocks?
[01:47:13.100 --> 01:47:16.460]   You know, if we've got a spacecraft landing on Mars,
[01:47:16.460 --> 01:47:17.860]   you know, do we say that it, you know,
[01:47:17.860 --> 01:47:19.540]   what time is it landing at?
[01:47:19.540 --> 01:47:21.700]   Was it, you know, even though there's a 20-minute
[01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:23.540]   speed of light delay or something,
[01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:25.380]   you know, what time do we say it landed at?
[01:47:25.380 --> 01:47:30.020]   How do we set up sort of time coordinates for the world?
[01:47:30.020 --> 01:47:33.860]   And that turns out to be, there's kind of this arbitrariness
[01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:35.960]   to how we set these reference frames
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:39.200]   that define sort of what counts as simultaneous.
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:42.020]   And what is the essence of special relativity
[01:47:42.020 --> 01:47:44.340]   is to think about reference frames going
[01:47:44.340 --> 01:47:47.180]   at different speeds and to think about sort of
[01:47:47.180 --> 01:47:49.820]   how they assign what counts as space,
[01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:51.460]   what counts as time, and so on.
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:55.680]   That's all a bit technical, but the basic bottom line is
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:58.920]   that this causal invariance property,
[01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:01.780]   that means that it's always the same causal graph,
[01:48:01.780 --> 01:48:04.760]   independent of how you slice it with these reference frames,
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:07.840]   you'll always sort of see the same physical processes go on.
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:10.360]   And that's basically why special relativity works.
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:14.600]   - So there's something like special relativity,
[01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:17.400]   like everything around space and time
[01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:22.920]   that fits this idea of the causal graph.
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:24.920]   - Right, well, you know, one way to think about it is
[01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:27.320]   given that you have a basic structure
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:29.920]   that just involves updating things
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:33.200]   in these connected updates and looking
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:35.680]   at the causal relationships between connected updates,
[01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:37.200]   that's enough.
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:39.800]   When you unravel the consequences of that,
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:41.540]   that together with the fact that there are lots
[01:48:41.540 --> 01:48:43.920]   of these things and that you can take a continuum limit
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:46.940]   and so on, implies special relativity.
[01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:51.000]   And so that, it's kind of a, not a big deal,
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:52.920]   because it's kind of a, you know,
[01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:56.520]   it was completely unobvious when you started off
[01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:57.880]   with saying we've got this graph,
[01:48:57.880 --> 01:49:00.200]   it's being updated in time, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,
[01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:03.280]   that just looks like nothing to do with special relativity.
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:05.040]   And yet you get that.
[01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:08.280]   And what, I mean, then the thing, I mean,
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:11.160]   this was stuff that I figured out back in the 1990s.
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:15.140]   The next big thing you get is general relativity.
[01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:18.920]   And so in this hypergraph,
[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:20.700]   the sort of limiting structure,
[01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:22.440]   when you have a very big hypergraph,
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:24.480]   you can think of as being just like, you know,
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:27.040]   water seems continuous on a large scale.
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:30.120]   So this hypergraph seems continuous on a large scale.
[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:31.660]   One question is, you know,
[01:49:31.660 --> 01:49:35.200]   how many dimensions of space does it correspond to?
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:36.440]   So one question you can ask is,
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:38.000]   if you've just got a bunch of points
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.480]   and they're connected together,
[01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:43.140]   how do you deduce what effective dimension of space
[01:49:43.140 --> 01:49:46.000]   that bundle of points corresponds to?
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:47.680]   And that's pretty easy to explain.
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:50.520]   So basically, if you say, you've got a point
[01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:52.760]   and you look at how many neighbors does that point have?
[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:54.640]   Okay, imagine it's on a square grid.
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:56.220]   Then it'll have four neighbors.
[01:49:56.220 --> 01:49:58.240]   Go another level out.
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:49:59.960]   How many neighbors do you get then?
[01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:02.760]   What you realize is, as you go more and more levels out,
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:05.880]   as you go more and more distance on the graph out,
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:09.680]   you're capturing something which is essentially a circle
[01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:11.440]   in two dimensions so that, you know,
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:14.680]   the number of the area of a circle is pi r squared.
[01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:18.360]   So it's the number of points that you get to
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:21.480]   goes up like the distance you've gone squared.
[01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:24.400]   And in general, in d-dimensional space,
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:25.880]   it's r to the power d.
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:28.640]   It's the number of points you get to
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:31.520]   if you go r steps on the graph
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:33.680]   grows like the number of steps you go
[01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:35.520]   to the power of the dimension.
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:37.720]   And that's a way that you can estimate
[01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:39.920]   the effective dimension of one of these graphs.
[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:41.040]   - So what does that grow to?
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:42.520]   So how does the dimension grow?
[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:45.880]   'Cause, I mean, obviously the visual aspect
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:47.360]   of these hypergraphs,
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:50.080]   they're often visualized in three dimensions.
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:50.920]   - Right.
[01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:53.040]   - And then there's a certain kind of structure.
[01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:58.880]   Like you said, there's, I mean, a circle, a sphere.
[01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:03.680]   There's a planar aspect to it, to this graph,
[01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:06.760]   to where it kinda, it almost starts creating a surface,
[01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:09.120]   like a complicated surface, but a surface.
[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:11.880]   So how does that connect to effective dimension?
[01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:14.400]   - Okay, so I mean, if you can lay out the graph
[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:17.640]   in such a way that the points in the graph,
[01:51:17.640 --> 01:51:21.320]   points that are neighbors on the graph
[01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:23.480]   are neighbors as you lay them out,
[01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:25.640]   and you can do that in two dimensions,
[01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:28.320]   then it's gonna approximate a two-dimensional thing.
[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:29.720]   If you can't do that in two dimensions,
[01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:31.200]   if everything would have to fold over a lot
[01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:33.240]   in two dimensions, then it's not approximating
[01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:34.080]   a two-dimensional thing.
[01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:36.160]   Maybe you can lay it out in three dimensions.
[01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:38.600]   Maybe you have to lay it out in five dimensions
[01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:40.040]   to have it be the case that it sort of
[01:51:40.040 --> 01:51:42.000]   smoothly lays out like that.
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.680]   - Well, but, okay, so, and I apologize
[01:51:44.680 --> 01:51:46.040]   for the different tangent questions,
[01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:49.420]   but there's an infinity number of possible rules.
[01:51:49.420 --> 01:51:55.760]   So we have to look for rules that create
[01:51:55.760 --> 01:52:00.600]   the kind of structures that are reminiscent for,
[01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:05.080]   that have echoes of the different physics theories in them.
[01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:07.760]   So what kind of rules, is there something simple
[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:09.940]   to be said about the kind of rules
[01:52:09.940 --> 01:52:12.080]   that you have found beautiful,
[01:52:12.080 --> 01:52:13.480]   that you have found powerful?
[01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:15.400]   - Right, so, I mean, what, you know,
[01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:18.800]   one of the features of computational irreducibility is
[01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:22.000]   it's very, you can't say in advance
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:23.960]   what's gonna happen with any particular,
[01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:26.000]   you can't say, I'm gonna pick these rules
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.920]   from this part of rule space, so to speak,
[01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:30.960]   'cause they're gonna be the ones that are gonna work.
[01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:33.360]   That's, you can make some statements along those lines,
[01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:35.220]   but you can't generally say that.
[01:52:35.220 --> 01:52:38.280]   Now, you know, the state of what we've been able to do
[01:52:38.280 --> 01:52:40.700]   is, you know, different properties of the universe,
[01:52:40.700 --> 01:52:44.620]   like dimensionality, you know, integer dimensionality,
[01:52:44.620 --> 01:52:47.960]   features of other features of quantum mechanics,
[01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:48.980]   things like that.
[01:52:48.980 --> 01:52:52.020]   At this point, what we've got is we've got rules
[01:52:52.020 --> 01:52:55.380]   that any one of those features,
[01:52:55.380 --> 01:52:58.100]   we can get a rule that has that feature.
[01:52:58.100 --> 01:52:59.140]   - Yeah, so the-- - But we don't have
[01:52:59.140 --> 01:53:01.340]   the sort of, the final, here's a rule
[01:53:01.340 --> 01:53:02.620]   which has all of these features.
[01:53:02.620 --> 01:53:03.660]   We do not have that yet.
[01:53:03.660 --> 01:53:06.980]   - So if I were to try to summarize
[01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:11.380]   the Wolfram Physics Project, which is, you know,
[01:53:11.380 --> 01:53:13.920]   something that's been in your brain for a long time,
[01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:17.300]   but really has just exploded in activity,
[01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:19.180]   you know, only just months ago.
[01:53:19.180 --> 01:53:20.020]   - Yes.
[01:53:20.020 --> 01:53:23.300]   - So it's an evolving thing, and next week,
[01:53:23.300 --> 01:53:26.540]   I'll try to publish this conversation as quickly as possible
[01:53:26.540 --> 01:53:27.820]   because by the time it's published,
[01:53:27.820 --> 01:53:29.620]   already new things will probably have come out.
[01:53:29.620 --> 01:53:33.180]   So if I were to summarize it,
[01:53:33.180 --> 01:53:35.940]   we've talked about the basics of,
[01:53:35.940 --> 01:53:38.380]   there's a hypergraph that represents space,
[01:53:38.380 --> 01:53:42.380]   there is transformations in that hypergraph
[01:53:42.380 --> 01:53:45.180]   that represents time. - Progress of time.
[01:53:45.180 --> 01:53:47.860]   - That progress of time, there's a causal graph
[01:53:47.860 --> 01:53:49.660]   that's a characteristic of this,
[01:53:49.660 --> 01:53:53.720]   and the basic process of science,
[01:53:53.720 --> 01:53:58.660]   of, yeah, of science within the Wolfram Physics model
[01:53:58.660 --> 01:54:02.540]   is to try different rules and see which properties
[01:54:02.540 --> 01:54:06.120]   of physics that we know of, known physical theories,
[01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:10.700]   are, appear within the graphs that emerge from that rule.
[01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:12.380]   - That's what I thought it was going to be.
[01:54:12.380 --> 01:54:13.660]   - Uh-oh, okay.
[01:54:13.660 --> 01:54:16.060]   So what, so what is it?
[01:54:16.060 --> 01:54:18.180]   - It turns out we can do a lot better than that.
[01:54:18.180 --> 01:54:21.420]   It turns out that using kind of mathematical ideas,
[01:54:21.420 --> 01:54:25.140]   we can say, and computational ideas,
[01:54:25.140 --> 01:54:28.380]   we can make general statements,
[01:54:28.380 --> 01:54:30.340]   and those general statements turn out
[01:54:30.340 --> 01:54:32.340]   to correspond to things that we know
[01:54:32.340 --> 01:54:34.100]   from 20th century physics.
[01:54:34.100 --> 01:54:36.940]   In other words, the idea of you just try a bunch of rules
[01:54:36.940 --> 01:54:37.780]   and see what they do,
[01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:40.260]   that's what I thought we were going to have to do.
[01:54:40.260 --> 01:54:43.780]   But in fact, we can say, given causal invariance
[01:54:43.780 --> 01:54:45.740]   and computational irreducibility,
[01:54:45.740 --> 01:54:48.380]   we can derive, and this is where it gets
[01:54:48.380 --> 01:54:49.460]   really pretty interesting,
[01:54:49.460 --> 01:54:51.140]   we can derive special relativity,
[01:54:51.140 --> 01:54:52.920]   we can derive general relativity,
[01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:55.140]   we can derive quantum mechanics.
[01:54:55.140 --> 01:54:58.300]   And that's where things really start to get exciting,
[01:54:58.300 --> 01:55:01.340]   is it wasn't at all obvious to me
[01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:03.340]   that even if we were completely correct,
[01:55:03.340 --> 01:55:05.420]   and even if we had, this is the rule,
[01:55:05.420 --> 01:55:07.980]   even if we found the rule, to be able to say,
[01:55:07.980 --> 01:55:10.340]   yes, it corresponds to things we already know,
[01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:12.660]   I did not expect that to be the case.
[01:55:12.660 --> 01:55:13.500]   And--
[01:55:13.500 --> 01:55:16.900]   - So for somebody who is a simple mind
[01:55:16.900 --> 01:55:19.460]   and definitely not a physicist, not even close,
[01:55:19.460 --> 01:55:22.780]   what does derivation mean in this case?
[01:55:22.780 --> 01:55:26.940]   - Okay, so let me, this is an interesting question.
[01:55:26.940 --> 01:55:29.180]   Okay, so one thing--
[01:55:29.180 --> 01:55:31.900]   - In the context of computational irreducibility.
[01:55:31.900 --> 01:55:32.940]   - Yeah, yeah, right, right.
[01:55:32.940 --> 01:55:36.860]   So what you have to do, let me go back to, again,
[01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:38.980]   the mundane example of fluids and water
[01:55:38.980 --> 01:55:40.420]   and things like that, right?
[01:55:40.420 --> 01:55:44.020]   So you have a bunch of molecules bouncing around.
[01:55:44.020 --> 01:55:47.340]   You can say, just as a piece of mathematics,
[01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:49.260]   I happened to do this from cellular automata
[01:55:49.260 --> 01:55:52.180]   back in the mid-1980s, you can say,
[01:55:52.180 --> 01:55:54.200]   just as a matter of mathematics,
[01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:57.240]   you can say the continuum limit
[01:55:57.240 --> 01:55:59.240]   of these little molecules bouncing around
[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:01.640]   is the Navier-Stokes equations.
[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:03.260]   That's just a piece of mathematics.
[01:56:03.260 --> 01:56:06.620]   It's not, it doesn't rely on,
[01:56:06.620 --> 01:56:08.480]   you have to make certain assumptions
[01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:10.900]   that you have to say there's enough randomness
[01:56:10.900 --> 01:56:12.420]   in the way the molecules bounce around
[01:56:12.420 --> 01:56:14.220]   that certain statistical averages work,
[01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:15.660]   et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:56:15.660 --> 01:56:18.320]   Okay, it is a very similar derivation
[01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:21.220]   to derive, for example, the Einstein equations.
[01:56:21.220 --> 01:56:23.700]   Okay, so the way that works, roughly,
[01:56:23.700 --> 01:56:26.740]   the Einstein equations are about curvature of space.
[01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:28.880]   Curvature of space, I talked about
[01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:31.860]   sort of how you can figure out dimension of space.
[01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:34.260]   There's a similar kind of way of figuring out
[01:56:34.260 --> 01:56:37.220]   if you just sort of say, you know,
[01:56:37.220 --> 01:56:39.060]   you're making a larger and larger ball
[01:56:39.060 --> 01:56:40.900]   or larger and larger, if you draw a circle
[01:56:40.900 --> 01:56:43.220]   on the surface of the Earth, for example,
[01:56:43.220 --> 01:56:45.980]   you might think the area of a circle is pi r squared,
[01:56:45.980 --> 01:56:47.940]   but on the surface of the Earth,
[01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:50.540]   because it's a sphere, it's not flat,
[01:56:50.540 --> 01:56:53.360]   the area of a circle isn't precisely pi r squared,
[01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:55.060]   as the circle gets bigger,
[01:56:55.060 --> 01:56:57.020]   the area is slightly smaller than you would expect
[01:56:57.020 --> 01:56:59.580]   from the formula pi r squared as a little correction term
[01:56:59.580 --> 01:57:02.060]   that depends on the ratio of the size of the circle
[01:57:02.060 --> 01:57:03.700]   to the radius of the Earth.
[01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:05.660]   Okay, so it's the same basic thing,
[01:57:05.660 --> 01:57:08.240]   allows you to measure from one of these hypergraphs,
[01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:10.100]   what is its effective curvature?
[01:57:10.100 --> 01:57:12.580]   And that was- - So,
[01:57:12.580 --> 01:57:15.440]   the little piece of mathematics
[01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:18.340]   that explains special general relativity
[01:57:20.980 --> 01:57:23.600]   can map nicely to describe
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:26.640]   fundamental property of the hypergraphs,
[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:27.480]   of the curvature of the hypergraphs.
[01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:30.240]   - Okay, so, special relativity
[01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:32.720]   is about the relationship of time to space.
[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:35.300]   General relativity is about curvature
[01:57:35.300 --> 01:57:38.600]   and the space represented by this hypergraph.
[01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:40.760]   - So, what is the curvature of a hypergraph?
[01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:43.120]   - Okay, so, first I have to explain,
[01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:44.680]   what I'm explaining is,
[01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:47.120]   first thing you have to have is a notion of dimension.
[01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:49.280]   You don't get to talk about curvature of things.
[01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:51.740]   If you say, "Oh, it's a curved line,
[01:57:51.740 --> 01:57:53.840]   "but I don't know what a line is yet."
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:55.220]   So- - Yeah, what is the dimension
[01:57:55.220 --> 01:57:56.460]   of a hypergraph then?
[01:57:56.460 --> 01:57:57.980]   Where, from where,
[01:57:57.980 --> 01:58:00.600]   we've talked about effective dimension, but-
[01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:03.100]   - Right, that's what this is about.
[01:58:03.100 --> 01:58:05.220]   What this is about is, you have your hypergraph,
[01:58:05.220 --> 01:58:07.420]   it's got a trillion nodes in it.
[01:58:07.420 --> 01:58:08.780]   What is it roughly like?
[01:58:08.780 --> 01:58:11.500]   Is it roughly like a grid, a two-dimensional grid?
[01:58:11.500 --> 01:58:15.280]   Is it roughly like all those nodes are arranged on a line?
[01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:16.780]   What's it roughly like?
[01:58:16.780 --> 01:58:19.600]   And there's a pretty simple mathematical way
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:23.340]   to estimate that by just looking at the,
[01:58:23.340 --> 01:58:24.760]   this thing I was describing,
[01:58:24.760 --> 01:58:26.340]   this sort of the size of a ball
[01:58:26.340 --> 01:58:28.240]   that you construct in the hypergraph.
[01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:29.800]   That's a, you just measure that,
[01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:31.580]   you can just compute it on a computer
[01:58:31.580 --> 01:58:32.980]   for a given hypergraph,
[01:58:32.980 --> 01:58:35.060]   and you can say, "Oh, this thing is wiggling around,
[01:58:35.060 --> 01:58:37.540]   "but it's roughly corresponds to two,"
[01:58:37.540 --> 01:58:38.380]   or something like that,
[01:58:38.380 --> 01:58:41.460]   or roughly corresponds to 2.6, or whatever.
[01:58:41.460 --> 01:58:44.100]   So, that's how you have a notion of dimension
[01:58:44.100 --> 01:58:45.620]   in these hypergraphs.
[01:58:45.620 --> 01:58:48.380]   Curvature is something a little bit beyond that.
[01:58:48.380 --> 01:58:49.760]   It's, if you look at the,
[01:58:49.760 --> 01:58:52.140]   how the size of this ball increases
[01:58:52.140 --> 01:58:53.960]   as you increase its radius,
[01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:57.380]   curvature is a correction to the size increase
[01:58:57.380 --> 01:58:58.900]   associated with dimension.
[01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:03.340]   It's a sort of a second order term in determining size,
[01:59:03.340 --> 01:59:07.000]   just like the area of a circle is roughly pi r squared,
[01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:08.500]   so it goes up like r squared,
[01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:11.080]   the two is because it's in two dimensions.
[01:59:11.080 --> 01:59:14.420]   But when that circle is drawn on a big sphere,
[01:59:14.420 --> 01:59:16.660]   the actual formula is pi r squared
[01:59:16.660 --> 01:59:20.900]   times one minus r squared over a squared,
[01:59:20.900 --> 01:59:22.660]   and some coefficient.
[01:59:22.660 --> 01:59:24.980]   So, in other words, there's a correction to,
[01:59:24.980 --> 01:59:28.260]   and that correction term, that gives you curvature.
[01:59:28.260 --> 01:59:32.100]   And that correction term is what makes this hypergraph
[01:59:32.100 --> 01:59:33.700]   correspond, have the potential
[01:59:33.700 --> 01:59:35.860]   to correspond to curved space.
[01:59:35.860 --> 01:59:38.460]   Now, the next question is, is that curvature,
[01:59:38.460 --> 01:59:40.400]   is the way that curvature works,
[01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:43.420]   the way that Einstein's equations for general relativity,
[01:59:43.420 --> 01:59:46.060]   is it the way they say it should work?
[01:59:46.060 --> 01:59:49.180]   And the answer is yes.
[01:59:49.180 --> 01:59:50.540]   - Really?
[01:59:50.540 --> 01:59:52.260]   - And so, how does that work?
[01:59:52.260 --> 01:59:57.220]   - The calculation of the curvature of this hypergraph
[01:59:57.220 --> 01:59:59.780]   for some set of rules?
[01:59:59.780 --> 02:00:01.540]   - No, it doesn't matter what the rules are.
[02:00:01.540 --> 02:00:03.380]   It doesn't, so long as they have causal invariance
[02:00:03.380 --> 02:00:05.460]   and computational irreducibility,
[02:00:05.460 --> 02:00:09.380]   and they lead to finite dimensional space.
[02:00:09.380 --> 02:00:11.380]   Non-infinite dimensional space.
[02:00:11.380 --> 02:00:13.620]   - Oh, oh, dimensional. - Non-infinite dimensional.
[02:00:13.620 --> 02:00:14.740]   It can grow infinitely,
[02:00:14.740 --> 02:00:16.540]   but it can't be infinite dimensional.
[02:00:16.540 --> 02:00:17.980]   So-- - What does a infinitely
[02:00:17.980 --> 02:00:19.860]   dimensional hypergraph look like?
[02:00:19.860 --> 02:00:21.420]   So that means-- - For example,
[02:00:21.420 --> 02:00:25.420]   so in a tree, you start from one root of the tree,
[02:00:25.420 --> 02:00:28.380]   it doubles, doubles again, doubles again, doubles again,
[02:00:28.380 --> 02:00:30.740]   and that means if you ask the question,
[02:00:30.740 --> 02:00:34.160]   starting from a given point, how many points do you get to?
[02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:36.700]   Remember, like a circle, you get to r squared,
[02:00:36.700 --> 02:00:37.820]   the two there.
[02:00:37.820 --> 02:00:41.220]   On a tree, you get to, for example, two to the r.
[02:00:41.220 --> 02:00:43.300]   It's exponential dimensional, so to speak,
[02:00:43.300 --> 02:00:44.340]   or infinite dimensional.
[02:00:44.340 --> 02:00:48.460]   - Do you have a sense of, in the space of all possible rules,
[02:00:48.460 --> 02:00:53.460]   how many lead to infinitely dimensional hypergraphs?
[02:00:53.460 --> 02:00:55.260]   Is that-- - No.
[02:00:55.260 --> 02:00:56.100]   - Okay.
[02:00:56.100 --> 02:00:57.940]   Is that an important thing to know?
[02:00:57.940 --> 02:00:59.540]   - Yes, it's an important thing to know.
[02:00:59.540 --> 02:01:01.300]   I would love to know the answer to that.
[02:01:01.300 --> 02:01:03.500]   But it gets a little bit more complicated,
[02:01:03.500 --> 02:01:05.700]   because, for example, it's very possibly the case
[02:01:05.700 --> 02:01:07.420]   that in our physical universe,
[02:01:07.420 --> 02:01:09.980]   that the universe started infinite dimensional,
[02:01:09.980 --> 02:01:13.780]   and it only, as the big bang,
[02:01:13.780 --> 02:01:16.100]   it was very likely infinite dimensional.
[02:01:16.100 --> 02:01:21.100]   And as the universe sort of expanded and cooled,
[02:01:21.100 --> 02:01:23.700]   its dimension gradually went down.
[02:01:23.700 --> 02:01:25.380]   And so one of the bizarre possibilities,
[02:01:25.380 --> 02:01:27.100]   which actually there are experiments you can do
[02:01:27.100 --> 02:01:28.520]   to try and look at this,
[02:01:28.520 --> 02:01:31.000]   the universe can have dimension fluctuations.
[02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:32.200]   So in other words, we think we live
[02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:33.380]   in a three-dimensional universe,
[02:01:33.380 --> 02:01:35.580]   but actually there may be places
[02:01:35.580 --> 02:01:37.940]   where it's actually 3.01 dimensional,
[02:01:37.940 --> 02:01:40.540]   or where it's 2.99 dimensional.
[02:01:40.540 --> 02:01:43.300]   And it may be that in the very early universe,
[02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:45.180]   it was actually infinite dimensional,
[02:01:45.180 --> 02:01:47.180]   and it's only a late-stage phenomenon
[02:01:47.180 --> 02:01:49.220]   that we end up getting three-dimensional space.
[02:01:49.220 --> 02:01:51.900]   - But from your perspective of the hypergraph,
[02:01:51.900 --> 02:01:55.220]   one of the underlying assumptions you kind of implied,
[02:01:55.220 --> 02:01:57.820]   but you have a sense, a hope,
[02:01:57.820 --> 02:02:03.100]   set of assumptions that the rules that underlie our universe
[02:02:03.100 --> 02:02:07.240]   or the rule that underlies our universe is static.
[02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:10.160]   Is that one of the assumptions
[02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:11.820]   you're currently operating under?
[02:02:11.820 --> 02:02:14.840]   - Yes, but there's a footnote to that,
[02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:15.680]   which we should get to,
[02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:17.560]   'cause it requires a few more steps.
[02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:19.920]   - Well, actually then, but let's backtrack to the curvature,
[02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:21.040]   because we're talking about
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:23.160]   as long as it's finite dimensional.
[02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:28.040]   - Finite dimensional computational irreducibility
[02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:29.720]   and causal invariance,
[02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:34.720]   then it follows that the large-scale structure
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:37.920]   will follow Einstein's equations.
[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:40.760]   And now let me, again, qualify that a little bit more.
[02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:42.960]   There's a little bit more complexity to it.
[02:02:42.960 --> 02:02:48.640]   Okay, so Einstein's equations in their simplest form
[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:52.280]   apply to the vacuum, no matter just the vacuum.
[02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:56.400]   And they say, in particular, what they say is if you have,
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:02:59.080]   so there's this term geodesic.
[02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:01.440]   That's a term that means shortest path,
[02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:04.220]   comes from measuring the shortest paths on the earth.
[02:03:04.220 --> 02:03:08.160]   So you look at a bunch of, a bundle of geodesics,
[02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:10.080]   a bunch of shortest paths.
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:12.040]   It's like the paths that photons would take
[02:03:12.040 --> 02:03:13.580]   between two points.
[02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:15.540]   Then the statement of Einstein's equations
[02:03:15.540 --> 02:03:18.520]   is basically a statement about a certain,
[02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:20.880]   that as you look at a bundle of geodesics,
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:23.440]   the structure of space has to be such that
[02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:28.280]   although the cross-sectional area of this bundle may,
[02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:30.520]   although the actual shape of the cross-section may change,
[02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:32.300]   the cross-sectional area does not.
[02:03:32.300 --> 02:03:35.760]   That's a version, that's the most simple-minded version
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:39.480]   of R mu nu minus a half R, g mu nu equals zero,
[02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:41.520]   which is the more mathematical version
[02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:42.960]   of Einstein's equations.
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:44.960]   It's a statement of the thing called
[02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:47.360]   the Ritchie tensor is equal to zero.
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:50.600]   That's Einstein's equations for the vacuum.
[02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:54.880]   Okay, so we get that as a result of this model,
[02:03:54.880 --> 02:03:58.360]   but footnote, big footnote,
[02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:00.760]   because all the matter in the universe
[02:04:00.760 --> 02:04:02.180]   is the stuff we actually care about,
[02:04:02.180 --> 02:04:04.080]   the vacuum is not stuff we care about.
[02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:06.920]   So the question is, how does matter come into this?
[02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:08.840]   And for that, you have to understand
[02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:11.640]   what energy is in these models.
[02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:15.760]   And one of the things that we realized, you know,
[02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:18.400]   last, late last year,
[02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:20.880]   was that there's a very simple interpretation
[02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:23.080]   of energy in these models, okay?
[02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:27.240]   And energy is basically, well,
[02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:31.480]   intuitively it's the amount of activity
[02:04:31.480 --> 02:04:36.480]   in these hypergraphs and the way that that remains over time.
[02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:39.140]   So a little bit more formally,
[02:04:39.140 --> 02:04:41.580]   you can think about this causal graph
[02:04:41.580 --> 02:04:44.900]   as having these edges that represent causal relationships.
[02:04:44.900 --> 02:04:46.160]   You can think about, oh boy,
[02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:47.940]   there's one more concept that we didn't get to.
[02:04:47.940 --> 02:04:51.820]   There's the notion of space-like hyper surfaces.
[02:04:51.820 --> 02:04:55.700]   So this is not as scary as it sounds.
[02:04:55.700 --> 02:04:59.780]   It's a common notion in general relativity.
[02:04:59.780 --> 02:05:04.780]   The notion is you're defining what is a possibly,
[02:05:04.780 --> 02:05:10.020]   what is, what, where in space-time
[02:05:10.020 --> 02:05:14.020]   might be a particular moment in time.
[02:05:14.020 --> 02:05:18.240]   So in other words, what is a consistent set of places
[02:05:18.240 --> 02:05:21.780]   where you can say this is happening now, so to speak,
[02:05:21.780 --> 02:05:25.620]   and you make this series of sort of slices
[02:05:25.620 --> 02:05:29.220]   through the space-time, through this causal graph,
[02:05:29.220 --> 02:05:32.000]   to represent sort of what we consider
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.660]   to be successive moments in time.
[02:05:34.660 --> 02:05:37.700]   It's somewhat arbitrary because you can deform that
[02:05:37.700 --> 02:05:39.940]   if you're going at a different speed in special activity,
[02:05:39.940 --> 02:05:41.460]   you tip those things.
[02:05:41.460 --> 02:05:45.460]   There are different kinds of deformations,
[02:05:45.460 --> 02:05:47.300]   but only certain deformations are allowed
[02:05:47.300 --> 02:05:48.380]   by the structure of the causal graph.
[02:05:48.380 --> 02:05:52.340]   Anyway, be as it may, the basic point is
[02:05:52.340 --> 02:05:54.900]   there is a way of figuring out,
[02:05:54.900 --> 02:05:57.100]   you say what is the energy associated
[02:05:57.100 --> 02:06:00.380]   with what's going on in this hypergraph?
[02:06:00.380 --> 02:06:04.340]   And the answer is there is a precise definition of that.
[02:06:04.340 --> 02:06:06.860]   And it is, the formal way to say it is
[02:06:06.860 --> 02:06:08.560]   it's the flux of causal edges
[02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:10.660]   through space-like hyper surfaces.
[02:06:10.660 --> 02:06:12.280]   The slightly less formal way to say it,
[02:06:12.280 --> 02:06:14.620]   it's basically the amount of activity.
[02:06:14.620 --> 02:06:18.020]   See, the reason it gets tricky is you might say
[02:06:18.020 --> 02:06:20.980]   it's the amount of activity per unit volume
[02:06:20.980 --> 02:06:25.260]   in this hypergraph, but you haven't defined what volume is.
[02:06:25.260 --> 02:06:27.140]   So it's a little bit, you have to be a little bit more--
[02:06:27.140 --> 02:06:30.620]   - But this hyper surface gives some more formalism to that.
[02:06:30.620 --> 02:06:32.860]   - Yeah, yeah, it gives a way to connect that.
[02:06:32.860 --> 02:06:34.940]   - But intuitively we should think about as the just--
[02:06:34.940 --> 02:06:36.420]   - The amount of activity.
[02:06:36.420 --> 02:06:39.620]   Right, so the amount of activity that kind of remains
[02:06:39.620 --> 02:06:42.780]   in one place in the hypergraph corresponds to energy.
[02:06:42.780 --> 02:06:44.660]   The amount of activity that is kind of where
[02:06:44.660 --> 02:06:47.700]   an activity here affects an activity somewhere else
[02:06:47.700 --> 02:06:50.460]   corresponds to momentum.
[02:06:50.460 --> 02:06:53.820]   And so one of the things that's kind of cool
[02:06:53.820 --> 02:06:55.620]   is that I'm trying to think about
[02:06:55.620 --> 02:06:56.700]   how to say this intuitively.
[02:06:56.700 --> 02:06:58.960]   The mathematics is easy, but the intuitive version,
[02:06:58.960 --> 02:07:01.060]   I'm not sure, but basically the way that things
[02:07:01.060 --> 02:07:03.940]   sort of stay in the same place and have activity
[02:07:03.940 --> 02:07:05.920]   is associated with rest mass.
[02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:08.060]   And so one of the things that you get to derive
[02:07:08.060 --> 02:07:09.860]   is E equals MC squared.
[02:07:09.860 --> 02:07:14.860]   That is a consequence of this interpretation of energy
[02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:18.040]   in terms of the way the causal graph works,
[02:07:18.040 --> 02:07:20.160]   which is the whole thing is sort of a consequence
[02:07:20.160 --> 02:07:23.700]   of this whole story about updates and hypergraphs and so on.
[02:07:23.700 --> 02:07:26.300]   - So can you linger on that a little bit?
[02:07:26.300 --> 02:07:28.820]   How do we get E equals MC squared?
[02:07:28.820 --> 02:07:30.740]   So where does the mass come from?
[02:07:30.740 --> 02:07:32.220]   - Okay, okay.
[02:07:32.220 --> 02:07:34.980]   - I mean, is there an intuitive, it's okay.
[02:07:34.980 --> 02:07:37.720]   First of all, you're pretty deep
[02:07:37.720 --> 02:07:41.580]   in the mathematical explorations of this thing right now.
[02:07:41.580 --> 02:07:45.900]   We're in a very, we're in a flux currently.
[02:07:45.900 --> 02:07:47.980]   So maybe you haven't even had time
[02:07:47.980 --> 02:07:50.040]   to think about intuitive explanations.
[02:07:50.040 --> 02:07:51.720]   But--
[02:07:51.720 --> 02:07:54.100]   - Yeah, I mean, this one is, look,
[02:07:54.100 --> 02:07:56.340]   roughly what's happening,
[02:07:56.340 --> 02:07:58.420]   that derivation is actually rather easy.
[02:07:58.420 --> 02:07:59.820]   And everybody, and I've been saying
[02:07:59.820 --> 02:08:01.620]   we should pay more attention to this derivation
[02:08:01.620 --> 02:08:02.500]   because it's such, you know,
[02:08:02.500 --> 02:08:04.340]   'cause people care about this one.
[02:08:04.340 --> 02:08:05.900]   But everybody says, "It's just easy."
[02:08:05.900 --> 02:08:07.180]   - It's easy.
[02:08:07.180 --> 02:08:09.300]   So there's some concept of energy
[02:08:09.300 --> 02:08:12.900]   that can be intuitively thought of as the activity,
[02:08:12.900 --> 02:08:16.780]   the flux, the level of changes that are occurring
[02:08:16.780 --> 02:08:19.380]   based on the transformations within a certain volume,
[02:08:19.380 --> 02:08:21.240]   however the heck do you find the volume.
[02:08:21.240 --> 02:08:23.540]   - Okay, so, and then mass--
[02:08:23.540 --> 02:08:25.700]   - Well, mass is-- - What?
[02:08:25.700 --> 02:08:28.720]   - Mass is associated with kind of the energy
[02:08:28.720 --> 02:08:30.660]   that does not cause you to,
[02:08:30.660 --> 02:08:34.180]   that does not somehow propagate through time.
[02:08:34.180 --> 02:08:36.140]   Yeah, I mean, one of the things that was not obvious
[02:08:36.140 --> 02:08:38.580]   in the usual formulation of special relativity
[02:08:38.580 --> 02:08:43.020]   is that space and time are connected in a certain way,
[02:08:43.020 --> 02:08:46.460]   energy and momentum are also connected in a certain way.
[02:08:46.460 --> 02:08:49.300]   The fact that the connection of energy to momentum
[02:08:49.300 --> 02:08:51.000]   is analogous to the connection to space
[02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.820]   between space and time is not self-evident
[02:08:53.820 --> 02:08:55.140]   in ordinary relativity.
[02:08:55.140 --> 02:08:58.540]   It is a consequence of the way this model works.
[02:08:58.540 --> 02:09:01.180]   It's an intrinsic consequence of the way this model works.
[02:09:01.180 --> 02:09:03.020]   And it's all to do with that,
[02:09:03.020 --> 02:09:05.460]   with unraveling that connection
[02:09:05.460 --> 02:09:07.940]   that ends up giving you this relationship
[02:09:07.940 --> 02:09:12.680]   between energy and, well, it's energy, momentum, mass,
[02:09:12.680 --> 02:09:13.780]   they're all connected.
[02:09:13.780 --> 02:09:19.780]   - And so, like, hence the general relativity,
[02:09:19.780 --> 02:09:24.780]   you have a sense that it appears to be baked in
[02:09:24.780 --> 02:09:27.220]   to the fundamental properties
[02:09:27.220 --> 02:09:29.580]   of the way these hypergraphs are evolved.
[02:09:29.580 --> 02:09:30.620]   - Well, I didn't yet get to,
[02:09:30.620 --> 02:09:33.920]   so I got as far as special relativity and E equals MC squared.
[02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:37.540]   The one last step is, in general relativity,
[02:09:37.540 --> 02:09:42.060]   the final connection is energy and mass
[02:09:42.060 --> 02:09:44.660]   cause curvature in space.
[02:09:44.660 --> 02:09:46.860]   And that's something that,
[02:09:46.860 --> 02:09:49.980]   when you understand this interpretation of energy
[02:09:49.980 --> 02:09:52.340]   and you kind of understand the correspondence
[02:09:52.340 --> 02:09:54.260]   to curvature and hypergraphs,
[02:09:54.260 --> 02:09:56.100]   then you can finally sort of,
[02:09:56.100 --> 02:09:58.500]   the big final answer is you derive
[02:09:58.500 --> 02:10:00.700]   the full version of Einstein's equations
[02:10:00.700 --> 02:10:03.500]   for space, time, and matter.
[02:10:03.500 --> 02:10:04.700]   And that's--
[02:10:04.700 --> 02:10:09.700]   - Is that, have you, that last piece with curvature,
[02:10:09.700 --> 02:10:12.540]   have, is that, have you arrived there yet?
[02:10:12.540 --> 02:10:13.980]   - Oh yeah, we're there, yes.
[02:10:13.980 --> 02:10:15.660]   And here's the way that we,
[02:10:15.660 --> 02:10:17.420]   here's how we're really, really going to know
[02:10:17.420 --> 02:10:18.720]   we've arrived, okay?
[02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:20.980]   So, you know, we have the mathematical derivation,
[02:10:20.980 --> 02:10:24.740]   it's all fine, but, you know, mathematical derivations,
[02:10:24.740 --> 02:10:27.980]   okay, so one thing that's sort of a,
[02:10:27.980 --> 02:10:29.500]   you know, we're taking this limit
[02:10:29.500 --> 02:10:30.860]   of what happens when,
[02:10:30.860 --> 02:10:32.360]   the limit, you have to look at things
[02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:35.500]   which are large compared to the size of an elementary length,
[02:10:35.500 --> 02:10:37.700]   small compared to the whole size of the universe,
[02:10:37.700 --> 02:10:40.740]   large compared to certain kinds of fluctuations,
[02:10:40.740 --> 02:10:41.860]   blah, blah, blah.
[02:10:41.860 --> 02:10:45.420]   There's a tower of many, many of these mathematical limits
[02:10:45.420 --> 02:10:46.660]   that have to be taken.
[02:10:46.660 --> 02:10:48.980]   So if you're a pure mathematician saying,
[02:10:48.980 --> 02:10:50.740]   where's the precise proof?
[02:10:50.740 --> 02:10:52.740]   It's like, well, there are all these limits,
[02:10:52.740 --> 02:10:54.820]   we can, you know, we can try each one of them
[02:10:54.820 --> 02:10:57.500]   computationally and we could say, yeah, it really works,
[02:10:57.500 --> 02:11:00.540]   but the formal mathematics is really hard to do.
[02:11:00.540 --> 02:11:03.060]   I mean, for example, in the case of deriving
[02:11:03.060 --> 02:11:06.160]   the equations of fluid dynamics from molecular dynamics,
[02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:07.980]   that derivation has never been done.
[02:11:07.980 --> 02:11:11.340]   There is no rigorous version of that derivation.
[02:11:11.340 --> 02:11:12.180]   So, so--
[02:11:12.180 --> 02:11:13.720]   - Because you can't do the limits?
[02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:15.860]   - Yeah, 'cause you can't do the limits.
[02:11:15.860 --> 02:11:18.300]   - But so the limits allow you to try to describe
[02:11:18.300 --> 02:11:20.220]   something general about the system
[02:11:20.220 --> 02:11:22.100]   and very, very particular kinds of limits
[02:11:22.100 --> 02:11:23.620]   that you need to take with these very--
[02:11:23.620 --> 02:11:25.980]   - Right, and the limits will definitely work
[02:11:25.980 --> 02:11:27.180]   the way we think they work,
[02:11:27.180 --> 02:11:28.620]   and we can do all kinds of computer experiments--
[02:11:28.620 --> 02:11:29.740]   - It's just a hard derivation.
[02:11:29.740 --> 02:11:32.740]   - Yeah, it's just the mathematical structure
[02:11:32.740 --> 02:11:35.220]   kind of ends up running right into
[02:11:35.220 --> 02:11:37.020]   computational irreducibility,
[02:11:37.020 --> 02:11:39.500]   and you end up with a bunch of difficulty there.
[02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:42.300]   But here's the way that we're getting really confident
[02:11:42.300 --> 02:11:43.920]   that we know completely what we're talking about,
[02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:47.840]   which is when people study things like black hole mergers
[02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:50.920]   using Einstein's equations, what do they actually do?
[02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:52.720]   Well, they actually use Mathematica a whole bunch
[02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:54.360]   to analyze the equations and so on,
[02:11:54.360 --> 02:11:57.300]   but in the end, they do numerical relativity,
[02:11:57.300 --> 02:12:01.360]   which means they take these nice mathematical equations
[02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:02.480]   and they break them down
[02:12:02.480 --> 02:12:04.280]   so that they can run them on a computer,
[02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:05.840]   and they break them down into something
[02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:07.620]   which is actually a discrete approximation
[02:12:07.620 --> 02:12:08.880]   to these equations.
[02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:11.480]   Then they run them on a computer, they get results,
[02:12:11.480 --> 02:12:12.800]   then you look at the gravitational waves
[02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:14.760]   and you see if they match, okay?
[02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:18.120]   Turns out that our model gives you a direct way
[02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:19.680]   to do numerical relativity.
[02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:21.020]   So in other words, instead of saying
[02:12:21.020 --> 02:12:23.880]   you start from these continuum equations from Einstein,
[02:12:23.880 --> 02:12:26.160]   you break them down into these discrete things,
[02:12:26.160 --> 02:12:27.520]   you run them on a computer,
[02:12:27.520 --> 02:12:28.760]   you say, "We're doing it the other way around.
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:30.500]   "We're starting from these discrete things
[02:12:30.500 --> 02:12:31.680]   "that come from our model,
[02:12:31.680 --> 02:12:34.320]   "and we're just running big versions on a computer,
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:36.880]   "and what we're saying is,
[02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:39.440]   "and this is how things will work."
[02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:41.920]   So the way I'm calling this
[02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:44.640]   is proof by compilation, so to speak.
[02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:45.620]   - Proof by comp--
[02:12:45.620 --> 02:12:48.420]   - That is, in other words, you're taking something
[02:12:48.420 --> 02:12:52.240]   where we've got this description of a black hole system,
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:54.960]   and what we're doing is we're showing that
[02:12:54.960 --> 02:12:58.680]   what we get by just running our model
[02:12:58.680 --> 02:13:01.060]   agrees with what you would get
[02:13:01.060 --> 02:13:04.240]   by doing the computation from the Einstein equations.
[02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:08.280]   - As a small tangent, or actually a very big tangent,
[02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:13.280]   but proof by compilation is a beautiful concept.
[02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:20.160]   In a sense, the way of doing physics with this model
[02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:26.040]   is by running it or compiling it.
[02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:27.920]   - At some level, yes.
[02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:29.760]   - Have you thought about,
[02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:31.960]   and these things can be very large,
[02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:36.960]   is there totally new possibilities of computing hardware
[02:13:38.060 --> 02:13:40.680]   and computing software which allows you
[02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:43.140]   to perform this kind of compilation?
[02:13:43.140 --> 02:13:43.980]   - Well--
[02:13:43.980 --> 02:13:45.780]   - Algorithms, software, hardware?
[02:13:45.780 --> 02:13:47.560]   - So first comment is,
[02:13:47.560 --> 02:13:51.580]   these models seem to give one a lot of intuition
[02:13:51.580 --> 02:13:53.420]   about distributed computing,
[02:13:53.420 --> 02:13:54.660]   a lot of different intuition
[02:13:54.660 --> 02:13:57.560]   about how to think about parallel computation,
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:13:58.980]   and that particularly comes
[02:13:58.980 --> 02:14:00.680]   from the quantum mechanics side of things,
[02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:02.820]   which we didn't talk about much yet,
[02:14:02.820 --> 02:14:05.620]   but the question of what,
[02:14:05.620 --> 02:14:07.740]   given our current computer hardware,
[02:14:07.740 --> 02:14:10.120]   how can we most efficiently simulate things?
[02:14:10.120 --> 02:14:12.900]   That's actually partly a story of the model itself,
[02:14:12.900 --> 02:14:16.140]   because the model itself has deep parallelism in it.
[02:14:16.140 --> 02:14:17.780]   The ways that we are simulating it,
[02:14:17.780 --> 02:14:21.100]   we're just starting to be able to use that deep parallelism
[02:14:21.100 --> 02:14:22.580]   to be able to be more efficient
[02:14:22.580 --> 02:14:24.400]   in the way that we simulate things.
[02:14:24.400 --> 02:14:27.860]   But in fact, the structure of the model itself
[02:14:27.860 --> 02:14:30.260]   allows us to think about parallel computation
[02:14:30.260 --> 02:14:31.500]   in different ways,
[02:14:31.500 --> 02:14:34.600]   and one of my realizations is that,
[02:14:34.600 --> 02:14:36.980]   so it's very hard to get in your brain
[02:14:36.980 --> 02:14:38.500]   how you deal with parallel computation,
[02:14:38.500 --> 02:14:40.220]   and you're always worrying about,
[02:14:40.220 --> 02:14:42.700]   if multiple things can happen on different computers
[02:14:42.700 --> 02:14:43.820]   at different times,
[02:14:43.820 --> 02:14:46.440]   oh, what happens if this thing happens before that thing,
[02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:48.740]   and we have these race conditions
[02:14:48.740 --> 02:14:50.900]   where something can race to get to the answer
[02:14:50.900 --> 02:14:51.800]   before another thing,
[02:14:51.800 --> 02:14:53.120]   and you get all tangled up
[02:14:53.120 --> 02:14:55.960]   because you don't know which thing is gonna come in first.
[02:14:55.960 --> 02:14:58.300]   And usually when you do parallel computing,
[02:14:58.300 --> 02:15:00.500]   there's a big obsession to lock things down
[02:15:00.500 --> 02:15:03.900]   to the point where you've had locks and mutexes
[02:15:03.900 --> 02:15:05.220]   and God knows what else,
[02:15:05.220 --> 02:15:08.500]   where you've arranged it
[02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:10.780]   so that there can only be one sequence of things
[02:15:10.780 --> 02:15:11.620]   that can happen,
[02:15:11.620 --> 02:15:12.620]   so you don't have to think about
[02:15:12.620 --> 02:15:14.780]   all the different kinds of things that can happen.
[02:15:14.780 --> 02:15:16.420]   Well, in these models,
[02:15:16.420 --> 02:15:18.220]   physics is throwing us into,
[02:15:18.220 --> 02:15:20.220]   forcing us to think about all these possible things
[02:15:20.220 --> 02:15:21.260]   that can happen,
[02:15:21.260 --> 02:15:22.460]   but these models,
[02:15:22.460 --> 02:15:24.620]   together with what we know from physics,
[02:15:24.620 --> 02:15:26.540]   is giving us new ways to think about
[02:15:26.540 --> 02:15:28.260]   all possible things happening,
[02:15:28.260 --> 02:15:30.660]   about all these different things happening in parallel.
[02:15:30.660 --> 02:15:31.500]   And so I'm guessing--
[02:15:31.500 --> 02:15:34.600]   - They have built-in protection for some of the parallelism.
[02:15:34.600 --> 02:15:37.260]   - Well, causal invariance is the built-in protection.
[02:15:37.260 --> 02:15:39.700]   Causal invariance is what means that
[02:15:39.700 --> 02:15:41.660]   even though things happen in different orders,
[02:15:41.660 --> 02:15:43.420]   it doesn't matter in the end.
[02:15:43.420 --> 02:15:46.460]   - As a person who struggled with concurrent programming
[02:15:46.460 --> 02:15:50.220]   in like Java,
[02:15:50.220 --> 02:15:53.460]   with all the basic concepts of concurrent programming,
[02:15:53.460 --> 02:15:55.740]   if there could be built up
[02:15:55.740 --> 02:16:00.020]   a strong mathematical framework for causal invariance,
[02:16:00.020 --> 02:16:01.700]   that's so liberating.
[02:16:01.700 --> 02:16:03.660]   And that could be not just liberating,
[02:16:03.660 --> 02:16:08.280]   but really powerful for massively distributed computation.
[02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:09.120]   - Absolutely.
[02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:11.760]   No, I mean, what's eventual consistency
[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:13.960]   in distributed databases
[02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:16.120]   is essentially the causal invariance idea.
[02:16:16.120 --> 02:16:16.960]   - Yeah.
[02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:17.800]   - Okay, so that's--
[02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:19.640]   - But have you thought about
[02:16:19.640 --> 02:16:26.000]   really large simulations?
[02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.040]   - Yeah, I mean, I'm also thinking about,
[02:16:28.040 --> 02:16:29.280]   look, the fact is,
[02:16:29.280 --> 02:16:31.600]   I've spent much of my life as a language designer, right?
[02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:34.320]   So I can't possibly not think about,
[02:16:34.320 --> 02:16:37.220]   what does this mean for designing languages
[02:16:37.220 --> 02:16:38.300]   for parallel computation?
[02:16:38.300 --> 02:16:40.620]   In fact, another thing that's one of these,
[02:16:40.620 --> 02:16:43.500]   I'm always embarrassed at
[02:16:43.500 --> 02:16:45.620]   how long it's taken me to figure stuff out.
[02:16:45.620 --> 02:16:47.340]   But back in the 1980s,
[02:16:47.340 --> 02:16:49.540]   I worked on trying to make up languages
[02:16:49.540 --> 02:16:50.920]   for parallel computation.
[02:16:50.920 --> 02:16:53.060]   I thought about doing graph rewriting.
[02:16:53.060 --> 02:16:54.400]   I thought about doing these kinds of things,
[02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:57.100]   but I couldn't see how to actually make the connections
[02:16:57.100 --> 02:16:59.300]   to actually do something useful.
[02:16:59.300 --> 02:17:02.480]   I think now physics is kind of showing us
[02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:04.160]   how to make those things useful.
[02:17:04.160 --> 02:17:06.260]   And so my guess is that in time,
[02:17:06.260 --> 02:17:07.480]   we'll be talking about,
[02:17:07.480 --> 02:17:08.960]   we do parallel programming,
[02:17:08.960 --> 02:17:10.320]   we'll be talking about programming
[02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:12.040]   in a certain reference frame,
[02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:14.080]   just as we think about thinking about physics
[02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:15.040]   in a certain reference frame.
[02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:17.600]   It's a certain co-ordinatization of what's going on.
[02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:19.920]   We say, we're gonna program in this reference frame.
[02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:22.620]   Oh, let's change the reference frame to this reference frame.
[02:17:22.620 --> 02:17:25.200]   And then our program will seem different
[02:17:25.200 --> 02:17:27.100]   and we'll have a different way to think about it,
[02:17:27.100 --> 02:17:28.960]   but it's still the same program underneath.
[02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:30.760]   - So let me ask on this topic,
[02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:32.360]   'cause I put out that I'm talking to you.
[02:17:32.360 --> 02:17:34.560]   I got way more questions than I can deal with,
[02:17:34.560 --> 02:17:37.520]   but what pops to mind is a question somebody asked
[02:17:37.520 --> 02:17:39.480]   on Reddit, I think, is,
[02:17:39.480 --> 02:17:42.560]   please ask Dr. Wolfram,
[02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:46.200]   what are the specs of the computer running the universe?
[02:17:46.200 --> 02:17:51.200]   So we're talking about specs of hardware and software
[02:17:51.200 --> 02:17:54.100]   for simulations of a large scale thing.
[02:17:54.100 --> 02:17:57.560]   What about a scale that is comparative
[02:17:57.560 --> 02:17:59.760]   to something that eventually leads
[02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:01.600]   to the two of us talking about?
[02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:02.640]   - Right, right, right.
[02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:05.080]   So actually I did try to estimate that
[02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:07.280]   and we actually have to go a couple more stages
[02:18:07.280 --> 02:18:08.720]   before we can really get to that answer
[02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:13.720]   because we're talking about this thing.
[02:18:13.720 --> 02:18:16.940]   This is what happens when you build these abstract systems
[02:18:16.940 --> 02:18:19.600]   and you're trying to explain the universe.
[02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:23.680]   They're quite a number of levels deep, so to speak.
[02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:25.560]   But the--
[02:18:25.560 --> 02:18:27.320]   - You mean conceptually or like literally,
[02:18:27.320 --> 02:18:28.800]   'cause you're talking about small objects
[02:18:28.800 --> 02:18:31.640]   and there's 10 to the 120 something.
[02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:32.480]   - Yeah, right.
[02:18:32.480 --> 02:18:35.160]   It is conceptually deep.
[02:18:35.160 --> 02:18:36.800]   And one of the things that's happening
[02:18:36.800 --> 02:18:39.600]   sort of structurally in this project is,
[02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:40.640]   you know, there were ideas,
[02:18:40.640 --> 02:18:41.800]   there's another layer of ideas,
[02:18:41.800 --> 02:18:43.260]   there's another layer of ideas
[02:18:43.260 --> 02:18:46.960]   to get to the different things that correspond to physics.
[02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:49.280]   They're just different layers of ideas.
[02:18:49.280 --> 02:18:52.380]   And they are, you know, it's actually probably,
[02:18:52.380 --> 02:18:54.480]   if anything, getting harder to explain this project
[02:18:54.480 --> 02:18:56.520]   'cause I'm realizing that the fraction of way through
[02:18:56.520 --> 02:18:58.640]   that I am so far in explaining this to you
[02:18:58.640 --> 02:19:01.520]   is less than, you know, it might be because,
[02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:03.080]   'cause we know more now, you know,
[02:19:03.080 --> 02:19:06.160]   and every week basically we know a little bit more.
[02:19:06.160 --> 02:19:07.000]   And like--
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:10.440]   - Those are just layers on the initial fundamental--
[02:19:10.440 --> 02:19:12.320]   - Yes, but the layers are, you know,
[02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:14.320]   you might be asking me, you know,
[02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:16.560]   how do we get, you know,
[02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:18.680]   the difference between fermions and bosons,
[02:19:18.680 --> 02:19:20.780]   the difference between particles that can be
[02:19:20.780 --> 02:19:21.720]   all in the same state
[02:19:21.720 --> 02:19:24.060]   and particles that exclude each other, okay?
[02:19:24.060 --> 02:19:27.300]   Last three days we've kind of figured that out, okay?
[02:19:27.300 --> 02:19:31.060]   But, and it's very interesting, it's very cool.
[02:19:31.060 --> 02:19:32.060]   And it's very--
[02:19:32.060 --> 02:19:34.420]   - And those are some kind of properties
[02:19:34.420 --> 02:19:37.860]   at a certain level, layer of abstraction on the hydrograph.
[02:19:37.860 --> 02:19:40.620]   - Yes, yes, and there's, but the layers of abstraction
[02:19:40.620 --> 02:19:42.740]   are kind of, they're compounding--
[02:19:42.740 --> 02:19:45.300]   - Stacking up, so it's difficult, but--
[02:19:45.300 --> 02:19:46.300]   - But okay, but this thing--
[02:19:46.300 --> 02:19:48.460]   - But the specs nevertheless remain the same.
[02:19:48.460 --> 02:19:50.940]   - The specs underneath, so I have an estimate.
[02:19:50.940 --> 02:19:52.460]   So the question is, what are the units?
[02:19:52.460 --> 02:19:54.860]   So we've got these different fundamental constants
[02:19:54.860 --> 02:19:56.160]   about the world.
[02:19:56.160 --> 02:19:58.540]   So one of them is the speed of light, which is the,
[02:19:58.540 --> 02:20:00.180]   so the thing that's always the same
[02:20:00.180 --> 02:20:02.700]   in all these different ways of thinking about the universe
[02:20:02.700 --> 02:20:06.180]   is the notion of time, because time is computation.
[02:20:06.180 --> 02:20:08.080]   And so there's an elementary time,
[02:20:08.080 --> 02:20:12.220]   which is sort of the amount of time that we ascribe
[02:20:12.220 --> 02:20:17.100]   to elapsing in a single computational step, okay?
[02:20:17.100 --> 02:20:18.420]   So that's the elementary time.
[02:20:18.420 --> 02:20:19.260]   So then there's an elementary--
[02:20:19.260 --> 02:20:21.900]   - That's a parameter or whatever, that's a constant.
[02:20:21.900 --> 02:20:23.380]   - It's whatever we define it to be,
[02:20:23.380 --> 02:20:25.380]   because I mean, we don't, you know--
[02:20:25.380 --> 02:20:26.700]   - I mean, it's all relative, right?
[02:20:26.700 --> 02:20:28.100]   It doesn't matter. - Yes, it doesn't matter
[02:20:28.100 --> 02:20:30.380]   what it is, because we could be, it could be slow,
[02:20:30.380 --> 02:20:34.460]   it's just a number which we use to convert that to seconds,
[02:20:34.460 --> 02:20:37.180]   so to speak, because we are experiencing things,
[02:20:37.180 --> 02:20:39.900]   and we say this amount of time has elapsed, so to speak.
[02:20:39.900 --> 02:20:42.420]   - But we're within this thing, so it doesn't--
[02:20:42.420 --> 02:20:43.700]   - It doesn't matter, right?
[02:20:43.700 --> 02:20:47.360]   But what does matter is the ratio, what we can,
[02:20:47.360 --> 02:20:51.020]   the ratio of the spatial distance in this hypergraph
[02:20:51.020 --> 02:20:55.860]   to this moment of time, again, that's an arbitrary thing,
[02:20:55.860 --> 02:20:58.780]   but we measure that in meters per second, for example,
[02:20:58.780 --> 02:21:00.940]   and that ratio is the speed of light.
[02:21:00.940 --> 02:21:03.220]   So the ratio of the elementary distance
[02:21:03.220 --> 02:21:06.700]   to the elementary time is the speed of light, okay?
[02:21:06.700 --> 02:21:08.300]   - Perfect. - And so there's another,
[02:21:08.300 --> 02:21:11.420]   there are two other levels of this, okay?
[02:21:11.420 --> 02:21:13.940]   So there is a thing which we can talk about,
[02:21:13.940 --> 02:21:16.580]   which is the maximum entanglement speed,
[02:21:16.580 --> 02:21:19.380]   which is a thing that happens at another level
[02:21:19.380 --> 02:21:20.980]   in this whole sort of story of how
[02:21:20.980 --> 02:21:22.900]   these things get constructed,
[02:21:22.900 --> 02:21:24.900]   that's a sort of maximum speed in quantum,
[02:21:24.900 --> 02:21:26.980]   in the space of quantum states,
[02:21:26.980 --> 02:21:28.900]   just as the speed of light is a maximum speed
[02:21:28.900 --> 02:21:31.100]   in physical space, this is a maximum speed
[02:21:31.100 --> 02:21:32.740]   in the space of quantum states,
[02:21:32.740 --> 02:21:35.040]   there's another level which is associated
[02:21:35.040 --> 02:21:36.620]   with what we call ruleal space,
[02:21:36.620 --> 02:21:39.160]   which is another one of these maximum speeds,
[02:21:39.160 --> 02:21:40.380]   we'll get to this.
[02:21:40.380 --> 02:21:42.140]   - So these are limitations on the system
[02:21:42.140 --> 02:21:45.300]   that are able to capture the kind of physical universe
[02:21:45.300 --> 02:21:47.060]   which we live in, the quantum mechanical--
[02:21:47.060 --> 02:21:51.820]   - They are inevitable features of having a rule
[02:21:51.820 --> 02:21:54.620]   that has only a finite amount of information in the rule.
[02:21:54.620 --> 02:21:57.300]   So long as you have a rule that only involves
[02:21:57.300 --> 02:22:01.580]   a bounded amount, a limited amount of,
[02:22:01.580 --> 02:22:03.260]   only involving a limited number of elements,
[02:22:03.260 --> 02:22:05.660]   limited number of relations, it is inevitable
[02:22:05.660 --> 02:22:07.300]   that there are these speed constraints.
[02:22:07.300 --> 02:22:08.820]   We knew about the one for speed of light,
[02:22:08.820 --> 02:22:11.440]   we didn't know about the one for maximum entanglement speed,
[02:22:11.440 --> 02:22:14.060]   which is actually something that is possibly measurable,
[02:22:14.060 --> 02:22:17.020]   particularly in black hole systems and things like this.
[02:22:17.020 --> 02:22:19.660]   But anyway, this is long story short,
[02:22:19.660 --> 02:22:22.340]   you're asking what the processing specs of the universe,
[02:22:22.340 --> 02:22:25.180]   of the sort of computation of the universe,
[02:22:25.180 --> 02:22:27.420]   there's a question of even what are the units
[02:22:27.420 --> 02:22:29.060]   of some of these measurements, okay?
[02:22:29.060 --> 02:22:31.460]   So the units I'm using are Wolfram language
[02:22:31.460 --> 02:22:33.340]   instructions per second, okay?
[02:22:33.340 --> 02:22:34.860]   Because you gotta have some, you know,
[02:22:34.860 --> 02:22:37.020]   what computation are you doing?
[02:22:37.020 --> 02:22:38.380]   - There gotta be some kind of frame of reference.
[02:22:38.380 --> 02:22:41.840]   - Right, right, so because it turns out in the end,
[02:22:41.840 --> 02:22:44.300]   there will be, there's sort of an arbitrariness
[02:22:44.300 --> 02:22:47.020]   in the language that you use to describe the universe.
[02:22:47.020 --> 02:22:51.660]   So in those terms, I think it's like 10 to the 500
[02:22:51.660 --> 02:22:54.380]   Wolfram language operations per second, I think,
[02:22:54.380 --> 02:22:56.580]   is the, I think it's of that order.
[02:22:56.580 --> 02:22:57.420]   You know, basically--
[02:22:57.420 --> 02:22:58.840]   - So that's the scale of the computation.
[02:22:58.840 --> 02:23:01.020]   What about memory, if there's an interesting thing
[02:23:01.020 --> 02:23:02.780]   to say about storage and memory?
[02:23:02.780 --> 02:23:04.420]   - Well, there's a question of how many sort of atoms
[02:23:04.420 --> 02:23:06.340]   of space might there be?
[02:23:06.340 --> 02:23:08.740]   You know, maybe 10 to the 400.
[02:23:08.740 --> 02:23:11.380]   We don't know exactly how to estimate these numbers.
[02:23:11.380 --> 02:23:14.740]   I mean, this is based on some, I would say,
[02:23:14.740 --> 02:23:17.260]   somewhat rickety way of estimating things.
[02:23:17.260 --> 02:23:20.300]   When there start to be able to be experiments done,
[02:23:20.300 --> 02:23:21.900]   if we're lucky, there will be experiments
[02:23:21.900 --> 02:23:24.220]   that can actually nail down some of these numbers.
[02:23:24.220 --> 02:23:27.980]   - And because of computation reducibility,
[02:23:27.980 --> 02:23:31.580]   there's not much hope for very efficient compression,
[02:23:31.580 --> 02:23:34.580]   like very efficient representation of this atom space?
[02:23:34.580 --> 02:23:35.740]   - Good question, good question.
[02:23:35.740 --> 02:23:38.020]   I mean, there's probably certain things, you know.
[02:23:38.020 --> 02:23:41.140]   The fact that we can deduce, okay,
[02:23:41.140 --> 02:23:44.540]   the question is how deep does the reducibility go?
[02:23:44.540 --> 02:23:45.380]   - Right. - Okay?
[02:23:45.380 --> 02:23:46.620]   And I keep on being surprised
[02:23:46.620 --> 02:23:48.860]   that it's a lot deeper than I thought, okay?
[02:23:48.860 --> 02:23:52.940]   And so one of the things is that there's a question
[02:23:52.940 --> 02:23:55.020]   of sort of how much of the whole of physics
[02:23:55.020 --> 02:23:57.520]   do we have to be able to get
[02:23:57.520 --> 02:23:59.340]   in order to explain certain kinds of phenomena?
[02:23:59.340 --> 02:24:02.880]   Like, for example, if we want to study quantum interference,
[02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:05.860]   do we have to know what an electron is?
[02:24:05.860 --> 02:24:08.540]   Turns out I thought we did, turns out we don't.
[02:24:08.540 --> 02:24:10.440]   I thought to know what energy is,
[02:24:10.440 --> 02:24:12.360]   we would have to know what electrons were.
[02:24:12.360 --> 02:24:13.200]   We don't.
[02:24:13.200 --> 02:24:15.580]   - So you can get a lot of really powerful shortcuts.
[02:24:15.580 --> 02:24:18.220]   - Right, there's a bunch of sort of bulk information
[02:24:18.220 --> 02:24:19.300]   about the world.
[02:24:19.300 --> 02:24:22.980]   The thing that I'm excited about last few days, okay,
[02:24:22.980 --> 02:24:26.660]   is the idea of fermions versus bosons,
[02:24:26.660 --> 02:24:28.060]   fundamental idea that, I mean,
[02:24:28.060 --> 02:24:29.860]   it's the reason we have matter
[02:24:29.860 --> 02:24:31.980]   that doesn't just self-destruct
[02:24:31.980 --> 02:24:33.860]   is because of the exclusion principle
[02:24:33.860 --> 02:24:35.840]   that means that two electrons
[02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:38.300]   can never be in the same quantum state.
[02:24:38.300 --> 02:24:41.920]   - Is it useful for us to maybe first talk about
[02:24:41.920 --> 02:24:46.520]   how quantum mechanics fits into the Wolfram physics model?
[02:24:46.520 --> 02:24:47.480]   - Yes. - Let's go there.
[02:24:47.480 --> 02:24:49.720]   So we talked about general relativity.
[02:24:49.720 --> 02:24:54.720]   Now, what have you found from quantum mechanics?
[02:24:54.720 --> 02:24:56.640]   - What's the story of quantum mechanics?
[02:24:56.640 --> 02:24:57.480]   Right.
[02:24:57.480 --> 02:24:59.960]   - Within and outside of the Wolfram physics.
[02:24:59.960 --> 02:25:04.220]   - Right, so I mean, the key idea of quantum mechanics,
[02:25:04.220 --> 02:25:06.880]   that sort of the typical interpretation is
[02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:09.920]   classical physics says a definite thing happens.
[02:25:09.920 --> 02:25:12.860]   Quantum physics says there's this whole set of paths
[02:25:12.860 --> 02:25:14.560]   of things that might happen,
[02:25:14.560 --> 02:25:17.440]   and we are just observing some overall probability
[02:25:17.440 --> 02:25:19.640]   of how those paths work.
[02:25:19.640 --> 02:25:22.440]   Okay, so when you think about our hypergraphs
[02:25:22.440 --> 02:25:24.640]   and all these little updates that are going on,
[02:25:24.640 --> 02:25:26.960]   there's a very remarkable thing to realize,
[02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:28.960]   which is if you say,
[02:25:28.960 --> 02:25:32.320]   well, which particular sequence of updates should you do?
[02:25:32.320 --> 02:25:33.720]   Say, well, it's not really defined.
[02:25:33.720 --> 02:25:35.360]   You can do any of a whole collection
[02:25:35.360 --> 02:25:37.400]   of possible sequences of updates.
[02:25:37.400 --> 02:25:41.960]   Okay, that set of possible sequences of updates
[02:25:41.960 --> 02:25:44.220]   defines yet another kind of graph
[02:25:44.220 --> 02:25:46.080]   that we call a multi-way graph.
[02:25:46.080 --> 02:25:48.640]   And a multi-way graph just is a graph
[02:25:48.640 --> 02:25:50.840]   where at every node,
[02:25:50.840 --> 02:25:54.160]   there is a choice of several different possible things
[02:25:54.160 --> 02:25:55.280]   that could happen.
[02:25:55.280 --> 02:25:57.680]   So for example, you go this way, you go that way,
[02:25:57.680 --> 02:26:00.880]   those are two different edges in the multi-way graph,
[02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:02.600]   and you're building up the set of possibilities.
[02:26:02.600 --> 02:26:04.840]   So actually, like for example, I just made the one,
[02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:07.360]   the multi-way graph for tic-tac-toe, okay?
[02:26:07.360 --> 02:26:10.960]   So tic-tac-toe, you start off with some board
[02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:12.240]   that, you know, everything is blank,
[02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:15.200]   and then somebody can put down an X somewhere,
[02:26:15.200 --> 02:26:16.760]   an O somewhere,
[02:26:16.760 --> 02:26:18.160]   and then there are different possibilities.
[02:26:18.160 --> 02:26:20.280]   At each stage, there are different possibilities.
[02:26:20.280 --> 02:26:22.720]   And so you build up this multi-way graph
[02:26:22.720 --> 02:26:23.720]   of all those possibilities.
[02:26:23.720 --> 02:26:25.920]   Now, notice that even in tic-tac-toe,
[02:26:25.920 --> 02:26:28.120]   you have the feature that there can be something
[02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:30.960]   where you have two different things that happen,
[02:26:30.960 --> 02:26:33.360]   and then those branches merge
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:35.200]   because you end up with the same shape,
[02:26:35.200 --> 02:26:37.360]   you know, the same configuration of the board,
[02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:39.920]   even though you got there in two different ways.
[02:26:39.920 --> 02:26:42.760]   So the thing that's sort of an inevitable feature
[02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:47.320]   of our models is that just like quantum mechanics suggests,
[02:26:47.320 --> 02:26:48.800]   definite things don't happen.
[02:26:48.800 --> 02:26:50.800]   Instead, you get this whole multi-way graph
[02:26:50.800 --> 02:26:52.720]   of all these possibilities.
[02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:54.600]   Okay, so then the question is,
[02:26:54.600 --> 02:26:58.280]   so, okay, so that's sort of a picture of what's going on.
[02:26:58.280 --> 02:27:00.480]   Now you say, okay, well, quantum mechanics
[02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:02.680]   has all these features of, you know,
[02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:04.840]   all this mathematical structure and so on.
[02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:07.120]   How do you get that mathematical structure?
[02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:08.800]   Okay, a couple of things to say.
[02:27:08.800 --> 02:27:11.600]   So quantum mechanics is actually, in a sense,
[02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:13.920]   two different theories glued together.
[02:27:13.920 --> 02:27:15.600]   Quantum mechanics is the theory
[02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:18.080]   of how quantum amplitudes work
[02:27:18.080 --> 02:27:19.400]   that more or less give you the probabilities
[02:27:19.400 --> 02:27:20.680]   of things happening.
[02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:22.760]   And it's the theory of quantum measurement,
[02:27:22.760 --> 02:27:25.160]   which is the theory of how we actually
[02:27:25.160 --> 02:27:26.960]   conclude definite things,
[02:27:26.960 --> 02:27:29.040]   because the mathematics just gives you
[02:27:29.040 --> 02:27:30.000]   these quantum amplitudes,
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.440]   which are more or less probabilities of things happening,
[02:27:32.440 --> 02:27:35.840]   but yet we actually observe definite things in the world.
[02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:39.080]   Quantum measurement has always been a bit mysterious.
[02:27:39.080 --> 02:27:41.120]   It's always been something where people just say,
[02:27:41.120 --> 02:27:42.360]   well, the mathematics says this,
[02:27:42.360 --> 02:27:43.440]   but then you do a measurement
[02:27:43.440 --> 02:27:45.080]   and there are philosophical arguments
[02:27:45.080 --> 02:27:46.600]   about what the measurement is.
[02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:48.760]   But it's not something where there's a theory
[02:27:48.760 --> 02:27:49.680]   of the measurement.
[02:27:49.680 --> 02:27:52.080]   - Somebody on Reddit also asked,
[02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:56.800]   please ask Stephen to tell his story
[02:27:56.800 --> 02:27:59.800]   of the double slit experiment.
[02:27:59.800 --> 02:28:01.160]   - Okay, yeah, I can.
[02:28:01.160 --> 02:28:02.880]   - Does that make sense?
[02:28:02.880 --> 02:28:03.960]   - Oh yeah, it makes sense.
[02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:05.000]   Absolutely makes sense.
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.760]   - Why, is this like a good way to discuss?
[02:28:07.760 --> 02:28:08.600]   - A little bit.
[02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:10.560]   Let me explain a couple of things first.
[02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:13.840]   So the structure of quantum mechanics
[02:28:13.840 --> 02:28:16.240]   is mathematically quite complicated.
[02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:18.600]   One of the features, let's see,
[02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:20.520]   well, how to describe this.
[02:28:20.520 --> 02:28:23.800]   Okay, so first point is there's this multi-way graph
[02:28:23.800 --> 02:28:25.840]   of all these different paths
[02:28:25.840 --> 02:28:28.760]   of things that can happen in the world.
[02:28:28.760 --> 02:28:32.640]   And the important point is that these,
[02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:35.600]   you can have branchings and you can have mergings.
[02:28:35.600 --> 02:28:39.680]   Okay, so this property turns out causal invariance
[02:28:39.680 --> 02:28:43.360]   is the statement that the number of mergings
[02:28:43.360 --> 02:28:45.800]   is equal to the number of branchings.
[02:28:45.800 --> 02:28:48.720]   So in other words, every time there's a branch,
[02:28:48.720 --> 02:28:50.640]   eventually there will also be a merge.
[02:28:50.640 --> 02:28:52.600]   In other words, every time there were two possibilities
[02:28:52.600 --> 02:28:55.120]   for what might've happened, eventually those will merge.
[02:28:55.120 --> 02:28:56.240]   - Beautiful concept, by the way.
[02:28:56.240 --> 02:28:57.400]   But yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:28:57.400 --> 02:29:00.080]   - So that idea, okay.
[02:29:00.080 --> 02:29:03.880]   So then, so that's one thing,
[02:29:03.880 --> 02:29:07.680]   and that's closely related to the sort of objectivity
[02:29:07.680 --> 02:29:08.520]   in quantum mechanics.
[02:29:08.520 --> 02:29:10.680]   The fact that we believe definite things happen,
[02:29:10.680 --> 02:29:13.160]   it's because although there are all these different paths,
[02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:15.560]   in some sense, because of causal invariance,
[02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:17.640]   they all imply the same thing.
[02:29:17.640 --> 02:29:19.360]   I'm cheating a little bit in saying that,
[02:29:19.360 --> 02:29:22.080]   but that's roughly the essence of what's going on.
[02:29:22.080 --> 02:29:25.080]   Okay, next thing to think about is
[02:29:26.080 --> 02:29:27.400]   we have this multi-way graph.
[02:29:27.400 --> 02:29:28.840]   It has all these different possible things
[02:29:28.840 --> 02:29:30.040]   that are happening.
[02:29:30.040 --> 02:29:32.440]   Now we ask, this multi-way graph
[02:29:32.440 --> 02:29:34.120]   is sort of evolving with time.
[02:29:34.120 --> 02:29:36.680]   Over time, it's branching, it's merging,
[02:29:36.680 --> 02:29:38.400]   it's doing all these things, okay?
[02:29:38.400 --> 02:29:41.280]   Question we can ask is,
[02:29:41.280 --> 02:29:46.120]   if we slice it at a particular time, what do we see?
[02:29:46.120 --> 02:29:48.840]   And that slice represents, in a sense,
[02:29:48.840 --> 02:29:51.240]   something to do with the state of the universe
[02:29:51.240 --> 02:29:53.080]   at a particular time.
[02:29:53.080 --> 02:29:55.120]   So in other words, we've got this multi-way graph
[02:29:55.120 --> 02:29:56.680]   of all these possibilities,
[02:29:56.680 --> 02:30:01.320]   and then we're asking, okay, we take this slice.
[02:30:01.320 --> 02:30:04.440]   This slice represents, okay,
[02:30:04.440 --> 02:30:06.120]   each of these different paths corresponds
[02:30:06.120 --> 02:30:09.360]   to a different quantum possibility for what's happening.
[02:30:09.360 --> 02:30:11.440]   When we take the slice, we're saying,
[02:30:11.440 --> 02:30:13.120]   what are the set of quantum possibilities
[02:30:13.120 --> 02:30:14.960]   that exist at a particular time?
[02:30:14.960 --> 02:30:17.680]   - And when you say slice, you slice the graph,
[02:30:17.680 --> 02:30:19.720]   and then there's a bunch of leaves.
[02:30:19.720 --> 02:30:20.560]   - A bunch of leaves.
[02:30:20.560 --> 02:30:23.520]   - And those represent the state of things.
[02:30:23.520 --> 02:30:26.320]   - Right, but then, okay, so the important thing
[02:30:26.320 --> 02:30:29.120]   that you are quickly picking up on
[02:30:29.120 --> 02:30:32.880]   is that what matters is kind of how these leaves
[02:30:32.880 --> 02:30:34.680]   are related to each other.
[02:30:34.680 --> 02:30:37.640]   So a good way to tell how leaves are related
[02:30:37.640 --> 02:30:40.000]   is just to say, on the step before,
[02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.240]   did they have a common ancestor?
[02:30:42.240 --> 02:30:44.040]   So two leaves might be,
[02:30:44.040 --> 02:30:45.880]   they might have just branched from one thing,
[02:30:45.880 --> 02:30:50.800]   or they might be far away, way far apart in this graph,
[02:30:50.800 --> 02:30:52.360]   where to get to a common ancestor,
[02:30:52.360 --> 02:30:53.480]   maybe you have to go all the way back
[02:30:53.480 --> 02:30:54.320]   to the beginning of the graph,
[02:30:54.320 --> 02:30:55.160]   all the way back to the beginning of the--
[02:30:55.160 --> 02:30:57.240]   - So there's some kind of measure of distance.
[02:30:57.240 --> 02:31:01.640]   - Right, but what you get is by making the slice,
[02:31:01.640 --> 02:31:05.960]   we call it branchial space, the space of branches.
[02:31:05.960 --> 02:31:09.760]   And in this branchial space, you have a graph
[02:31:09.760 --> 02:31:11.320]   that represents the relationships
[02:31:11.320 --> 02:31:14.720]   between these quantum states in branchial space.
[02:31:14.720 --> 02:31:18.080]   You have this notion of distance in branchial space.
[02:31:18.080 --> 02:31:18.920]   Okay, so--
[02:31:18.920 --> 02:31:20.960]   - It's connected to quantum entanglement?
[02:31:20.960 --> 02:31:21.960]   - Yes, yes.
[02:31:21.960 --> 02:31:25.640]   It's basically, the distance in branchial space
[02:31:25.640 --> 02:31:27.880]   is kind of an entanglement distance.
[02:31:27.880 --> 02:31:28.720]   So this--
[02:31:28.720 --> 02:31:29.920]   - That's a very nice model.
[02:31:29.920 --> 02:31:31.280]   - Right, it is very nice.
[02:31:31.280 --> 02:31:32.400]   It's very beautiful.
[02:31:32.400 --> 02:31:35.560]   I mean, it's so clean.
[02:31:35.560 --> 02:31:38.960]   I mean, it's really, you know, and it tells one,
[02:31:38.960 --> 02:31:42.840]   okay, so anyway, so then this branchial space
[02:31:42.840 --> 02:31:46.120]   has this sort of map of the entanglements
[02:31:46.120 --> 02:31:47.760]   between quantum states.
[02:31:47.760 --> 02:31:50.360]   So in physical space, we have,
[02:31:50.360 --> 02:31:54.720]   so you know, you can say, take, let's say the causal graph,
[02:31:54.720 --> 02:31:57.840]   and we can slice that at a particular time,
[02:31:57.840 --> 02:31:59.800]   and then we get this map of how things are laid out
[02:31:59.800 --> 02:32:01.440]   in physical space.
[02:32:01.440 --> 02:32:02.760]   When we do the same kind of thing,
[02:32:02.760 --> 02:32:04.880]   there's a thing called the multi-way causal graph,
[02:32:04.880 --> 02:32:06.400]   which is the analog of a causal graph
[02:32:06.400 --> 02:32:07.800]   for the multi-way system.
[02:32:07.800 --> 02:32:11.400]   We slice that, we get essentially the relationships
[02:32:11.400 --> 02:32:13.760]   between things, not in physical space,
[02:32:13.760 --> 02:32:15.760]   but in the space of quantum states.
[02:32:15.760 --> 02:32:17.480]   It's like which quantum state is similar
[02:32:17.480 --> 02:32:19.400]   to which other quantum state.
[02:32:19.400 --> 02:32:22.320]   Okay, so now I think next thing to say
[02:32:22.320 --> 02:32:24.840]   is just to mention how quantum measurement works.
[02:32:24.840 --> 02:32:27.600]   So quantum measurement has to do with reference frames
[02:32:27.600 --> 02:32:29.760]   in branchial space.
[02:32:29.760 --> 02:32:33.760]   So, okay, so measurement in physical space,
[02:32:33.760 --> 02:32:38.760]   it matters whether how we assign spatial position
[02:32:38.760 --> 02:32:42.680]   and how we define coordinates in space and time.
[02:32:42.680 --> 02:32:45.520]   And that's how we make measurements in ordinary space.
[02:32:45.520 --> 02:32:46.560]   So we're making a measurement
[02:32:46.560 --> 02:32:48.400]   based on us sitting still here,
[02:32:48.400 --> 02:32:50.040]   are we traveling at half the speed of light
[02:32:50.040 --> 02:32:51.760]   and making measurements that way?
[02:32:51.760 --> 02:32:53.240]   These are different reference frames
[02:32:53.240 --> 02:32:54.920]   in which we're making our measurements.
[02:32:54.920 --> 02:32:57.960]   And the relationship between different events
[02:32:57.960 --> 02:32:59.880]   and different points in space and time
[02:32:59.880 --> 02:33:03.640]   will be different depending on what reference frame
[02:33:03.640 --> 02:33:04.480]   we're in.
[02:33:04.480 --> 02:33:06.640]   Okay, so then we have this idea
[02:33:06.640 --> 02:33:09.000]   of quantum observation frames,
[02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.200]   which are the analog of reference frames,
[02:33:11.200 --> 02:33:13.160]   but in branchial space.
[02:33:13.160 --> 02:33:16.040]   And so what happens is what we realize
[02:33:16.040 --> 02:33:18.600]   is that a quantum measurement is,
[02:33:18.600 --> 02:33:21.760]   the observer is sort of arbitrarily determining
[02:33:21.760 --> 02:33:23.160]   this reference frame.
[02:33:23.160 --> 02:33:24.120]   The observer is saying,
[02:33:24.120 --> 02:33:27.000]   I'm going to understand the world
[02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:30.720]   by saying that space and time are coordinatized this way.
[02:33:30.720 --> 02:33:32.760]   I'm gonna understand the world by saying
[02:33:32.760 --> 02:33:36.680]   that quantum states and time are coordinatized in this way.
[02:33:36.680 --> 02:33:39.080]   And essentially what happens is that,
[02:33:39.080 --> 02:33:41.080]   you know, the process of quantum measurement
[02:33:41.080 --> 02:33:45.080]   is a process of deciding how you slice up
[02:33:45.080 --> 02:33:48.760]   this multi-way system in these quantum observation frames.
[02:33:48.760 --> 02:33:50.320]   So in a sense, the observer,
[02:33:50.320 --> 02:33:51.960]   the way the observer enters
[02:33:51.960 --> 02:33:55.800]   is by their choice of these quantum observation frames.
[02:33:55.800 --> 02:33:59.080]   And what happens is that the observer,
[02:33:59.080 --> 02:34:00.680]   because, okay, this is again,
[02:34:00.680 --> 02:34:02.600]   another stack of other concepts,
[02:34:02.600 --> 02:34:06.380]   but anyway, because the observer is computationally bounded,
[02:34:06.380 --> 02:34:09.040]   there is a limit to the type of quantum observation frames
[02:34:09.040 --> 02:34:10.160]   that they can construct.
[02:34:10.160 --> 02:34:11.000]   - Interesting, okay.
[02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:12.760]   So there's, okay, so there's some constraints,
[02:34:12.760 --> 02:34:13.760]   some limit on-
[02:34:14.720 --> 02:34:17.960]   - On the choice of observation frames.
[02:34:17.960 --> 02:34:18.800]   - Right, and by the way,
[02:34:18.800 --> 02:34:20.960]   I just want to mention that there's a,
[02:34:20.960 --> 02:34:22.040]   I mean, it's bizarre,
[02:34:22.040 --> 02:34:23.840]   but there's a hierarchy of these things.
[02:34:23.840 --> 02:34:27.600]   So in thermodynamics,
[02:34:27.600 --> 02:34:29.780]   the fact that we believe entropy increases,
[02:34:29.780 --> 02:34:31.680]   we believe things get more disordered
[02:34:31.680 --> 02:34:32.680]   is a consequence of the fact
[02:34:32.680 --> 02:34:34.440]   that we can't track each individual molecule.
[02:34:34.440 --> 02:34:36.360]   If we could track every single molecule,
[02:34:36.360 --> 02:34:38.440]   we could run every movie in reverse, so to speak,
[02:34:38.440 --> 02:34:39.560]   and we would, you know,
[02:34:39.560 --> 02:34:42.400]   that we would not see that things are getting more disordered
[02:34:42.400 --> 02:34:44.960]   but it's because we are computationally bounded.
[02:34:44.960 --> 02:34:46.920]   We can only look at these big blobs
[02:34:46.920 --> 02:34:49.720]   of what all these molecules collectively do
[02:34:49.720 --> 02:34:52.440]   that we think that things are,
[02:34:52.440 --> 02:34:55.960]   that we describe it in terms of entropy increasing and so on.
[02:34:55.960 --> 02:34:58.720]   And it's the same phenomenon, basically,
[02:34:58.720 --> 02:35:01.560]   also a consequence of computational irreducibility
[02:35:01.560 --> 02:35:04.840]   that causes us to basically be forced to conclude
[02:35:04.840 --> 02:35:06.940]   that definite things happen in the world,
[02:35:06.940 --> 02:35:08.720]   even though there's this quantum, you know,
[02:35:08.720 --> 02:35:10.700]   this set of all these different quantum processes
[02:35:10.700 --> 02:35:11.900]   that are going on.
[02:35:11.900 --> 02:35:15.440]   So, I mean, I'm skipping a little bit,
[02:35:15.440 --> 02:35:18.600]   but that's a rough picture.
[02:35:18.600 --> 02:35:21.920]   - And in the evolution of the Wolfram Physics Project,
[02:35:21.920 --> 02:35:24.320]   where do you feel you stand on some of the puzzles
[02:35:24.320 --> 02:35:25.160]   that are along the way?
[02:35:25.160 --> 02:35:27.040]   See, you're skipping along a bunch of,
[02:35:27.040 --> 02:35:27.880]   you're skipping a bunch of stuff.
[02:35:27.880 --> 02:35:30.480]   - Oh, it's amazing how much these things are unraveling.
[02:35:30.480 --> 02:35:31.940]   I mean, you know, these things,
[02:35:31.940 --> 02:35:33.560]   look, it used to be the case
[02:35:33.560 --> 02:35:35.680]   that I would agree with Dick Feynman,
[02:35:35.680 --> 02:35:38.860]   nobody understands quantum mechanics, including me, okay?
[02:35:38.860 --> 02:35:39.760]   I'm getting to the point
[02:35:39.760 --> 02:35:41.580]   where I think I actually understand quantum mechanics.
[02:35:41.580 --> 02:35:45.760]   My exercise, okay, is can I explain quantum mechanics
[02:35:45.760 --> 02:35:48.800]   for real at the level of kind of middle school
[02:35:48.800 --> 02:35:50.320]   type explanation?
[02:35:50.320 --> 02:35:52.620]   And I'm getting closer, it's getting there.
[02:35:52.620 --> 02:35:54.960]   I'm not quite there, I've tried it a few times,
[02:35:54.960 --> 02:35:56.360]   and I realized that there are things
[02:35:56.360 --> 02:35:58.920]   that where I have to start talking
[02:35:58.920 --> 02:36:00.900]   about elaborate mathematical concepts and so on.
[02:36:00.900 --> 02:36:03.000]   But I think, and you've got to realize
[02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.840]   that it's not self-evident that we can explain,
[02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:09.240]   you know, at an intuitively graspable level,
[02:36:09.240 --> 02:36:11.140]   something which, you know,
[02:36:11.140 --> 02:36:12.380]   about the way the universe works.
[02:36:12.380 --> 02:36:14.760]   The universe wasn't built for our understanding,
[02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:16.280]   so to speak.
[02:36:16.280 --> 02:36:21.280]   But I think then, okay, so another important idea
[02:36:21.280 --> 02:36:25.280]   is this idea of branchial space, which I mentioned,
[02:36:25.280 --> 02:36:27.420]   this sort of space of quantum states.
[02:36:27.420 --> 02:36:31.260]   It is, okay, so I mentioned Einstein's equations
[02:36:31.260 --> 02:36:36.260]   describing, you know, the effect of mass and energy
[02:36:37.400 --> 02:36:40.840]   on trajectories of particles, on geodesics.
[02:36:40.840 --> 02:36:44.900]   The curvature of physical space is associated
[02:36:44.900 --> 02:36:47.040]   with the presence of energy,
[02:36:47.040 --> 02:36:49.400]   according to Einstein's equations, okay?
[02:36:49.400 --> 02:36:51.920]   So it turns out that, rather amazingly,
[02:36:51.920 --> 02:36:54.880]   the same thing is true in branchial space.
[02:36:54.880 --> 02:36:57.360]   So it turns out the presence of energy,
[02:36:57.360 --> 02:36:59.420]   or more accurately, Lagrangian density,
[02:36:59.420 --> 02:37:00.920]   which is a kind of relativistic,
[02:37:00.920 --> 02:37:03.200]   invariant version of energy,
[02:37:03.200 --> 02:37:06.320]   the presence of that causes, essentially,
[02:37:06.320 --> 02:37:11.160]   deflection of geodesics in this branchial space, okay?
[02:37:11.160 --> 02:37:12.560]   So you might say, so what?
[02:37:12.560 --> 02:37:16.000]   Well, it turns out that the sort of,
[02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.800]   the best formulation we have of quantum mechanics,
[02:37:18.800 --> 02:37:21.360]   this Feynman path integral,
[02:37:21.360 --> 02:37:26.200]   is a thing that describes quantum processes
[02:37:26.200 --> 02:37:31.200]   in terms of mathematics that can be interpreted as,
[02:37:31.200 --> 02:37:33.880]   well, in quantum mechanics, the big thing
[02:37:33.880 --> 02:37:35.360]   is you get these quantum amplitudes,
[02:37:35.360 --> 02:37:38.320]   which are complex numbers that represent,
[02:37:38.320 --> 02:37:39.400]   when you combine them together,
[02:37:39.400 --> 02:37:41.560]   represent probabilities of things happening.
[02:37:41.560 --> 02:37:42.840]   And so the big story has been,
[02:37:42.840 --> 02:37:45.320]   how do you derive these quantum amplitudes?
[02:37:45.320 --> 02:37:47.500]   And people think these quantum amplitudes,
[02:37:47.500 --> 02:37:49.160]   they have a complex number,
[02:37:49.160 --> 02:37:51.200]   has a real part and an imaginary part.
[02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:53.920]   You can also think of it as a magnitude and a phase.
[02:37:53.920 --> 02:37:58.160]   And people have sort of thought these quantum amplitudes
[02:37:58.160 --> 02:38:01.000]   have magnitude and phase, and you compute those together.
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:04.560]   Turns out that the magnitude and the phase
[02:38:04.560 --> 02:38:07.000]   come from completely different places.
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:10.240]   The magnitude comes, okay, so what do you,
[02:38:10.240 --> 02:38:11.680]   how do you compute things in quantum mechanics?
[02:38:11.680 --> 02:38:14.280]   Roughly, I'm telling you, I'm getting there
[02:38:14.280 --> 02:38:15.960]   to be able to do this at a middle school level,
[02:38:15.960 --> 02:38:17.160]   but I'm not there yet.
[02:38:17.160 --> 02:38:21.400]   Roughly what happens is you're asking,
[02:38:21.400 --> 02:38:24.960]   does this state in quantum mechanics
[02:38:24.960 --> 02:38:27.800]   evolve to this other state in quantum mechanics?
[02:38:27.800 --> 02:38:31.340]   And you can think about that like a particle traveling
[02:38:31.340 --> 02:38:33.960]   or something traveling through physical space,
[02:38:33.960 --> 02:38:36.860]   but instead it's traveling through branchial space.
[02:38:36.860 --> 02:38:37.940]   And so what's happening is,
[02:38:37.940 --> 02:38:40.680]   does this quantum state evolve to this other quantum state?
[02:38:40.680 --> 02:38:42.880]   It's like saying, does this object move
[02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:45.920]   from this place in space to this other place in space?
[02:38:45.920 --> 02:38:48.440]   Okay, now the way that you,
[02:38:48.440 --> 02:38:52.740]   these quantum amplitudes characterize kind of
[02:38:52.740 --> 02:38:55.560]   to what extent the thing will successfully reach
[02:38:55.560 --> 02:38:57.240]   some particular point in branchial space.
[02:38:57.240 --> 02:38:59.000]   Just like in physical space, you could say,
[02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:02.440]   oh, it had a certain velocity and it went in this direction.
[02:39:02.440 --> 02:39:05.200]   In branchial space, there's a similar kind of concept.
[02:39:05.200 --> 02:39:07.760]   - Is there a nice way to visualize,
[02:39:07.760 --> 02:39:10.600]   for me now, mentally branchial space?
[02:39:10.600 --> 02:39:13.760]   - It's just, you have this hypergraph,
[02:39:13.760 --> 02:39:15.760]   sorry, you have this multi-way graph.
[02:39:15.760 --> 02:39:18.480]   It's this big branching thing, branching and merging thing.
[02:39:18.480 --> 02:39:21.840]   - But I mean, like moving through that space.
[02:39:21.840 --> 02:39:24.400]   I'm just trying to understand what that looks like.
[02:39:24.400 --> 02:39:26.000]   (both laugh)
[02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:29.360]   - You know, that space is probably exponential dimensional,
[02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:32.360]   which makes it, again, another can of worms
[02:39:32.360 --> 02:39:33.960]   in understanding what's going on.
[02:39:33.960 --> 02:39:37.760]   That space, as in ordinary space, this hypergraph,
[02:39:37.760 --> 02:39:40.200]   the spatial hypergraph, limits to something
[02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:42.680]   which is like a manifold,
[02:39:42.680 --> 02:39:45.080]   like something like three-dimensional space.
[02:39:45.080 --> 02:39:48.760]   Almost certainly, the multi-way graph limits
[02:39:48.760 --> 02:39:52.400]   to a Hilbert space, which is something that,
[02:39:52.400 --> 02:39:55.600]   I mean, it's just a weird exponential dimensional space.
[02:39:55.600 --> 02:39:57.240]   And by the way, you can ask,
[02:39:57.240 --> 02:39:58.920]   I mean, there are much weirder things that go on.
[02:39:58.920 --> 02:40:00.760]   For example, one of the things I've been interested in
[02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:03.960]   is the expansion of the universe in branchial space.
[02:40:03.960 --> 02:40:07.120]   So we know the universe is expanding in physical space,
[02:40:07.120 --> 02:40:09.240]   but the universe is probably also expanding
[02:40:09.240 --> 02:40:10.960]   in branchial space. - Expanding in branchial space.
[02:40:10.960 --> 02:40:13.320]   - So that means the number of quantum states
[02:40:13.320 --> 02:40:15.800]   of the universe is increasing with time.
[02:40:15.800 --> 02:40:17.920]   - The diameter of the thing is growing.
[02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:20.720]   - Right, so that means that the, and by the way,
[02:40:20.720 --> 02:40:25.120]   this is related to whether quantum computing can ever work.
[02:40:25.120 --> 02:40:28.960]   And-- - Why?
[02:40:28.960 --> 02:40:30.000]   - Okay, so let me explain why.
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:33.120]   So let's talk about, okay, so first of all,
[02:40:33.120 --> 02:40:35.360]   just to finish the thought about quantum amplitudes,
[02:40:35.360 --> 02:40:37.360]   the incredibly beautiful thing,
[02:40:37.360 --> 02:40:40.760]   but I'm just very excited about this.
[02:40:40.760 --> 02:40:44.720]   The Feynman path integral is this formula.
[02:40:44.720 --> 02:40:47.440]   It says that the amplitude, the quantum amplitude
[02:40:47.440 --> 02:40:49.560]   is e to the i s over h bar,
[02:40:49.560 --> 02:40:51.640]   where s is this thing called the action.
[02:40:51.640 --> 02:40:55.800]   And it, okay, so that can be thought of
[02:40:55.800 --> 02:40:59.320]   as representing a deflection of the angle
[02:40:59.320 --> 02:41:02.240]   of this path in the multi-way graph.
[02:41:02.240 --> 02:41:05.080]   So it's a deflection of a geodesic in the multi-way path
[02:41:05.080 --> 02:41:07.000]   that is caused by this thing called the action,
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:10.080]   which is essentially associated with the energy, okay?
[02:41:10.080 --> 02:41:13.800]   And so this is a deflection of a path in branchial space
[02:41:13.800 --> 02:41:15.560]   that is described by this path integral,
[02:41:15.560 --> 02:41:17.800]   which is the thing that is the mathematical essence
[02:41:17.800 --> 02:41:19.480]   of quantum mechanics.
[02:41:19.480 --> 02:41:22.800]   Turns out that deflection is,
[02:41:22.800 --> 02:41:25.280]   the deflection of geodesics in branchial space
[02:41:25.280 --> 02:41:28.760]   follows the exact same mathematical setup
[02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:31.920]   as the deflection of geodesics in physical space,
[02:41:31.920 --> 02:41:34.280]   except the deflection of geodesics in physical space
[02:41:34.280 --> 02:41:36.520]   is described with Einstein's equations.
[02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:38.640]   The deflection of geodesics in branchial space
[02:41:38.640 --> 02:41:40.920]   is defined by the Feynman path integral,
[02:41:40.920 --> 02:41:42.840]   and they are the same.
[02:41:42.840 --> 02:41:45.800]   In other words, they are mathematically the same.
[02:41:45.800 --> 02:41:48.400]   So that means that general relativity
[02:41:48.400 --> 02:41:53.240]   is a story of essentially motion in physical space.
[02:41:53.240 --> 02:41:55.560]   Quantum mechanics is a story of essentially motion
[02:41:55.560 --> 02:41:57.360]   in branchial space.
[02:41:57.360 --> 02:42:01.360]   And the underlying equation for those two things,
[02:42:01.360 --> 02:42:02.560]   although it's presented differently
[02:42:02.560 --> 02:42:04.160]   because one's interested in different things
[02:42:04.160 --> 02:42:06.120]   in branchial space than physical space,
[02:42:06.120 --> 02:42:08.720]   but the underlying equation is the same.
[02:42:08.720 --> 02:42:12.480]   So in other words, it's just, you know,
[02:42:12.480 --> 02:42:13.440]   these two theories,
[02:42:13.440 --> 02:42:16.360]   which are those two sort of pillars of 20th century physics,
[02:42:16.360 --> 02:42:19.120]   which have seemed to be off in different directions
[02:42:19.120 --> 02:42:21.780]   are actually facets of the exact same theory.
[02:42:21.780 --> 02:42:24.240]   And this, I mean--
[02:42:24.240 --> 02:42:27.000]   - That's exciting to see where that evolves,
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.160]   and exciting that that just is there.
[02:42:29.160 --> 02:42:31.040]   - Right, I mean, to me, you know,
[02:42:31.040 --> 02:42:34.240]   look, having spent some part of my early life,
[02:42:34.240 --> 02:42:36.800]   you know, working in the context of these theories
[02:42:36.800 --> 02:42:39.400]   of, you know, 20th century physics,
[02:42:39.400 --> 02:42:41.960]   it's, they just, they seem so different.
[02:42:41.960 --> 02:42:44.080]   And the fact that they're really the same
[02:42:44.080 --> 02:42:46.480]   is just really amazing.
[02:42:46.480 --> 02:42:49.120]   Actually, you mentioned double-slit experiment, okay?
[02:42:49.120 --> 02:42:50.280]   So the double-slit experiment
[02:42:50.280 --> 02:42:54.040]   is an interference phenomenon where you say there are,
[02:42:54.040 --> 02:42:56.600]   you know, you can have a photon or an electron,
[02:42:56.600 --> 02:42:58.240]   and you say there are these two slits,
[02:42:58.240 --> 02:43:00.320]   it could have gone through either one,
[02:43:00.320 --> 02:43:02.560]   but there is this interference pattern
[02:43:02.560 --> 02:43:05.080]   where there's destructive interference,
[02:43:05.080 --> 02:43:07.160]   where you might've said in classical physics,
[02:43:07.160 --> 02:43:09.000]   oh, well, if there are two slits,
[02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:10.440]   then there's a better chance
[02:43:10.440 --> 02:43:12.120]   that it gets through one or the other of them.
[02:43:12.120 --> 02:43:13.240]   But in quantum mechanics,
[02:43:13.240 --> 02:43:15.720]   there's this phenomenon of destructive interference
[02:43:15.720 --> 02:43:18.140]   that means that even though there are two slits,
[02:43:18.140 --> 02:43:20.240]   two can lead to nothing,
[02:43:20.240 --> 02:43:23.640]   as opposed to two leading to more than,
[02:43:23.640 --> 02:43:25.240]   for example, one slit.
[02:43:25.240 --> 02:43:27.480]   And what happens in this model,
[02:43:27.480 --> 02:43:29.040]   and we've just been understanding this
[02:43:29.040 --> 02:43:30.780]   in the last few weeks, actually,
[02:43:30.780 --> 02:43:34.400]   is that the, what essentially happens
[02:43:34.400 --> 02:43:38.040]   is that the double-slit experiment
[02:43:38.040 --> 02:43:39.400]   is a story of the interface
[02:43:39.400 --> 02:43:41.960]   between branchial space and physical space.
[02:43:41.960 --> 02:43:43.720]   And what's essentially happening is
[02:43:43.720 --> 02:43:45.520]   that the destructive interference
[02:43:45.520 --> 02:43:48.520]   is the result of the two possible paths
[02:43:48.520 --> 02:43:51.200]   associated with photons going through those two slits,
[02:43:51.200 --> 02:43:54.160]   winding up at opposite ends of branchial space.
[02:43:54.160 --> 02:43:56.000]   And so they don't, and so that's why
[02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.480]   there's sort of nothing there when you look at it,
[02:43:58.480 --> 02:44:02.160]   is because these two different sort of branches
[02:44:02.160 --> 02:44:05.160]   couldn't get merged together to produce something
[02:44:05.160 --> 02:44:07.720]   that you can measure in physical space.
[02:44:07.720 --> 02:44:10.720]   - Is there a lot to be understood about branchial space?
[02:44:10.720 --> 02:44:13.960]   I guess, mathematically speaking.
[02:44:13.960 --> 02:44:16.440]   - Yes, it's a very beautiful mathematical thing,
[02:44:16.440 --> 02:44:18.320]   and it's very, I mean, by the way,
[02:44:18.320 --> 02:44:22.060]   this whole theory is just amazingly rich
[02:44:22.060 --> 02:44:23.220]   in terms of the mathematics
[02:44:23.220 --> 02:44:25.120]   that it says should exist, okay?
[02:44:25.120 --> 02:44:27.700]   So for example, calculus, you know,
[02:44:27.700 --> 02:44:30.360]   is the story of infinitesimal change
[02:44:30.360 --> 02:44:32.000]   in integer-dimensional space,
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.880]   one-dimensional, two-dimensional, three-dimensional space.
[02:44:34.880 --> 02:44:37.960]   We need a theory of infinitesimal change
[02:44:37.960 --> 02:44:41.440]   in fractional-dimensional and dynamic-dimensional space.
[02:44:41.440 --> 02:44:42.640]   No such theory exists.
[02:44:42.640 --> 02:44:45.320]   - So there's tools in mathematics that are needed here.
[02:44:45.320 --> 02:44:46.140]   - Right.
[02:44:46.140 --> 02:44:47.040]   - And this is the motivation for that, actually.
[02:44:47.040 --> 02:44:50.320]   - Right, and it's, you know, there are indications,
[02:44:50.320 --> 02:44:51.760]   and we can do computer experiments,
[02:44:51.760 --> 02:44:53.560]   and we can see how it's gonna come out,
[02:44:53.560 --> 02:44:54.920]   but we need to, you know,
[02:44:54.920 --> 02:44:58.040]   the actual mathematics doesn't exist.
[02:44:58.040 --> 02:45:00.720]   And in branchial space, it's actually even worse.
[02:45:00.720 --> 02:45:04.560]   There's even more sort of layers of mathematics that are,
[02:45:04.560 --> 02:45:06.260]   you know, we can see how it works, roughly,
[02:45:06.260 --> 02:45:07.960]   by doing computer experiments,
[02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:10.100]   but to really understand it,
[02:45:10.100 --> 02:45:13.280]   we need more sort of mathematical sophistication.
[02:45:13.280 --> 02:45:14.880]   - So quantum computers.
[02:45:14.880 --> 02:45:17.780]   - Okay, so the basic idea of quantum computers,
[02:45:17.780 --> 02:45:19.960]   the promise of quantum computers
[02:45:19.960 --> 02:45:23.640]   is quantum mechanics does things in parallel,
[02:45:23.640 --> 02:45:26.180]   and so you can sort of intrinsically
[02:45:26.180 --> 02:45:27.880]   do computations in parallel,
[02:45:27.880 --> 02:45:30.160]   and somehow that can be much more efficient
[02:45:30.160 --> 02:45:33.280]   than just doing them one after another.
[02:45:33.280 --> 02:45:36.240]   And, you know, I actually worked on quantum computing a bit
[02:45:36.240 --> 02:45:40.680]   with Dick Feynman back in 1980, one, two, three,
[02:45:40.680 --> 02:45:42.120]   that kind of timeframe, and we--
[02:45:42.120 --> 02:45:43.680]   - A fascinating image.
[02:45:43.680 --> 02:45:46.600]   You and Feynman work on quantum computers.
[02:45:46.600 --> 02:45:47.720]   - Well, we tried to work,
[02:45:47.840 --> 02:45:51.000]   the big thing we tried to do was invent a randomness chip
[02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.760]   that would generate randomness at a high speed
[02:45:53.760 --> 02:45:55.440]   using quantum mechanics.
[02:45:55.440 --> 02:45:58.880]   And the discovery that that wasn't really possible
[02:45:58.880 --> 02:46:01.480]   was part of the story of,
[02:46:01.480 --> 02:46:02.980]   we never really wrote anything about it.
[02:46:02.980 --> 02:46:04.200]   I think maybe he wrote some stuff,
[02:46:04.200 --> 02:46:07.480]   but we didn't write stuff about what we figured out
[02:46:07.480 --> 02:46:10.040]   about sort of the fact that it really seemed like
[02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:12.280]   the measurement process in quantum mechanics
[02:46:12.280 --> 02:46:15.640]   was a serious damper on what was possible to do
[02:46:15.640 --> 02:46:18.360]   in sort of, you know, the possible advantages
[02:46:18.360 --> 02:46:20.680]   of quantum mechanics for computing.
[02:46:20.680 --> 02:46:24.680]   But anyway, so the sort of the promise of quantum computing
[02:46:24.680 --> 02:46:28.220]   is let's say you're trying to, you know, factor an integer.
[02:46:28.220 --> 02:46:30.040]   Well, you can, instead of, you know,
[02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:31.440]   when you factor an integer, you might say,
[02:46:31.440 --> 02:46:32.640]   well, does this factor work?
[02:46:32.640 --> 02:46:33.480]   Does this factor work?
[02:46:33.480 --> 02:46:34.580]   Does this factor work?
[02:46:34.580 --> 02:46:38.200]   In ordinary computing, it seems like we pretty much
[02:46:38.200 --> 02:46:41.060]   just have to try all these different factors,
[02:46:41.060 --> 02:46:43.040]   you know, kind of one after another.
[02:46:43.040 --> 02:46:45.120]   But in quantum mechanics, you might have the idea,
[02:46:45.120 --> 02:46:48.320]   oh, you can just sort of have the physics,
[02:46:48.320 --> 02:46:51.280]   try all of them in parallel, okay?
[02:46:51.280 --> 02:46:54.880]   And the, you know, and there's this algorithm,
[02:46:54.880 --> 02:46:58.720]   Shor's algorithm, which allows you,
[02:46:58.720 --> 02:47:01.040]   according to the formalism of quantum mechanics,
[02:47:01.040 --> 02:47:03.400]   to do everything in parallel and to do it much faster
[02:47:03.400 --> 02:47:05.280]   than you can on a classical computer.
[02:47:05.280 --> 02:47:08.100]   Okay, the only little footnote is,
[02:47:08.100 --> 02:47:09.880]   you have to figure out what the answer is.
[02:47:09.880 --> 02:47:11.960]   You have to measure the results.
[02:47:11.960 --> 02:47:13.920]   So the quantum mechanics internally has figured out
[02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:15.480]   all these different branches,
[02:47:15.480 --> 02:47:17.840]   but then you have to pull all these branches together
[02:47:17.840 --> 02:47:21.000]   to say, and the classical answer is this, okay?
[02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:22.560]   The standard theory of quantum mechanics
[02:47:22.560 --> 02:47:24.180]   does not tell you how to do that.
[02:47:24.180 --> 02:47:26.140]   It tells you how the branching works,
[02:47:26.140 --> 02:47:27.840]   but it doesn't tell you the process
[02:47:27.840 --> 02:47:30.200]   of corralling all these things together.
[02:47:30.200 --> 02:47:32.780]   And that process, which intuitively you can see
[02:47:32.780 --> 02:47:34.360]   is going to be kind of tricky,
[02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:37.040]   but our model actually does tell you
[02:47:37.040 --> 02:47:40.160]   how that process of pulling things together works.
[02:47:40.160 --> 02:47:42.840]   And the answer seems to be, we're not absolutely sure.
[02:47:42.840 --> 02:47:45.320]   We've only got to two times three so far,
[02:47:45.320 --> 02:47:50.320]   which is kind of in this factorization
[02:47:50.320 --> 02:47:52.120]   in quantum computers, but we can,
[02:47:52.120 --> 02:47:56.760]   what seems to be the case is that the advantage you get
[02:47:56.760 --> 02:47:59.960]   from the parallelization from quantum mechanics
[02:47:59.960 --> 02:48:03.520]   is lost from the amount that you have to spend
[02:48:03.520 --> 02:48:05.320]   pulling together all those parallel threads
[02:48:05.320 --> 02:48:07.680]   to get to a classical answer at the end.
[02:48:07.680 --> 02:48:10.280]   Now, that phenomenon is not unrelated
[02:48:10.280 --> 02:48:11.880]   to various decoherence phenomena
[02:48:11.880 --> 02:48:14.280]   that are seen in practical quantum computers and so on.
[02:48:14.280 --> 02:48:16.760]   I mean, I should say as a very practical point,
[02:48:16.760 --> 02:48:19.060]   I mean, it's like, should people stop bothering
[02:48:19.060 --> 02:48:20.760]   to do quantum computing research?
[02:48:20.760 --> 02:48:23.120]   No, because what they're really doing
[02:48:23.120 --> 02:48:25.240]   is they're trying to use physics
[02:48:25.240 --> 02:48:28.720]   to get to a new level of what's possible in computing.
[02:48:28.720 --> 02:48:30.920]   And that's a completely valid activity.
[02:48:30.920 --> 02:48:33.400]   Whether you can really put,
[02:48:33.400 --> 02:48:34.240]   whether you can say,
[02:48:34.240 --> 02:48:35.960]   oh, you can solve an NP complete problem,
[02:48:35.960 --> 02:48:38.560]   you can reduce exponential time to polynomial time,
[02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:40.600]   we're not sure.
[02:48:40.600 --> 02:48:43.080]   And I'm suspecting the answer is no,
[02:48:43.080 --> 02:48:46.080]   but that's not relevant to the practical speed-ups
[02:48:46.080 --> 02:48:48.520]   you can get by using different kinds of technologies,
[02:48:48.520 --> 02:48:52.320]   different kinds of physics to do basic computing.
[02:48:52.320 --> 02:48:53.640]   - So you're saying, I mean,
[02:48:53.640 --> 02:48:55.280]   some of the models you're playing with,
[02:48:55.280 --> 02:49:00.280]   the indication is that to get all the sheep back together
[02:49:00.280 --> 02:49:05.980]   and to corral everything together
[02:49:05.980 --> 02:49:08.920]   to get the actual solution to the algorithm
[02:49:08.920 --> 02:49:10.840]   is-- - You lose all the--
[02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:12.240]   - You lose all the--
[02:49:12.240 --> 02:49:14.400]   - By the way, I mean, so again, this question,
[02:49:14.400 --> 02:49:16.600]   do we actually know what we're talking about
[02:49:16.600 --> 02:49:18.240]   about quantum computing and so on?
[02:49:18.240 --> 02:49:22.440]   So again, we're doing proof by compilation.
[02:49:22.440 --> 02:49:24.880]   So we have a quantum computing framework
[02:49:24.880 --> 02:49:26.080]   in Wolfram language,
[02:49:26.080 --> 02:49:28.360]   which is a standard quantum computing framework
[02:49:28.360 --> 02:49:31.320]   that represents things in terms of the standard
[02:49:31.320 --> 02:49:32.840]   formalism of quantum mechanics.
[02:49:32.840 --> 02:49:36.920]   And we have a compiler that simply compiles
[02:49:36.920 --> 02:49:41.520]   the representation of quantum gates into multi-way systems.
[02:49:41.520 --> 02:49:43.920]   So, and in fact, the message that I got
[02:49:43.920 --> 02:49:46.000]   was from somebody who's working on the project
[02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:49.920]   who has managed to compile one of the sort of
[02:49:49.920 --> 02:49:53.200]   a core formalism based on category theory
[02:49:53.200 --> 02:49:57.520]   and core quantum formalism into multi-way systems.
[02:49:57.520 --> 02:49:58.920]   So this-- - When you say multi-way system,
[02:49:58.920 --> 02:50:00.160]   these multi-way graphs?
[02:50:00.160 --> 02:50:02.160]   - Yes, yes. - So you're,
[02:50:02.160 --> 02:50:03.160]   okay, that's awesome.
[02:50:03.160 --> 02:50:05.200]   And then you can do all kinds of experiments
[02:50:05.200 --> 02:50:06.280]   on that multi-way graph.
[02:50:06.280 --> 02:50:08.640]   - Right, but the point is that what we're saying is
[02:50:08.640 --> 02:50:10.400]   the thing, we've got this representation
[02:50:10.400 --> 02:50:12.000]   of let's say Shor's algorithm
[02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.040]   in terms of standard quantum gates.
[02:50:14.040 --> 02:50:17.480]   And it's just a pure matter of sort of computation
[02:50:17.480 --> 02:50:19.240]   to just say that is equivalent.
[02:50:19.240 --> 02:50:23.360]   We will get the same result as running this multi-way system.
[02:50:23.360 --> 02:50:26.640]   - Can you do complexity analysis on that multi-way system?
[02:50:26.640 --> 02:50:28.600]   - Well, that's what we've been trying to do, yes.
[02:50:28.600 --> 02:50:29.440]   We're getting there.
[02:50:29.440 --> 02:50:30.280]   We haven't done that yet.
[02:50:30.280 --> 02:50:32.480]   I mean, there's a pretty good indication
[02:50:32.480 --> 02:50:33.480]   of how that's gonna work out.
[02:50:33.480 --> 02:50:36.240]   And we've done, as I say, our computer experiments,
[02:50:36.240 --> 02:50:39.440]   we've unimpressively gotten to about two times three
[02:50:39.440 --> 02:50:41.040]   in terms of factorization,
[02:50:41.040 --> 02:50:43.120]   which is kind of about how far people have got
[02:50:43.120 --> 02:50:45.400]   with physical quantum computers as well.
[02:50:45.400 --> 02:50:48.040]   But yes, we will be able to,
[02:50:48.040 --> 02:50:50.440]   we definitely will be able to do complexity analysis
[02:50:50.440 --> 02:50:51.800]   and we will be able to know.
[02:50:51.800 --> 02:50:55.240]   So the one remaining hope for quantum computing
[02:50:55.240 --> 02:50:58.200]   really, really working at this formal level
[02:50:58.200 --> 02:51:01.120]   of quantum brand exponential stuff being done
[02:51:01.120 --> 02:51:03.040]   in polynomial time and so on,
[02:51:03.040 --> 02:51:05.240]   the one hope, which is very bizarre,
[02:51:05.240 --> 02:51:08.960]   is that you can kind of piggyback
[02:51:08.960 --> 02:51:11.200]   on the expansion of Brownshield space.
[02:51:11.200 --> 02:51:13.440]   So here's how that might work.
[02:51:13.440 --> 02:51:17.120]   So you think, you know, energy conservation,
[02:51:17.120 --> 02:51:18.680]   standard thing in high school physics,
[02:51:18.680 --> 02:51:20.560]   energy is conserved, right?
[02:51:20.560 --> 02:51:23.600]   But now you imagine, you think about energy
[02:51:23.600 --> 02:51:24.960]   in the context of cosmology,
[02:51:24.960 --> 02:51:26.880]   in the context of the whole universe.
[02:51:26.880 --> 02:51:28.640]   It's a much more complicated story.
[02:51:28.640 --> 02:51:29.760]   The expansion of the universe
[02:51:29.760 --> 02:51:32.440]   kind of violates energy conservation.
[02:51:32.440 --> 02:51:33.720]   And so, for example, if you imagine
[02:51:33.720 --> 02:51:34.920]   you've got two galaxies,
[02:51:34.920 --> 02:51:37.000]   they're receding from each other very quickly.
[02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.320]   They've got two big central black holes.
[02:51:39.320 --> 02:51:42.960]   You connect a spring between these two central black holes.
[02:51:42.960 --> 02:51:44.560]   Not easy to do in practice,
[02:51:44.560 --> 02:51:46.520]   but let's imagine you could do it.
[02:51:46.520 --> 02:51:49.120]   Now that spring is being pulled apart.
[02:51:49.120 --> 02:51:52.320]   It's getting more potential energy in the spring
[02:51:52.320 --> 02:51:55.040]   as a result of the expansion of the universe.
[02:51:55.040 --> 02:51:58.000]   So in a sense, you are piggybacking
[02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:00.440]   on the expansion that exists in the universe
[02:52:00.440 --> 02:52:03.040]   and the sort of violation of energy conservation
[02:52:03.040 --> 02:52:05.760]   that's associated with that cosmological expansion
[02:52:05.760 --> 02:52:07.080]   to essentially get energy.
[02:52:07.080 --> 02:52:09.600]   You're essentially building a perpetual motion machine
[02:52:09.600 --> 02:52:12.320]   by using the expansion of the universe.
[02:52:12.320 --> 02:52:15.200]   And that is a physical version of that.
[02:52:15.200 --> 02:52:17.120]   It is conceivable that the same thing
[02:52:17.120 --> 02:52:19.120]   could be done in branchial space
[02:52:19.120 --> 02:52:23.080]   to essentially mine the expansion of the universe
[02:52:23.080 --> 02:52:26.720]   in branchial space as a way to get
[02:52:26.720 --> 02:52:31.160]   the sort of quantum computing for free, so to speak,
[02:52:31.160 --> 02:52:34.160]   just from the expansion of the universe in branchial space.
[02:52:34.160 --> 02:52:36.520]   Now, the physical space version is kind of absurd
[02:52:36.520 --> 02:52:40.120]   and involves springs between black holes and so on.
[02:52:40.120 --> 02:52:42.680]   It's conceivable that the branchial space version
[02:52:42.680 --> 02:52:45.240]   is not as absurd and that it's actually something
[02:52:45.240 --> 02:52:47.680]   you can reach with physical things
[02:52:47.680 --> 02:52:49.200]   you can build in labs and so on.
[02:52:49.200 --> 02:52:50.280]   We don't know yet.
[02:52:50.280 --> 02:52:51.920]   - Okay, so like you were saying,
[02:52:51.920 --> 02:52:54.640]   the branchial space might be expanding
[02:52:54.640 --> 02:52:57.720]   and there might be something that could be exploited.
[02:52:57.720 --> 02:52:59.640]   - Right, in the same kind of way
[02:52:59.640 --> 02:53:04.360]   that you can exploit that expansion of the universe
[02:53:04.360 --> 02:53:07.120]   in principle in physical space.
[02:53:07.120 --> 02:53:09.160]   - You just have like a glimmer of hope.
[02:53:09.160 --> 02:53:10.480]   - Right, I think that the, look,
[02:53:10.480 --> 02:53:12.400]   I think the real answer is going to be
[02:53:12.400 --> 02:53:14.520]   that for practical purposes,
[02:53:14.520 --> 02:53:18.840]   the official brand that says you can do exponential things
[02:53:18.840 --> 02:53:21.120]   in polynomial time is probably not gonna work.
[02:53:21.120 --> 02:53:22.880]   - For people curious to kind of learn more,
[02:53:22.880 --> 02:53:25.240]   so this is more like, this is not middle school.
[02:53:25.240 --> 02:53:28.520]   We're gonna go to elementary school for a second.
[02:53:28.520 --> 02:53:31.280]   Maybe middle school, let's go to middle school.
[02:53:31.280 --> 02:53:36.280]   So if I were to try to maybe write a pamphlet
[02:53:36.280 --> 02:53:41.880]   of like Wolfram Physics Project for dummies,
[02:53:41.880 --> 02:53:47.240]   aka for me, or maybe make a video on the basics,
[02:53:47.240 --> 02:53:51.200]   but not just the basics of the physics project,
[02:53:51.200 --> 02:53:56.200]   but the basics plus the most beautiful central ideas,
[02:53:56.200 --> 02:54:01.160]   how would you go about doing that?
[02:54:01.160 --> 02:54:02.680]   Could you help me out a little bit?
[02:54:02.680 --> 02:54:05.720]   - Yeah, yeah, I mean, as a really practical matter,
[02:54:05.720 --> 02:54:10.240]   we have this kind of visual summary picture that we made,
[02:54:10.240 --> 02:54:12.280]   which I think is a pretty good,
[02:54:12.280 --> 02:54:14.480]   when I've tried to explain this to people,
[02:54:14.480 --> 02:54:17.080]   and it's a pretty good place to start,
[02:54:17.080 --> 02:54:19.760]   is you got this rule, you apply the rule,
[02:54:19.760 --> 02:54:22.720]   you're building up this big hypergraph,
[02:54:22.720 --> 02:54:24.520]   you've got all these possibilities,
[02:54:24.520 --> 02:54:25.920]   you're kind of thinking about that
[02:54:25.920 --> 02:54:27.640]   in terms of quantum mechanics.
[02:54:27.640 --> 02:54:30.640]   I mean, that's a decent place to start.
[02:54:30.640 --> 02:54:32.960]   - So basically, the things we've talked about,
[02:54:32.960 --> 02:54:36.200]   which is space represented as a hypergraph,
[02:54:36.200 --> 02:54:40.740]   transformation of that space is kind of time.
[02:54:40.740 --> 02:54:42.000]   - Yes. - And then--
[02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:45.040]   - Structure of that space,
[02:54:45.040 --> 02:54:47.800]   the curvature of that space is gravity.
[02:54:47.800 --> 02:54:49.120]   That can be explained without going
[02:54:49.120 --> 02:54:51.200]   anywhere near quantum mechanics.
[02:54:51.200 --> 02:54:53.120]   I would say that's actually easier to explain
[02:54:53.120 --> 02:54:54.320]   than special relativity.
[02:54:54.320 --> 02:54:58.400]   - Oh, so going into general, so going to curvature?
[02:54:58.400 --> 02:55:00.640]   - Yeah, I mean, special relativity, I think,
[02:55:00.640 --> 02:55:03.480]   is it's a little bit elaborate to explain.
[02:55:03.480 --> 02:55:05.560]   And honestly, you only care about it
[02:55:05.560 --> 02:55:06.800]   if you know about special relativity,
[02:55:06.800 --> 02:55:07.960]   if you know how special relativity
[02:55:07.960 --> 02:55:09.880]   is ordinarily derived and so on.
[02:55:09.880 --> 02:55:11.760]   - So general relativity is easier?
[02:55:11.760 --> 02:55:12.600]   - Is easier, yes.
[02:55:12.600 --> 02:55:13.760]   - And then what about quantum,
[02:55:13.760 --> 02:55:16.320]   what's the easiest way to reveal--
[02:55:16.320 --> 02:55:20.160]   - I think the basic point is just this fact
[02:55:20.160 --> 02:55:22.120]   that there are all these different branches,
[02:55:22.120 --> 02:55:25.280]   that there's this kind of map of how the branches work,
[02:55:25.280 --> 02:55:30.280]   and that, I mean, I think actually the recent things
[02:55:30.280 --> 02:55:32.280]   that we have about the double slit experiment
[02:55:32.280 --> 02:55:34.920]   are pretty good, 'cause you can actually see this,
[02:55:34.920 --> 02:55:39.080]   you can see how the double slit phenomenon arises
[02:55:39.080 --> 02:55:41.360]   from just features of these graphs.
[02:55:41.360 --> 02:55:44.760]   Now, having said that, there is a little bit
[02:55:44.760 --> 02:55:49.520]   of sleight of hand there, because the true story
[02:55:49.520 --> 02:55:51.800]   of the way that double slit thing works
[02:55:51.800 --> 02:55:55.080]   depends on the co-ordinatization of branchial space
[02:55:55.080 --> 02:55:57.800]   that, for example, in our internal team,
[02:55:57.800 --> 02:56:00.200]   there is still a vigorous battle going on
[02:56:00.200 --> 02:56:01.560]   about how that works.
[02:56:01.560 --> 02:56:04.960]   And what's becoming clear is, I mean,
[02:56:04.960 --> 02:56:07.440]   what's becoming clear is that it's mathematically
[02:56:07.440 --> 02:56:08.840]   really quite interesting.
[02:56:08.840 --> 02:56:10.680]   I mean, that is that there's a, you know,
[02:56:10.680 --> 02:56:13.160]   it involves essentially putting space-filling curves,
[02:56:13.160 --> 02:56:14.800]   you basically have a thing which is naturally
[02:56:14.800 --> 02:56:17.240]   two-dimensional, and you're sort of mapping it
[02:56:17.240 --> 02:56:20.000]   into one dimension with a space-filling curve,
[02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:21.640]   and it's like, why is it this space-filling curve
[02:56:21.640 --> 02:56:23.360]   and not another space-filling curve?
[02:56:23.360 --> 02:56:26.600]   And that becomes a story about Riemann surfaces and things,
[02:56:26.600 --> 02:56:28.200]   and it's quite elaborate.
[02:56:28.200 --> 02:56:32.680]   But there's a more, a little bit sleight of hand way
[02:56:32.680 --> 02:56:36.680]   of doing it where it's, you know, it's surprisingly direct.
[02:56:36.680 --> 02:56:42.440]   - So a question that might be difficult to answer,
[02:56:42.600 --> 02:56:46.120]   but for several levels of people,
[02:56:46.120 --> 02:56:50.360]   could you give me advice on how we can learn more?
[02:56:50.360 --> 02:56:54.640]   Specifically, there is people that are completely outside
[02:56:54.640 --> 02:56:57.080]   and just curious and are captivated
[02:56:57.080 --> 02:57:00.880]   by the beauty of hypergraphs, actually.
[02:57:00.880 --> 02:57:04.000]   So people that just want to explore, play around with this.
[02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:09.000]   Second level is people from, say, people like me,
[02:57:10.080 --> 02:57:13.720]   who somehow got a PhD in computer science,
[02:57:13.720 --> 02:57:16.480]   but are not physicists, but fundamentally,
[02:57:16.480 --> 02:57:19.680]   the work you're doing is of computational nature,
[02:57:19.680 --> 02:57:21.360]   so it feels very accessible.
[02:57:21.360 --> 02:57:22.200]   - Yes.
[02:57:22.200 --> 02:57:27.200]   - So what can a person like that do to learn enough physics
[02:57:27.200 --> 02:57:32.640]   or not to be able to, one, explore the beauty of it,
[02:57:32.640 --> 02:57:37.640]   and two, the final level of contribute something
[02:57:38.200 --> 02:57:41.520]   of a level of even publishable, you know,
[02:57:41.520 --> 02:57:44.320]   like strong, interesting ideas.
[02:57:44.320 --> 02:57:47.320]   So at all those layers, complete beginner,
[02:57:47.320 --> 02:57:48.920]   kind of a CS person,
[02:57:48.920 --> 02:57:50.640]   and a CS person that wants to publish.
[02:57:50.640 --> 02:57:52.440]   - Right, I mean, I think that, you know,
[02:57:52.440 --> 02:57:54.560]   I've written a bunch of stuff.
[02:57:54.560 --> 02:57:55.720]   A person called Jonathan Gorod,
[02:57:55.720 --> 02:57:57.480]   who's been a key person working on this project,
[02:57:57.480 --> 02:57:59.920]   has also written a bunch of stuff.
[02:57:59.920 --> 02:58:02.080]   And some other people started writing things, too.
[02:58:02.080 --> 02:58:03.400]   - And he's a physicist.
[02:58:03.400 --> 02:58:06.440]   - Physicist, well, I would say a mathematical physicist.
[02:58:06.440 --> 02:58:07.280]   - Mathematical physicist.
[02:58:07.280 --> 02:58:08.840]   - Pretty mathematically sophisticated.
[02:58:08.840 --> 02:58:11.680]   He regularly out-mathematicizes me.
[02:58:11.680 --> 02:58:14.920]   - Yeah, strong mathematical physicist, yeah.
[02:58:14.920 --> 02:58:16.600]   I looked at some of the papers.
[02:58:16.600 --> 02:58:19.480]   - Right, but so, I mean, you know,
[02:58:19.480 --> 02:58:22.480]   I wrote this kind of original announcement blog post
[02:58:22.480 --> 02:58:25.520]   about this project, which people seem to have found.
[02:58:25.520 --> 02:58:29.040]   I've been really happy, actually, that people who,
[02:58:29.040 --> 02:58:34.800]   you know, people seem to have grokked key points from that.
[02:58:34.800 --> 02:58:37.440]   Much deeper key points people seem to have grokked
[02:58:37.440 --> 02:58:39.560]   than I thought they would grokk.
[02:58:39.560 --> 02:58:41.600]   - And that's a kind of a long blog post
[02:58:41.600 --> 02:58:43.160]   that explains some of the things we talked about,
[02:58:43.160 --> 02:58:45.200]   like the hypergraph and the basic rules.
[02:58:45.200 --> 02:58:46.040]   - Yes, yes.
[02:58:46.040 --> 02:58:47.960]   - And I don't, does it, I forget,
[02:58:47.960 --> 02:58:49.280]   it doesn't have any quantum mechanics in it.
[02:58:49.280 --> 02:58:50.120]   - Oh, yeah, yeah, it does.
[02:58:50.120 --> 02:58:51.920]   It does have quantum mechanics, yes, it does.
[02:58:51.920 --> 02:58:54.760]   But we know a little bit more since that blog post
[02:58:54.760 --> 02:58:57.720]   that probably clarifies, but that blog post
[02:58:57.720 --> 02:58:59.600]   does a pretty decent job.
[02:58:59.600 --> 02:59:02.160]   And, you know, talking about things like, again,
[02:59:02.160 --> 02:59:03.000]   something we didn't mention,
[02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:04.920]   the fact that the uncertainty principle
[02:59:04.920 --> 02:59:07.760]   is a consequence of curvature in Brown-Shield space.
[02:59:07.760 --> 02:59:10.120]   - How much physics should a person know
[02:59:10.120 --> 02:59:14.440]   to be able to understand the beauty of this framework
[02:59:14.440 --> 02:59:16.880]   and to contribute something novel?
[02:59:16.880 --> 02:59:20.200]   - Okay, so I think that those are different questions.
[02:59:20.200 --> 02:59:23.820]   So, I mean, I think that the why does this work,
[02:59:23.820 --> 02:59:25.560]   why does this make any sense,
[02:59:25.560 --> 02:59:28.460]   to really know that,
[02:59:28.460 --> 02:59:32.040]   you have to know a fair amount of physics, okay?
[02:59:32.040 --> 02:59:33.520]   And for example, have a decent--
[02:59:33.520 --> 02:59:35.040]   - When you say why does this work,
[02:59:35.040 --> 02:59:39.120]   you're referring to the connection between this model and--
[02:59:39.120 --> 02:59:39.960]   - General relativity, for example.
[02:59:39.960 --> 02:59:40.780]   - And general relativity.
[02:59:40.780 --> 02:59:41.620]   - Like you have to understand
[02:59:41.620 --> 02:59:43.160]   something about general relativity.
[02:59:43.160 --> 02:59:45.240]   - There's also a side of this where just,
[02:59:45.240 --> 02:59:47.880]   as the pure mathematical framework is fascinating.
[02:59:47.880 --> 02:59:48.720]   - Yes.
[02:59:48.720 --> 02:59:49.920]   - If you throw the physics out completely.
[02:59:49.920 --> 02:59:52.520]   - Right, then it's quite accessible to, I mean, you know,
[02:59:52.520 --> 02:59:55.280]   I wrote this sort of long technical introduction
[02:59:55.280 --> 02:59:58.480]   to the project, which seems to have been very accessible
[02:59:58.480 --> 03:00:01.400]   to people who are, you know, who understand computation
[03:00:01.400 --> 03:00:03.680]   and formal abstract ideas,
[03:00:03.680 --> 03:00:05.720]   but are not specialists in physics
[03:00:05.720 --> 03:00:07.240]   or other kinds of things.
[03:00:07.240 --> 03:00:10.320]   I mean, the thing with the physics part of it is,
[03:00:10.320 --> 03:00:14.600]   you know, there's both a way of thinking
[03:00:14.600 --> 03:00:16.840]   and a literally a mathematical formalism.
[03:00:16.840 --> 03:00:18.080]   I mean, it's like, you know,
[03:00:18.080 --> 03:00:19.980]   to know that we get the Einstein equations,
[03:00:19.980 --> 03:00:22.120]   to know we get the energy momentum tensor,
[03:00:22.120 --> 03:00:24.820]   you kind of have to know what the energy momentum tensor is,
[03:00:24.820 --> 03:00:25.920]   and that's physics.
[03:00:25.920 --> 03:00:29.260]   I mean, that's kind of graduate level physics, basically.
[03:00:29.260 --> 03:00:33.360]   And so that, you know, making that final connection
[03:00:33.360 --> 03:00:37.440]   is, requires some depth of physics knowledge.
[03:00:37.440 --> 03:00:38.880]   - I mean, that's the unfortunate thing,
[03:00:38.880 --> 03:00:40.600]   the difference in machine learning and physics
[03:00:40.600 --> 03:00:42.880]   in the 21st century.
[03:00:42.880 --> 03:00:47.440]   Is it really out of reach of a year or two worth of study?
[03:00:47.440 --> 03:00:49.920]   - No, you could get it in a year or two,
[03:00:49.920 --> 03:00:51.600]   but you can't get it in a month.
[03:00:51.600 --> 03:00:52.440]   - Right.
[03:00:52.440 --> 03:00:53.260]   - I mean, it--
[03:00:53.260 --> 03:00:56.160]   - But it doesn't require necessarily like 15 years.
[03:00:56.160 --> 03:00:57.000]   - No, it does not.
[03:00:57.000 --> 03:01:00.200]   And in fact, a lot of what has happened with this project
[03:01:00.200 --> 03:01:02.760]   makes a lot of this stuff much more accessible.
[03:01:02.760 --> 03:01:04.760]   There are things where it has been quite difficult
[03:01:04.760 --> 03:01:06.000]   to explain what's going on,
[03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:09.120]   and it requires much more, you know,
[03:01:09.120 --> 03:01:11.800]   having the concreteness of being able to do simulations,
[03:01:11.800 --> 03:01:15.120]   knowing that this thing that you might've thought
[03:01:15.120 --> 03:01:18.960]   was just an analogy is really actually what's going on,
[03:01:18.960 --> 03:01:21.000]   makes one feel much more secure
[03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:24.200]   about just sort of saying, this is how this works.
[03:01:24.200 --> 03:01:26.200]   And I think it will be, you know,
[03:01:26.200 --> 03:01:28.480]   I'm hoping the textbooks of the future,
[03:01:28.480 --> 03:01:30.440]   the physics textbooks of the future,
[03:01:30.440 --> 03:01:32.080]   there will be a certain compression.
[03:01:32.080 --> 03:01:33.320]   There will be things that used to be
[03:01:33.320 --> 03:01:35.200]   very much more elaborate, because for example,
[03:01:35.200 --> 03:01:36.720]   even doing continuous mathematics
[03:01:36.720 --> 03:01:38.840]   versus this discrete mathematics,
[03:01:38.840 --> 03:01:40.640]   that, you know, to know how things work
[03:01:40.640 --> 03:01:41.760]   in continuous mathematics,
[03:01:41.760 --> 03:01:43.080]   you have to be talking about stuff
[03:01:43.080 --> 03:01:44.720]   and waving your hands about things.
[03:01:44.720 --> 03:01:47.080]   Whereas with the discrete version,
[03:01:47.080 --> 03:01:50.880]   it's just like, here is a picture, this is how it works.
[03:01:50.880 --> 03:01:53.200]   And there's no, oh, did we get the limit right?
[03:01:53.200 --> 03:01:55.520]   Did this, you know, did this thing that is of,
[03:01:55.520 --> 03:01:59.360]   you know, zero, you know, measure zero object,
[03:01:59.360 --> 03:02:01.920]   you know, interact with this thing in the right way.
[03:02:01.920 --> 03:02:03.360]   You don't have to have that whole discussion.
[03:02:03.360 --> 03:02:05.480]   It's just like, here's a picture, you know,
[03:02:05.480 --> 03:02:07.120]   this is what it does.
[03:02:07.120 --> 03:02:09.280]   And, you know, you can, then it takes more effort
[03:02:09.280 --> 03:02:10.560]   to say, what does it do in the limit
[03:02:10.560 --> 03:02:12.000]   when the picture gets very big?
[03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:13.080]   - But you can do experiments
[03:02:13.080 --> 03:02:14.320]   to build up an intuition actually.
[03:02:14.320 --> 03:02:15.160]   - Yes, right.
[03:02:15.160 --> 03:02:17.440]   And you can get sort of core intuition for what's going on.
[03:02:17.440 --> 03:02:19.680]   Now, in terms of contributing to this,
[03:02:19.680 --> 03:02:21.880]   the, you know, I would say that the study
[03:02:21.880 --> 03:02:23.160]   of the computational universe
[03:02:23.160 --> 03:02:24.480]   and how all these programs work
[03:02:24.480 --> 03:02:25.960]   in the computational universe,
[03:02:25.960 --> 03:02:28.720]   there's just an unbelievable amount to do there.
[03:02:28.720 --> 03:02:31.280]   And it is very close to the surface.
[03:02:31.280 --> 03:02:34.360]   That is, you know, high school kids,
[03:02:34.360 --> 03:02:36.040]   you can do experiments.
[03:02:36.040 --> 03:02:38.920]   It's not, you know, and you can discover things.
[03:02:38.920 --> 03:02:42.560]   I mean, you know, we, you can discover stuff about,
[03:02:42.560 --> 03:02:44.280]   I don't know, like this thing about expansion
[03:02:44.280 --> 03:02:45.120]   of branchial space.
[03:02:45.120 --> 03:02:47.720]   That's an absolutely accessible thing to look at.
[03:02:47.720 --> 03:02:50.680]   Now, you know, the main issue with doing these things
[03:02:50.680 --> 03:02:54.600]   is not, there isn't a lot of technical depth
[03:02:54.600 --> 03:02:56.000]   difficulty there.
[03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:58.040]   The actual doing of the experiments, you know,
[03:02:58.040 --> 03:03:01.360]   all the code is all on our website to do all these things.
[03:03:01.360 --> 03:03:03.880]   The real thing is sort of the judgment
[03:03:03.880 --> 03:03:05.600]   of what's the right experiment to do.
[03:03:05.600 --> 03:03:07.760]   How do you interpret what you see?
[03:03:07.760 --> 03:03:09.920]   That's the part that, you know,
[03:03:09.920 --> 03:03:11.840]   people will do amazing things with,
[03:03:11.840 --> 03:03:13.520]   and that's the part that,
[03:03:13.520 --> 03:03:17.040]   but it isn't like you have to have done 10 years of study
[03:03:17.040 --> 03:03:18.840]   to get to the point where you can do the experiments.
[03:03:18.840 --> 03:03:19.680]   You don't.
[03:03:19.680 --> 03:03:20.520]   - That's the cool thing.
[03:03:20.520 --> 03:03:22.480]   You can do experiments day one, basically.
[03:03:22.480 --> 03:03:25.080]   It's that, that's the amazing thing about,
[03:03:25.080 --> 03:03:26.920]   and you've actually put the tools out there.
[03:03:26.920 --> 03:03:29.680]   It's beautiful, it's mysterious.
[03:03:29.680 --> 03:03:32.760]   There's still, I would say, maybe you can correct me.
[03:03:32.760 --> 03:03:35.520]   It feels like there's a huge number of low-hanging fruit
[03:03:35.520 --> 03:03:37.840]   on the mathematical side, at least,
[03:03:37.840 --> 03:03:40.120]   not the physics side, perhaps.
[03:03:40.120 --> 03:03:44.440]   - No, look, on the, okay, on the physics side,
[03:03:44.440 --> 03:03:48.480]   we are, we're definitely in harvesting mode, you know.
[03:03:48.480 --> 03:03:51.000]   - Of which fruit, the low-hanging ones or?
[03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:52.560]   - The low-hanging ones, yeah, right.
[03:03:52.560 --> 03:03:54.200]   I mean, basically, here's the thing.
[03:03:54.200 --> 03:03:56.120]   There's a certain list of, you know,
[03:03:56.120 --> 03:03:57.800]   here are the effects in quantum mechanics,
[03:03:57.800 --> 03:03:59.760]   here are the effects in general relativity.
[03:03:59.760 --> 03:04:02.200]   It's just like industrial harvesting.
[03:04:02.200 --> 03:04:04.480]   It's like, can we get this one, this one, this one,
[03:04:04.480 --> 03:04:05.560]   this one, this one?
[03:04:05.560 --> 03:04:07.560]   And the thing that's really, you know,
[03:04:07.560 --> 03:04:10.120]   interesting and satisfying, and it's like, you know,
[03:04:10.120 --> 03:04:11.520]   is one climbing the right mountain?
[03:04:11.520 --> 03:04:12.920]   Does one have the right model?
[03:04:12.920 --> 03:04:15.920]   The thing that's just amazing is, you know,
[03:04:15.920 --> 03:04:18.280]   we keep on like, are we gonna get this one?
[03:04:18.280 --> 03:04:19.920]   How hard is this one?
[03:04:19.920 --> 03:04:22.920]   It's like, oh, you know, it looks really hard,
[03:04:22.920 --> 03:04:23.800]   it looks really hard.
[03:04:23.800 --> 03:04:25.800]   Oh, actually, we can get it.
[03:04:25.800 --> 03:04:27.560]   And--
[03:04:27.560 --> 03:04:29.040]   - And you're continually surprised.
[03:04:29.040 --> 03:04:31.520]   I mean, it seems like, I've been following your progress.
[03:04:31.520 --> 03:04:34.320]   It's kind of exciting, all the, in harvesting mode,
[03:04:34.320 --> 03:04:35.880]   all the things you're picking up along the way.
[03:04:35.880 --> 03:04:38.320]   - Right, right, no, I mean, it's the thing that is,
[03:04:38.320 --> 03:04:40.560]   I keep on thinking it's gonna be more difficult than it is.
[03:04:40.560 --> 03:04:43.360]   Now, that's a, you know, that's a, who knows what,
[03:04:43.360 --> 03:04:47.400]   I mean, the one thing, so the thing that's been,
[03:04:47.400 --> 03:04:50.920]   was a big thing that I think we're pretty close to,
[03:04:50.920 --> 03:04:52.480]   I mean, I can give you a little bit of the roadmap,
[03:04:52.480 --> 03:04:54.000]   it's sort of interesting to see,
[03:04:54.000 --> 03:04:55.720]   is like, what are particles?
[03:04:55.720 --> 03:04:56.880]   What are things like electrons?
[03:04:56.880 --> 03:04:58.520]   How do they really work?
[03:04:58.520 --> 03:05:01.400]   - Are you close to get, like, what's,
[03:05:01.400 --> 03:05:03.160]   are you close to trying to understand, like,
[03:05:03.160 --> 03:05:06.480]   the atom, the electrons, neutrons, protons,
[03:05:06.480 --> 03:05:07.320]   like just particles? - Okay, so this is,
[03:05:07.320 --> 03:05:08.160]   this is the stack.
[03:05:08.160 --> 03:05:10.600]   So the first thing we want to understand is
[03:05:10.600 --> 03:05:13.360]   the quantization of spin.
[03:05:13.360 --> 03:05:15.960]   So particles, they kind of spin,
[03:05:15.960 --> 03:05:18.080]   they have a certain angular momentum.
[03:05:18.080 --> 03:05:21.520]   That angular momentum, even though the masses of particles
[03:05:21.520 --> 03:05:22.400]   are all over the place, you know,
[03:05:22.400 --> 03:05:26.000]   the electron has a mass of 0.511 MeV,
[03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:28.240]   but, you know, the proton is 938 MeV,
[03:05:28.240 --> 03:05:29.080]   et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,
[03:05:29.080 --> 03:05:30.640]   they're all kind of random numbers.
[03:05:30.640 --> 03:05:32.720]   The spins of all these particles
[03:05:32.720 --> 03:05:34.840]   are either integers or half integers.
[03:05:34.840 --> 03:05:37.720]   And that's a fact that was discovered in the 1920s,
[03:05:37.720 --> 03:05:38.560]   I guess.
[03:05:38.560 --> 03:05:44.160]   I think that we are close to understanding
[03:05:44.160 --> 03:05:46.160]   why spin is quantized.
[03:05:46.160 --> 03:05:48.320]   And that's a, and it appears to be
[03:05:48.320 --> 03:05:50.320]   a quite elaborate mathematical story
[03:05:50.320 --> 03:05:53.080]   about homotopy groups in crystal space
[03:05:53.080 --> 03:05:54.480]   and all kinds of things.
[03:05:54.480 --> 03:05:58.040]   But bottom line is that seems within reach.
[03:05:58.040 --> 03:06:01.160]   And that's a big deal because that's a very core feature
[03:06:01.160 --> 03:06:04.240]   of understanding how particles work in quantum mechanics.
[03:06:04.240 --> 03:06:06.600]   Another core feature is this difference
[03:06:06.600 --> 03:06:09.240]   between particles that obey the exclusion principle
[03:06:09.240 --> 03:06:10.640]   and sort of stay apart,
[03:06:10.640 --> 03:06:13.720]   that leads to the stability of matter and things like that,
[03:06:13.720 --> 03:06:15.400]   and particles that love to get together
[03:06:15.400 --> 03:06:18.120]   and be in the same state, things like photons,
[03:06:18.120 --> 03:06:22.200]   that, and that's what leads to phenomena like lasers,
[03:06:22.200 --> 03:06:24.200]   where you can get sort of coherently everything
[03:06:24.200 --> 03:06:25.520]   in the same state.
[03:06:25.520 --> 03:06:29.280]   That difference is the particles of integer spin
[03:06:29.280 --> 03:06:31.760]   or bosons like to get together in the same state,
[03:06:31.760 --> 03:06:34.480]   the particles of half integers spin, of fermions,
[03:06:34.480 --> 03:06:37.560]   like electrons, that they tend to stay apart.
[03:06:37.560 --> 03:06:41.840]   And so the question is, can we get that in our models?
[03:06:41.840 --> 03:06:45.440]   And just the last few days, I think we made,
[03:06:45.440 --> 03:06:47.960]   I mean, I think the story of,
[03:06:47.960 --> 03:06:51.440]   I mean, it's one of these things where we're really close.
[03:06:51.440 --> 03:06:53.400]   - Is this connected to fermions and bosons?
[03:06:53.400 --> 03:06:54.240]   You were talking about? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:06:54.240 --> 03:06:57.760]   So this was, what happens is what seems to happen, okay?
[03:06:57.760 --> 03:07:01.480]   It's subject to revision even the next few days.
[03:07:01.480 --> 03:07:04.960]   But what seems to be the case is that bosons
[03:07:04.960 --> 03:07:08.400]   are associated with essentially merging in multi-way graphs
[03:07:08.400 --> 03:07:09.680]   and fermions are associated
[03:07:09.720 --> 03:07:11.960]   with branching in multi-way graphs.
[03:07:11.960 --> 03:07:15.160]   And that essentially the exclusion principle
[03:07:15.160 --> 03:07:18.320]   is the fact that in branchial space,
[03:07:18.320 --> 03:07:21.400]   things have a certain extent in branchial space
[03:07:21.400 --> 03:07:24.040]   that in which things are being sort of forced apart
[03:07:24.040 --> 03:07:26.320]   in branchial space, whereas the case of bosons,
[03:07:26.320 --> 03:07:29.440]   they get, they come together in branchial space.
[03:07:29.440 --> 03:07:30.880]   And the real question is,
[03:07:30.880 --> 03:07:32.960]   can we explain the relationship between that
[03:07:32.960 --> 03:07:34.560]   and these things called spinners,
[03:07:34.560 --> 03:07:35.640]   which are the representation
[03:07:35.640 --> 03:07:37.480]   of half-integer spin particles
[03:07:37.480 --> 03:07:38.960]   that have this weird feature that usually
[03:07:38.960 --> 03:07:41.600]   when you go around 360 degree rotation,
[03:07:41.600 --> 03:07:43.440]   you get back to where you started from.
[03:07:43.440 --> 03:07:44.280]   But for a spinner,
[03:07:44.280 --> 03:07:46.080]   you don't get back to where you started from.
[03:07:46.080 --> 03:07:48.440]   It takes 720 degrees of rotation
[03:07:48.440 --> 03:07:50.280]   to get back to where you started from.
[03:07:50.280 --> 03:07:53.200]   And we are just, it feels like we are,
[03:07:53.200 --> 03:07:55.480]   we're just incredibly close to actually having that,
[03:07:55.480 --> 03:07:57.200]   understanding how that works.
[03:07:57.200 --> 03:07:59.080]   And it turns out, it looks like,
[03:07:59.080 --> 03:08:00.680]   my current speculation is,
[03:08:00.680 --> 03:08:05.000]   that it's as simple as the directed hypergraphs
[03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:06.560]   versus undirected hypergraphs.
[03:08:06.560 --> 03:08:07.840]   - Oh, interesting.
[03:08:07.840 --> 03:08:10.320]   - The relationship between spinners and vectors.
[03:08:10.320 --> 03:08:11.160]   So, which is just--
[03:08:11.160 --> 03:08:12.000]   - Nice, interesting.
[03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:12.840]   Yeah, that would be interesting
[03:08:12.840 --> 03:08:16.320]   if these are all these kind of nice properties
[03:08:16.320 --> 03:08:20.000]   of this multigraphs of branching and rejoining.
[03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:21.800]   - Spinners have been very mysterious.
[03:08:21.800 --> 03:08:23.960]   And if that's what they turn out to be,
[03:08:23.960 --> 03:08:25.360]   there's gonna be an easy explanation
[03:08:25.360 --> 03:08:26.200]   of what's going on.
[03:08:26.200 --> 03:08:27.240]   - Yeah, if it's directed versus undirected.
[03:08:27.240 --> 03:08:28.800]   - It's just, and that's why
[03:08:28.800 --> 03:08:30.440]   there's only two different cases.
[03:08:30.440 --> 03:08:34.240]   - Why are spinners important in quantum mechanics?
[03:08:34.240 --> 03:08:35.720]   Can you just give a--
[03:08:35.720 --> 03:08:37.040]   - Yeah, so spinners are important
[03:08:37.040 --> 03:08:41.520]   because they are the representation of electrons
[03:08:41.520 --> 03:08:43.440]   which have half an integer spin.
[03:08:43.440 --> 03:08:48.360]   They are the wave functions of electrons are spinners.
[03:08:48.360 --> 03:08:51.320]   Just like the wave functions of photons are vectors,
[03:08:51.320 --> 03:08:54.320]   the wave functions of electrons are spinners.
[03:08:54.320 --> 03:08:56.200]   And they have this property
[03:08:56.200 --> 03:09:00.120]   that when you rotate by 360 degrees,
[03:09:00.120 --> 03:09:02.960]   they come back to minus one of themselves
[03:09:02.960 --> 03:09:06.800]   and take 720 degrees to get back to the original value.
[03:09:06.800 --> 03:09:08.520]   And they are a consequence of,
[03:09:08.520 --> 03:09:14.280]   we usually think of rotation in space
[03:09:14.280 --> 03:09:18.760]   as being when you have this notion of rotational invariance
[03:09:18.760 --> 03:09:22.200]   and rotational invariance, as we ordinarily experience it,
[03:09:22.200 --> 03:09:23.320]   doesn't have the feature.
[03:09:23.320 --> 03:09:24.800]   If you go through 360 degrees,
[03:09:24.800 --> 03:09:26.480]   you go back to where you started from,
[03:09:26.480 --> 03:09:28.520]   but that's not true for electrons.
[03:09:28.520 --> 03:09:32.520]   And so that's why understanding how that works is important.
[03:09:32.520 --> 03:09:34.960]   - Yeah, I've been playing with Mobius strip
[03:09:34.960 --> 03:09:37.040]   quite a bit lately just for fun.
[03:09:37.040 --> 03:09:37.880]   - Yes, yes.
[03:09:37.880 --> 03:09:41.040]   - It has the same kind of funky properties.
[03:09:41.040 --> 03:09:41.880]   - Yes, right, exactly.
[03:09:41.880 --> 03:09:43.600]   You can have this, the so-called belt trick,
[03:09:43.600 --> 03:09:46.000]   which is this way of taking an extended object
[03:09:46.000 --> 03:09:47.640]   and you can see properties like spinners
[03:09:47.640 --> 03:09:50.280]   with that kind of extended object that--
[03:09:50.280 --> 03:09:52.640]   - Yeah, it would be very cool if it somehow connects
[03:09:52.640 --> 03:09:53.840]   the directive versus undirected.
[03:09:53.840 --> 03:09:54.680]   - I think that's what it's gonna be.
[03:09:54.680 --> 03:09:57.480]   I think it's gonna be as simple as that, but we'll see.
[03:09:57.480 --> 03:09:59.680]   I mean, this is the thing that,
[03:09:59.680 --> 03:10:02.040]   this is the big sort of bizarre surprise
[03:10:02.040 --> 03:10:07.040]   is that, because I learned physics as probably,
[03:10:07.040 --> 03:10:10.080]   let's say a fifth generation in the sense that,
[03:10:10.080 --> 03:10:11.960]   if you go back to the 1920s and so on,
[03:10:11.960 --> 03:10:13.720]   there were the people who were originating
[03:10:13.720 --> 03:10:15.400]   quantum mechanics and so on.
[03:10:15.400 --> 03:10:16.280]   Maybe it's a little less than that.
[03:10:16.280 --> 03:10:19.760]   Maybe I was like a third generation or something.
[03:10:19.760 --> 03:10:23.560]   I don't know, but the people from whom I learned physics
[03:10:23.560 --> 03:10:26.760]   were the people who have been students of the students
[03:10:26.760 --> 03:10:28.920]   of the people who originated
[03:10:28.920 --> 03:10:31.240]   the current understanding of physics.
[03:10:31.240 --> 03:10:33.920]   And we're now at probably the seventh generation
[03:10:33.920 --> 03:10:36.600]   of physicists or something from the early days
[03:10:36.600 --> 03:10:38.360]   of 20th century physics.
[03:10:38.360 --> 03:10:43.360]   And whenever a field gets that many generations deep,
[03:10:43.360 --> 03:10:46.520]   it seems the foundations seem quite inaccessible
[03:10:46.520 --> 03:10:49.800]   and it seems like you can't possibly understand that.
[03:10:49.800 --> 03:10:52.720]   We've gone through seven academic generations
[03:10:52.720 --> 03:10:56.280]   and that's been this thing that's been difficult
[03:10:56.280 --> 03:10:58.600]   to understand for that long.
[03:10:58.600 --> 03:11:01.040]   It just can't be that simple.
[03:11:01.040 --> 03:11:03.800]   - But in a sense, maybe that journey takes you
[03:11:03.800 --> 03:11:07.640]   to a simple explanation that was there all along.
[03:11:07.640 --> 03:11:08.480]   That's the whole-- - Right, right, right.
[03:11:08.480 --> 03:11:10.640]   I mean, and the thing for me personally,
[03:11:10.640 --> 03:11:13.200]   the thing that's been quite interesting is,
[03:11:13.200 --> 03:11:15.980]   I didn't expect this project to work in this way.
[03:11:15.980 --> 03:11:19.880]   But I had this sort of weird piece of personal history
[03:11:19.880 --> 03:11:21.840]   that I used to be a physicist
[03:11:21.840 --> 03:11:23.040]   and I used to do all this stuff.
[03:11:23.040 --> 03:11:26.880]   And I know the standard canon of physics.
[03:11:26.880 --> 03:11:28.520]   I knew it very well.
[03:11:30.080 --> 03:11:31.680]   But then I'd been working on this kind
[03:11:31.680 --> 03:11:35.100]   of computational paradigm for basically 40 years.
[03:11:35.100 --> 03:11:38.800]   And the fact that I'm sort of now coming back
[03:11:38.800 --> 03:11:42.240]   to trying to apply that in physics,
[03:11:42.240 --> 03:11:44.880]   it kind of felt like that journey was necessary.
[03:11:44.880 --> 03:11:49.040]   - When did you first try to play with a hypergraph?
[03:11:49.040 --> 03:11:50.520]   - So what happened is-- - Is this recent?
[03:11:50.520 --> 03:11:53.840]   - Yeah, so what I had was, okay, so this is again,
[03:11:53.840 --> 03:11:56.280]   one always feels dumb after the fact.
[03:11:56.280 --> 03:11:58.800]   It's obvious after the fact.
[03:11:58.800 --> 03:12:02.240]   But so back in the early 1990s,
[03:12:02.240 --> 03:12:05.720]   I realized that using graphs as a sort
[03:12:05.720 --> 03:12:07.780]   of underlying thing underneath space and time
[03:12:07.780 --> 03:12:09.720]   was going to be a useful thing to do.
[03:12:09.720 --> 03:12:11.920]   I figured out about multi-way systems.
[03:12:11.920 --> 03:12:14.960]   I figured out the things about general relativity.
[03:12:14.960 --> 03:12:17.400]   I'd figured out by the end of the 1990s.
[03:12:17.400 --> 03:12:20.040]   But I always felt there was a certain inelegance
[03:12:20.040 --> 03:12:21.880]   because I was using these graphs
[03:12:21.880 --> 03:12:23.880]   and there were certain constraints on these graphs
[03:12:23.880 --> 03:12:26.440]   that seemed like they were kind of awkward.
[03:12:26.440 --> 03:12:28.320]   It was kind of like you can pick,
[03:12:28.320 --> 03:12:30.200]   it's like you couldn't pick any rule.
[03:12:30.200 --> 03:12:33.360]   It was like pick any number, but the number has to be prime.
[03:12:33.360 --> 03:12:34.600]   It was kind of like you couldn't,
[03:12:34.600 --> 03:12:36.900]   it was kind of an awkward special constraint.
[03:12:36.900 --> 03:12:38.400]   I had these trivalent graphs,
[03:12:38.400 --> 03:12:41.440]   graphs with just three connections from every node.
[03:12:41.440 --> 03:12:44.280]   Okay, so, but I discovered a bunch of stuff with that.
[03:12:44.280 --> 03:12:46.280]   I thought it was kind of inelegant.
[03:12:46.280 --> 03:12:48.680]   And the other piece of sort of personal history
[03:12:48.680 --> 03:12:50.200]   is obviously I spent my life
[03:12:50.200 --> 03:12:52.960]   as a computational language designer.
[03:12:52.960 --> 03:12:55.160]   And so the story of computational language design
[03:12:55.160 --> 03:12:58.000]   is a story of how do you take all these random ideas
[03:12:58.000 --> 03:13:00.740]   in the world and kind of grind them down
[03:13:00.740 --> 03:13:02.720]   into something that is computationally
[03:13:02.720 --> 03:13:04.760]   as simple as possible.
[03:13:04.760 --> 03:13:06.680]   And so, I've been very interested
[03:13:06.680 --> 03:13:09.300]   in kind of simple computational frameworks
[03:13:09.300 --> 03:13:13.440]   for representing things and have ridiculous amounts
[03:13:13.440 --> 03:13:15.840]   of experience in trying to do that.
[03:13:15.840 --> 03:13:18.300]   - And actually all of those trajectories of your life
[03:13:18.300 --> 03:13:19.320]   kind of came together.
[03:13:19.320 --> 03:13:21.600]   So you make it sound like you could have come up
[03:13:21.600 --> 03:13:24.640]   with everything you're working on now decades ago,
[03:13:24.640 --> 03:13:26.440]   but in reality.
[03:13:26.440 --> 03:13:28.080]   - Look, two things slowed me down.
[03:13:28.080 --> 03:13:30.280]   I mean, one thing that slowed me down was
[03:13:30.280 --> 03:13:32.840]   I couldn't figure out how to make it elegant.
[03:13:32.840 --> 03:13:35.600]   And that turns out hypergraphs were the key to that.
[03:13:35.600 --> 03:13:39.180]   And that I figured out about less than two years ago now.
[03:13:39.180 --> 03:13:43.360]   And the other, I mean, I think,
[03:13:43.360 --> 03:13:46.160]   so that was sort of a key thing.
[03:13:46.160 --> 03:13:49.760]   Well, okay, so the real embarrassment of this project
[03:13:49.760 --> 03:13:52.680]   is that the final structure that we have
[03:13:52.680 --> 03:13:55.800]   that is the foundation for this project
[03:13:55.800 --> 03:14:00.000]   is basically a kind of an idealized version,
[03:14:00.000 --> 03:14:03.560]   a formalized version of the exact same structure
[03:14:03.560 --> 03:14:05.640]   that I've used to build computational languages
[03:14:05.640 --> 03:14:07.140]   for more than 40 years.
[03:14:07.140 --> 03:14:09.700]   But it took me, but I didn't realize that.
[03:14:09.700 --> 03:14:12.800]   - And there yet may be other,
[03:14:12.800 --> 03:14:14.360]   so we're focused on physics now,
[03:14:14.360 --> 03:14:17.720]   but I mean, that's what the new kind of science is about,
[03:14:17.720 --> 03:14:19.120]   same kind of stuff.
[03:14:19.120 --> 03:14:21.040]   And this, in terms of mathematically,
[03:14:21.040 --> 03:14:23.760]   the beauty of it, so there could be
[03:14:23.760 --> 03:14:27.600]   entire other kind of objects that are useful for,
[03:14:27.600 --> 03:14:31.920]   like we're not talking about machine learning, for example.
[03:14:31.920 --> 03:14:33.880]   Maybe there's other variants of the hypergraph
[03:14:33.880 --> 03:14:35.720]   that are very useful for reasoning about--
[03:14:35.720 --> 03:14:37.440]   - Well, we'll see whether the multi-way graph
[03:14:37.440 --> 03:14:40.640]   for a machine learning system is interesting, okay?
[03:14:40.640 --> 03:14:41.480]   (Luke laughs)
[03:14:41.480 --> 03:14:42.320]   - Let's leave it at that.
[03:14:42.320 --> 03:14:43.680]   That's conversation number three.
[03:14:43.680 --> 03:14:46.240]   - That's, we're not gonna go there right now.
[03:14:46.240 --> 03:14:49.040]   - One of the things you've mentioned
[03:14:49.040 --> 03:14:52.640]   is the space of all possible rules
[03:14:52.640 --> 03:14:55.200]   that we kind of discussed a little bit,
[03:14:55.200 --> 03:14:58.000]   that there could be, I guess,
[03:14:58.000 --> 03:14:59.900]   the set of possible rules is infinite.
[03:14:59.900 --> 03:15:02.720]   - Right, well, so here's the big,
[03:15:02.720 --> 03:15:04.200]   sort of one of the conundrums
[03:15:04.200 --> 03:15:07.080]   that I'm kind of trying to deal with,
[03:15:07.080 --> 03:15:11.720]   is let's say we think we found the rule for the universe.
[03:15:11.720 --> 03:15:14.200]   And we say, here it is, write it down.
[03:15:14.200 --> 03:15:15.780]   It's a little tiny thing.
[03:15:15.780 --> 03:15:18.000]   And then we say, gosh, that's really weird.
[03:15:18.000 --> 03:15:19.680]   Why did we get that one?
[03:15:20.840 --> 03:15:23.240]   And then we're in this whole situation
[03:15:23.240 --> 03:15:25.480]   because let's say it's fairly simple.
[03:15:25.480 --> 03:15:27.680]   How did we come up the winners,
[03:15:27.680 --> 03:15:30.400]   getting one of the simple possible universe rules?
[03:15:30.400 --> 03:15:33.600]   Why didn't we get some incredibly complicated rule?
[03:15:33.600 --> 03:15:35.280]   Why did we get one of the simpler ones?
[03:15:35.280 --> 03:15:38.800]   And that's the thing which, in the history of science,
[03:15:38.800 --> 03:15:42.840]   the whole sort of story of Copernicus and so on was,
[03:15:42.840 --> 03:15:44.960]   we used to think the Earth was the center of the universe,
[03:15:44.960 --> 03:15:46.320]   but now we find out it's not.
[03:15:46.320 --> 03:15:48.760]   And we're actually just in some random corner
[03:15:48.760 --> 03:15:51.580]   of some random galaxy out in this big universe.
[03:15:51.580 --> 03:15:53.800]   There's nothing special about us.
[03:15:53.800 --> 03:15:58.120]   So if we get universe number 317
[03:15:58.120 --> 03:16:00.400]   out of all the infinite number of possibilities,
[03:16:00.400 --> 03:16:02.920]   how do we get something that small and simple?
[03:16:02.920 --> 03:16:05.040]   So I was very confused by this.
[03:16:05.040 --> 03:16:06.740]   And it's like, what are we going to say about this?
[03:16:06.740 --> 03:16:08.560]   How are we going to explain this?
[03:16:08.560 --> 03:16:10.320]   And I thought it might be one of these things
[03:16:10.320 --> 03:16:13.300]   where you just, you can get it to the threshold,
[03:16:13.300 --> 03:16:15.480]   and then you find out its rule number such and such,
[03:16:15.480 --> 03:16:17.760]   and you just have no idea why it's like that.
[03:16:17.760 --> 03:16:19.120]   Okay, so then I realized
[03:16:19.120 --> 03:16:22.560]   it's actually more bizarre than that, okay?
[03:16:22.560 --> 03:16:25.020]   So we talked about multi-way graphs.
[03:16:25.020 --> 03:16:26.200]   We talked about this idea
[03:16:26.200 --> 03:16:29.020]   that you take these underlying transformation rules
[03:16:29.020 --> 03:16:31.840]   on these hypergraphs, and you apply them
[03:16:31.840 --> 03:16:34.720]   wherever the rule can apply, you apply it.
[03:16:34.720 --> 03:16:37.680]   And that makes this whole multi-way graph of possibilities.
[03:16:37.680 --> 03:16:39.960]   Okay, so let's go a little bit weirder.
[03:16:39.960 --> 03:16:42.820]   Let's say that at every place,
[03:16:42.820 --> 03:16:45.260]   not only do you apply a particular rule
[03:16:45.260 --> 03:16:47.160]   in all possible ways it can apply,
[03:16:47.160 --> 03:16:49.520]   but you apply all possible rules
[03:16:49.520 --> 03:16:51.920]   in all possible ways they can apply.
[03:16:51.920 --> 03:16:53.760]   As you say, that's just crazy.
[03:16:53.760 --> 03:16:54.920]   That's way too complicated.
[03:16:54.920 --> 03:16:57.240]   You're never going to be able to conclude anything.
[03:16:57.240 --> 03:17:00.840]   Okay, however, turns out that-
[03:17:00.840 --> 03:17:02.880]   - Don't tell me there's some kind of invariance.
[03:17:02.880 --> 03:17:03.880]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:17:03.880 --> 03:17:05.360]   (laughing)
[03:17:05.360 --> 03:17:06.200]   So what happens is-
[03:17:06.200 --> 03:17:08.080]   - Oh man, that would be amazing.
[03:17:08.080 --> 03:17:11.280]   - Right, so this thing that you get,
[03:17:11.280 --> 03:17:13.400]   there's this kind of ruleal multi-way graph,
[03:17:13.400 --> 03:17:15.920]   this multi-way graph that is a branching of rules
[03:17:15.920 --> 03:17:19.800]   as well as a branching of possible applications of rules.
[03:17:19.800 --> 03:17:22.100]   This thing has causal invariance.
[03:17:22.100 --> 03:17:25.360]   It's an inevitable feature that it shows causal invariance.
[03:17:25.360 --> 03:17:28.640]   And that means that you can take different reference frames,
[03:17:28.640 --> 03:17:30.960]   different ways of slicing this thing,
[03:17:30.960 --> 03:17:33.960]   and they will all in some sense be equivalent.
[03:17:33.960 --> 03:17:37.380]   If you make the right translation, they will be equivalent.
[03:17:37.380 --> 03:17:40.440]   So, okay, so the basic point here is-
[03:17:40.440 --> 03:17:43.080]   - If that's true, that would be beautiful.
[03:17:43.080 --> 03:17:44.400]   - It is true, and it is beautiful.
[03:17:44.400 --> 03:17:47.520]   - So it's not just an intuition, there is some-
[03:17:47.520 --> 03:17:50.280]   - No, no, no, there's real mathematics behind this.
[03:17:50.280 --> 03:17:55.280]   And it is, okay, so here's how it comes out.
[03:17:55.280 --> 03:17:57.360]   - That's amazing.
[03:17:57.360 --> 03:17:58.800]   - Right, so by the way, I mean,
[03:17:58.800 --> 03:18:01.160]   the mathematics it's connected to is the mathematics
[03:18:01.160 --> 03:18:03.640]   of higher category theory and groupoids
[03:18:03.640 --> 03:18:05.900]   and things like this, which I've always been afraid of,
[03:18:05.900 --> 03:18:09.960]   but now I'm finally wrapping my arms around it.
[03:18:09.960 --> 03:18:13.280]   But it's also related to,
[03:18:13.280 --> 03:18:16.160]   it also relates to computational complexity theory.
[03:18:16.160 --> 03:18:19.200]   It's also deeply related to the P versus NP problem
[03:18:19.200 --> 03:18:20.480]   and other things like this.
[03:18:20.480 --> 03:18:21.880]   Again, it seems completely bizarre
[03:18:21.880 --> 03:18:22.960]   that these things are connected,
[03:18:22.960 --> 03:18:25.160]   but here's why it's connected.
[03:18:25.160 --> 03:18:30.160]   This space of all possible, okay, so a Turing machine,
[03:18:30.160 --> 03:18:32.080]   very simple model of computation.
[03:18:32.080 --> 03:18:36.480]   You just got this tape where you write down ones and zeros
[03:18:36.480 --> 03:18:38.880]   or something on the tape, and you have this rule
[03:18:38.880 --> 03:18:41.520]   that says, you change the number,
[03:18:41.520 --> 03:18:44.320]   you move the head on the tape, et cetera.
[03:18:44.320 --> 03:18:46.040]   You have a definite rule for doing that.
[03:18:46.040 --> 03:18:47.880]   A deterministic Turing machine
[03:18:47.880 --> 03:18:50.000]   just does that deterministically.
[03:18:50.000 --> 03:18:51.800]   Given the configuration of the tape,
[03:18:51.800 --> 03:18:53.640]   it will always do the same thing.
[03:18:53.640 --> 03:18:55.800]   A non-deterministic Turing machine
[03:18:55.800 --> 03:18:59.000]   can have different choices that it makes at every step.
[03:18:59.000 --> 03:19:03.260]   And so, you know this stuff, you probably teach this stuff.
[03:19:07.120 --> 03:19:09.240]   So a non-deterministic Turing machine
[03:19:09.240 --> 03:19:11.720]   has the set of branching possibilities,
[03:19:11.720 --> 03:19:14.400]   which is in fact one of these multi-way graphs.
[03:19:14.400 --> 03:19:16.280]   And in fact, if you say,
[03:19:16.280 --> 03:19:19.560]   imagine the extremely non-deterministic Turing machine,
[03:19:19.560 --> 03:19:22.600]   the Turing machine that can just do,
[03:19:22.600 --> 03:19:25.480]   that takes any possible rule at each step.
[03:19:25.480 --> 03:19:27.560]   That is this real multi-way graph.
[03:19:27.560 --> 03:19:31.340]   The set of possible histories
[03:19:31.340 --> 03:19:33.760]   of that extreme non-deterministic Turing machine
[03:19:33.760 --> 03:19:35.360]   is a really a multi-way graph.
[03:19:36.820 --> 03:19:38.520]   - What term are you using, Rulio?
[03:19:38.520 --> 03:19:39.360]   - Rulio.
[03:19:39.360 --> 03:19:40.760]   - Rulio, I like it. - It's a weird word.
[03:19:40.760 --> 03:19:41.600]   Yeah, it's a weird word.
[03:19:41.600 --> 03:19:44.200]   - Rulio. - Multi-way graph.
[03:19:44.200 --> 03:19:45.920]   Okay, so this, so that.
[03:19:45.920 --> 03:19:50.920]   - I'm trying to think of the space of rules.
[03:19:50.920 --> 03:19:54.280]   So these are basic transformations.
[03:19:54.280 --> 03:19:57.080]   - So in a Turing machine, it's like it says,
[03:19:57.080 --> 03:19:59.800]   move left, move, you know, if it's a one,
[03:19:59.800 --> 03:20:02.360]   if it's a black square under the head,
[03:20:02.360 --> 03:20:04.880]   move left and right a green square.
[03:20:04.880 --> 03:20:05.760]   That's a rule.
[03:20:05.760 --> 03:20:06.780]   That's a very basic rule,
[03:20:06.780 --> 03:20:09.900]   but I'm trying to see the rules on the hypergraphs,
[03:20:09.900 --> 03:20:12.260]   how rich of the programs can they be?
[03:20:12.260 --> 03:20:15.580]   Or do they all ultimately just map into something simple?
[03:20:15.580 --> 03:20:18.060]   - Yeah, they're all, I mean, hypergraphs,
[03:20:18.060 --> 03:20:20.220]   that's another layer of complexity on this whole thing.
[03:20:20.220 --> 03:20:23.100]   You can think about these in transformations of hypergraphs,
[03:20:23.100 --> 03:20:23.940]   but Turing machines are a little bit simpler.
[03:20:23.940 --> 03:20:25.620]   - You should stick up with Turing machines, okay.
[03:20:25.620 --> 03:20:27.320]   - Right, they're a little bit simpler.
[03:20:27.320 --> 03:20:29.140]   So if you look at these extreme
[03:20:29.140 --> 03:20:30.980]   non-deterministic Turing machines,
[03:20:30.980 --> 03:20:35.180]   you're mapping out all the possible non-deterministic paths
[03:20:35.180 --> 03:20:37.220]   that the Turing machine can follow.
[03:20:37.220 --> 03:20:40.820]   And if you ask the question, can you reach,
[03:20:40.820 --> 03:20:43.260]   okay, so a deterministic Turing machine
[03:20:43.260 --> 03:20:44.860]   follows a single path.
[03:20:44.860 --> 03:20:46.340]   The non-deterministic Turing machine
[03:20:46.340 --> 03:20:50.740]   fills out this whole sort of ball of possibilities.
[03:20:50.740 --> 03:20:53.340]   And so then the P versus NP problem
[03:20:53.340 --> 03:20:55.220]   ends up being questions about,
[03:20:55.220 --> 03:20:56.820]   and we haven't completely figured out
[03:20:56.820 --> 03:20:57.660]   all the details of this,
[03:20:57.660 --> 03:20:59.980]   but it's basically has to do with questions
[03:20:59.980 --> 03:21:02.840]   about the growth of that ball
[03:21:02.840 --> 03:21:05.060]   relative to what happens with individual paths.
[03:21:05.060 --> 03:21:05.900]   And so on.
[03:21:05.900 --> 03:21:07.860]   So essentially there's a geometrization
[03:21:07.860 --> 03:21:10.180]   of the P versus NP problem that comes out of this.
[03:21:10.180 --> 03:21:12.060]   That's a sideshow, okay.
[03:21:12.060 --> 03:21:15.020]   The main event here is the statement
[03:21:15.020 --> 03:21:20.020]   that you can look at this multi-way graph
[03:21:20.020 --> 03:21:21.860]   where the branches correspond,
[03:21:21.860 --> 03:21:24.260]   not just to different applications of a single rule,
[03:21:24.260 --> 03:21:25.460]   but to different applications,
[03:21:25.460 --> 03:21:28.260]   to applications of different rules, okay.
[03:21:28.260 --> 03:21:32.020]   And that then that when you say,
[03:21:32.020 --> 03:21:35.500]   I'm going to be an observer embedded in that system,
[03:21:35.500 --> 03:21:37.020]   and I'm going to try and make sense
[03:21:37.020 --> 03:21:38.820]   of what's going on in the system.
[03:21:38.820 --> 03:21:40.200]   And to do that,
[03:21:40.200 --> 03:21:43.100]   I essentially am picking a reference frame.
[03:21:43.100 --> 03:21:46.620]   And that turns out to be, well, okay.
[03:21:46.620 --> 03:21:48.660]   So the way this comes out essentially
[03:21:48.660 --> 03:21:50.780]   is the reference frame you pick
[03:21:50.780 --> 03:21:52.700]   is the rule that you infer
[03:21:52.700 --> 03:21:55.340]   is what's going on in the universe.
[03:21:55.340 --> 03:21:58.940]   Even though all possible rules are being run,
[03:21:58.940 --> 03:22:01.260]   although all those possible rules
[03:22:01.260 --> 03:22:02.740]   are in a sense giving the same answer
[03:22:02.740 --> 03:22:04.580]   because of causal invariance.
[03:22:04.580 --> 03:22:08.500]   But what you see could be completely different.
[03:22:08.500 --> 03:22:10.380]   If you pick different reference frames,
[03:22:10.380 --> 03:22:12.940]   you essentially have a different description language
[03:22:12.940 --> 03:22:15.000]   for describing the universe.
[03:22:15.000 --> 03:22:17.340]   Okay, so what does this really mean in practice?
[03:22:17.340 --> 03:22:19.660]   So imagine there's us.
[03:22:19.660 --> 03:22:22.340]   We think about the universe in terms of space and time,
[03:22:22.340 --> 03:22:25.060]   and we have various kinds of description models and so on.
[03:22:25.060 --> 03:22:29.080]   Now let's imagine the friendly aliens, for example, right?
[03:22:29.080 --> 03:22:31.360]   How do they describe their universe?
[03:22:31.360 --> 03:22:33.480]   Well, our description of the universe
[03:22:33.480 --> 03:22:36.200]   probably is affected by the fact that
[03:22:36.200 --> 03:22:37.920]   we are about the size we are,
[03:22:37.920 --> 03:22:40.280]   a meter-ish tall, so to speak.
[03:22:40.280 --> 03:22:41.880]   We have brain processing speeds
[03:22:41.880 --> 03:22:43.720]   of about the speeds we have.
[03:22:43.720 --> 03:22:46.360]   We're not the size of planets, for example,
[03:22:46.360 --> 03:22:49.040]   where the speed of light really would matter.
[03:22:49.040 --> 03:22:50.060]   In our everyday life,
[03:22:50.060 --> 03:22:51.820]   the speed of light doesn't really matter.
[03:22:51.820 --> 03:22:52.960]   Everything can be,
[03:22:52.960 --> 03:22:55.240]   the fact that the speed of light is finite is irrelevant.
[03:22:55.240 --> 03:22:56.740]   It could as well be infinite.
[03:22:56.740 --> 03:22:58.760]   We wouldn't make any difference.
[03:22:58.760 --> 03:23:01.280]   It affects the ping times on the internet.
[03:23:01.280 --> 03:23:06.080]   That's about the level of how we notice the speed of light.
[03:23:06.080 --> 03:23:07.440]   In our sort of everyday existence,
[03:23:07.440 --> 03:23:09.400]   we don't really notice it.
[03:23:09.400 --> 03:23:12.280]   And so we have a way of describing the universe
[03:23:12.280 --> 03:23:14.920]   that's based on our sensory,
[03:23:14.920 --> 03:23:17.960]   our senses, these days,
[03:23:17.960 --> 03:23:20.760]   also on the mathematics we've constructed and so on.
[03:23:20.760 --> 03:23:24.200]   But the realization is it's not the only way to do it.
[03:23:24.200 --> 03:23:28.240]   There will be completely, utterly incoherent descriptions
[03:23:28.240 --> 03:23:30.880]   of the universe which correspond
[03:23:30.880 --> 03:23:34.280]   to different reference frames in this sort of ruleal space.
[03:23:34.280 --> 03:23:36.120]   - In the ruleal space, that's fascinating.
[03:23:36.120 --> 03:23:38.240]   So we have some kind of reference frame
[03:23:38.240 --> 03:23:39.400]   in this ruleal space.
[03:23:39.400 --> 03:23:40.240]   - Right.
[03:23:40.240 --> 03:23:41.720]   - And from that--
[03:23:41.720 --> 03:23:45.640]   - That's why we are attributing this rule to the universe.
[03:23:45.640 --> 03:23:47.240]   So in other words, when we say,
[03:23:47.240 --> 03:23:49.480]   "Why is it this rule and not another?"
[03:23:49.480 --> 03:23:54.480]   The answer is just shine the light back on us, so to speak.
[03:23:54.480 --> 03:23:57.280]   It's because of the reference frame that we've picked
[03:23:57.280 --> 03:23:59.000]   in our way of understanding what's happening
[03:23:59.000 --> 03:24:02.360]   in this sort of space of all possible rules and so on.
[03:24:02.360 --> 03:24:05.200]   - But also in the space from this reference frame,
[03:24:05.200 --> 03:24:11.160]   because of the ruleal, the invariance,
[03:24:11.160 --> 03:24:17.360]   that simple, that the rule on which the universe,
[03:24:17.360 --> 03:24:19.800]   with which you can run the universe,
[03:24:19.800 --> 03:24:21.320]   might as well be simple.
[03:24:21.320 --> 03:24:22.240]   - Yes, yes.
[03:24:22.240 --> 03:24:23.680]   Okay, so here's another point.
[03:24:23.680 --> 03:24:24.960]   So this is, again,
[03:24:25.040 --> 03:24:27.320]   these are a little bit mind twisting in some ways,
[03:24:27.320 --> 03:24:31.880]   but the, okay, another thing that's sort of we know
[03:24:31.880 --> 03:24:36.440]   from computation is this idea of computation universality.
[03:24:36.440 --> 03:24:38.840]   The fact that given that we have a program
[03:24:38.840 --> 03:24:40.680]   that runs on one kind of computer,
[03:24:40.680 --> 03:24:42.800]   we can as well, you know,
[03:24:42.800 --> 03:24:45.360]   we can convert it to run on any other kind of computer.
[03:24:45.360 --> 03:24:47.880]   We can emulate one kind of computer with another.
[03:24:47.880 --> 03:24:50.240]   So that might lead you to say,
[03:24:50.240 --> 03:24:52.760]   "Well, you think you have the rule for the universe,
[03:24:52.760 --> 03:24:54.840]   but you might as well be running it on a Turing machine,
[03:24:54.840 --> 03:24:59.000]   because we know we can emulate any computational rule
[03:24:59.000 --> 03:25:00.920]   on any kind of machine."
[03:25:00.920 --> 03:25:02.320]   And that's essentially the same thing
[03:25:02.320 --> 03:25:03.680]   that's being said here.
[03:25:03.680 --> 03:25:07.320]   That is that what we're doing is we're saying
[03:25:07.320 --> 03:25:10.440]   these different interpretations of physics
[03:25:10.440 --> 03:25:13.400]   correspond to essentially running physics
[03:25:13.400 --> 03:25:16.040]   on different underlying, you know,
[03:25:16.040 --> 03:25:18.160]   thinking about the physics as running in different,
[03:25:18.160 --> 03:25:19.520]   with different underlying rules,
[03:25:19.520 --> 03:25:22.960]   as if different underlying computers were running them.
[03:25:22.960 --> 03:25:26.040]   And, but because of computation universality,
[03:25:26.040 --> 03:25:26.880]   or more accurately,
[03:25:26.880 --> 03:25:27.720]   because of this principle
[03:25:27.720 --> 03:25:30.360]   of computational equivalence thing of mine,
[03:25:30.360 --> 03:25:32.040]   there's, they are,
[03:25:32.040 --> 03:25:35.760]   these things are ultimately equivalent.
[03:25:35.760 --> 03:25:38.120]   So the only thing that is the ultimate fact
[03:25:38.120 --> 03:25:39.440]   about the universe,
[03:25:39.440 --> 03:25:41.520]   the ultimate fact that doesn't depend on any of these,
[03:25:41.520 --> 03:25:43.760]   you know, we don't have to talk about specific rules,
[03:25:43.760 --> 03:25:44.640]   et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[03:25:44.640 --> 03:25:48.360]   The ultimate fact is the universe is computational,
[03:25:48.360 --> 03:25:52.640]   and it is the things that happen in the universe
[03:25:52.640 --> 03:25:54.400]   are the kinds of computations
[03:25:54.400 --> 03:25:56.000]   that the principle of computational equivalence
[03:25:56.000 --> 03:25:57.560]   says should happen.
[03:25:57.560 --> 03:25:59.480]   Now, that might sound like,
[03:25:59.480 --> 03:26:01.560]   hey, you're not really saying anything there,
[03:26:01.560 --> 03:26:03.920]   but you are, because you can,
[03:26:03.920 --> 03:26:06.640]   you could in principle have a hypercomputer
[03:26:06.640 --> 03:26:09.720]   that things that take an ordinary computer
[03:26:09.720 --> 03:26:10.800]   an infinite time to do,
[03:26:10.800 --> 03:26:11.920]   the hypercomputer can just say,
[03:26:11.920 --> 03:26:13.440]   "Oh, I know the answer.
[03:26:13.440 --> 03:26:15.720]   It's this, immediately."
[03:26:15.720 --> 03:26:19.600]   What this is saying is the universe is not a hypercomputer.
[03:26:19.600 --> 03:26:23.040]   It's not simpler than an ordinary Turing machine
[03:26:23.040 --> 03:26:24.040]   type computer.
[03:26:24.040 --> 03:26:28.080]   It's exactly like an ordinary Turing machine type computer.
[03:26:28.080 --> 03:26:30.040]   And so that's in the end,
[03:26:30.040 --> 03:26:34.000]   the sort of net net conclusion is that's the thing
[03:26:34.000 --> 03:26:36.600]   that is the sort of the hard immovable fact
[03:26:36.600 --> 03:26:38.000]   about the universe.
[03:26:38.000 --> 03:26:41.600]   That's sort of the fundamental principle of the universe
[03:26:41.600 --> 03:26:45.440]   is that it is computational and not hypercomputational
[03:26:45.440 --> 03:26:47.280]   and not sort of infracomputational.
[03:26:47.280 --> 03:26:50.360]   It is this level of computational ability
[03:26:50.360 --> 03:26:53.080]   and it kind of has,
[03:26:53.080 --> 03:26:56.120]   and that's sort of the core fact.
[03:26:56.120 --> 03:26:59.200]   But now, this idea that you can have
[03:26:59.200 --> 03:27:02.280]   these different kind of ruleal reference frames,
[03:27:02.280 --> 03:27:05.280]   these different description languages for the universe,
[03:27:05.280 --> 03:27:08.800]   it makes me, I used to think, okay,
[03:27:08.800 --> 03:27:09.840]   imagine the aliens,
[03:27:09.840 --> 03:27:12.600]   imagine the extraterrestrial intelligence thing,
[03:27:12.600 --> 03:27:15.560]   at least they experienced the same physics.
[03:27:15.560 --> 03:27:17.440]   And now I've realized it isn't true.
[03:27:17.440 --> 03:27:19.240]   - They could have a different ruleal frame.
[03:27:19.240 --> 03:27:21.120]   That's fascinating.
[03:27:21.120 --> 03:27:25.160]   - They can end up with a description of the universe
[03:27:25.160 --> 03:27:28.040]   that is utterly, utterly incoherent with ours.
[03:27:28.040 --> 03:27:31.320]   And that's also interesting in terms of how we think about,
[03:27:31.320 --> 03:27:34.240]   well, intelligence, the nature of intelligence and so on.
[03:27:34.240 --> 03:27:35.360]   I'm fond of the quote,
[03:27:35.360 --> 03:27:37.400]   "The weather has a mind of its own,"
[03:27:37.400 --> 03:27:41.040]   because these are sort of computationally,
[03:27:41.040 --> 03:27:43.600]   that system is computationally equivalent
[03:27:43.600 --> 03:27:46.560]   to the system that is our brains and so on.
[03:27:46.560 --> 03:27:50.320]   And what's different is we don't have a way to understand
[03:27:50.320 --> 03:27:52.480]   what the weather is trying to do, so to speak.
[03:27:52.480 --> 03:27:54.880]   We have a story about what's happening in our brains.
[03:27:54.880 --> 03:27:56.680]   We don't have a sort of connection
[03:27:56.680 --> 03:27:57.800]   to what's happening there.
[03:27:57.800 --> 03:27:59.680]   - So we actually, it's funny,
[03:27:59.680 --> 03:28:03.280]   last time we talked, maybe over a year ago,
[03:28:03.280 --> 03:28:07.320]   we talked about how it was more
[03:28:07.320 --> 03:28:09.960]   based on your work with Arrival.
[03:28:09.960 --> 03:28:11.600]   We talked about how would we communicate
[03:28:11.600 --> 03:28:14.160]   with alien intelligences.
[03:28:14.160 --> 03:28:18.000]   Can you maybe comment on how we might,
[03:28:18.000 --> 03:28:20.680]   how the Wolfram Physics Project changed your view
[03:28:20.680 --> 03:28:22.200]   of how we might be able to communicate
[03:28:22.200 --> 03:28:23.280]   with alien intelligence?
[03:28:23.280 --> 03:28:27.040]   Like if they showed up, is it possible that
[03:28:27.040 --> 03:28:31.800]   because of our comprehension of the physics of the world
[03:28:31.800 --> 03:28:33.640]   might be completely different,
[03:28:33.640 --> 03:28:36.640]   we would just not be able to communicate at all?
[03:28:36.640 --> 03:28:38.040]   - Here's the thing.
[03:28:38.040 --> 03:28:41.520]   Intelligence is everywhere.
[03:28:41.520 --> 03:28:43.800]   The fact, this idea that there's this notion of,
[03:28:43.800 --> 03:28:45.080]   oh, there's gonna be this amazing
[03:28:45.080 --> 03:28:46.400]   extraterrestrial intelligence
[03:28:46.400 --> 03:28:48.760]   and it's gonna be this unique thing,
[03:28:48.760 --> 03:28:50.080]   it's just not true.
[03:28:50.080 --> 03:28:51.360]   It's the same thing.
[03:28:51.360 --> 03:28:53.240]   You know, I think people will realize this
[03:28:53.240 --> 03:28:54.840]   about the time when people decide
[03:28:54.840 --> 03:28:57.280]   that artificial intelligences are kind of
[03:28:57.280 --> 03:29:01.160]   just natural things that are like human intelligences.
[03:29:01.160 --> 03:29:04.520]   They'll realize that extraterrestrial intelligences
[03:29:04.520 --> 03:29:08.600]   or intelligences associated with physical systems and so on,
[03:29:08.600 --> 03:29:09.440]   it's all the same kind of thing.
[03:29:09.440 --> 03:29:11.120]   - It's ultimately computation.
[03:29:11.120 --> 03:29:12.080]   It's all the same.
[03:29:12.080 --> 03:29:13.280]   It's all just computation.
[03:29:13.280 --> 03:29:17.160]   And the issue is, are you sort of inside it?
[03:29:17.160 --> 03:29:19.200]   Are you thinking about it?
[03:29:19.200 --> 03:29:23.160]   Do you have sort of a story you're telling yourself about it?
[03:29:23.160 --> 03:29:25.160]   And, you know, the weather could have a story
[03:29:25.160 --> 03:29:27.560]   it's telling itself about what it's doing.
[03:29:27.560 --> 03:29:30.880]   We just, it's utterly incoherent with the stories
[03:29:30.880 --> 03:29:33.560]   that we tell ourselves based on how our brains work.
[03:29:33.560 --> 03:29:37.080]   - I mean, ultimately it must be a question
[03:29:37.080 --> 03:29:39.280]   whether we can align.
[03:29:39.280 --> 03:29:40.120]   - Exactly, exactly.
[03:29:40.120 --> 03:29:41.960]   - Align with the kind of intelligence.
[03:29:41.960 --> 03:29:42.800]   - Right, right, right.
[03:29:42.800 --> 03:29:44.200]   - There's a systematic way of doing it.
[03:29:44.200 --> 03:29:45.520]   - Right, so the question is in the space
[03:29:45.520 --> 03:29:47.240]   of all possible intelligences,
[03:29:47.240 --> 03:29:50.440]   what's the, how do you think about the distance
[03:29:50.440 --> 03:29:52.400]   between description languages
[03:29:52.400 --> 03:29:54.680]   for one intelligence versus another?
[03:29:54.680 --> 03:29:57.120]   And needless to say, I have thought about this.
[03:29:57.120 --> 03:30:00.880]   And, you know, I don't have a great answer yet,
[03:30:00.880 --> 03:30:03.760]   but I think that's a thing where there will be things
[03:30:03.760 --> 03:30:05.080]   that can be said and there'll be things
[03:30:05.080 --> 03:30:07.800]   that where you can sort of start to characterize,
[03:30:07.800 --> 03:30:10.880]   you know, what is the translation distance
[03:30:10.880 --> 03:30:15.120]   between this, you know, version of the universe
[03:30:15.120 --> 03:30:17.840]   or this, you know, kind of set of computational rules
[03:30:17.840 --> 03:30:18.800]   and this other one.
[03:30:18.800 --> 03:30:21.480]   In fact, okay, so this is a, you know,
[03:30:21.480 --> 03:30:23.560]   there's this idea of algorithmic information theory.
[03:30:23.560 --> 03:30:25.800]   There's this question of sort of what is the,
[03:30:25.800 --> 03:30:28.700]   when you have some something,
[03:30:28.700 --> 03:30:31.520]   what is the sort of shortest description you can make of it
[03:30:31.520 --> 03:30:33.320]   where that description could be saying,
[03:30:33.320 --> 03:30:36.480]   run this program to get the thing, right?
[03:30:36.480 --> 03:30:41.480]   So I'm pretty sure that there will be a physicalization
[03:30:41.480 --> 03:30:49.700]   of the idea of algorithmic information and that,
[03:30:49.700 --> 03:30:51.560]   okay, this is again, a little bit bizarre,
[03:30:51.560 --> 03:30:54.480]   but so I mentioned that there's the speed of light,
[03:30:54.480 --> 03:30:56.120]   maximum speed of information transmission
[03:30:56.120 --> 03:30:57.560]   in physical space.
[03:30:57.560 --> 03:30:59.840]   There's a maximum speed of information transmission
[03:30:59.840 --> 03:31:02.920]   in branchial space, which is a maximum entanglement speed.
[03:31:02.920 --> 03:31:05.240]   There's a maximum speed of information transmission
[03:31:05.240 --> 03:31:09.200]   in ruleal space, which has to do with a maximum speed
[03:31:09.200 --> 03:31:14.200]   of translation between different description languages.
[03:31:14.200 --> 03:31:17.480]   And again, I'm not fully wrapped my brain around this one.
[03:31:17.480 --> 03:31:20.120]   - Yeah, that one just blows my mind to think about that,
[03:31:20.120 --> 03:31:23.600]   but that starts getting closer to the, yeah, the--
[03:31:23.600 --> 03:31:26.360]   - It's kind of a physicalization, right.
[03:31:26.360 --> 03:31:29.960]   And it's also a physicalization of algorithmic information.
[03:31:29.960 --> 03:31:32.360]   And I think there's probably a connection between,
[03:31:32.360 --> 03:31:33.640]   I mean, there's probably a connection
[03:31:33.640 --> 03:31:36.600]   between the notion of energy and some of these things,
[03:31:36.600 --> 03:31:39.400]   which again, I hadn't seen all this coming.
[03:31:39.400 --> 03:31:41.120]   I've always been a little bit resistant
[03:31:41.120 --> 03:31:43.500]   to the idea of connecting physical energy
[03:31:43.500 --> 03:31:45.660]   to things in computation theory,
[03:31:45.660 --> 03:31:47.200]   but I think that's probably coming.
[03:31:47.200 --> 03:31:48.560]   - And that's what essentially at the core
[03:31:48.560 --> 03:31:52.000]   with the physics project is that you're connecting
[03:31:52.000 --> 03:31:55.560]   information theory with physics.
[03:31:55.560 --> 03:31:56.920]   - Yeah, it's computation.
[03:31:56.920 --> 03:31:59.580]   - Computation with our physical universe.
[03:31:59.580 --> 03:32:00.420]   - Yeah, right.
[03:32:00.420 --> 03:32:03.520]   I mean, the fact that our physical universe is,
[03:32:03.520 --> 03:32:05.760]   right, that we can think of it as a computation
[03:32:05.760 --> 03:32:08.760]   and that we can have discussions like,
[03:32:08.760 --> 03:32:11.040]   the theory of the physical universe
[03:32:11.040 --> 03:32:13.080]   is the same kind of a theory
[03:32:13.080 --> 03:32:15.520]   as the P versus NP problem and so on,
[03:32:15.520 --> 03:32:18.640]   is really, I think that's really interesting.
[03:32:18.640 --> 03:32:21.520]   And the fact that, well, okay,
[03:32:21.520 --> 03:32:24.240]   so this kind of brings me to one more thing
[03:32:24.240 --> 03:32:26.140]   that I have to in terms of this sort of unification
[03:32:26.140 --> 03:32:29.640]   of different ideas, which is metamathematics.
[03:32:29.640 --> 03:32:30.520]   - Yeah, let's talk about that.
[03:32:30.520 --> 03:32:31.680]   You mentioned that earlier.
[03:32:31.680 --> 03:32:34.760]   What the heck is mathematics and--
[03:32:34.760 --> 03:32:36.880]   - Okay, so here's what, here's, okay.
[03:32:36.880 --> 03:32:38.840]   So what is mathematics?
[03:32:38.840 --> 03:32:43.840]   Mathematics, sort of at a lowest level,
[03:32:43.840 --> 03:32:47.400]   one thinks of mathematics as you have certain axioms,
[03:32:47.400 --> 03:32:50.560]   you say, you know, you say things like X plus Y
[03:32:50.560 --> 03:32:51.840]   is the same as Y plus X.
[03:32:51.840 --> 03:32:55.320]   That's an axiom about addition.
[03:32:55.320 --> 03:32:57.360]   And then you say, we've got these axioms
[03:32:57.360 --> 03:33:00.560]   and from these axioms, we derive all these theorems
[03:33:00.560 --> 03:33:02.400]   that fill up the literature of mathematics.
[03:33:02.400 --> 03:33:04.760]   The activity of mathematicians
[03:33:04.760 --> 03:33:06.800]   is to derive all these theorems.
[03:33:06.800 --> 03:33:10.360]   Actually, the axioms of mathematics are very small.
[03:33:10.360 --> 03:33:12.480]   You can fit, you know, when I did my new kind
[03:33:12.480 --> 03:33:15.400]   of science book, I fit all of the standard axioms
[03:33:15.400 --> 03:33:17.760]   of mathematics on basically a page and a half.
[03:33:17.760 --> 03:33:19.620]   Not much stuff.
[03:33:19.620 --> 03:33:21.400]   It's like a very simple rule
[03:33:21.400 --> 03:33:23.980]   from which all of mathematics arises.
[03:33:23.980 --> 03:33:26.680]   The way it works, though, is a little different
[03:33:26.680 --> 03:33:31.680]   from the way things work in sort of a computation
[03:33:31.680 --> 03:33:33.480]   because in mathematics, what you're interested in
[03:33:33.480 --> 03:33:37.480]   is a proof and the proof says from here,
[03:33:37.480 --> 03:33:40.360]   you can use from this expression, for example,
[03:33:40.360 --> 03:33:43.080]   you can use these axioms to get to this other expression.
[03:33:43.080 --> 03:33:45.480]   So that proves these two things are equal.
[03:33:45.480 --> 03:33:49.080]   Okay, so we can begin to see how this is going to work.
[03:33:49.080 --> 03:33:51.380]   What's gonna happen is there are paths
[03:33:51.380 --> 03:33:53.420]   in metamathematical space.
[03:33:53.420 --> 03:33:57.680]   So what happens is each, two different ways to look at it.
[03:33:57.680 --> 03:33:59.920]   You can just look at it as mathematical expressions
[03:33:59.920 --> 03:34:02.680]   or you can look at it as mathematical statements,
[03:34:02.680 --> 03:34:05.200]   postulates or something, but either way,
[03:34:05.200 --> 03:34:07.880]   you think of these things and they are connected
[03:34:07.880 --> 03:34:11.500]   by these axioms.
[03:34:11.500 --> 03:34:14.140]   So in other words, you have some fact,
[03:34:14.140 --> 03:34:15.960]   you, or you have some expression,
[03:34:15.960 --> 03:34:18.860]   you apply this axiom, you get some other expression.
[03:34:18.860 --> 03:34:21.640]   And in general, given some expression,
[03:34:21.640 --> 03:34:23.920]   there may be many possible different expressions
[03:34:23.920 --> 03:34:24.880]   you can get.
[03:34:24.880 --> 03:34:27.360]   You basically build up a multi-way graph
[03:34:27.360 --> 03:34:31.160]   and a proof is a path through the multi-way graph
[03:34:31.160 --> 03:34:34.240]   that goes from one thing to another thing.
[03:34:34.240 --> 03:34:36.960]   The path tells you how did you get from one thing
[03:34:36.960 --> 03:34:37.800]   to the other thing?
[03:34:37.800 --> 03:34:40.720]   It's the story of how you got from this to that.
[03:34:40.720 --> 03:34:42.880]   The theorem is the thing at one end
[03:34:42.880 --> 03:34:44.680]   is equal to the thing at the other end.
[03:34:44.680 --> 03:34:46.920]   The proof is the path you go down
[03:34:46.920 --> 03:34:48.640]   to get from one thing to the other.
[03:34:48.640 --> 03:34:51.040]   - You mentioned that Gadel's incompleteness theorem
[03:34:51.040 --> 03:34:53.560]   is the natural, it fits naturally there.
[03:34:53.560 --> 03:34:54.400]   How does it fit?
[03:34:54.400 --> 03:34:55.920]   - Yeah, so what happens there is that
[03:34:55.920 --> 03:34:58.480]   the Gadel's theorem is basically saying
[03:34:58.480 --> 03:35:01.240]   that there are paths of infinite length.
[03:35:01.240 --> 03:35:03.120]   That is, that there's no upper bound.
[03:35:03.120 --> 03:35:04.240]   If you know these two things,
[03:35:04.240 --> 03:35:06.200]   you say, I'm trying to get from here to here,
[03:35:06.200 --> 03:35:07.940]   how long do I have to go?
[03:35:07.940 --> 03:35:10.840]   You say, well, I've looked at all the paths of length 10.
[03:35:10.840 --> 03:35:12.620]   Somebody says, that's not good enough.
[03:35:12.620 --> 03:35:14.720]   That path might be of length a billion.
[03:35:14.720 --> 03:35:17.400]   And there's no upper bound on how long that path is.
[03:35:17.400 --> 03:35:19.760]   And that's what leads to the incompleteness theorem.
[03:35:19.760 --> 03:35:24.520]   So, I mean, the thing that is kind of an emerging idea
[03:35:24.520 --> 03:35:26.200]   is you can start asking,
[03:35:26.200 --> 03:35:27.840]   what's the analog of Einstein's equations
[03:35:27.840 --> 03:35:29.760]   in metamathematical space?
[03:35:29.760 --> 03:35:31.160]   What's the analog of a black hole
[03:35:31.160 --> 03:35:33.160]   in metamathematical space?
[03:35:33.160 --> 03:35:34.940]   - What's the hope, so yeah,
[03:35:34.940 --> 03:35:37.040]   it's fascinating to model all the mathematics in this way.
[03:35:37.040 --> 03:35:38.480]   - Well, so here's what it is.
[03:35:38.480 --> 03:35:40.360]   This is mathematics in bulk.
[03:35:40.360 --> 03:35:44.040]   So human mathematicians have made a few million theorems.
[03:35:44.040 --> 03:35:45.840]   They published a few million theorems.
[03:35:45.840 --> 03:35:48.440]   But imagine the infinite future of mathematics.
[03:35:48.440 --> 03:35:50.440]   Apply something to mathematics
[03:35:50.440 --> 03:35:52.360]   that mathematics likes to apply to other things.
[03:35:52.360 --> 03:35:53.520]   Take a limit.
[03:35:53.520 --> 03:35:56.320]   What is the limit of the infinite future of mathematics?
[03:35:56.320 --> 03:35:57.560]   What does it look like?
[03:35:57.560 --> 03:35:59.560]   What is the continuum limit of mathematics?
[03:35:59.560 --> 03:36:01.960]   What is the, as you just fill in more and more
[03:36:01.960 --> 03:36:04.060]   and more theorems, what does it look like?
[03:36:04.060 --> 03:36:05.040]   What does it do?
[03:36:05.040 --> 03:36:07.380]   How does, what kinds of conclusions can you make?
[03:36:07.380 --> 03:36:09.800]   So for example, one thing I've just been doing
[03:36:09.800 --> 03:36:10.960]   is taking Euclid.
[03:36:10.960 --> 03:36:12.760]   So Euclid, very impressive.
[03:36:12.760 --> 03:36:14.240]   He had 10 axioms.
[03:36:14.240 --> 03:36:17.400]   He derived 465 theorems, okay?
[03:36:17.400 --> 03:36:21.360]   His book, you know, that was the sort of defining book
[03:36:21.360 --> 03:36:23.180]   of mathematics for 2000 years.
[03:36:23.180 --> 03:36:26.000]   So you can actually map out,
[03:36:26.000 --> 03:36:28.800]   I actually did this 20 years ago,
[03:36:28.800 --> 03:36:30.740]   but I've done it more seriously now.
[03:36:30.740 --> 03:36:32.680]   You can map out the theorem dependency
[03:36:32.680 --> 03:36:34.760]   of those 465 theorems.
[03:36:34.760 --> 03:36:37.520]   So from the axioms, you grow this graph,
[03:36:37.520 --> 03:36:39.220]   it's actually a multi-way graph,
[03:36:39.220 --> 03:36:42.420]   of how all these theorems get proved from other theorems.
[03:36:42.420 --> 03:36:45.240]   And so you can ask questions about, you know,
[03:36:45.240 --> 03:36:46.080]   well, you can ask things like,
[03:36:46.080 --> 03:36:47.560]   what's the hardest theorem in Euclid?
[03:36:47.560 --> 03:36:49.000]   The answer is, the hardest theorem is
[03:36:49.000 --> 03:36:50.980]   that there are five platonic solids.
[03:36:50.980 --> 03:36:52.800]   That turns out to be the hardest theorem in Euclid.
[03:36:52.800 --> 03:36:55.320]   That's actually his last theorem in all his books.
[03:36:55.320 --> 03:36:56.880]   That's the final-- - What's the hardness,
[03:36:56.880 --> 03:36:58.480]   the distance you have to travel?
[03:36:58.480 --> 03:37:01.080]   - Yeah, let's say it's 33 steps from the,
[03:37:01.080 --> 03:37:03.740]   the longest path in the graph is 33 steps.
[03:37:03.740 --> 03:37:07.400]   So that's the, there's a 33 step path you have to follow
[03:37:07.400 --> 03:37:10.920]   to go from the axioms, according to Euclid's proofs,
[03:37:10.920 --> 03:37:13.560]   to the statement there are five platonic solids.
[03:37:13.560 --> 03:37:15.560]   So, okay, so then-- - Great.
[03:37:15.560 --> 03:37:20.060]   - Then the question is, in, what does it mean,
[03:37:20.060 --> 03:37:24.520]   if you have this map, okay, so, in a sense,
[03:37:24.520 --> 03:37:27.960]   this meta-mathematical space is the infrastructural space
[03:37:27.960 --> 03:37:31.560]   of all possible theorems that you could prove in mathematics.
[03:37:31.560 --> 03:37:34.340]   That's the geometry of meta-mathematics.
[03:37:34.340 --> 03:37:37.120]   There's also the geography of mathematics.
[03:37:37.120 --> 03:37:40.760]   That is, where did people choose to live in space?
[03:37:40.760 --> 03:37:43.040]   And that's what, for example, exploring the sort
[03:37:43.040 --> 03:37:45.480]   of empirical meta-mathematics of Euclid is doing that.
[03:37:45.480 --> 03:37:48.360]   - Each individual, like, human mathematician,
[03:37:48.360 --> 03:37:49.860]   you can embed them into that space.
[03:37:49.860 --> 03:37:51.200]   I mean, they kind of live-- - Yeah, well,
[03:37:51.200 --> 03:37:52.040]   they represent a path in space.
[03:37:52.040 --> 03:37:53.640]   - The little path. - The things they do.
[03:37:53.640 --> 03:37:55.140]   - Maybe a set of paths. - Right.
[03:37:55.140 --> 03:37:58.480]   - So, like, a set of axioms that are chosen.
[03:37:58.480 --> 03:38:00.300]   - Right, so, for example, here's an example
[03:38:00.300 --> 03:38:01.960]   of a thing that I realized.
[03:38:01.960 --> 03:38:03.920]   So, one of the surprising things about,
[03:38:03.920 --> 03:38:06.060]   well, there are two surprising facts about math.
[03:38:06.060 --> 03:38:09.560]   One is that it's hard, and the other is that it's doable.
[03:38:09.560 --> 03:38:12.640]   Okay, so first question is, why is math hard?
[03:38:12.640 --> 03:38:15.000]   You know, you've got these axioms, they're very small.
[03:38:15.000 --> 03:38:17.640]   Why can't you just solve every problem in math easily?
[03:38:17.640 --> 03:38:19.120]   - Yeah, it's just logic.
[03:38:19.120 --> 03:38:21.280]   - Right, yeah, well, logic happens to be
[03:38:21.280 --> 03:38:23.120]   a particular special case that does have
[03:38:23.120 --> 03:38:25.280]   certain simplicity to it.
[03:38:25.280 --> 03:38:27.560]   But general mathematics, even arithmetic,
[03:38:27.560 --> 03:38:30.360]   already doesn't have the simplicity that logic has.
[03:38:30.360 --> 03:38:31.720]   - So, why is it hard?
[03:38:31.720 --> 03:38:33.840]   - Because of computational irreducibility.
[03:38:33.840 --> 03:38:34.680]   - Right.
[03:38:34.680 --> 03:38:38.900]   - Because what happens is, to know what's true,
[03:38:38.900 --> 03:38:40.720]   and this is this whole story about the path
[03:38:40.720 --> 03:38:43.000]   you have to follow, and how long is the path,
[03:38:43.000 --> 03:38:44.520]   and Gödel's theorem is the statement
[03:38:44.520 --> 03:38:47.720]   that the path is not a bounded length,
[03:38:47.720 --> 03:38:50.480]   but the fact that the path is not always compressible
[03:38:50.480 --> 03:38:52.480]   to something tiny is a story
[03:38:52.480 --> 03:38:54.500]   of computational irreducibility.
[03:38:54.500 --> 03:38:56.840]   So, that's why math is hard.
[03:38:56.840 --> 03:38:59.540]   Now, the next question is, why is math doable?
[03:38:59.540 --> 03:39:01.560]   Because it might be the case that most things
[03:39:01.560 --> 03:39:04.240]   you care about don't have finite length paths.
[03:39:04.240 --> 03:39:06.760]   Most things you care about might be things
[03:39:06.760 --> 03:39:09.000]   where you get lost in the sea of computational
[03:39:09.000 --> 03:39:12.580]   irreducibility and worse, undecidability.
[03:39:12.580 --> 03:39:14.780]   That is, there's just no finite length path
[03:39:14.780 --> 03:39:15.860]   that gets you there.
[03:39:15.860 --> 03:39:19.100]   Why is mathematics doable?
[03:39:19.100 --> 03:39:22.260]   Gödel proved his incompleteness theorem in 1931.
[03:39:22.260 --> 03:39:25.260]   Most working mathematicians don't really care about it.
[03:39:25.260 --> 03:39:27.260]   They just go ahead and do mathematics,
[03:39:27.260 --> 03:39:29.220]   even though it could be that the questions
[03:39:29.220 --> 03:39:31.060]   they're asking are undecidable.
[03:39:31.060 --> 03:39:32.920]   It could have been that Fermat's last theorem
[03:39:32.920 --> 03:39:33.760]   is undecidable.
[03:39:33.760 --> 03:39:35.160]   It turned out it had a proof.
[03:39:35.160 --> 03:39:37.020]   It's a long, complicated proof.
[03:39:37.020 --> 03:39:40.240]   The twin prime conjecture might be undecidable.
[03:39:40.240 --> 03:39:43.060]   The Riemann hypothesis might be undecidable.
[03:39:43.060 --> 03:39:45.960]   These things might be, the axioms of mathematics
[03:39:45.960 --> 03:39:49.060]   might not be strong enough to reach those statements.
[03:39:49.060 --> 03:39:51.440]   It might be the case that depending on what axioms
[03:39:51.440 --> 03:39:53.460]   you choose, you can either say that's true
[03:39:53.460 --> 03:39:54.820]   or that's not true.
[03:39:54.820 --> 03:39:57.700]   - And by the way, Fermat's last theorem,
[03:39:57.700 --> 03:39:59.460]   it could be a shorter path.
[03:39:59.460 --> 03:40:00.420]   - Absolutely.
[03:40:00.420 --> 03:40:03.760]   Yeah, so the notion of geodesics in metamathematical space
[03:40:03.760 --> 03:40:07.300]   is a notion of shortest proofs in metamathematical space.
[03:40:07.300 --> 03:40:09.440]   And that's a, you know, human mathematicians
[03:40:09.440 --> 03:40:11.420]   do not find shortest paths,
[03:40:11.420 --> 03:40:13.980]   nor do automated theorem provers.
[03:40:13.980 --> 03:40:16.140]   But the fact, and by the way,
[03:40:16.140 --> 03:40:18.820]   I mean, this stuff is so bizarrely connected.
[03:40:18.820 --> 03:40:21.700]   I mean, if you're into automated theorem proving,
[03:40:21.700 --> 03:40:23.540]   there are these so-called critical pair lemmas
[03:40:23.540 --> 03:40:24.940]   in automated theorem proving.
[03:40:24.940 --> 03:40:28.620]   Those are precisely the branch pairs in our,
[03:40:28.620 --> 03:40:30.620]   that in multi-way graphs.
[03:40:30.620 --> 03:40:32.980]   Let me just finish on the why mathematics is doable.
[03:40:32.980 --> 03:40:34.140]   - Oh yes, the second part.
[03:40:34.140 --> 03:40:35.780]   So we know why it's hard.
[03:40:35.780 --> 03:40:36.700]   Why is it doable?
[03:40:36.700 --> 03:40:38.180]   - Right, why do we not just get lost
[03:40:38.180 --> 03:40:39.600]   in undecidability all the time?
[03:40:39.600 --> 03:40:40.600]   - Yeah.
[03:40:40.600 --> 03:40:43.200]   - So, and here's another fact,
[03:40:43.200 --> 03:40:45.440]   is in doing computer experiments
[03:40:45.440 --> 03:40:47.060]   and doing experimental mathematics,
[03:40:47.060 --> 03:40:49.060]   you do get lost in that way.
[03:40:49.060 --> 03:40:53.900]   When you just say, I'm picking a random integer equation,
[03:40:53.900 --> 03:40:56.220]   how do I, does it have a solution or not?
[03:40:56.220 --> 03:40:57.440]   And you just pick it at random
[03:40:57.440 --> 03:41:00.940]   without any human sort of path getting there.
[03:41:00.940 --> 03:41:03.320]   Often, it's really, really hard.
[03:41:03.320 --> 03:41:04.780]   It's really hard to answer those questions.
[03:41:04.780 --> 03:41:07.880]   We just pick them at random from the space of possibilities.
[03:41:07.880 --> 03:41:10.740]   But what I think is happening is,
[03:41:10.740 --> 03:41:12.500]   and that's a case where you just fell off
[03:41:12.500 --> 03:41:15.580]   into this ocean of sort of irreducibility and so on.
[03:41:15.580 --> 03:41:16.620]   What's happening is,
[03:41:16.620 --> 03:41:19.940]   human mathematics is a story of building a path.
[03:41:19.940 --> 03:41:23.260]   You started off, you're always building out
[03:41:23.260 --> 03:41:25.740]   on this path where you are proving things.
[03:41:25.740 --> 03:41:28.160]   You've got this proof trajectory,
[03:41:28.160 --> 03:41:30.340]   and you're basically, human mathematics
[03:41:30.340 --> 03:41:34.200]   is the sort of the exploration of the world
[03:41:34.200 --> 03:41:36.780]   along this proof trajectory, so to speak.
[03:41:36.780 --> 03:41:41.780]   You're not just parachuting in from anywhere,
[03:41:41.780 --> 03:41:44.860]   you're following Lewis and Clark or whatever.
[03:41:44.860 --> 03:41:48.180]   You're actually going, doing the path.
[03:41:48.180 --> 03:41:52.100]   And the fact that you are constrained to go along that path
[03:41:52.100 --> 03:41:53.780]   is the reason you don't end up with,
[03:41:53.780 --> 03:41:55.100]   every so often, you'll see a little piece
[03:41:55.100 --> 03:41:58.020]   of undecidability and you'll avoid that part of the path.
[03:41:58.020 --> 03:41:59.340]   But that's basically the story
[03:41:59.340 --> 03:42:02.660]   of why human mathematics has seemed to be doable.
[03:42:02.660 --> 03:42:05.220]   It's a story of exploring these paths
[03:42:05.220 --> 03:42:08.900]   that are by their nature, they have been constructed
[03:42:08.900 --> 03:42:10.500]   to be paths that can be followed.
[03:42:10.500 --> 03:42:12.260]   And so you can follow them further.
[03:42:12.260 --> 03:42:14.900]   Now, why is this relevant to anything?
[03:42:14.900 --> 03:42:19.460]   So, okay, so here's my belief.
[03:42:19.460 --> 03:42:23.980]   The fact that human mathematics works that way is,
[03:42:23.980 --> 03:42:26.060]   I think there's some sort of connections
[03:42:26.060 --> 03:42:29.700]   between the way that observers work in physics
[03:42:29.700 --> 03:42:32.060]   and the way that the axiom systems of mathematics
[03:42:32.060 --> 03:42:34.900]   are set up to make mathematics be doable
[03:42:34.900 --> 03:42:36.340]   in that kind of way.
[03:42:36.340 --> 03:42:38.860]   And so, in other words, in particular,
[03:42:38.860 --> 03:42:41.700]   I think there is an analog of causal invariance,
[03:42:41.700 --> 03:42:44.820]   which I think is, and this is again,
[03:42:44.820 --> 03:42:46.620]   it's sort of the upper reaches of mathematics
[03:42:46.620 --> 03:42:50.660]   and stuff that it's a thing,
[03:42:50.660 --> 03:42:52.900]   there's this thing called homotopy type theory,
[03:42:52.900 --> 03:42:56.100]   which is an abstract, it's came out of category theory,
[03:42:56.100 --> 03:42:58.380]   and it's sort of an abstraction of mathematics.
[03:42:58.380 --> 03:43:00.340]   Mathematics itself is an abstraction,
[03:43:00.340 --> 03:43:03.980]   but it's an abstraction of the abstraction of mathematics.
[03:43:03.980 --> 03:43:06.620]   And there is the thing called the univalence axiom,
[03:43:06.620 --> 03:43:11.620]   which is a sort of a key axiom in that set of ideas.
[03:43:11.620 --> 03:43:14.180]   And I'm pretty sure the univalence axiom
[03:43:14.180 --> 03:43:16.220]   is equivalent to causal invariance.
[03:43:16.220 --> 03:43:18.100]   - What was the term used again?
[03:43:18.100 --> 03:43:18.980]   - Univalence.
[03:43:18.980 --> 03:43:21.580]   - Is that something for somebody like me accessible?
[03:43:21.580 --> 03:43:23.260]   Or is this?
[03:43:23.260 --> 03:43:25.540]   - There's a statement of it that's fairly accessible.
[03:43:25.540 --> 03:43:27.100]   I mean, the statement of it is,
[03:43:27.100 --> 03:43:32.740]   basically it says things which are equivalent
[03:43:32.740 --> 03:43:34.620]   can be considered to be identical.
[03:43:34.620 --> 03:43:38.140]   - In which space?
[03:43:38.140 --> 03:43:40.420]   - Yeah, it's in higher category.
[03:43:40.420 --> 03:43:41.660]   - Okay, in category theory.
[03:43:41.660 --> 03:43:43.860]   - Okay, so it's a, but I mean,
[03:43:43.860 --> 03:43:46.140]   the thing just to give a sketch of how that works,
[03:43:46.140 --> 03:43:49.660]   so category theory is an attempt to idealize,
[03:43:49.660 --> 03:43:52.020]   it's an attempt to sort of have a formal theory
[03:43:52.020 --> 03:43:54.380]   of mathematics that is at a sort of higher level
[03:43:54.380 --> 03:43:55.580]   than mathematics.
[03:43:55.580 --> 03:43:59.540]   It's where you just think about these mathematical objects
[03:43:59.540 --> 03:44:01.820]   and these categories of objects
[03:44:01.820 --> 03:44:05.540]   and these morphisms, these connections between categories.
[03:44:05.540 --> 03:44:08.580]   Okay, so it turns out the morphisms and categories,
[03:44:08.580 --> 03:44:12.780]   at least weak categories, are very much like the paths
[03:44:12.780 --> 03:44:14.780]   in our hypergraphs and things.
[03:44:14.780 --> 03:44:18.420]   And it turns out, again, this is where it all gets crazy.
[03:44:18.420 --> 03:44:20.740]   I mean, it's the fact that these things are connected
[03:44:20.740 --> 03:44:21.940]   is just bizarre.
[03:44:21.940 --> 03:44:26.940]   So category theory, our causal graphs
[03:44:26.940 --> 03:44:29.900]   are like second order category theory.
[03:44:29.900 --> 03:44:32.620]   And it turns out you can take the limits
[03:44:32.620 --> 03:44:34.140]   of infinite order category theory.
[03:44:34.140 --> 03:44:36.460]   So just give roughly the idea.
[03:44:36.460 --> 03:44:39.100]   This is a roughly explainable idea.
[03:44:39.100 --> 03:44:43.380]   So a mathematical proof will be a path
[03:44:43.380 --> 03:44:45.900]   that says you can get from this thing to this other thing.
[03:44:45.900 --> 03:44:47.460]   And here's the path that you get from this thing
[03:44:47.460 --> 03:44:48.700]   to this other thing.
[03:44:48.700 --> 03:44:51.140]   But in general, there may be many paths,
[03:44:51.140 --> 03:44:53.940]   many proofs that get you many different paths
[03:44:53.940 --> 03:44:55.780]   that all successfully go from this thing
[03:44:55.780 --> 03:44:57.660]   to this other thing, okay?
[03:44:57.660 --> 03:45:00.380]   Now you can define a higher order proof,
[03:45:00.380 --> 03:45:03.820]   which is a proof of the equivalence of those proofs.
[03:45:03.820 --> 03:45:05.100]   Okay, so you're saying there's a--
[03:45:05.100 --> 03:45:07.100]   - Path between those proofs, essentially.
[03:45:07.100 --> 03:45:09.780]   - Yes, a path between the paths, okay?
[03:45:09.780 --> 03:45:10.940]   And so you do that.
[03:45:10.940 --> 03:45:12.260]   That's the sort of second order thing.
[03:45:12.260 --> 03:45:16.100]   That path between the paths is essentially related
[03:45:16.100 --> 03:45:18.180]   to our causal graphs.
[03:45:18.180 --> 03:45:20.300]   Then you take the limit-- - Ah, wow, okay.
[03:45:20.300 --> 03:45:22.980]   - Path between path between path between path,
[03:45:22.980 --> 03:45:26.060]   the infinite limit, that infinite limit turns out
[03:45:26.060 --> 03:45:28.700]   to be our Rullio multiway system.
[03:45:28.700 --> 03:45:31.500]   - Yeah, the Rullio multiway system,
[03:45:31.500 --> 03:45:33.780]   that's a fascinating thing, both in the physics world
[03:45:33.780 --> 03:45:35.500]   and as you're saying now. - Yeah, yeah.
[03:45:35.500 --> 03:45:36.860]   - That's fascinating.
[03:45:36.860 --> 03:45:39.020]   I'm not sure I've loaded it in completely, but--
[03:45:39.020 --> 03:45:40.220]   - Well, I'm not sure I have either.
[03:45:40.220 --> 03:45:41.420]   And it may be one of these things
[03:45:41.420 --> 03:45:44.580]   where in another five years or something,
[03:45:44.580 --> 03:45:47.100]   it's like, this was obvious, but I didn't see it.
[03:45:47.100 --> 03:45:49.300]   No, but the thing which is sort of interesting to me
[03:45:49.300 --> 03:45:53.060]   is that there's sort of an upper reach of mathematics,
[03:45:53.060 --> 03:45:54.780]   of the abstraction of mathematics.
[03:45:55.860 --> 03:45:58.980]   This thing, there's this mathematician called Grothendieck
[03:45:58.980 --> 03:46:00.500]   who's generally viewed as being sort of
[03:46:00.500 --> 03:46:03.020]   one of the most abstract, sort of creator
[03:46:03.020 --> 03:46:07.860]   of the most abstract mathematics of 1970s-ish timeframe.
[03:46:07.860 --> 03:46:11.500]   And one of the things that he constructed was this thing
[03:46:11.500 --> 03:46:13.220]   he called the infinity groupoid.
[03:46:13.220 --> 03:46:15.780]   And he has this sort of hypothesis
[03:46:15.780 --> 03:46:18.340]   about the inevitable appearance of geometry
[03:46:18.340 --> 03:46:22.380]   from essentially logic in the structure of this thing.
[03:46:22.380 --> 03:46:24.620]   Well, it turns out this Rullio multiway system
[03:46:24.620 --> 03:46:26.540]   is the infinity groupoid.
[03:46:26.540 --> 03:46:29.620]   So it's this limiting object,
[03:46:29.620 --> 03:46:33.500]   and this is an instance of that limiting object.
[03:46:33.500 --> 03:46:35.420]   So what to me is, I mean, again,
[03:46:35.420 --> 03:46:37.940]   I've been always afraid of this kind of mathematics
[03:46:37.940 --> 03:46:42.220]   because it seemed incomprehensibly abstract to me.
[03:46:42.220 --> 03:46:45.540]   But what I'm sort of excited about with this
[03:46:45.540 --> 03:46:49.220]   is that we've sort of concretified
[03:46:49.220 --> 03:46:51.820]   the way that you can reach this kind of mathematics,
[03:46:51.820 --> 03:46:55.220]   which makes it, well, both seem more relevant
[03:46:55.220 --> 03:46:57.380]   and also the fact that that, you know,
[03:46:57.380 --> 03:46:59.940]   I don't yet know exactly what mileage we're gonna get
[03:46:59.940 --> 03:47:03.300]   from using the sort of the apparatus that's been built
[03:47:03.300 --> 03:47:06.460]   in those areas of mathematics to analyze what we're doing.
[03:47:06.460 --> 03:47:07.300]   But the thing that's--
[03:47:07.300 --> 03:47:09.100]   - So both ways, using the mathematics
[03:47:09.100 --> 03:47:11.060]   to understand what you're doing and using,
[03:47:11.060 --> 03:47:12.300]   what you're doing computationally
[03:47:12.300 --> 03:47:13.140]   to understand that mathematics.
[03:47:13.140 --> 03:47:14.180]   - Right, so for example,
[03:47:14.180 --> 03:47:17.820]   the understanding of metamathematical space,
[03:47:17.820 --> 03:47:19.820]   one of the reasons I really want to do that
[03:47:19.820 --> 03:47:22.580]   is because I want to understand quantum mechanics better.
[03:47:22.580 --> 03:47:25.940]   And that, what you see, you know,
[03:47:25.940 --> 03:47:30.220]   we live that kind of the multi-way graph of mathematics
[03:47:30.220 --> 03:47:32.500]   because we actually know this is a theorem we've heard of.
[03:47:32.500 --> 03:47:33.980]   This is another one we've heard of.
[03:47:33.980 --> 03:47:36.860]   We can actually say these are actual things in the world
[03:47:36.860 --> 03:47:40.700]   that we relate to, which we can't really do as readily
[03:47:40.700 --> 03:47:43.020]   for the physics case.
[03:47:43.020 --> 03:47:45.140]   And so it's kind of a way to help my intuition.
[03:47:45.140 --> 03:47:47.780]   It's also, you know, there are bizarre things
[03:47:47.780 --> 03:47:49.980]   like what's the analog of Einstein's equations
[03:47:49.980 --> 03:47:51.860]   in metamathematical space?
[03:47:51.860 --> 03:47:53.740]   What's the analog of a black hole?
[03:47:53.740 --> 03:47:55.740]   You know, it turns out it looks like,
[03:47:55.740 --> 03:47:57.620]   not completely sure yet,
[03:47:57.620 --> 03:48:00.140]   but there's this notion of non-constructive proofs
[03:48:00.140 --> 03:48:01.460]   in mathematics.
[03:48:01.460 --> 03:48:04.420]   And I think those relate to, well, actually,
[03:48:04.420 --> 03:48:10.380]   they relate to things related to event horizons.
[03:48:10.380 --> 03:48:13.460]   So the fact that you can take ideas from physics,
[03:48:13.460 --> 03:48:14.420]   like event horizons--
[03:48:14.420 --> 03:48:16.740]   - And map them into the same kind of space--
[03:48:16.740 --> 03:48:17.980]   - It's really--
[03:48:17.980 --> 03:48:22.980]   - Do you think you might stumble upon some breakthrough
[03:48:22.980 --> 03:48:28.300]   ideas in theorem proving, like from the other direction?
[03:48:28.300 --> 03:48:29.540]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:48:29.540 --> 03:48:32.140]   No, I mean, what's really nice is that we are using,
[03:48:32.140 --> 03:48:35.620]   so this absolutely directly maps to theorem proving.
[03:48:35.620 --> 03:48:37.220]   So paths and multi-way graphs,
[03:48:37.220 --> 03:48:38.500]   that's what a theorem prover is trying to do.
[03:48:38.500 --> 03:48:40.780]   - But I also mean like automated theorem proving.
[03:48:40.780 --> 03:48:41.620]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:48:41.620 --> 03:48:43.700]   That's what, right, so the finding of paths,
[03:48:43.700 --> 03:48:46.820]   the finding of shortest paths or finding of paths at all
[03:48:46.820 --> 03:48:48.780]   is what automated theorem provers do.
[03:48:48.780 --> 03:48:50.980]   And actually what we've been doing,
[03:48:50.980 --> 03:48:53.740]   so we've actually been using automated theorem proving
[03:48:53.740 --> 03:48:56.300]   both in the physics project to prove things
[03:48:56.300 --> 03:49:00.500]   and using that as a way to understand multi-way graphs.
[03:49:00.500 --> 03:49:04.060]   And because what an automated theorem prover is doing
[03:49:04.060 --> 03:49:07.380]   is it's trying to find a path through a multi-way graph.
[03:49:07.380 --> 03:49:11.780]   And it's critical pair lemmas are precisely little stubs
[03:49:11.780 --> 03:49:15.060]   of branch pairs going off into branchial space.
[03:49:15.060 --> 03:49:16.980]   And that's, I mean, it's really weird.
[03:49:16.980 --> 03:49:19.060]   We have these visualizations in Wolfram language
[03:49:19.060 --> 03:49:24.060]   of proof graphs from our automated theorem proving system.
[03:49:24.060 --> 03:49:25.620]   - And they look reminiscent of--
[03:49:25.620 --> 03:49:27.660]   - Well, it's just bizarre because we made these up
[03:49:27.660 --> 03:49:30.700]   a few years ago and they have these little triangle things.
[03:49:30.700 --> 03:49:32.980]   And they are, we didn't quite get it right.
[03:49:32.980 --> 03:49:35.060]   We didn't quite get the analogy perfectly right,
[03:49:35.060 --> 03:49:36.740]   but it's very close.
[03:49:36.740 --> 03:49:39.900]   Just to say in terms of how these things are connected.
[03:49:39.900 --> 03:49:42.140]   So there's another bizarre connection that I have
[03:49:42.140 --> 03:49:47.140]   to mention because, which again, we don't fully know,
[03:49:47.140 --> 03:49:51.100]   but it's a connection to something else
[03:49:51.100 --> 03:49:52.620]   you might not have thought was in the slightest
[03:49:52.620 --> 03:49:56.780]   bit connected, which is distributed blockchain like things.
[03:49:56.780 --> 03:49:58.100]   Now you might figure out that that's,
[03:49:58.100 --> 03:49:59.860]   you would figure out that that's connected
[03:49:59.860 --> 03:50:02.820]   because it's a story of distributed computing.
[03:50:02.820 --> 03:50:05.820]   And the issue, with a blockchain, you're saying
[03:50:05.820 --> 03:50:09.620]   there's gonna be this one ledger that globally says,
[03:50:09.620 --> 03:50:11.660]   this is what happened in the world.
[03:50:11.660 --> 03:50:14.740]   But that's a bad deal if you've got all these
[03:50:14.740 --> 03:50:16.300]   different transactions that are happening.
[03:50:16.300 --> 03:50:21.220]   And this transaction in country A doesn't have
[03:50:21.220 --> 03:50:23.980]   to be reconciled with the transaction in country B,
[03:50:23.980 --> 03:50:25.340]   at least not for a while.
[03:50:25.340 --> 03:50:29.340]   And that story is just like what happens
[03:50:29.340 --> 03:50:30.980]   with our causal graphs.
[03:50:30.980 --> 03:50:33.580]   That whole reconciliation thing is just like what happens
[03:50:33.580 --> 03:50:35.660]   with light cones and all this kind of thing.
[03:50:35.660 --> 03:50:36.780]   - Yeah, so that's where the causal invariance
[03:50:36.780 --> 03:50:37.620]   comes into play.
[03:50:37.620 --> 03:50:40.620]   I mean, that's, you know, most of your conversations
[03:50:40.620 --> 03:50:43.060]   are about physics, but it's kind of funny
[03:50:43.060 --> 03:50:48.060]   that this probably and possibly might have even bigger
[03:50:48.060 --> 03:50:52.140]   impact and revolutionary ideas
[03:50:52.140 --> 03:50:53.980]   in totally other disciplines.
[03:50:53.980 --> 03:50:57.100]   - Right, so the question is, why is that happening?
[03:50:57.100 --> 03:50:59.140]   Right, and the reason it's happening,
[03:50:59.140 --> 03:51:00.700]   I've thought about this, obviously,
[03:51:00.700 --> 03:51:02.740]   because I like to think about these meta questions
[03:51:02.740 --> 03:51:05.340]   of, you know, what's happening is this model
[03:51:05.340 --> 03:51:08.700]   that we have is an incredibly minimal model.
[03:51:08.700 --> 03:51:11.300]   And once you have an incredibly minimal model,
[03:51:11.300 --> 03:51:13.580]   and this happened with cellular automata as well,
[03:51:13.580 --> 03:51:15.980]   cellular automata are an incredibly minimal model.
[03:51:15.980 --> 03:51:19.140]   And so it's inevitable that it gets used,
[03:51:19.140 --> 03:51:21.180]   sort of an upstream thing that gets used
[03:51:21.180 --> 03:51:22.660]   in lots of different places.
[03:51:22.660 --> 03:51:25.220]   And it's like, you know, the fact that it gets used,
[03:51:25.220 --> 03:51:27.340]   you know, cellular automata are sort of a minimal model
[03:51:27.340 --> 03:51:29.100]   of like, say, road traffic flow or something.
[03:51:29.100 --> 03:51:31.180]   And they're also a minimal model of something
[03:51:31.180 --> 03:51:32.060]   in, you know, chemistry.
[03:51:32.060 --> 03:51:33.540]   And they're also a minimal model of something
[03:51:33.540 --> 03:51:35.820]   in epidemiology, right?
[03:51:35.820 --> 03:51:37.420]   It's because they're such a simple model
[03:51:37.420 --> 03:51:38.860]   that they can, that they apply
[03:51:38.860 --> 03:51:40.260]   to all these different things.
[03:51:40.260 --> 03:51:43.020]   Similarly, this model that we have of the physics project
[03:51:43.020 --> 03:51:47.260]   is another, cellular automata are a minimal model
[03:51:47.260 --> 03:51:50.540]   of parallel, of basically of parallel computation
[03:51:50.540 --> 03:51:52.780]   where you've defined space and time.
[03:51:52.780 --> 03:51:54.780]   These models are minimal models
[03:51:54.780 --> 03:51:57.140]   where you have not defined space and time.
[03:51:57.140 --> 03:52:00.300]   And they have been very hard to understand in the past.
[03:52:00.300 --> 03:52:03.700]   But the, I think the, perhaps the most important breakthrough
[03:52:03.700 --> 03:52:07.380]   there is the realization that these are models of physics.
[03:52:07.380 --> 03:52:09.140]   And therefore that you can use everything
[03:52:09.140 --> 03:52:11.940]   that's been developed in physics to get intuition
[03:52:11.940 --> 03:52:13.820]   about how things like that work.
[03:52:13.820 --> 03:52:17.420]   And that's why you can potentially use ideas from physics
[03:52:17.420 --> 03:52:20.060]   to get intuition about how to do parallel computing.
[03:52:20.060 --> 03:52:24.380]   And because the underlying model is the same.
[03:52:24.380 --> 03:52:26.980]   And, but we have all of this achievement in physics.
[03:52:26.980 --> 03:52:28.380]   I mean, you know, you might say,
[03:52:28.380 --> 03:52:30.060]   oh, you've come up with the fundamental theory of physics.
[03:52:30.060 --> 03:52:32.420]   That throws out what people have done in physics before.
[03:52:32.420 --> 03:52:35.460]   Well, it doesn't, but also the real power
[03:52:35.460 --> 03:52:37.860]   is to use what's been done before in physics
[03:52:37.860 --> 03:52:39.540]   to apply it in these other places.
[03:52:39.540 --> 03:52:41.420]   - Yes, absolutely.
[03:52:41.420 --> 03:52:44.060]   - This kind of brings up, I know you probably don't
[03:52:44.060 --> 03:52:48.740]   particularly love commenting on the work of others,
[03:52:48.740 --> 03:52:51.180]   but let me bring up a couple of personalities
[03:52:51.180 --> 03:52:53.580]   just 'cause it's fun and people are curious about it.
[03:52:53.580 --> 03:52:58.620]   So there's Sabine Hassenfelder.
[03:52:58.620 --> 03:53:00.420]   I don't know if you're familiar with her.
[03:53:00.420 --> 03:53:04.860]   She wrote this book that I need to read,
[03:53:04.860 --> 03:53:06.900]   but it based, I forget what the title is,
[03:53:06.900 --> 03:53:10.420]   but it's "Beauty Leads Us Astray in Physics"
[03:53:10.420 --> 03:53:12.340]   is a subtitle, something like that.
[03:53:12.340 --> 03:53:15.060]   Which so much about what we're talking about now,
[03:53:15.060 --> 03:53:19.340]   like this simplification is to us humans
[03:53:19.340 --> 03:53:20.380]   seems to be beautiful.
[03:53:20.380 --> 03:53:23.460]   Like there's a certain intuition with physicists,
[03:53:23.460 --> 03:53:27.980]   with people that a simple theory, like this reducibility,
[03:53:27.980 --> 03:53:30.500]   pockets of reducibility is the ultimate goal.
[03:53:30.500 --> 03:53:33.260]   And I think what she tries to argue is,
[03:53:33.260 --> 03:53:37.660]   no, we just need to come up with theories
[03:53:37.660 --> 03:53:40.540]   that are just really good at predicting physical phenomena.
[03:53:40.540 --> 03:53:44.300]   It's okay to have a bunch of disparate theories
[03:53:44.300 --> 03:53:48.500]   as opposed to trying to chase this beautiful theory
[03:53:48.500 --> 03:53:52.140]   of everything is the ultimate beautiful theory, a simple one.
[03:53:52.140 --> 03:53:54.540]   What's your response to that?
[03:53:54.540 --> 03:53:56.180]   - Well, so what you're quoting,
[03:53:56.180 --> 03:53:59.780]   so I don't know that Sabine Hossenfelder's,
[03:53:59.780 --> 03:54:00.620]   exactly what she said, but I mean-
[03:54:00.620 --> 03:54:03.740]   - You might be misquoting the title of her book.
[03:54:03.740 --> 03:54:07.740]   - Okay, well, let me respond to what you were describing,
[03:54:07.740 --> 03:54:09.340]   which may or may not have anything to do
[03:54:09.340 --> 03:54:14.340]   with what Sabine Hossenfelder says or thinks.
[03:54:14.340 --> 03:54:15.500]   - Sorry, Sabine.
[03:54:15.500 --> 03:54:17.140]   - The, right.
[03:54:17.140 --> 03:54:18.260]   - Sorry for misquoting.
[03:54:18.260 --> 03:54:21.340]   - But I mean, the question is,
[03:54:23.340 --> 03:54:26.580]   is beauty a guide to whether something is correct?
[03:54:26.580 --> 03:54:29.260]   Which is kind of also the story of Occam's razor.
[03:54:29.260 --> 03:54:32.180]   If you've got a bunch of different explanations of things,
[03:54:32.180 --> 03:54:34.540]   is the thing that is the simplest explanation
[03:54:34.540 --> 03:54:36.620]   likely to be the correct explanation?
[03:54:36.620 --> 03:54:38.180]   And there are situations where that's true
[03:54:38.180 --> 03:54:39.980]   and there are situations where it isn't true.
[03:54:39.980 --> 03:54:41.940]   Sometimes in human systems, it is true
[03:54:41.940 --> 03:54:43.180]   because people have kind of,
[03:54:43.180 --> 03:54:45.260]   in evolutionary systems, sometimes it's true
[03:54:45.260 --> 03:54:46.860]   because it's sort of been kicked
[03:54:46.860 --> 03:54:49.380]   to the point where it's minimized.
[03:54:49.380 --> 03:54:53.300]   But in physics, does Occam's razor work?
[03:54:53.300 --> 03:54:55.660]   Is there a simple, quote,
[03:54:55.660 --> 03:54:58.740]   "beautiful explanation for things," or is it a big mess?
[03:54:58.740 --> 03:55:01.900]   We don't intrinsically know.
[03:55:01.900 --> 03:55:03.660]   I think that the, I wouldn't,
[03:55:03.660 --> 03:55:07.180]   before I worked on the project in recent times,
[03:55:07.180 --> 03:55:09.860]   I would have said, "We do not know how complicated
[03:55:09.860 --> 03:55:12.140]   "the rule for the universe will be."
[03:55:12.140 --> 03:55:13.580]   And I would have said,
[03:55:13.580 --> 03:55:15.940]   the one thing we know,
[03:55:15.940 --> 03:55:17.780]   which is a fundamental fact about science,
[03:55:17.780 --> 03:55:19.740]   that's the thing that makes science possible,
[03:55:19.740 --> 03:55:21.860]   is that there is order in the universe.
[03:55:21.860 --> 03:55:24.860]   I mean, early theologians would have used that
[03:55:24.860 --> 03:55:27.140]   as an argument for the existence of God,
[03:55:27.140 --> 03:55:29.420]   because it's like, why is there order in the universe?
[03:55:29.420 --> 03:55:31.500]   Why doesn't every single particle in the universe
[03:55:31.500 --> 03:55:32.660]   just do its own thing?
[03:55:32.660 --> 03:55:37.180]   Something must be making there be order in the universe.
[03:55:37.180 --> 03:55:41.820]   We, in the sort of early theology point of view,
[03:55:41.820 --> 03:55:45.180]   that's, the role of God is to do that, so to speak.
[03:55:45.180 --> 03:55:48.180]   In our, we might say it's the role
[03:55:48.180 --> 03:55:50.140]   of a formal theory to do that.
[03:55:50.140 --> 03:55:51.820]   And then the question is, but how simple
[03:55:51.820 --> 03:55:53.260]   should that theory be?
[03:55:53.260 --> 03:55:55.300]   And should that theory be one that,
[03:55:55.300 --> 03:56:00.620]   where I think the point is, if it's simple,
[03:56:00.620 --> 03:56:03.180]   it's almost inevitably somewhat beautiful
[03:56:03.180 --> 03:56:06.460]   in the sense that, because all the stuff that we see
[03:56:06.460 --> 03:56:08.740]   has to fit into this little tiny theory.
[03:56:08.740 --> 03:56:10.860]   And the way it does that has to be,
[03:56:10.860 --> 03:56:13.300]   it depends on your notion of beauty,
[03:56:13.300 --> 03:56:17.940]   but I mean, for me, the sort of the surprising
[03:56:17.940 --> 03:56:21.980]   connectivity of it is, at least in my aesthetic,
[03:56:21.980 --> 03:56:25.100]   that's something that responds to my aesthetic.
[03:56:25.100 --> 03:56:29.660]   - But the question is, I mean, you're a fascinating person
[03:56:29.660 --> 03:56:34.460]   in the sense that you're at once talking about computational,
[03:56:34.460 --> 03:56:37.940]   the fundamental computational reducibility of the universe,
[03:56:37.940 --> 03:56:41.220]   and on the other hand, trying to come up
[03:56:41.220 --> 03:56:44.340]   with a theory of everything, which simply describes
[03:56:44.340 --> 03:56:49.340]   the simple origins of that computational reducibility.
[03:56:49.340 --> 03:56:53.820]   I mean, both of those things are kind of,
[03:56:53.820 --> 03:56:56.340]   it's paralyzing to think that we can't make any sense
[03:56:56.340 --> 03:56:58.580]   of the universe in the general case,
[03:56:58.580 --> 03:57:01.460]   but it's hopeful to think, like, one,
[03:57:01.460 --> 03:57:05.980]   we can think of a rule that generates this whole complexity,
[03:57:05.980 --> 03:57:10.980]   and two, we can find pockets of reducibility
[03:57:10.980 --> 03:57:13.660]   that are powerful for our everyday life
[03:57:13.660 --> 03:57:15.780]   to do different kinds of predictions.
[03:57:15.780 --> 03:57:19.300]   I suppose Sabine wants to find,
[03:57:19.300 --> 03:57:23.180]   focus on the finding of small pockets of reducibility
[03:57:23.180 --> 03:57:26.980]   versus the theory of everything.
[03:57:26.980 --> 03:57:29.700]   - You know, it's a funny thing because, you know,
[03:57:29.700 --> 03:57:32.180]   a bunch of people have started working on this,
[03:57:32.180 --> 03:57:34.620]   you know, physics project, people who are, you know,
[03:57:34.620 --> 03:57:38.220]   physicists, basically, and it is really
[03:57:38.220 --> 03:57:40.060]   a fascinating sociological phenomenon
[03:57:40.060 --> 03:57:44.020]   because what, you know, when I was working on this before
[03:57:44.020 --> 03:57:47.780]   in the 1990s, you know, wrote it up,
[03:57:47.780 --> 03:57:50.300]   put it, it's 100 pages of this 1200 page book
[03:57:50.300 --> 03:57:51.540]   that I wrote, "New Kind of Science,"
[03:57:51.540 --> 03:57:54.380]   it's, you know, 100 pages of that is about physics.
[03:57:54.380 --> 03:57:59.380]   But I saw it at that time, not as a pinnacle achievement,
[03:57:59.380 --> 03:58:02.060]   but rather as a use case, so to speak.
[03:58:02.060 --> 03:58:04.340]   I mean, my main point was this new kind of science,
[03:58:04.340 --> 03:58:06.180]   and it's like, you can apply it to biology,
[03:58:06.180 --> 03:58:08.660]   you can apply it to, you know, other kinds of physics,
[03:58:08.660 --> 03:58:09.980]   you can apply it to fundamental physics.
[03:58:09.980 --> 03:58:12.620]   It's just an application, so to speak.
[03:58:12.620 --> 03:58:14.940]   It's not the core thing.
[03:58:14.940 --> 03:58:17.740]   But then, you know, one of the things
[03:58:17.740 --> 03:58:21.380]   that was interesting with that book was, you know,
[03:58:21.380 --> 03:58:24.820]   book comes out, lots of people think it's pretty interesting
[03:58:24.820 --> 03:58:26.700]   and lots of people start using what it has
[03:58:26.700 --> 03:58:28.300]   in different kinds of fields.
[03:58:28.300 --> 03:58:32.700]   The one field where there was sort of a heavy pitchforking
[03:58:32.700 --> 03:58:36.140]   was from my friends, the fundamental physics people,
[03:58:36.140 --> 03:58:38.900]   which was, it's like, no, this can't possibly be right.
[03:58:38.900 --> 03:58:40.420]   And, you know, it's like, you know,
[03:58:40.420 --> 03:58:41.740]   if what you're doing is right,
[03:58:41.740 --> 03:58:44.420]   it'll overturn 50 years of what we've been doing.
[03:58:44.420 --> 03:58:47.180]   And it's like, no, it won't, was what I was saying.
[03:58:47.180 --> 03:58:51.020]   And it's like, but, you know, for a while,
[03:58:51.020 --> 03:58:53.300]   when I started, you know, I was going to go on
[03:58:53.300 --> 03:58:55.980]   back in 2002, well, 2004, actually,
[03:58:55.980 --> 03:58:58.700]   I was going to go on working on this project.
[03:58:58.700 --> 03:59:01.620]   And I actually stopped, partly because it's like,
[03:59:01.620 --> 03:59:04.140]   why am I, you know, this is like,
[03:59:04.140 --> 03:59:05.580]   I've been in business a long time, right?
[03:59:05.580 --> 03:59:08.300]   I'm building a product for a target market
[03:59:08.300 --> 03:59:09.900]   that doesn't want the product.
[03:59:09.900 --> 03:59:10.860]   And it's like--
[03:59:10.860 --> 03:59:13.460]   - Why work, yeah, yeah, why work against,
[03:59:13.460 --> 03:59:14.820]   swim against the current or whatever.
[03:59:14.820 --> 03:59:16.300]   - Right, but you see what's happened,
[03:59:16.300 --> 03:59:17.380]   which is sort of interesting,
[03:59:17.380 --> 03:59:19.700]   is that a couple of things happened.
[03:59:19.700 --> 03:59:23.660]   And it was like, you know, it was like,
[03:59:23.660 --> 03:59:25.900]   I don't want to do this project
[03:59:25.900 --> 03:59:28.700]   because I can do so many other things,
[03:59:28.700 --> 03:59:30.580]   which I'm really interested in,
[03:59:30.580 --> 03:59:34.260]   where, you know, people say, great, thanks for those tools,
[03:59:34.260 --> 03:59:36.540]   thanks for those ideas, et cetera.
[03:59:36.540 --> 03:59:39.140]   Whereas, you know, if you're dealing with kind of a,
[03:59:39.140 --> 03:59:42.980]   you know, sort of a structure where people are saying,
[03:59:42.980 --> 03:59:44.380]   no, no, we don't want this new stuff,
[03:59:44.380 --> 03:59:45.460]   we don't need any new stuff,
[03:59:45.460 --> 03:59:46.300]   we're really fine with what we're doing.
[03:59:46.300 --> 03:59:48.460]   - Yeah, there's like literally, like, I don't know,
[03:59:48.460 --> 03:59:51.300]   millions of people who are thankful for Wolfram Alpha,
[03:59:51.300 --> 03:59:53.420]   a bunch of people wrote to me how thankful,
[03:59:53.420 --> 03:59:55.620]   they are a different crowd
[03:59:55.620 --> 03:59:57.980]   than the theoretical physics community, perhaps.
[03:59:57.980 --> 03:59:59.100]   - Yeah, well, right, but you know,
[03:59:59.100 --> 04:00:00.420]   the theoretical physics community
[04:00:00.420 --> 04:00:01.940]   pretty much uniformly uses
[04:00:01.940 --> 04:00:04.580]   Wolfram language and Mathematica, right?
[04:00:04.580 --> 04:00:07.780]   And so it's kind of like, you know,
[04:00:07.780 --> 04:00:10.820]   and that's, but the thing is, what happens,
[04:00:10.820 --> 04:00:12.300]   you know, this is what happens,
[04:00:12.300 --> 04:00:15.140]   mature fields do not, you know,
[04:00:15.140 --> 04:00:16.580]   it's like, we're doing what we're doing,
[04:00:16.580 --> 04:00:18.420]   we have the methods that we have,
[04:00:18.420 --> 04:00:20.420]   and we're just fine here.
[04:00:20.420 --> 04:00:23.580]   Now, what's happened in the last 18 years or so,
[04:00:23.580 --> 04:00:25.620]   I think there's a couple of things have happened.
[04:00:25.620 --> 04:00:29.420]   First of all, the hope that, you know,
[04:00:29.420 --> 04:00:30.460]   string theory or whatever
[04:00:30.460 --> 04:00:32.660]   would deliver the fundamental theory of physics,
[04:00:32.660 --> 04:00:34.740]   that hope has disappeared.
[04:00:34.740 --> 04:00:37.500]   That the, another thing that's happened is the,
[04:00:37.500 --> 04:00:41.220]   the sort of the interest in computation around physics
[04:00:41.220 --> 04:00:44.180]   has been greatly enhanced by the whole quantum information,
[04:00:44.180 --> 04:00:46.220]   quantum computing story.
[04:00:46.220 --> 04:00:47.260]   People, you know, the idea
[04:00:47.260 --> 04:00:50.140]   there might be something sort of computational
[04:00:50.140 --> 04:00:53.260]   related to physics has somehow grown.
[04:00:53.260 --> 04:00:55.980]   And I think, you know, it's sort of interesting,
[04:00:55.980 --> 04:00:58.260]   I mean, right now, if we say, you know,
[04:00:58.260 --> 04:00:59.860]   it's like, if you're like,
[04:00:59.860 --> 04:01:00.980]   who else is trying to come up
[04:01:00.980 --> 04:01:02.620]   with the fundamental theory of physics?
[04:01:02.620 --> 04:01:04.660]   It's like, there aren't professional,
[04:01:04.660 --> 04:01:06.020]   no professional physicists. - Oh, no professional.
[04:01:06.020 --> 04:01:07.420]   - No professional physicists.
[04:01:07.420 --> 04:01:11.020]   - What are your, I mean, you've talked with him,
[04:01:11.020 --> 04:01:13.020]   but just as a matter of personalities,
[04:01:13.020 --> 04:01:14.020]   'cause it's a beautiful story,
[04:01:14.020 --> 04:01:17.340]   what are your thoughts about Eric Weinstein's work?
[04:01:17.340 --> 04:01:20.780]   - You know, I think his, I mean,
[04:01:20.780 --> 04:01:23.660]   he did a PhD thesis in mathematical physics at Harvard.
[04:01:23.660 --> 04:01:24.740]   - He's a mathematical physicist.
[04:01:24.740 --> 04:01:29.100]   - And, you know, it's, it seems like it's kind of,
[04:01:29.100 --> 04:01:31.100]   you know, it's in that framework
[04:01:31.100 --> 04:01:34.220]   and it's kind of like, I'm not sure how much further
[04:01:34.220 --> 04:01:36.060]   it's got than his PhD thesis,
[04:01:36.060 --> 04:01:37.740]   which was 20 years ago or something.
[04:01:37.740 --> 04:01:39.540]   And I think that, you know,
[04:01:39.540 --> 04:01:43.940]   it's a fairly specific piece of mathematical physics
[04:01:43.940 --> 04:01:45.100]   that's quite nice.
[04:01:45.100 --> 04:01:46.660]   And- - What trajectory
[04:01:46.660 --> 04:01:47.700]   do you hope it takes?
[04:01:47.700 --> 04:01:49.220]   I mean- - Well, I think
[04:01:49.220 --> 04:01:51.540]   in his particular case, I mean, from what I understand,
[04:01:51.540 --> 04:01:53.100]   which is not everything at all,
[04:01:53.100 --> 04:01:55.020]   but, you know, I think I know the rough tradition,
[04:01:55.020 --> 04:01:56.740]   at least, that he's operating in
[04:01:56.740 --> 04:01:59.180]   is sort of theory of gauge theories.
[04:01:59.180 --> 04:02:00.020]   - Gauge theories, yeah.
[04:02:00.020 --> 04:02:01.260]   - Local gauge invariance and so on.
[04:02:01.260 --> 04:02:04.380]   Okay, we are very close to understanding
[04:02:04.380 --> 04:02:06.420]   how local gauge invariance works in our models
[04:02:06.420 --> 04:02:09.580]   and it's very beautiful and it's very,
[04:02:09.580 --> 04:02:12.460]   and, you know, does some of the mathematical structure
[04:02:12.460 --> 04:02:14.540]   that he's enthusiastic about fit?
[04:02:14.540 --> 04:02:15.980]   Quite possibly, yes.
[04:02:15.980 --> 04:02:17.900]   - So there might be a possibility of trying to understand
[04:02:17.900 --> 04:02:19.940]   how those things fit, how gauge theory fits.
[04:02:19.940 --> 04:02:20.780]   - Yeah, might very well.
[04:02:20.780 --> 04:02:22.180]   I mean, the question is, you know,
[04:02:22.180 --> 04:02:23.020]   so there are a couple of things
[04:02:23.020 --> 04:02:24.260]   one might try to get in the world.
[04:02:24.260 --> 04:02:25.820]   So for example, it's like,
[04:02:25.820 --> 04:02:27.260]   can we get three dimensions of space?
[04:02:27.260 --> 04:02:29.020]   We haven't managed to get that yet.
[04:02:29.020 --> 04:02:32.540]   Gauge theory, the standard model of particle physics says
[04:02:32.540 --> 04:02:35.780]   that it's SU3 cross SU2 cross U1.
[04:02:35.780 --> 04:02:40.140]   Those are the designations of these Lie groups.
[04:02:40.140 --> 04:02:42.860]   It doesn't, but anyway, so those are sort of
[04:02:42.860 --> 04:02:46.620]   representations of symmetries of the theory.
[04:02:46.620 --> 04:02:50.220]   And so, you know, it is conceivable
[04:02:50.220 --> 04:02:52.780]   that it is generically true.
[04:02:52.780 --> 04:02:55.460]   Okay, so all those are subgroups of a group called E8,
[04:02:55.460 --> 04:02:59.100]   which is a weird, exceptional Lie group.
[04:02:59.100 --> 04:03:02.220]   Okay, it is conceivable, I don't know whether it's the case,
[04:03:02.220 --> 04:03:05.220]   that that will be generic in these models,
[04:03:05.220 --> 04:03:06.900]   that it will be generic,
[04:03:06.900 --> 04:03:11.900]   that the gauge invariance of the model has this property,
[04:03:11.900 --> 04:03:15.220]   just as things like general relativity,
[04:03:15.220 --> 04:03:20.220]   which corresponds to a thing called general covariance,
[04:03:20.220 --> 04:03:23.780]   which is another gauge-like invariance.
[04:03:23.780 --> 04:03:26.020]   It could conceivably be the case
[04:03:26.020 --> 04:03:28.100]   that the kind of local gauge invariance
[04:03:28.100 --> 04:03:31.260]   that we see in particle physics is somehow generic.
[04:03:31.260 --> 04:03:32.980]   And that would be a, you know,
[04:03:32.980 --> 04:03:36.020]   the thing that's really cool, I think, you know,
[04:03:36.020 --> 04:03:38.740]   sociologically, although this hasn't really hit yet,
[04:03:38.740 --> 04:03:40.700]   is that all of these different things,
[04:03:40.700 --> 04:03:42.300]   all these different things people have been working on
[04:03:42.300 --> 04:03:45.740]   in these, in some cases, quite abstruse areas
[04:03:45.740 --> 04:03:48.060]   of mathematical physics, an awful lot of them
[04:03:48.060 --> 04:03:50.100]   seem to tie into what we're doing.
[04:03:50.100 --> 04:03:51.900]   And, you know, it might not be that way.
[04:03:51.900 --> 04:03:52.740]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[04:03:52.740 --> 04:03:54.220]   That's a beautiful thing of the theory.
[04:03:54.220 --> 04:03:56.140]   I mean, but the reason I,
[04:03:56.140 --> 04:03:58.580]   the reason Erick Weinstein is important
[04:03:58.580 --> 04:04:00.660]   is to the point that you mentioned before,
[04:04:00.660 --> 04:04:04.860]   which is it's strange that the theory of everything
[04:04:04.860 --> 04:04:09.860]   is not at the core of the passion, the dream,
[04:04:09.860 --> 04:04:14.620]   the focus, the funding of the physics community.
[04:04:14.620 --> 04:04:15.580]   - It's too hard.
[04:04:15.580 --> 04:04:19.340]   It's too hard, and people gave up.
[04:04:19.340 --> 04:04:21.500]   I mean, basically what happened is,
[04:04:21.500 --> 04:04:24.340]   ancient Greece, people thought we're nearly there.
[04:04:24.340 --> 04:04:26.340]   You know, the world is made of platonic solids.
[04:04:26.340 --> 04:04:29.100]   It's, you know, water is a tetrahedron or something.
[04:04:29.100 --> 04:04:30.980]   We're almost there, okay?
[04:04:30.980 --> 04:04:33.380]   Long period of time where people were like,
[04:04:33.380 --> 04:04:35.180]   no, we don't know how it works.
[04:04:35.180 --> 04:04:38.220]   You know, time of Newton, you know, we're almost there.
[04:04:38.220 --> 04:04:39.900]   Everything is gravitation.
[04:04:39.900 --> 04:04:43.500]   You know, time of Faraday and Maxwell, we're almost there.
[04:04:43.500 --> 04:04:44.380]   Everything is fields.
[04:04:44.380 --> 04:04:46.020]   Everything is the ether.
[04:04:46.020 --> 04:04:47.100]   You know, then--
[04:04:47.100 --> 04:04:49.940]   - And the whole time we're making big progress, though.
[04:04:49.940 --> 04:04:51.140]   - Oh, yes, absolutely.
[04:04:51.140 --> 04:04:54.820]   But the fundamental theory of physics is almost a footnote
[04:04:54.820 --> 04:04:57.820]   because it's like, it's the machine code.
[04:04:57.820 --> 04:05:00.260]   It's like, we're operating in the high-level languages.
[04:05:00.260 --> 04:05:01.140]   - Yeah.
[04:05:01.140 --> 04:05:02.580]   - You know, that's what we really care about.
[04:05:02.580 --> 04:05:04.580]   That's what's relevant for our everyday physics.
[04:05:04.580 --> 04:05:06.020]   - You talked about different centuries,
[04:05:06.020 --> 04:05:09.700]   and the 21st century will be everything is computation.
[04:05:09.700 --> 04:05:10.540]   - Yes.
[04:05:10.540 --> 04:05:12.460]   - If that takes us all the way, we don't know,
[04:05:12.460 --> 04:05:14.100]   but it might take us pretty far.
[04:05:14.100 --> 04:05:15.540]   - Yes, right, that's right.
[04:05:15.540 --> 04:05:17.620]   But I think the point is that it's like, you know,
[04:05:17.620 --> 04:05:19.300]   if you're doing biology, you might say,
[04:05:19.300 --> 04:05:20.820]   "How can you not be really interested
[04:05:20.820 --> 04:05:23.420]   "in the origin of life and the definition of life?"
[04:05:23.420 --> 04:05:24.300]   Well, it's irrelevant.
[04:05:24.300 --> 04:05:26.700]   You know, you're studying the properties of some virus.
[04:05:26.700 --> 04:05:28.700]   It doesn't matter, you know, where, you know,
[04:05:28.700 --> 04:05:31.300]   you're operating at some much higher level.
[04:05:31.300 --> 04:05:34.820]   And it's the same, what's happened with physics is,
[04:05:34.820 --> 04:05:36.100]   I was sort of surprised, actually.
[04:05:36.100 --> 04:05:39.460]   I was sort of mapping out this history of people's efforts
[04:05:39.460 --> 04:05:41.900]   to understand the fundamental theory of physics.
[04:05:41.900 --> 04:05:44.580]   And it's remarkable how little has been done
[04:05:44.580 --> 04:05:45.820]   on this question.
[04:05:45.820 --> 04:05:47.660]   And it's, you know, because, you know,
[04:05:47.660 --> 04:05:49.940]   there've been times when there's been bursts of enthusiasm.
[04:05:49.940 --> 04:05:51.500]   Oh, we're almost there.
[04:05:51.500 --> 04:05:55.420]   And then it decays, and people just say,
[04:05:55.420 --> 04:05:57.820]   "Oh, it's too hard, but it's not relevant anyway."
[04:05:57.820 --> 04:06:01.660]   And I think that the thing that, you know,
[04:06:01.660 --> 04:06:04.620]   so the question of, you know,
[04:06:04.620 --> 04:06:06.020]   one question is why does anybody,
[04:06:06.020 --> 04:06:07.980]   why should anybody care, right?
[04:06:07.980 --> 04:06:09.060]   Why should anybody care
[04:06:09.060 --> 04:06:10.940]   what the fundamental theory of physics is?
[04:06:10.940 --> 04:06:13.100]   I think it's intellectually interesting,
[04:06:13.100 --> 04:06:14.820]   but what will be the sort of,
[04:06:14.820 --> 04:06:16.460]   what will be the impact of this?
[04:06:16.460 --> 04:06:18.900]   - What, I mean, this is the key question.
[04:06:18.900 --> 04:06:20.660]   What do you think will happen
[04:06:20.660 --> 04:06:25.260]   if we figure out the fundamental theory of physics?
[04:06:25.260 --> 04:06:26.100]   - Right.
[04:06:26.100 --> 04:06:28.140]   - Outside of the intellectual curiosity of us.
[04:06:28.140 --> 04:06:31.340]   - Okay, so here's my best guess, okay?
[04:06:31.340 --> 04:06:33.540]   So if you look at the history of science,
[04:06:33.540 --> 04:06:37.420]   I think a very interesting analogy is Copernicus.
[04:06:37.420 --> 04:06:39.740]   Okay, so what did Copernicus do?
[04:06:39.740 --> 04:06:41.340]   There'd been this Ptolemaic system
[04:06:41.340 --> 04:06:43.260]   for working out the motion of planets.
[04:06:43.260 --> 04:06:44.740]   It did pretty well.
[04:06:44.740 --> 04:06:47.100]   It used epicycles, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[04:06:47.100 --> 04:06:49.340]   It had all this computational ways
[04:06:49.340 --> 04:06:51.180]   of working out what planets will be.
[04:06:51.180 --> 04:06:52.740]   When we work out where planets are today,
[04:06:52.740 --> 04:06:54.860]   we're basically using epicycles.
[04:06:54.860 --> 04:06:58.060]   But Copernicus had this different way of formulating things
[04:06:58.060 --> 04:07:00.180]   in which he said, you know,
[04:07:00.180 --> 04:07:02.980]   "And the Earth is going around the sun."
[04:07:02.980 --> 04:07:04.180]   And that had a consequence.
[04:07:04.180 --> 04:07:07.900]   The consequence was you can use this mathematical theory
[04:07:07.900 --> 04:07:10.740]   to conclude something which is absolutely not
[04:07:10.740 --> 04:07:14.140]   what we can tell from common sense, right?
[04:07:14.140 --> 04:07:17.860]   So it's like, trust the mathematics, trust the science.
[04:07:17.860 --> 04:07:21.060]   Okay, now fast forward 400 years,
[04:07:21.060 --> 04:07:23.900]   and now we're in this pandemic,
[04:07:23.900 --> 04:07:25.660]   and it's kind of like everybody thinks
[04:07:25.660 --> 04:07:28.260]   the science will figure out everything.
[04:07:28.260 --> 04:07:30.020]   It's like, from the science,
[04:07:30.020 --> 04:07:31.340]   we can just figure out what to do.
[04:07:31.340 --> 04:07:32.940]   We can figure out everything.
[04:07:32.940 --> 04:07:34.820]   That was before Copernicus.
[04:07:34.820 --> 04:07:37.700]   Nobody would have thought if the science says something
[04:07:37.700 --> 04:07:40.820]   that doesn't agree with our everyday experience,
[04:07:40.820 --> 04:07:43.220]   where we just have to compute the science
[04:07:43.220 --> 04:07:44.460]   and then figure out what to do.
[04:07:44.460 --> 04:07:46.420]   People say that's completely crazy.
[04:07:46.420 --> 04:07:47.620]   - And so your sense is,
[04:07:47.620 --> 04:07:49.860]   once we figure out the framework of computation
[04:07:49.860 --> 04:07:51.820]   that can basically do any,
[04:07:51.820 --> 04:07:53.820]   understand the fabric of reality,
[04:07:53.820 --> 04:07:58.820]   we'll be able to derive totally counterintuitive things.
[04:07:58.820 --> 04:08:01.140]   - No, the point, I think, is the following,
[04:08:01.140 --> 04:08:05.780]   that right now, I talk about computational irreducibility.
[04:08:05.780 --> 04:08:08.260]   People, I was very proud that I managed
[04:08:08.260 --> 04:08:10.180]   to get the term computational irreducibility
[04:08:10.180 --> 04:08:13.060]   into the congressional record last year.
[04:08:13.060 --> 04:08:13.900]   - That's right, by the way.
[04:08:13.900 --> 04:08:15.380]   That's a whole 'nother topic we could talk about.
[04:08:15.380 --> 04:08:16.700]   Fascinating. - Different topic.
[04:08:16.700 --> 04:08:18.260]   - Different day. - Different topic.
[04:08:18.260 --> 04:08:22.180]   But in any case, so computational irreducibility
[04:08:22.180 --> 04:08:23.940]   is one of these sort of concepts
[04:08:23.940 --> 04:08:25.460]   that I think is important in understanding
[04:08:25.460 --> 04:08:27.020]   lots of things in the world.
[04:08:27.020 --> 04:08:29.220]   But the question is, it's only important
[04:08:29.220 --> 04:08:32.020]   if you believe the world is fundamentally computational.
[04:08:33.180 --> 04:08:36.020]   But if you know the fundamental theory of physics
[04:08:36.020 --> 04:08:38.300]   and it's fundamentally computational,
[04:08:38.300 --> 04:08:40.260]   then you've rooted the whole thing.
[04:08:40.260 --> 04:08:43.180]   That is, you know the world is computational.
[04:08:43.180 --> 04:08:46.060]   And while you can discuss whether,
[04:08:46.060 --> 04:08:48.860]   it's not the case that people would say,
[04:08:48.860 --> 04:08:50.980]   well, you have this whole computational irreducibility,
[04:08:50.980 --> 04:08:52.620]   all these features of computation,
[04:08:52.620 --> 04:08:54.140]   we don't care about those
[04:08:54.140 --> 04:08:56.220]   because after all, the world isn't computational,
[04:08:56.220 --> 04:08:57.340]   you might say.
[04:08:57.340 --> 04:09:01.300]   But if you know, base, base, base thing,
[04:09:01.300 --> 04:09:03.220]   physics is computational,
[04:09:03.220 --> 04:09:05.260]   then you know that that stuff is,
[04:09:05.260 --> 04:09:07.700]   you know, that that's kind of the grounding for that stuff.
[04:09:07.700 --> 04:09:10.540]   Just as in a sense, Copernicus was the grounding
[04:09:10.540 --> 04:09:12.900]   for the idea that you could figure out something
[04:09:12.900 --> 04:09:17.380]   with math and science that was not what you
[04:09:17.380 --> 04:09:20.100]   would intuitively think from your senses.
[04:09:20.100 --> 04:09:22.820]   So now we've got to this point where, for example,
[04:09:22.820 --> 04:09:25.260]   we say, you know, once we have the idea
[04:09:25.260 --> 04:09:27.980]   that computation is the foundational thing
[04:09:27.980 --> 04:09:30.140]   that explains our whole universe,
[04:09:30.140 --> 04:09:31.380]   then we have to say, well,
[04:09:31.380 --> 04:09:32.820]   what does it mean for other things?
[04:09:32.820 --> 04:09:35.260]   Like it means there's computational irreducibility.
[04:09:35.260 --> 04:09:37.900]   That means science is limited in certain ways.
[04:09:37.900 --> 04:09:39.780]   That means this, that means that.
[04:09:39.780 --> 04:09:43.300]   But the fact that we have that grounding means that,
[04:09:43.300 --> 04:09:44.820]   you know, and I think for example,
[04:09:44.820 --> 04:09:47.220]   for Copernicus, for instance,
[04:09:47.220 --> 04:09:49.180]   the implications of his work
[04:09:49.180 --> 04:09:52.380]   on the set of mathematics of astronomy were cool,
[04:09:52.380 --> 04:09:54.580]   but they involved a very small number of people.
[04:09:54.580 --> 04:09:56.940]   The implications of his work for sort of the philosophy
[04:09:56.940 --> 04:09:59.860]   of how you think about things were vast
[04:09:59.860 --> 04:10:02.860]   and involved, you know, everybody more or less.
[04:10:02.860 --> 04:10:05.780]   - But do you think, so that's actually the way scientists
[04:10:05.780 --> 04:10:08.580]   and people see the world around us.
[04:10:08.580 --> 04:10:10.620]   So it has a huge impact in that sense.
[04:10:10.620 --> 04:10:14.260]   Do you think it might have an impact more directly
[04:10:14.260 --> 04:10:18.140]   to engineering derivations from physics,
[04:10:18.140 --> 04:10:22.020]   like propulsion systems, our ability to colonize the world?
[04:10:22.020 --> 04:10:24.640]   Like for example, okay, this is like sci-fi,
[04:10:24.640 --> 04:10:29.640]   but if you understand the computational nature,
[04:10:29.920 --> 04:10:34.000]   say, of the different forces of physics,
[04:10:34.000 --> 04:10:37.240]   you know, there's a notion of being able to,
[04:10:37.240 --> 04:10:39.040]   you know, warp gravity, things like this.
[04:10:39.040 --> 04:10:40.520]   - Yeah, can we make warp drive?
[04:10:40.520 --> 04:10:41.760]   - Warp drive, yeah.
[04:10:41.760 --> 04:10:44.160]   So like, would we be able to, will it,
[04:10:44.160 --> 04:10:47.640]   will, you know, will like Elon Musk start paying attention?
[04:10:47.640 --> 04:10:50.520]   Like it's awfully costly to launch these rockets.
[04:10:50.520 --> 04:10:52.880]   Do you think we'll be able to, yeah, create warp drive?
[04:10:52.880 --> 04:10:55.400]   - Right, you know, I set myself some homework.
[04:10:55.400 --> 04:10:57.640]   I agreed to give a talk at some NASA workshop
[04:10:57.640 --> 04:10:59.920]   in a few weeks about faster than light travel.
[04:10:59.920 --> 04:11:02.800]   So I haven't figured it out yet, but no, but--
[04:11:02.800 --> 04:11:03.640]   - You got two weeks.
[04:11:03.640 --> 04:11:04.460]   - Yeah, right.
[04:11:04.460 --> 04:11:06.320]   - But do you think that kind of understanding
[04:11:06.320 --> 04:11:07.640]   of fundamental theory of physics
[04:11:07.640 --> 04:11:09.640]   can lead to those engineering breakthroughs?
[04:11:09.640 --> 04:11:12.120]   - Okay, I think it's far away, but I'm not certain.
[04:11:12.120 --> 04:11:14.760]   I mean, you know, this is the thing that,
[04:11:14.760 --> 04:11:17.040]   I set myself an exercise when gravity waves,
[04:11:17.040 --> 04:11:19.300]   gravitational waves were discovered, right?
[04:11:19.300 --> 04:11:21.000]   I set myself the exercise of
[04:11:21.000 --> 04:11:23.880]   what would black hole technology look like?
[04:11:23.880 --> 04:11:25.340]   In other words, right now, you know,
[04:11:25.340 --> 04:11:26.480]   black holes are far away.
[04:11:26.480 --> 04:11:28.120]   They're, you know, how on earth can we do things with them?
[04:11:28.120 --> 04:11:30.120]   But just imagine that we could get, you know,
[04:11:30.120 --> 04:11:32.480]   pet black holes right in our backyard.
[04:11:32.480 --> 04:11:34.520]   You know, what kind of technology could we build with them?
[04:11:34.520 --> 04:11:36.720]   I got a certain distance, not that far.
[04:11:36.720 --> 04:11:39.840]   But I think in, you know, so there are ideas.
[04:11:39.840 --> 04:11:42.000]   You know, I have this, one of the weirder ideas
[04:11:42.000 --> 04:11:44.160]   is things I'm calling space tunnels,
[04:11:44.160 --> 04:11:47.840]   which are higher dimensional pieces of space time,
[04:11:47.840 --> 04:11:50.040]   where basically you can, you know,
[04:11:50.040 --> 04:11:52.000]   in our three-dimensional space,
[04:11:52.000 --> 04:11:55.480]   there might be a five-dimensional, you know, region,
[04:11:55.480 --> 04:11:57.040]   which actually will appear as a white hole
[04:11:57.040 --> 04:11:59.320]   at one end and a black hole at the other end.
[04:11:59.320 --> 04:12:01.080]   You know, who knows whether they exist?
[04:12:01.080 --> 04:12:02.760]   And then the question's another one,
[04:12:02.760 --> 04:12:04.480]   okay, this is another crazy one,
[04:12:04.480 --> 04:12:07.640]   is the thing that I'm calling a vacuum cleaner, okay?
[04:12:07.640 --> 04:12:10.660]   So I mentioned that, you know,
[04:12:10.660 --> 04:12:12.620]   there's all this activity in the universe,
[04:12:12.620 --> 04:12:15.000]   which is maintaining the structure of space.
[04:12:15.000 --> 04:12:18.280]   And that leads to a certain energy density,
[04:12:18.280 --> 04:12:20.120]   effectively, in space.
[04:12:20.120 --> 04:12:23.640]   And so the question, in fact, dark energy
[04:12:23.640 --> 04:12:26.840]   is a story of essentially negative mass
[04:12:26.840 --> 04:12:30.960]   produced by the absence of energy
[04:12:30.960 --> 04:12:33.200]   you thought would be there, so to speak.
[04:12:33.200 --> 04:12:34.840]   And we don't know exactly how it works
[04:12:34.840 --> 04:12:37.720]   in either our model or the physical universe,
[04:12:37.720 --> 04:12:40.620]   but this notion of a vacuum cleaner
[04:12:40.620 --> 04:12:43.080]   is a thing where, you know, you have all these things
[04:12:43.080 --> 04:12:44.520]   that are maintaining the structure of space,
[04:12:44.520 --> 04:12:47.600]   but what if you could clean out some of that stuff
[04:12:47.600 --> 04:12:49.480]   that's maintaining the structure of space
[04:12:49.480 --> 04:12:51.600]   and make a simpler vacuum somewhere?
[04:12:51.600 --> 04:12:52.880]   - Yeah. - You know, what would that do?
[04:12:52.880 --> 04:12:54.240]   - Totally different kind of vacuum.
[04:12:54.240 --> 04:12:57.220]   - Right, and that would lead to negative energy density,
[04:12:57.220 --> 04:12:59.460]   which would need to, so gravity is usually
[04:12:59.460 --> 04:13:02.480]   a purely attractive force, but negative mass
[04:13:02.480 --> 04:13:06.220]   would lead to repulsive gravity
[04:13:06.220 --> 04:13:08.560]   and lead to all kinds of weird things.
[04:13:08.560 --> 04:13:11.280]   Now, can it be done in our universe?
[04:13:11.280 --> 04:13:14.840]   You know, my immediate thought is no,
[04:13:14.840 --> 04:13:18.440]   but, you know, the fact is that, okay, so--
[04:13:18.440 --> 04:13:19.640]   - Well, once you understand the fact,
[04:13:19.640 --> 04:13:21.600]   'cause you're saying, like, at this level of abstraction,
[04:13:21.600 --> 04:13:25.480]   you can reach to the lower levels and mess with it.
[04:13:25.480 --> 04:13:26.840]   - Yes. - Once you understand
[04:13:26.840 --> 04:13:29.000]   the levels, I think you can start to--
[04:13:29.000 --> 04:13:30.760]   - I know, and I'm, you know, I have to say
[04:13:30.760 --> 04:13:34.720]   that this reminds me of people telling one years ago
[04:13:34.720 --> 04:13:36.360]   that, you know, you'll never transmit data
[04:13:36.360 --> 04:13:39.680]   over a copper wire at more than 1,000, you know,
[04:13:39.680 --> 04:13:41.520]   1,000 baud or something, right?
[04:13:41.520 --> 04:13:44.000]   And this is, why did that not happen?
[04:13:44.000 --> 04:13:46.240]   You know, why do we have these much, much faster
[04:13:46.240 --> 04:13:47.080]   data transmission?
[04:13:47.080 --> 04:13:48.920]   Because we've understood many more of the details
[04:13:48.920 --> 04:13:50.480]   of what's actually going on.
[04:13:50.480 --> 04:13:52.600]   And it's the same exact story here.
[04:13:52.600 --> 04:13:54.800]   And it's the same, you know, I think that this,
[04:13:54.800 --> 04:13:58.640]   as I say, I think one of the features of sort of,
[04:13:58.640 --> 04:14:00.600]   one of the things about our time
[04:14:00.600 --> 04:14:03.080]   that will seem incredibly naive in the future
[04:14:03.080 --> 04:14:06.280]   is the belief that, you know, things like heat
[04:14:06.280 --> 04:14:08.440]   is just random motion of molecules,
[04:14:08.440 --> 04:14:11.360]   that it's just, just throw up your hands,
[04:14:11.360 --> 04:14:14.120]   it's just random, we can't say anything about it.
[04:14:14.120 --> 04:14:15.680]   That will seem naive.
[04:14:15.680 --> 04:14:18.160]   - Yeah, at the heat death of the universe,
[04:14:18.160 --> 04:14:20.400]   those particles would be laughing at us humans
[04:14:20.400 --> 04:14:23.640]   thinking that life is not beautiful.
[04:14:23.640 --> 04:14:25.960]   - Right, we'll have a whole civilization, you know.
[04:14:25.960 --> 04:14:27.600]   - Humans used to think they're special
[04:14:27.600 --> 04:14:29.000]   with their little brains.
[04:14:29.000 --> 04:14:31.280]   - Well, right, but also, and they used to think
[04:14:31.280 --> 04:14:33.960]   that this would just be random and uninteresting.
[04:14:33.960 --> 04:14:37.640]   But that's, but so this question about whether you can,
[04:14:37.640 --> 04:14:40.000]   you know, mess with the underlying structure
[04:14:40.000 --> 04:14:41.320]   and how you find a way to mess
[04:14:41.320 --> 04:14:44.040]   with the underlying structure, that's a, you know,
[04:14:44.040 --> 04:14:47.000]   I have to say, you know, my immediate thing is,
[04:14:47.000 --> 04:14:48.800]   boy, that seems really hard.
[04:14:48.800 --> 04:14:52.240]   But then, and, you know, possibly computational
[04:14:52.240 --> 04:14:54.000]   irreducibility will bite you,
[04:14:54.000 --> 04:14:55.520]   but then there's always some path
[04:14:55.520 --> 04:14:57.360]   of computational reducibility.
[04:14:57.360 --> 04:14:59.720]   And that path of computational reducibility
[04:14:59.720 --> 04:15:02.520]   is the engineering invention that has to be made.
[04:15:02.520 --> 04:15:05.960]   - Those little pockets can have huge engineering impact.
[04:15:05.960 --> 04:15:07.760]   - Right, and I think that that's right.
[04:15:07.760 --> 04:15:09.120]   And I mean, we live in, you know,
[04:15:09.120 --> 04:15:11.400]   we make use of so many of those pockets.
[04:15:11.400 --> 04:15:16.400]   And the fact is, you know, I, you know, this is, yes,
[04:15:16.960 --> 04:15:20.360]   it's a, you know, it's one of these things where,
[04:15:20.360 --> 04:15:24.720]   where, you know, I'm a person who likes to figure out ideas
[04:15:24.720 --> 04:15:26.400]   and so on, and there's sort of tests
[04:15:26.400 --> 04:15:29.120]   of my level of imagination, so to speak.
[04:15:29.120 --> 04:15:32.080]   And so a couple of places where there's sort
[04:15:32.080 --> 04:15:35.440]   of serious humility in terms of my level of imagination.
[04:15:35.440 --> 04:15:38.160]   One is this thing about different reference frames
[04:15:38.160 --> 04:15:40.600]   for understanding the universe, where like,
[04:15:40.600 --> 04:15:43.600]   imagine the physics of the aliens, what will it be like?
[04:15:43.600 --> 04:15:45.720]   And I'm like, that's really hard.
[04:15:45.720 --> 04:15:47.440]   I don't know, you know?
[04:15:47.440 --> 04:15:48.280]   And I mean, I think-
[04:15:48.280 --> 04:15:49.920]   - But once you have the framework in place,
[04:15:49.920 --> 04:15:53.600]   you can at least reason about the things you don't know.
[04:15:53.600 --> 04:15:55.200]   - Yes. - Or maybe can't know,
[04:15:55.200 --> 04:15:57.560]   or like it's too hard for you to know.
[04:15:57.560 --> 04:16:01.560]   But then the mathematics can, that's exactly it.
[04:16:01.560 --> 04:16:05.400]   Allow you to reach beyond what you can reason about.
[04:16:05.400 --> 04:16:09.160]   - Right, so I'm, you know, I'm trying to not have,
[04:16:09.160 --> 04:16:11.640]   you know, if you think back to Alan Turing, for example,
[04:16:11.640 --> 04:16:13.880]   and, you know, when he invented Turing machines,
[04:16:13.880 --> 04:16:16.960]   you know, and imagining what computers would end up doing,
[04:16:16.960 --> 04:16:17.800]   so to speak.
[04:16:17.800 --> 04:16:18.640]   - Yeah.
[04:16:18.640 --> 04:16:19.960]   - You know, and it's- - It's very difficult.
[04:16:19.960 --> 04:16:21.000]   - It's difficult, right.
[04:16:21.000 --> 04:16:21.840]   And it's, I mean, this thing-
[04:16:21.840 --> 04:16:23.440]   - He made a few reasonable predictions,
[04:16:23.440 --> 04:16:25.480]   but most of it he couldn't predict, possibly.
[04:16:25.480 --> 04:16:28.280]   - By the time, by 1950, he was making reasonable predictions
[04:16:28.280 --> 04:16:29.120]   about something.
[04:16:29.120 --> 04:16:30.080]   - But not the '30s, yeah.
[04:16:30.080 --> 04:16:34.600]   - Right, not when he first, you know, conceptualized,
[04:16:34.600 --> 04:16:37.320]   you know, and he conceptualized universal computing
[04:16:37.320 --> 04:16:39.120]   for a very specific mathematical reason
[04:16:39.120 --> 04:16:41.280]   that wasn't as general.
[04:16:41.280 --> 04:16:44.160]   But yes, it's a good sort of exercise in humility
[04:16:44.160 --> 04:16:46.760]   to realize that it's kind of like,
[04:16:46.760 --> 04:16:49.520]   it's really hard to figure these things out.
[04:16:49.520 --> 04:16:52.200]   The engineering of the universe,
[04:16:52.200 --> 04:16:55.800]   if we know how the universe works, how can we engineer it?
[04:16:55.800 --> 04:16:57.520]   - That's such a beautiful vision.
[04:16:57.520 --> 04:16:58.360]   That's such a beautiful-
[04:16:58.360 --> 04:16:59.680]   - By the way, I have to mention one more thing,
[04:16:59.680 --> 04:17:04.200]   which is the ultimate question from physics is,
[04:17:04.200 --> 04:17:07.280]   okay, so we have this abstract model of the universe.
[04:17:07.280 --> 04:17:11.160]   Why does the universe exist at all, right?
[04:17:11.160 --> 04:17:15.120]   So, you know, we might say there is a formal model
[04:17:15.120 --> 04:17:18.000]   that if you run this model, you get the universe,
[04:17:18.000 --> 04:17:20.440]   or the model gives you, you know,
[04:17:20.440 --> 04:17:22.000]   a model of the universe, right?
[04:17:22.000 --> 04:17:25.160]   You run this mathematical thing,
[04:17:25.160 --> 04:17:27.720]   and the mathematics unfolds in the way
[04:17:27.720 --> 04:17:29.320]   that corresponds to the universe.
[04:17:29.320 --> 04:17:32.320]   But the question is, why was that actualized?
[04:17:32.320 --> 04:17:35.840]   Why does the actual universe actually exist?
[04:17:35.840 --> 04:17:39.080]   And so this is another one of these humility,
[04:17:39.080 --> 04:17:41.560]   and it's like, can you figure this out?
[04:17:41.560 --> 04:17:44.600]   I have a guess, okay, about the answer to that.
[04:17:44.600 --> 04:17:47.640]   And my guess is somewhat unsatisfying,
[04:17:47.640 --> 04:17:50.200]   but my guess is that it's a little bit similar
[04:17:50.200 --> 04:17:52.560]   to Godel's second incompleteness theorem,
[04:17:52.560 --> 04:17:55.000]   which is the statement that from within
[04:17:55.000 --> 04:17:57.880]   as an axiomatic theory like Peano arithmetic,
[04:17:57.880 --> 04:17:59.560]   you cannot from within that theory
[04:17:59.560 --> 04:18:02.240]   prove the consistency of the theory.
[04:18:02.240 --> 04:18:07.240]   So my guess is that for entities within the universe,
[04:18:07.920 --> 04:18:11.360]   there is no finite determination that can be made
[04:18:11.360 --> 04:18:15.080]   of the statement the universe exists
[04:18:15.080 --> 04:18:18.400]   is essentially undecidable to any entity
[04:18:18.400 --> 04:18:19.680]   that is embedded in the universe.
[04:18:19.680 --> 04:18:22.640]   - Within that universe, how does that make you feel?
[04:18:22.640 --> 04:18:27.640]   Does that put you at peace that it's impossible,
[04:18:27.640 --> 04:18:30.880]   or is it really ultimately frustrating?
[04:18:30.880 --> 04:18:34.080]   - Well, I think it just says that it's not a kind
[04:18:34.080 --> 04:18:38.720]   of question that, you know, there are things
[04:18:38.720 --> 04:18:40.120]   that it is reasonable.
[04:18:40.120 --> 04:18:42.760]   I mean, there's kinds of, you know,
[04:18:42.760 --> 04:18:44.560]   you can talk about hypercomputation as well.
[04:18:44.560 --> 04:18:46.480]   You can say, imagine there was a hypercomputer,
[04:18:46.480 --> 04:18:47.640]   here's what it would do.
[04:18:47.640 --> 04:18:49.920]   So, okay, great, it would be lovely to have a hypercomputer,
[04:18:49.920 --> 04:18:52.240]   but unfortunately we can't make it in the universe.
[04:18:52.240 --> 04:18:53.520]   Like, it would be lovely to answer this,
[04:18:53.520 --> 04:18:56.280]   but unfortunately we can't do it in the universe.
[04:18:56.280 --> 04:18:59.040]   And, you know, this is all we have, so to speak.
[04:18:59.040 --> 04:19:02.320]   And I think it's really just a statement.
[04:19:02.320 --> 04:19:06.160]   It's sort of, in the end, it'll be a kind of a logical,
[04:19:06.160 --> 04:19:08.320]   logically inevitable statement, I think.
[04:19:08.320 --> 04:19:10.640]   I think it will be something where it is,
[04:19:10.640 --> 04:19:14.960]   as you understand what it means to have a sort of predicate
[04:19:14.960 --> 04:19:17.440]   of existence and what it means to have these kinds
[04:19:17.440 --> 04:19:19.320]   of things, it will sort of be inevitable
[04:19:19.320 --> 04:19:20.400]   that this has to be the case,
[04:19:20.400 --> 04:19:21.680]   that from within that universe,
[04:19:21.680 --> 04:19:24.600]   you can't establish the reason for its existence,
[04:19:24.600 --> 04:19:25.440]   so to speak.
[04:19:25.440 --> 04:19:26.880]   You can't prove that it exists and so on.
[04:19:26.880 --> 04:19:29.880]   - And nevertheless, because of computational reducibility,
[04:19:29.880 --> 04:19:34.080]   the future is ultimately not predictable, full of mystery,
[04:19:34.080 --> 04:19:36.840]   and that's what makes life worth living.
[04:19:36.840 --> 04:19:37.680]   - Right, I mean, right.
[04:19:37.680 --> 04:19:39.280]   And, you know, it's funny for me,
[04:19:39.280 --> 04:19:43.040]   because as a pure sort of human being doing what I do,
[04:19:43.040 --> 04:19:45.320]   it's, you know, I'm, you know,
[04:19:45.320 --> 04:19:46.720]   I like, I'm interested in people.
[04:19:46.720 --> 04:19:49.880]   I like sort of, you know, the whole human experience,
[04:19:49.880 --> 04:19:50.960]   so to speak.
[04:19:50.960 --> 04:19:53.920]   And yet, it's a little bit weird when I'm thinking,
[04:19:53.920 --> 04:19:56.400]   you know, it's all hypergraphs down there,
[04:19:56.400 --> 04:19:57.720]   and it's all just--
[04:19:57.720 --> 04:19:59.560]   - Hypergraphs all the way down.
[04:19:59.560 --> 04:20:00.400]   - Right.
[04:20:00.400 --> 04:20:01.360]   - It's like turtles all the way down.
[04:20:01.360 --> 04:20:03.040]   - Yeah, yeah, right.
[04:20:03.040 --> 04:20:05.720]   And it's kind of, you know, it's, to me,
[04:20:05.720 --> 04:20:08.000]   it is a funny thing, because every so often I get this,
[04:20:08.000 --> 04:20:09.120]   you know, as I'm thinking about,
[04:20:09.120 --> 04:20:10.800]   I think we've really gotten, you know,
[04:20:10.800 --> 04:20:12.480]   we've really figured out kind of the essence
[04:20:12.480 --> 04:20:14.760]   of how physics works, and I'm like thinking to myself,
[04:20:14.760 --> 04:20:16.400]   you know, here's this physical thing,
[04:20:16.400 --> 04:20:17.760]   and I'm like, you know,
[04:20:17.760 --> 04:20:19.880]   this feels like a very definite thing.
[04:20:19.880 --> 04:20:21.480]   How can it be the case that this is just
[04:20:21.480 --> 04:20:24.000]   some ruleal reference frame of, you know,
[04:20:24.000 --> 04:20:28.440]   this infinite creature that is so abstract and so on?
[04:20:28.440 --> 04:20:32.960]   And I kind of, it is a, it's a funny sort of feeling
[04:20:32.960 --> 04:20:35.720]   that, you know, we are, we're sort of,
[04:20:35.720 --> 04:20:39.560]   it's like, in the end, it's just sort of--
[04:20:39.560 --> 04:20:40.400]   - We're just like a little speck.
[04:20:40.400 --> 04:20:42.200]   - Be happy we're just humans type thing.
[04:20:42.200 --> 04:20:44.960]   And it's kind of like, but we're making,
[04:20:44.960 --> 04:20:49.960]   we make things as, it's not like we're just a tiny speck.
[04:20:49.960 --> 04:20:54.480]   We are, in a sense, we are more important
[04:20:54.480 --> 04:20:58.280]   by virtue of the fact that, in a sense,
[04:20:58.280 --> 04:21:02.160]   it's not like there's, there is no ultimate,
[04:21:02.160 --> 04:21:05.000]   you know, it's like we're important because,
[04:21:05.000 --> 04:21:08.880]   because, you know, we're here, so to speak,
[04:21:08.880 --> 04:21:10.880]   and we're not, it's not like there's a thing
[04:21:10.880 --> 04:21:13.560]   where we're saying, you know,
[04:21:13.560 --> 04:21:16.720]   we are just but one sort of intelligence
[04:21:16.720 --> 04:21:18.360]   out of all these other intelligences,
[04:21:18.360 --> 04:21:20.560]   and so, you know, ultimately,
[04:21:20.560 --> 04:21:22.040]   there'll be the super intelligence,
[04:21:22.040 --> 04:21:23.960]   which is all of these put together,
[04:21:23.960 --> 04:21:25.240]   and it'll be very different from us.
[04:21:25.240 --> 04:21:27.520]   No, it's actually gonna be equivalent to us.
[04:21:27.520 --> 04:21:31.360]   And the thing that makes us sort of special
[04:21:31.360 --> 04:21:34.720]   is just the details of us, so to speak.
[04:21:34.720 --> 04:21:36.640]   It's not something where we can say,
[04:21:36.640 --> 04:21:38.960]   oh, there's this other thing, you know,
[04:21:38.960 --> 04:21:40.880]   just you think humans are cool,
[04:21:40.880 --> 04:21:43.240]   just wait until you've seen this.
[04:21:43.240 --> 04:21:45.080]   You know, it's gonna be much more impressive.
[04:21:45.080 --> 04:21:47.000]   Well, no, it's all going to be
[04:21:47.000 --> 04:21:48.880]   kind of computationally equivalent.
[04:21:48.880 --> 04:21:51.360]   And the thing that, you know, it's not gonna be,
[04:21:51.360 --> 04:21:53.960]   oh, this thing is amazingly much more impressive
[04:21:53.960 --> 04:21:56.840]   and amazingly much more meaningful, let's say.
[04:21:56.840 --> 04:21:58.960]   No, we're it.
[04:21:58.960 --> 04:22:01.480]   I mean, that's the--
[04:22:01.480 --> 04:22:04.400]   - And the symbolism of this particular moment,
[04:22:04.400 --> 04:22:09.000]   so this has been one of the favorite conversations
[04:22:09.000 --> 04:22:10.840]   I've ever had, Stephen.
[04:22:10.840 --> 04:22:12.720]   It's a huge honor to talk to you,
[04:22:12.720 --> 04:22:16.640]   to talk about a topic like this for four plus hours
[04:22:16.640 --> 04:22:18.600]   on the fundamental theory of physics,
[04:22:18.600 --> 04:22:22.880]   and yet we're just two finite descendants of apes
[04:22:22.880 --> 04:22:24.920]   that have to end this conversation
[04:22:24.920 --> 04:22:28.040]   because darkness have come upon us.
[04:22:28.040 --> 04:22:30.000]   - Right, and we're gonna get bitten by mosquitoes
[04:22:30.000 --> 04:22:30.840]   and all kinds of terrible things.
[04:22:30.840 --> 04:22:32.600]   - The symbolism of that,
[04:22:32.600 --> 04:22:36.320]   we're talking about the most basic fabric of reality
[04:22:36.320 --> 04:22:39.940]   and having to end because of the fact that things end.
[04:22:39.940 --> 04:22:42.520]   It's tragic and beautiful, Stephen.
[04:22:42.520 --> 04:22:44.360]   Thank you so much, huge honor.
[04:22:44.360 --> 04:22:47.080]   I can't wait to see what you do in the next couple of days
[04:22:47.080 --> 04:22:48.560]   and next week, a month.
[04:22:48.560 --> 04:22:50.640]   We're all watching with excitement.
[04:22:50.640 --> 04:22:51.520]   Thank you so much.
[04:22:51.520 --> 04:22:53.000]   - Thanks.

[04:23:19.040 --> 04:23:20.260]   from Richard Feynman.
[04:23:20.260 --> 04:23:23.540]   Physics isn't the most important thing.
[04:23:24.540 --> 04:23:25.460]   Love is.
