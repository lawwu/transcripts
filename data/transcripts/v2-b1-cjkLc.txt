[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:09.960]   All right, so we got a question here from Tom.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.160]   Tom says, what do you do when you get tired?
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.000]   He elaborates, he's extremely good at sticking
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   to time blocking, not going on social media,
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.400]   doing Pomodoro at the beginning of the week,
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.740]   but as the week goes on, I get a bit tired and burnt out,
[00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.640]   and it's easier and easier to lose focus.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.320]   I wonder if you can relate at all.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.200]   Of course not, Tom.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.320]   Tiredness is equivalent to cowardice.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.960]   You should be ashamed.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.360]   Don't do tiredness.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.160]   No, Tom, of course people get tired.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.120]   And there's two answers to this, right?
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.120]   I mean, one, if you're tired at a given day for whatever
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.040]   reason--
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.840]   sleep, sickness, et cetera--
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.440]   do less.
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.880]   Do less that day.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.600]   I mean, what are you doing during the day?
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.680]   You're taking energy, and you're converting it
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.040]   into output of value.
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.880]   And you're doing that mainly by putting this energy
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.520]   through the circuits in your brain
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.440]   to add value to information if you're a knowledge worker.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.020]   But you're converting energy to value.
[00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.840]   If you have less energy, there's less value you can produce.
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.680]   So I think that's fine.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.240]   The key, however, is to remain intentional about it.
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.640]   So the thing that you don't want to do is, as you get tired--
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.220]   if you're tired in a given day, or you
[00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.840]   get tired as the week goes on--
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.960]   you don't want to just become ad hoc and lax.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.040]   Like, eh, I'm sort of falling off my time block schedule
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.040]   and going down rabbit holes online.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.000]   And I sort of limp in for a finish on that day
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.040]   or limp in for a finish that week.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.600]   No, don't do that.
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.600]   If you see you're less energy, say,
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.800]   I'm going to work less today.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.280]   But I'm going to make a plan for this less work day.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.480]   I'm going to end it early.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.920]   I'm going to put a two-hour break in the middle.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.240]   I'm going to move things from this week to next week.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.960]   But I'm still going to stick to the plan.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.440]   I'm just going to make a plan that better fits my energy.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.720]   That is the key.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.680]   That is the key to energy and time management
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.840]   is intentionality, intentionality, intentionality.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.680]   If you are giving your time a job that
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.640]   is based off a realistic assessment of what's
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.960]   going on in your current context, you're winning.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.640]   If you are letting other factors in your mind and context
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.640]   just push you around like a leaf on a turbulent stream,
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.080]   you're in trouble.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.720]   The exhaustion is going to amplify.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.840]   You're going to feel bad.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.800]   You're not going to end up in a place that's good.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.080]   So it's always the best thing to do is to be intentional.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.880]   And the main point I want to make here, Tom,
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.200]   and I think it's a good one, and I'm glad you asked it.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.080]   I'm glad you asked it.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.600]   The main point I want to make is that some days you
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.800]   have more energy than others.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.400]   That means there's less work you can produce, and that's fine.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.480]   But what I want to see again is a plan
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.880]   that reflects a lower energy day.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.840]   Here is my lower energy day plan.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.920]   I finish at 2.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.400]   I take an hour lunch where I don't work.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.160]   I replace this hard thing with an easier thing.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.160]   Whatever you need to do.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.480]   So be intentional about it, Tom.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
